 Allow me to welcome you, Mr. Olner. It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair. I am delighted to introduce the debate, as this subject is of huge importance to thousands of people in this country&#151;predominantly women&#151;who carry out work on behalf of employers in their own homes either because they prefer to work at home, or, as in the majority of cases, because they have no option other than to work from home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08012265000011">Almost 100 years ago, on 22 July 1908, the House of Commons Select Committee on Home Work published a report under the chairmanship of Sir Thomas Whittaker. It may be useful&#151;it is certainly relevant to today&#146;s debate&#151;to quote some of the report&#146;s recommendations and conclusions. The first recommendation was that</p>
<a name="80122h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08012265000414"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there should be legislation with regard to the rates of payment made to Home Workers who are employed in the production or preparation of articles for sale by other persons.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08012265000012">The fourth recommendation&#151;I am sure that you will be grateful, Mr. Olner, for the fact that I shall not read the whole report, which is 286 pages long&#151;was that</p>
<a name="80122h0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08012265000415"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it should be an offence to pay or offer lower rates of payment to Home Workers in those trades than the minimum rates which had been fixed for that district by the Wages Board.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08012265000013">Recommendation 6 was that</p>
<a name="80122h0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08012265000416"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;all Home Workers who are employed by other persons in producing or preparing articles for sale should be required to register their name, address and class of work at, and receive a certificate of such registration from, the offices of the Local Authority, and that the keeping of accurate outworkers&#146; lists by employers should be strictly enforced.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08012265000014">Recommendation 7 was that</p>
<a name="80122h0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08012265000417"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it should be an offence for any person to employ any Home Worker to produce or prepare any articles for sale by another person unless the worker produce a certificate of registration.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08012265000015">I thought that quoting from the 1908 Select Committee would give a context for today&#146;s debate, 100 years later. The Committee spent a good deal of time and effort investigating the way in which workers were exploited by unscrupulous employers who used outworkers, working in their own homes, to lower wage costs and increase profits, usually at the expense of the home worker, who struggled to complete the piecework in the time allocated. For many home workers, little has changed in the past 100 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08012265000016">There remains, in 2008, a pressing need to bring home workers into line with other workers in our economy who, thanks to the Government, have seen their terms and conditions at work dramatically improve. Add to that the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, which was strongly opposed by the Opposition at the time, and it is clear that workers&#146; rights and wages for the majority  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Jan 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 360WH</b><br>
who go to work in a workplace each day have been greatly enhanced. However, there remains a large group of workers who were clearly exploited in 1908 and remain in the same position today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08012265000017">I wish not only to draw the Government&#146;s attention to the plight of home workers, but to call for a further change in the law. Why does it matter? Thousands of workers in the United Kingdom are vulnerable to exploitation from unscrupulous employers. That continues either because they do not have full employee status, or because it is unclear whether they have employee status. Although uncertain employee status is a problem for all kinds of workers in the UK, it is a particular issue for home, agency and temporary workers. Home workers who have worked for a company for several years&#151;often on low wages and taking on rushed orders at short notice at the company&#146;s convenience&#151;can discover, if they become pregnant or fall ill, or if their work simply stops, that they have no protection under the law, because they are not classed as employees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08012265000018">There are three main types of employment status under current law: employees, workers and the self-employed. Qualifying hurdles and exclusions may apply, but in broad terms, employees are entitled to the full range of employment rights and protection in respect of unfair dismissal, redundancy, sick leave and pay, maternity leave and pay and the right to written terms and conditions. Workers, on the other hand, are entitled to a smaller range of basic protections, the most significant for home workers being the national minimum wage and holiday pay. The self-employed are free to negotiate their own terms with the people with whom they contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08012265000019">Many home workers do not receive full employment rights. If challenged, their employers can argue that they are workers and not technically employees. The only way in which that can be resolved is at an employment tribunal, which can be extremely stressful and highly unpredictable. Alternatively, home workers may be told by their employers that they are self-employed even when they do not have the independence or control over their work patterns that would enable them genuinely to negotiate terms. False self-employment is just another way for unscrupulous employers to avoid their obligations to employees.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="08012265000020"><a name="80122h0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="08012265000490"><b>David Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 In another life, as an accountant, I dealt with outworkers and self-employed people on some scale. Does my hon. Friend agree that the difficulties in defining the characteristics of self-employment that he describes need to be revisited by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and other Departments? Individual employees who are being coerced into self-employment feel very vulnerable and are unlikely to pursue their employers with any vigour. There is a pressing need for some kind of class action on behalf of a group of employees to get them designated as employees, so that they benefit from the protection that he describes.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="08012265000021"><a name="80122h0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="08012265000491"><b>Mr. Hamilton:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. As I shall describe, many of the more unscrupulous employers frequently force their workers to take on self-employed status, but their situation is clearly nothing like being self-employed. I have been self-employed and know that the self-employed have a lot of control over their lives. They may not have the  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Jan 2008">

benefits of being employees, nor a lot of employment protection, but they have much more control over what they do, when they do it and how much they charge for their labour. The big difference for those who are really home workers but are designated as self-employed is that they have absolutely no control over what they charge, when they do their work, how quickly it must be done, or how or whether they advertise. I therefore think my hon. Friend&#146;s proposal is very helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08012265000022">If unscrupulous employers try to avoid their obligations to employees, they can be challenged only at tribunal. That uncertainty can make it difficult for home workers to assert even their most basic rights to the national minimum wage and holiday pay. Workers can be deterred from demanding those rights through the very real fear that they may lose their work as a consequence. Without employment contracts, they have little protection against that sort of victimisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08012265000023">In 2002, the Government conducted a consultation exercise, asking whether</p>
<a name="80122h0001.htm_brev4"><a name="08012265000418"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there are any categories of working people currently excluded from statutory employment rights who require the protection provided by some or all rights and how they would benefit.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08012265000024">Amongst many others, the National Group on Homeworking responded. It argued for the extension of all existing employment rights to all workers, particularly home workers who are not genuinely self-employed. Unfortunately, although the consultation raised hopes that the Government were intending to take action, their response, which was delivered only on 30 March 2006, was extremely disappointing. In the &#147;Success at Work&#148; strategy paper, the Government rejected calls for a change in the law. Furthermore, that 58-page document, which was intended to protect so-called vulnerable workers, made no specific mention of home workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08012265000025">The current situation is hugely complex and confusing, and the unpredictability of tribunal rulings on status benefits no one. Home workers have to negotiate their way through a maze of legal arguments, tests and obstructions, simply for a chance to gain the rights to which other employees are automatically entitled. The Government need to take swift and decisive action to grant full employment status and rights to all UK home workers who are working for another person and not genuinely in business on their own account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08012265000026">On 21 November last year, together with my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer), I hosted in the House of Commons the launch of a report entitled, &#147;Subject to Status&#148;. It was written and researched by Nesta Holden and was published by the National Group on Homeworking, which is based in Leeds. It is the only national body that supports and helps home workers. Accompanying staff from the organisation and the author of the report were several home workers who came to Parliament to tell their stories in their own words to Members of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08012265000027">One home worker&#146;s story concerning her status amply illustrates the issues, which the report so ably highlights. Pamela James took her employer to a tribunal to establish that she is not self-employed nor does she have the rights and benefits of an employed worker&#151;she falls between the two. But let her speak in her own words:</p>

As a packing company, home workers are key to its business, and it uses proper systems for calculating piece rates.

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="80122h0001.htm_para29"><a name="08012265000043">As we have said, home workers are vulnerable in a number of ways. They may need to work from home because of their caring responsibilities&#151;often child care&#151;or their language, disability or long-term health problems. They are isolated. Very few home workers join trade unions, and trade unions rarely recruit them. By the very nature of their job and the way that they work, home workers do not enjoy the company of fellow workers. Work is irregular and they live in fear of losing their jobs. When there is a problem, home workers are frightened to complain because the employer will probably just take the work elsewhere. Home workers also have an uncertain employment status, and addressing that issue would tackle one of the core problems of vulnerability.</p>

Minister is working hard to achieve and that the Shipley office of the national minimum wage team of HMRC has been set up to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para1"><a name="08012265000046">Since 1997, the Government have introduced and extended a number of rights to protect people at work, including employee rights, such as the right to request flexible working; maternity and paternity leave; and most recently, making age discrimination illegal. Other rights that also apply to workers include the national minimum wage, working time regulations, including those on holiday pay, and the part-time workers directive. Some of those rights, most notably the national minimum wage, have been introduced in the face of intense opposition from business and dramatic warnings of a devastating impact on employment. In practice, those warnings have been exposed as scaremongering. The Government&#146;s economic record demonstrates that protections for workers do not have to come at the expense of jobs. Although the rights that workers and employees can benefit from may have increased under this Government, a growing grey area of atypical workers now find themselves with few protections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para2"><a name="08012265000047">Home workers miss out on employment rights, because they lack employee status or because their status is unclear. Home workers who have worked for a company for several years, often on low wages, find that they have no protection under the law, because they are not employees. Many of them are deemed by their employers to be self-employed, leaving them ineligible even for the minimum wage. The law is unclear: short of taking the employer to a tribunal, it is virtually impossible for home workers to be certain of their rights under the law. As the case of Pamela James shows, going to a tribunal can be extremely traumatic, as well as very expensive. It is deeply unjust that the home workers, who are among some of the lowest paid workers in the country, are also those with the fewest rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para3"><a name="08012265000048">In a recent strategy paper, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, formerly the Department of Trade and Industry, rejected calls to extend employment rights to any group of workers who are not currently covered. It stated that</p>
<a name="80122h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="08012265000437"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;changes to the legal framework would not prevent instances of abuse or lack of awareness. It could however damage labour market flexibility and result in a reduction in overall employment... The government believes that it meets the labour market&#146;s current needs and there is no need for further legislation in this area.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para4"><a name="08012265000049">The Department&#146;s argument against extending rights seems precisely the same as that used by the employers who opposed the national minimum wage. It is an argument that the Government have discredited through the success of their own national minimum wage policy. It is an anomaly that, while introducing much valued rights for employees, the Government are turning a blind eye to the exploitation of thousands of workers. The welcome extension of employment rights and protections under this Government needs to be accompanied by an extension of those rights to all home workers who are not in business on their own account.</p>

Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden), who asked me to co-sponsor his private Member&#146;s Bill, the Outworking Bill, and who introduced me to the issues and problems facing home workers.

 I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words. Going back to the Outworking Bill, he will remember that it focused very much on home working scams and proposed a prohibition on companies demanding money upfront from home workers before they supplied them with the goods that they would make, pass on, produce and so on. Does he agree that there is still a need for such a simple measure, as well as the employment rights, to tackle some of the injustices that home workers face?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that. There is no doubt that the work that he did on the Outworking Bill drew national attention to those so-called scams. It is a disgrace that that kind of fraudulent activity, which is effectively what it is, should deprive some of the most vulnerable and poorest workers in the country of what little savings and money they have, to enrich people in a criminal way. Very simple legislation to outlaw that kind of upfront payment and the other so-called scams to which my hon. Friend drew attention in 2001 is still lacking and could be easily put in place.</p>

He dug up reports that were compiled some 100 years ago. I am reminded again of how much unfinished business there is in the House that we have to return to again and again.

also warned that if we do not understand the relationship between trade and international solidarity, all our efforts will be doomed&#151;and that was before the new world of economic globalisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08012265000056">Eighteen years ago, I raised the issue in the House of home workers in my own constituency, in Bramley. Those home workers were mainly women who worked wrapping Christmas cards in cellophane and threading the little strings on to gift cards. How did it work? A company in Bradford employed an agent on the estate, who took the packages around in a van, dropped them off in the house and told the women to have them finished by Friday. The women worked and worked to finish them, but more work was always piled on them than they could actually complete. Wage rates at the time worked out at less than 50p an hour&#151;well below the average in the low-paid market. Then, as usual, the van failed to turn up on Friday with the money to pay the women and their families who had helped to meet the deadline, so the boxes were left stacked in their hallways and front rooms for ages as we tried to sort out the problem. It was a mess. Eventually, we managed, through the supply chain, to track down the employer and we had a real go at them, saying that they had to act responsibly towards those people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08012265000057">It must be remembered that that was the age when people thought that home working was a good thing. We should distinguish between types of home worker. People who worked in an office might be told, &#147;Please go home and work from your computer there&#151;that will be much more relaxed.&#148; That was 10 years ago. Today, we read reports of people wanting to get back into the office and do hot desking because working at home is so stressful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08012265000058">There are not only office workers. I like the expression that some of my hon. Friends have used: outreach workers. That refers to people who have work pushed out on to them, who are in a different position from those in the middle income brackets who are working at home on computers, because if they complain, they lose the work altogether and lose the vital income that is propping up their family budget. I was told, &#147;Please, John, don&#146;t take the issue up with the company, because it might just cut off the supply line.&#148; It is true that the company in Bradford employed some of the people, but others lost their jobs altogether.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08012265000059">One million people in Britain are still doing home working. Some are packing Christmas cards and tags; some are knitting and sewing; some are doing inspections of industrial seals; and others are making souvenirs for sports shops. When I learned of that last one, I was tempted to wonder whether, in the supply chain of life, when we buy our products, we think about who in the chain is paying the highest price for those goods. Home workers are still right at the bottom of the pile.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para12"><a name="08012265000060">I would like to add another dimension. In the search and struggle for what we now gloriously call joined-up government, which I believe is incredibly difficult, we must bridge across Departments. The global is now local, and the local is global. We are in an interdependent world writ large, particularly economically. In the past five years, people have thought that home working has gone offshore: it is done in China, India and the Philippines, where the footballs, football shirts and so on are made; it is not a British issue. Well, it is. Of course it is a two-thirds world issue, in the poor countries of the  <br>

world, as a result of globalisation, but I say to the Minister that we need to tackle poverty worldwide as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08012265000061">I serve on the Select Committee on International Development, which is a great privilege. We all know of the millennium development goals. Which one is missing? We can work on health care, HIV/AIDS and education, but the issue that is missing is employment and wages. There is no MDG to ensure fuller employment or decent wages. That is a big lacuna in the international system. In Oxfam&#146;s 2004 report on home working entitled &#147;Trading away our rights&#148;, for which it surveyed 12 countries, it demonstrated that if the poor are paying the highest price in one country and a campaign is started to do something about that, the company is shut down and people are out of work and the practice moves across the world to another country. We cannot do that; we have to join things up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para14"><a name="08012265000062">In this country, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East said, a million workers are without proper remuneration or employment rights, which has something to do with the fudge of the definitions of an employee, a worker and the self-employed. He spelled that out eloquently, so I need not repeat it. Our employment law provides different levels of protection for those different categories. Those who are classified as employees have a range of employment rights, which we have been strengthening: protection against unfair dismissal, sick pay, some maternity rights and the right to redundancy pay. We are even encouraging people to take up resources to get child care so they have some space to work. However, all those rights fall away from a person who is not an employee and works from home. They fall down the gap between the different categories. We have never properly resolved that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para15"><a name="08012265000063">The present Government introduced the national minimum wage. That was not my personal responsibility, although I was in the Department of Trade and Industry when it was introduced. At that time, we were saying, &#147;Well, we can&#146;t introduce it for home workers. That would be too complicated.&#148; Why? Because we had not sorted out their employment status. We cannot give them the wage if we have not clarified their status. That is unfinished business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para16"><a name="08012265000064">One part of the problem is that many different Government agencies deal with the issue. There are agencies that deal with legal definitions of employment&#151;that involves the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. There are rights that relate to health and safety at work that are not covered there. Even rights relating to child care come through a different Department. I simply suggest that, even with all our best intentions for the legislation in this place, home workers are falling between the frameworks of different Departments. I am making a plea to my hon. Friend the Minister: the sub-committee that draws together different Ministers in different Departments should take this small issue seriously, put together a working party on it and crack it. It should drive through a means of joining up the agendas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para17"><a name="08012265000065">I would like international and national law to be brought together with good practice. There is a home workers code. That has something to do with the whole business of checking sourcing. If we could regularise legislation and sort out where home workers fit in the piece so that they have protection, that would be a start.</p>

At the ground floor level, people are joining together the agendas: the TUC for workers&#146; rights, Oxfam, which works internationally as well in Britain, and the NGH. That group could be a means of demonstrating how such joining up can be done. The general secretary of the TUC, Brendan Barber, said at the time:</p>

Many are not &#145;employees&#146; and so lack even the most basic employment rights including protection against unfair dismissal and maternity leave. Legally all homeworkers should be getting the minimum wage and holiday pay, but the reality is that many employers prey upon and exploit their vulnerable position for their own ends.</p>
</ul><a name="80122h0002.htm_brev3"><a name="08012265000439"><ul><p class="tabletext">The situation is made worse because the law covering homeworkers is unclear.

It is in the light of the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) about the company referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East. We need to do much more as a society&#151;by which I mean civil society, campaigning organisations, Members of Parliament and Departments&#151;in tracking where company profits come from. We are not doing enough to track the sourcing. Who pays the highest price? I have been quite shocked. In the International Development Committee we have been considering the ethical trading initiative, but if people go through the reports, they will find that the companies in Britain that are signed up to the ETI are the very companies that, through the chain of supply, are employing home workers and hoping that no one notices. We need to track them and say, &#147;You can&#146;t sign up to ethical trading initiatives and claim the moral high ground when at the same time, four layers down, you are exploiting workers in the most atrocious way because you are exploiting gaps in the law.&#148; Tracking supply chains is a job that still needs to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para21"><a name="08012265000069">We need to regularise and fuse together at national level legal protections such as the minimum wage, employment law and those relating to health and safety and child care.

relates to energy costs, borrowing money from loan sharks, or indeed doing the work at basic level. We owe them the responsibility of saying that they should not pay the highest personal and family price. We should take legislative and practical action as a society, locally, nationally and internationally, to ensure that they get the same employment rights and protection as everyone else. That is part of the campaign to make poverty history and the campaign for fairer trade; but it is also part of the campaign for treating human beings decently.

 I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Olner, for this extremely important debate and I congratulate the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton) on introducing this subject for discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para23"><a name="08012265000072">It is interesting to look at the wider perspective on home working. There is a spectrum, from home working that has the potential to be liberating, through to home working that is enslaving&#151;we have heard descriptions of the sorry state of some home workers. There are a great number of people involved in home working. The Economic and Social Research Institute says that 8.4 per cent. of people regularly work from home; the Department of Trade and Industry says that 3.1 million people work at home; and the National Group on Homeworking talks about 1 million people who are home workers. The discrepancy in the figures is because the National Group on Homeworking focuses on women, and on the least powerful and the most exploited people. Their situation was eloquently described by both the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East and the right hon. Member for Leeds, West (John Battle).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para24"><a name="08012265000073">On the happier end of the spectrum&#151;the flexible working end&#151;I introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill last year to extend the age of the children for whom an employee can request flexible working to 18. I am delighted that the Government will introduce such a measure&#151;I see it as greatly enlightening. At some stage, I should like everyone to have the opportunity to request flexible working. However, it is important that such a right is protected. For the vast majority of workers, greater working flexibility would greatly increase equality in our society. I would love to see the end of the culture of presentism, whereby when a child is born, one parent must make the economic sacrifice. It is usually the woman, which contributes to the economic inequality of the work unit and to women&#146;s lack of ability to catch up when they return to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para25"><a name="08012265000074">More flexible working would bring benefits to the environment. Savings in carbon emissions would come because people would no longer travel to work. People would have more time, so there would be an improvement in work-life balance. A growing number of mothers are turning to self-employment&#151;true female entrepreneurship &#151;because it fits in to their work-life balance. It has become a lifestyle choice. If as many women as men turned to an entrepreneurial lifestyle, 500,000 additional companies would be set up in this country. That would make a difference to our balance of payments and prosperity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="80122h0002.htm_para26"><a name="08012265000075">That is the good side of home working, which definitely has benefits: for the employer, it can mean a motivated work force, and reduced staff turnover, sick days and  <br>

infrastructure costs. There is a social responsibility aspect: carers and people with disabilities have much more flexibility for their work. Although it can be liberating, it can also be enslaving&#151;at least it can be where irresponsible companies are concerned.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for expanding the debate. She is absolutely right on work for women: they could have what I believe is called a better work-life balance, and there would perhaps be a better gender balance. However, I am thinking particularly about people who are not self-employed, even those who are more mobile in the labour market, if I may put it that way, who have decent jobs and qualifications and who work in offices but who sometimes go home to work. In a sense, it is about the attitude of employers to home workers. They do not see home working as a way of helping people to be liberated; rather, they are looking at how to reduce their costs. There are now rows about who pays for the lighting and the electricity, and people are pleading to go back into a workplace because on-costs are being pushed on to them. More than a million people who are at the behest of an employer rather than self-employed are picking up hidden costs for the employer. That is the real exploitation. Such people are paying a high price. Not only do they not receive a wage, but by paying their lighting bill and other on-costs they are subsidising their employer.</p>

 I am grateful for that point&#151;it gives another perspective on the matter. However, I have recently been through the trauma of completing my tax return. I have been advised that a proportion&#151;one eighth for a Member of Parliament&#151;of one&#146;s lighting and heating costs can be claimed against one&#146;s final tax Bill, so the Government try to make allowances for employees who work at home&#151;<i>[</i><i>Laughter.</i><i>]</i> It was news to me too, but I am assured that that is the case&#151;a House of Commons approved company told me.

If, on the other hand, the worker can decide whether or not to accept work and how to carry it out, makes his or her own arrangements for holidays or sickness absences, pays his or her own tax and national insurance contributions and is free to do the same type of work for more than one employer at the same time, this points towards the person being self-employed.&#148;</p>

do that if they have only one major source of work? We have heard this morning how home workers are afraid to turn work down, because they are worried that if they do so, they will not be offered more work. They are isolated and powerless.</p>

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="08012265000081"><a name="80122h0003.htm_spnew0"><a name="08012265000500"><b>Mr. Hamilton:</b>
 Does the hon. Lady agree that in addition to that clear description she gave&#151;it was helpful extremely helpful&#151;sometimes, the home worker is expected to provide their own machinery, especially in the sewing industry? I cannot think of a better description of that than the one in Monica Ali&#146;s book &#147;Brick Lane&#148;. The machinery is supplied, serviced and looked after by the home worker. The home work can only be done with the right equipment, but the employer pays nothing towards its costs. Does she agree that that is another abuse of home workers?</p>

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="08012265000082"><a name="80122h0003.htm_spnew1"><a name="08012265000501"><b>Lorely Burt:</b>
 I totally agree that it is an abuse in such circumstances. There might be another perspective; I want to understand it from the other side. For instance, someone may want to start up in business for themselves, buying their own equipment to produce clothing&#151;perhaps bespoke clothing. It is not simply that the person has to buy their own equipment, it is the relationship between that individual and the employer&#151;the power balance between the two&#151;that is so out of kilter in the examples that the hon. Gentleman cited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para2"><a name="08012265000083">The problems of home workers have been described; they include long hours, a lot of stress, repetitive strain injury, and the fear of complaining about the volume of work and pay rates. The National Group on Homeworking estimates that 48 per cent. of home workers are denied basic employment rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08012265000084">Wages are an important subject. The fair estimate agreements for output work were replaced in October 2004 by the four-fifths rule for rated output work. If employers do not pay an hourly rate, they have to pay 120 per cent. of the average work rate times the national minimum wage. For those employers who adhere to the Government&#146;s guidelines, that represents good progress. However, the thread constantly running through this is the fact that unscrupulous employers do not adhere to those guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para4"><a name="08012265000085">The Government have legislated to protect home workers, but should they go further? In our desire to protect one class of worker, we must not threaten another. People such as professional contractors, who work as outside consultants but often from home, have a completely different status, which must also be protected within the law. It is important that we do not throw the baby out with the proverbial bathwater; people who are genuinely self-employed should not be incorporated in the definition of employee, as they would lose their exclusive status and their earning ability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para5"><a name="08012265000086">I am open to suggestions on additional legislation, but I believe that it is not so much the legislation itself that is important as the enforcement of existing law. The chance of a company&#146;s being inspected on its payment of the minimum wage is low; on average it happens only once in over 200 years. Enforcement is paramount here. Will the Minister say whether the Government have plans to strengthen the hand of the enforcement agencies, which can do only what they have the resources for? There is nothing better that the  <br>

It occurs to me that we could encourage companies, and especially large companies&#151;the company I am thinking of must be large, as it has made more than &#163;1 billion&#151;to include how they pay their workers and how they look after them in their corporate social responsibility reporting. We are developing such a culture in all sorts of areas. I have been talking to the Minister about supply side diversity, and companies can be encouraged to take that step.</p>

 The hon. Lady has been most generous in giving way. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East, who is an accountant, could clarify the rules of company accounting, but it would help if companies, including major household names, were not allowed to use corporate accounting methods to be what I would call absentee landlords, not being forced to reveal their suppliers further down the chain. If that was put into company and accounting law, it would make things much more transparent.</p>

exactly 100 years ago. It is true that there is much unfinished business. The more we think that we are continuing to improve the way in which our society works&#151;that we are becoming more equal, more fair, more reasonable, and reaching a better work-life balance&#151;the more we uncover the fact that much is yet to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para10"><a name="08012265000095">It is somewhat ironic that the Prime Minister should now be in India and that he was previously in China&#151;the more time he spends in India and China, the happier some of us will be. However, I commend him for undertaking the tour because our economy will depend enormously on the emerging economies of China and India in future. Although press commentators and many of those engaged in the political process are quick to recognise the importance of improving employment rights and human rights in China and India, low-paid workers in Britain are doing work in competition with work being outsourced&#151;particularly to India and the subcontinent&#151;and it is those back home in the United Kingdom who still need to be looked after. I do not blame the Prime Minister; I commend him for what he is doing on the international stage, but will the Government please recognise that there is still work to be done here at home?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08012265000096">While we are adopting the historical perspective, it is interesting that the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East said that, once upon a time, the Conservative party was opposed to the national minimum wage. That, too, is history. We are not opposed to the national minimum wage.

In all truth, not only was I interested in the issues that arose from that meeting but I was genuinely shocked to discover the employment conditions under which large numbers of people work in Britain today. They are not the type of bad employment conditions that existed 100 years ago, or indeed those found in India and China at present&#151;I am not being insulting to those countries, but we must recognise the reality and truth of the situation there. However, although the current employment conditions of large numbers of home workers are not as bad as low-paid workers once had to endure, they are still bad enough to require our attention and the Government&#146;s attention as soon as possible.</p>

It is quite unacceptable that a tribunal decision should take more than eight months to come out. That is simply unfair and I hope that somebody somewhere will take note of that fact this morning and deal with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para14"><a name="08012265000101">In general, however, we must recognise that people do not usually work from home, or want to work part-time or need flexibility in their working environment  <br>

because they choose to; nor is it because, as some employers and some other people would have us believe, they are housewives earning a bit of pin money. That view is an insult&#151;an absolute insult. The reason why people work from home, or need flexibility in employment or to work part-time, is that they have other family duties, whether it be looking after children or looking after elderly or sick relatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para15"><a name="08012265000102">Furthermore, we as a society not only recognise that that situation exists; we encourage it. We need people to do two jobs, especially women&#151;let us not forget that more than 80 per cent. of home workers are women&#151;but also men in some circumstances. We need them to bring up families and look after the elderly and sick but we also need them to be economically active, because we need their input in the economy. Our economy would not work without people doing those part-time jobs. Such work is not a luxury or an add-on, nor is it about pin money; it is absolutely essential. Given that we expect people, especially women, to organise their lives so that they can work, be economically active and pay taxes, and look after their children and elderly relatives at the same time, we ought to recognise their work and give them the respect they deserve for doing lots of different jobs at once.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para16"><a name="08012265000103">Bringing up children is not an add-on luxury; it is an absolute necessity. Looking after the elderly is not an add-on luxury; it is the most difficult job there is. Where people are also trying to earn money at the same time, they ought to be given respect and support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para17"><a name="08012265000104">Flexibility is absolutely vital. I see from <i>Hansard </i>that I had an interesting exchange with the then Minister for Women, now the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly), in the House of Commons on 8 June 2006, when I was shadow Minister for Women. We agreed with one another about the importance of encouraging flexibility. I was arguing that the right to request flexibility should be extended, a point to which the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) alluded a few moments ago in her excellent speech. At present, the right to request flexible working is extended only to some people in the working population; like the hon. Member for Solihull, I argue that it should be extended far more widely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08012265000105">I say that because children do not stop being an enormous responsibility when they reach the age of six or seven; actually, they become more difficult then. Sometimes, people do not understand that. A baby can be put in a corner to sleep, but that is not possible with an eight-year-old child. Children of eight, nine or 10 and especially teenagers need their parents even more than small children do.</p>

 I absolutely agree with the hon. Lady about the importance of flexibility in the household, in domestic circumstances and support work; we must move in that direction. However, ambivalence exists because employers interpret the word &#147;flexibility&#148; very differently and can see it as a means of avoiding health and safety regulations and employment law. Until they start to understand flexibility more positively and not as a negative way of just squeezing out more profit, we will have a problem with the concept.</p>

will be well aware that when one studies the effects of flexible working one finds that many of the best, most profitable and most employee-friendly companies in Britain have introduced flexible working or have experimented with it, and the vast majority of them have evidence that not only has flexibility improved the morale of their work force but, as a result, their profitability and the general well-being of the company, in economic as well as social terms, has improved, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para20"><a name="08012265000109">The important issue is that many men in the political world have come to respect the position of women who are looking after children.

It is the fact that most part-time workers and home workers are women that causes that enormous gender pay gap.</p>

I do not have the resources to do so, but somebody somewhere has, and that would let us see how difficult the position of home workers is.</p>

 I begin by paying tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton) for introducing the debate. He spoke with great expertise and passion, particularly about the individual examples that he raised, some of which are summarised in the NGH report &#147;Subject to Status&#148;, to which he referred. He raised several issues relating to piece rates, the minimum wage and employment status, and I shall deal with those in more detail later.</p>

I hope I will not embarrass him when I say that I have regarded him as something of an inspiration for many years because of the depth of his passion on issues relating to poverty, because of his belief in empowering people and because of the international reach of his thinking on these important issues, as we have seen today.

Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East began&#151;100 years ago, which is when the report with which my hon. Friend began his speech was published. In a sense, 100 years ago is a good place to start because we are currently experiencing a great wave of globalisation. However, it is not the first, and there was another great wave of globalisation in the years before the first world war; indeed, the 1908 report would have been written in the middle of that phenomenon. The hon. Member for Epping Forest is therefore right to draw attention to the Prime Minister&#146;s visits to India and China and the powerful international economic changes that we have seen. I appreciate that you will not want me to veer too far from the subject, Mr. Olner, but history shows that the first wave of globalisation did not continue and was brought to an end by world war and then cold war. It is only since the end of the cold war that we have experienced a second great wave of globalisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="80122h0003.htm_para27"><a name="08012265000117">My right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West raised some important questions about employment rights in an era of globalisation, which is a difficult issue, particularly for those of us in the richer west. It is sometimes argued that globalisation exploits people in newly developing countries and that we would not tolerate their working conditions and wages. Looked at from our end of the telescope, that might be true, but it might also be true that such conditions and wages are better than those offered by local employers. Indeed, if we look at the impact of globalisation, particularly in the two countries mentioned by the hon. Member for Epping Forest, we see that the number of people living on less than $1 a day has declined rapidly in recent years.</p>

I agree that it is an important subject, which raises important issues about the Government&#146;s role in  <br>

securing a flexible labour market that offers people decent rights&#151;one that both contributes to the success of our economy and is good for people to work in. That is what we are trying to achieve, and I would not want people to think that home workers have not been part of our agenda or of the work that we have done in the little over a decade that we have been in power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="80122h0004.htm_para1"><a name="08012265000119">My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East referred to the national minimum wage, which is important, because it was designed to put a basic floor under the labour market, beneath which no one should fall. My hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West also mentioned the distinction between workers and employees, and we will come back to that. However, section 35 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 ensures that those who fall outside the usual definition of a worker&#151;for example, because they may not be obliged to do all their work personally&#151;are still covered by the Act, and it is important that the legislation tried to reach out beyond employees to cover workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="80122h0004.htm_para2"><a name="08012265000120">That was the first thing that was done to ensure that legislation reached home workers and those outside the normal definition of an employee. The second thing was to amend piece rates, to which the hon. Member for Solihull referred, and that was done through the fair piece rates legislation introduced in 2005, which addressed the fact that the bar was set at such a level that it seemed to justify payment beneath the national minimum wage. The way piece rates were calculated was changed to address that problem, and the fair piece rate was amended to ensure that people working at an average rate would get the national minimum wage. Those were important gains for home workers, and I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East acknowledged them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="80122h0004.htm_para3"><a name="08012265000121">The Government also supply guidance on fair piece rates by means of the national minimum wage helpline, which anyone who is in doubt about their rights under the legislation can phone in confidence. My hon. Friend also referred to the fact that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs has a specific enforcement team dedicated to enforcing the minimum wage in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="80122h0004.htm_para4"><a name="08012265000122">My hon. Friend rightly said that there is a difference between passing a law and enforcing it. Although passing a law may be the first necessary and important step, we must all be aware of the fact that the law must be properly enforced. I therefore want directly to address the question raised by the hon. Member for Solihull about action on enforcement, because we have been very active on the issue recently. In fact, only last week, I was with the national minimum wage bus, which is sponsored by my Department. It is visiting 30 towns and cities, distributing information to people in town centres and shopping centres. On Friday we were outside St. Andrews football ground in Birmingham. I also visited the bus in Newham, and it is going on to other areas. It is part of an effort to make sure of two things: first, that people are aware of national minimum wage rates. The bus&#146;s route number is 552, and if one thinks about it that is the right name for it. People can go on the bus and find out directly whether they are being paid the minimum wage, as well as finding out about youth rates. They can also phone the helpline to report in confidence if they are not being paid the correct rate.</p>

young people and I have written articles for newspapers&#151;particularly those more likely to be read by migrant workers, who are often exploited and not paid the minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="80122h0004.htm_para6"><a name="08012265000123">Awareness is important to our work, and so are resources. The hon. Member for Solihull was quite right when she asked about resources. The Prime Minister, in his final Budget as Chancellor, announced a significant increase in resources for enforcement of the national minimum wage&#151;an extra &#163;3 million or so per year over the next few years. That will allow Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, which does the work of enforcement, to hire more staff to ensure that that important legislation is properly enforced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="80122h0004.htm_para7"><a name="08012265000124">As well as awareness and enforcement, there is a third arm to the relevant work, and that is changing the law, which we are doing in two respects. The Employment Bill received its Second Reading in the other place recently, and will eventually find its way to the House for discussion. It will change the law in two important ways: first, by increasing the arrears of minimum wage payable to anyone who has been underpaid, to give people a better deal on arrears and, secondly, by increasing the penalties for employers who pay less than the minimum wage. My right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West talked about employers and unscrupulous practice. We want to change the law so that employers who underpay the minimum wage will receive stiffer penalties than they do now. I do not think that legitimate business has a problem in that regard. In fact, at the TUC a few months ago, the director general of the CBI said that employers who behave in such a way &#147;should get clobbered.&#148; He rightly sees that illegal exploitation of workers through not paying the minimum wage undercuts legitimate businesses, the vast majority of which want to treat their workers decently and fairly. On those fronts&#151;awareness, enforcement through resources, and changes to the law&#151;it is important to make the Act we passed seven or eight years ago even better suited to today&#146;s circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="80122h0004.htm_para8"><a name="08012265000125">My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East also raised the issue of employment status and the employment status review. It was an exhaustive review, which took about four years. The ship of state did not move particularly quickly in that respect, and did not come out with overnight, knee-jerk conclusions. I think that my hon. Friend said that the work lasted from 2002 until 2006. I know that he does not agree with the conclusions he read out, but on the basic distinction between employees, workers and the self-employed, the Government decided not to change the legal framework. I have referred already to new law affecting the minimum wage, which is on the way and will also cover other issues, such as those concerned with employment agencies. It will be debated fully in the House. However, I must be candid with my hon. Friend and tell him that I shall not today announce a shift away from the conclusion reached  <br>

by the Government in the employment status review, which, as I have said, took four years and concluded just two years ago. Nevertheless I should not want right hon. and hon. Members to conclude that workers are without rights and protections. That is not the case. Workers are entitled to the minimum wage and paid leave and they have redress for the enforcement of those rights. We do not want a labour market in which some people enjoy the kind of progress that my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West spoke about, while others are abandoned.</p>

 If I remember rightly, the relevant response did not mention the expression &#147;home workers&#148; and I think that part of the point of the debate that my hon. Friend has initiated this morning is whether, when the Government consider the issue, home workers can be positively and explicitly included.</p>

<p><a name="st_24"><a name="08012265000127"><a name="80122h0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="08012265000512"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 The review was concluded two years ago and there is no plan to start that piece of work again, now that it has been decided that there should not be a basic change in the legal status of the self-employed, workers and employees. That is not to say that suggestions that the National Group on Homeworking and hon. Members who support the campaigns may make with regard to home workers will be swept aside and not listened to. I do not mean that at all. Home workers deserve the protection of the law. They have it with respect to the national minimum wage and rights under working-time protections, as well as, for example, rights under discrimination legislation and entitlement to statutory maternity pay. They are not a group that should be without protection and it is important that their legal protections should be properly enforced, as the hon. Member for Solihull said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="80122h0004.htm_para9"><a name="08012265000128">We have made important advances in the labour market in recent years. The hon. Member for Epping Forest referred to the right to request flexible working, which is another change that we have made. It is intended to recognise the twin responsibilities of family and work, and to help employees and employers cope with them. We have worked step by step, through granting the right first to parents of younger children and to carers. Hon. Members will know that the Government recently announced a review of the arrangements, with a view to extending the right to the parents of older children. The review is being carried out by Imelda Walsh of Sainsbury&#146;s, a senior and experienced business woman. We are trying to establish a labour market that helps families to cope with the twin responsibilities of family and work and supports them in a way that business can accommodate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="80122h0004.htm_para10"><a name="08012265000129">Today&#146;s debate has raised important issues. We want a labour market with flexibility, but we also want it to have decency and dignity. That is the core philosophy behind the changes in the labour market that the Government have made in the past decade.</p>

Net immigration is now 190,000 per year&#151;the highest ever, and unprecedented in our nation&#146;s history. When the Government estimated the net immigration figure at only 145,000, a couple of years ago, they put the proportion of household formation caused by that immigration at 33 per cent., meaning a need for 200 houses every day just to accommodate immigrants. Those figures are now significantly higher and still rising, with the figure of 190,000.</p>

There is appalling traffic congestion on junction 21 of the M5, and a variety of related problems with local infrastructure and services because of the failure to plan for a sustainable community rather than for a dormitory.

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. It was the policy and philosophy that the previous Conservative Government tried to promote.

My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) will remember that an effigy of Nicholas Ridley was burned at Foxley wood, and it led to a complete change in policy.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that in place of burning effigies of the Secretary of State, or of the Minister for Housing, we could have small statues to her if the plan were to do what it will signally fail to do, which is to encourage, for example, community land trusts? In my constituency, the villagers of Buckland Newton have clubbed together to support extra housing for local young people, precisely because those villagers are able to control it through the community land trust and its shared equity arrangements.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right again. Other areas are trying to emulate the achievements regarding community land trusts in his constituency. They have struck a chord with local people, and they are an example of truly sustainable development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para2"><a name="08012265000166">I shall provide my own example of the way in which a small community is being imposed upon by the panel&#146;s report and the strategy. There are 1,350 households in the parish of West Parley, and the parish and its residents association conducted a survey of all residents. They did not go door to door trying to get them to answer yes or no, they sent them survey forms and invited residents to return them. Some 65 per cent. of households did so, representing 1,755 people on the electoral register, and 97.78 per cent. of those residents said that they wanted to preserve their green belt in West Parley. They were also concerned about the lack of infrastructure, and about other issues relating to the proposal to build over the green belt there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para3"><a name="08012265000167">The EIP heard evidence from West Parley, but there is no reference to it in the report, save to say that the opposition to the development on the green belt arose because of a change of political control. That is, however, a completely wrong assertion. It was not a change of political control that caused people to become so angry about the removal of the green belt in that area. It was, however, material that if the local councillors did not go along with the wishes of the people, they certainly would have lost political control, and quite right, too, because surely that is what local democracy should be all about. Instead, the panel has chosen to re-impose through that process a requirement that West Parley should have its green belt taken away to provide 900 high-density houses right on the edge of the River Stour. West Parley parish council is seething, as indeed is East Dorset district council, which realises that the decision is completely at odds with local people&#146;s wishes. The recommendations are totally undemocratic, and they fly in the face of localism. Almost everybody recognises that we need more houses in East Dorset, but surely locally elected representatives should be able to decide on their location.</p>

<a name="80122h0005.htm_brev2"><a name="08012265000455"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The strategy presents the opportunity to incorporate a clear policy of rejecting garden land as being &#145;brown&#146; and encouraging the retention of gardens in urban areas to help &#145;play&#146;; to protect amenity and encourage wildlife.&#148;</p>

that almost every tree has to be removed from any given site, that there will be no local recreational facilities for the people who are forced to live in those high-density dwellings, and that they will be forced to travel to other recreational hot spots at a time when Natural England says that it wants to reduce the amount of people using heathland in order to protect that valuable habitat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para6"><a name="08012265000170">My next representation, again on policy reference SR29, stated:</p>

I am horrified to say that not only was my recommendation rejected by the panel, but that it removed all reference to key infrastructure requirements on the basis that it did not know what that key infrastructure was. That is an absurd situation. I hope that, when the Minister examines the panel report, she will also examine a further recommendation that I made to the panel: that any development should depend on the required infrastructure being in place before it starts. A problem in our planning system in the past 10 or 15 years has been that developers, and sometimes public authorities, have promised to put in infrastructure after the event, but the developments have taken place and the infrastructure has never been put in place. The result has been the pressures that we see every day: increased congestion and pressure on sewerage, waste facilities and water. That is all because the Government refuse to recognise that there must be a link between infrastructure and development.</p>

 My hon. Friend touches on the crucial matter in the debate&#151;the fact that infrastructure is so inadequate. We share the Wessex way, which is almost at gridlock, and Castle lane is completely inadequate. We also have an airport served by a country bumpkin road. That is not the backdrop to which 48,000 houses should be built.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I know that it is suggested that there should be development on the green belt in north Bournemouth, in the northern part of his constituency. To enable access to that land, an enormous amount needs to be spent on infrastructure improvement, but there is no way in which that money can ever be afforded. The proposal in the original report that there should be a proper infrastructure link between the A338 and the airport, to enable new employment, has been rejected in the panel report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para10"><a name="08012265000176">Probably the only good thing in the whole panel report is the suggestion that the A31 should be made a dual carriageway towards the west. The panel regards  <br>

that road as an &#147;urban road&#148;, although it is currently a single carriageway through heathland. That is how it justifies the requirement that it should be a dual carriageway. There is not yet any suggestion as to whether the Highways Agency is in favour of that, and if so, how it will be afforded, but it is about the only crumb of comfort that I could find in the whole 500-plus-page report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para11"><a name="08012265000177">The report mentions the number of houses to be built. I was in the position that you are in today, Mr. Olner, chairing a debate here on the north-east regional strategy last June. The hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), who is now the Deputy Leader of the House, complained that the north-east was not being allowed to build enough houses. The north-east regional spatial strategy stated that there should be a net increase of 6,500 new properties a year, compared with the requirement of 28,500 in the south-west. She said that only 19,000 were proposed in Durham for the whole 15-year planning period, which compares with 48,000 in Dorset. She said that she knew of Members of the House who had complained about lack of infrastructure, congestion and declining quality of life because of development in the south, and that she wanted more of that in the north. If the Government were to say, &#147;Our strategy is to spread the demand for housing and the provision of housing across the country,&#148; we would be talking the same language. That would truly be a strategy led by the Government. Instead, we have the fall-back position of the predict and provide policy.</p>

I hope that the Minister will examine carefully the proposal to increase housing provision in East Dorset by 1,000 properties, with the implications spelled out succinctly by the council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para14"><a name="08012265000180">The report states:</p>

When I was the Roads Minister, the policy was to transfer as much traffic as possible on to the strategic trunk road network, rather than the reverse. Now it seems that we are not going to be doing that. There is a reference in the panel report to restricting the use of the motorway around the Bristol conurbation. What implications does that have for the alternative route into the west country, the A303? It should go via Stonehenge, but the Government have abandoned that project and the panel report states that we should have a gentle approach to developing a second thoroughfare into the west country.

The Leader of the House ducked the second part of my question last Thursday about further opportunities for parliamentary scrutiny. I hope that the Minister will assure us of her willingness to receive deputations from our constituencies on the subject matter of this important report. I do not wish to give an autobiography, but I can remember, when I was a Planning Minister, receiving deputations from Members of Parliament who had concerns about proposed changes to county structure plans. Those plans were much closer to the people than these regional monstrosities that we have now, and the public examination of them was much more thorough, albeit long-winded, than that of the regional spatial strategy.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) on securing this debate. For once, we have a great deal in common, and I shall reiterate some of the important points that he made.

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para18"><a name="08012265000186">I begin with a basic point about the report&#146;s lack of democratic accountability. Like many other MPs, I asked to attend the examination in public. In fact, I requested that three times. I tried to get beyond the secretariat to the examination in public, but that person seemed to have all the power at their elbow. I could not get beyond them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para19"><a name="08012265000187">What concerns me particularly is that we frequently have statements from the Government that the green belt is safe, that it is Government policy not to encroach on it, but that of course local authorities might make adjustments. So where does an unelected regional body that is proposing massive changes to the green belt, regardless of what local councils and elected representatives might say, come into the equation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para20"><a name="08012265000188">I notice, for example, that the Government office for the south-west indicated that an approved green belt should be altered only in exceptional circumstances.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Jan 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 389WH</b><br>
The examination in public panel concluded that the scale of demand and the application of the principles of sustainable locations provide the exceptional circumstances to justify alterations to the green belt in the region. At what point can locally elected representatives challenge that conclusion?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para21"><a name="08012265000189">There is a further conclusion that I find unsatisfactory. The strategic authority suggested that greenfield development in my area needs to be phased in to ensure that it does not prejudice the rate of development within the area, particularly the Poole regeneration area. That is a large brownfield site on which people would support the building of 2,000 dwellings, if they could be secured&#151;it is proving to be difficult&#151;a high proportion of which would be affordable housing. Development on that old power station site is supported by all. Surely that should be attended to before this development comes forth, but the panel&#146;s view was that no evidence had been provided to demonstrate that there was a need for phasing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para22"><a name="08012265000190">Without phasing, how will our existing infrastructure cope? Any Members who have visited Dorset or attempted to travel through it will be aware that it is beautiful but that there is not even a tiny bit of motorway within it, that it has incredibly poor public transport and that it is difficult to travel westward in general. The county lacks infrastructure, yet the thrust of the report is build, build, build, everything will follow. I do not have confidence in that strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para23"><a name="08012265000191">I would like to mention the situation in east Dorset, to which the hon. Member for Christchurch also referred. Corfe Mullen is a large village in my constituency. It was proposed that the authorities working together should undertake a large development in the green belt. An interest group was formed, and it produced a massive petition. The parish council did not just go along with the interest group; as in West Parley, it did a detailed house-to-house survey on the right balance between building and tackling the serious local problem of the lack of affordable local accommodation for our young people. As soon as the results were in&#151;the survey was very well done&#151;they were presented to East Dorset district council. There was hard evidence from local people, and it is absolute nonsense, as the report suggests, to say that East Dorset had a change of political control. That is just one example of the many flaws in the report, and a very obvious one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para24"><a name="08012265000192">I want to refer particularly to the western extension, which is a location around a village called Lytchett Minster. It is true that, originally, the concept of a new town was explored. Natural England objected to that, and, for all sorts of reasons, the whole thing was thrown out. The south-east Dorset joint study area group commissioned a study to consider a reduced scale of development from a transport perspective. The study concluded that substantial highway infrastructure costs would be associated with the development. As a consequence, in evidence to the examination in public, Dorset county council, Purbeck district council, and Lytchett Minster and Upton town council all objected to any development in the area. Lytchett Matravers parish council would have been included, if it had been invited. There was no local support for any development in that green belt and flood plain area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para25"><a name="08012265000193">However, evidence was submitted on behalf of the developer. It is interesting that such evidence could be submitted, whereas I as an MP was told that my viewpoint would not be strategic enough. The person who appeared on behalf of the developer challenged the finding of the study commissioned by our local authorities and said that a development of that scale could be accommodated without the need for additional lanes on the A35. In due course, the examination in public supported an extra 2,750 dwellings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para26"><a name="08012265000194">At the start, Purbeck was asked to provide 2,100 extra dwellings. That has gone up to 5,150, which is an increase of 3,050 and half the increase for the whole of the Bournemouth-Poole conurbation. That is absolutely phenomenal. Purbeck has a wonderful world heritage coastline, it is in an area of outstanding beauty and it has an enormous proportion of heathland.

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para27"><a name="08012265000195">I understand how the statistics might look from the outside. Purbeck has one of the highest ratios of house prices to earnings. Well, perhaps one should just build houses to bring house prices down. That may be the view from outside, but if one also considers the proportion of second homes, one begins to realise that building more and more houses and trying to build a way out of the situation is not the way to tackle the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="80122h0005.htm_para28"><a name="08012265000196">What is needed is a proper approach to providing affordable housing for local young people. It will involve working with local councils and communities. The right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) gave some examples of how we should tackle the problem at local level.

 I am struck by the similarities between the opposition in Dorset and the opposition to urban extension around Cheltenham, where all elected and community representatives opposed the extension and only planners and developers supported it. Does my hon.

He tackled the issue as I would have hoped to myself, covering the nonsense of the Government&#146;s policy of being elected on the ending of the predict and provide approach to housing. We all applauded that at the time, because it was a necessary policy. I am sorry that it has been ditched. He could have gone on to say that when the regional government concept was rejected in the north-east, it would have been sensible to reject it throughout the country. Instead, we have regional government by stealth, and there is no worse example than this issue to show what an inappropriate way that is of carrying on government. When things are done regionally, there is no feel for the position locally, so inappropriate recommendations are inevitably made&#151;no more so than in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para1"><a name="08012265000203">I take us back to last July. My hon. Friend said that he would not discuss flooding, but with your permission, Mr. Olner, I shall. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) was kind enough to visit Tewkesbury at that time, when he saw some of the devastation that the floods caused. Indeed, the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and several other Ministers from DEFRA and the Department for Communities and Local Government have been kind and generous with their time in the past six months. They have visited the area several times and are giving some money. We could do with a lot more, but does not everyone say that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para2"><a name="08012265000204">All that time, energy and interest will be wasted if we ignore the central problem in my area, which includes not only Tewkesbury but a wider part of Gloucestershire. We understand that we live in a flood risk area&#151;two rivers converge at Tewkesbury, so there are bound to be problems&#151;but there are still hundreds of people living in caravans in my constituency. It is six months since the main event, and those people are months away from being settled back into their homes. The question that bothers them more than anything else is whether lessons will be learned from the flooding. The DEFRA inquiry is going on and Sir Michael Pitt is carrying out an inquiry&#151;I am meeting him tomorrow morning&#151;and the main thing that my constituents would want me to say is, &#147;For goodness&#146; sake, we know that we live in a flood risk area, but let&#146;s not make things worse than they need to be.&#148;</p>

People in other areas of the country have probably suffered a little more than we have this time. We know that it will rain again and that the water table is high in my area. We also know that the building of thousands of houses in the past few years has made the matter worse, but the RSS, which was, unbelievably, submitted to the Minister at a time when we were frightened that flooding would recur in Gloucestershire, proposes thousands more houses in my constituency, some of which will be on fields that have flooded. The RSS is not site-specific, but those of us with local knowledge can guess where the houses are going to go. Some will be close to areas that flood and some will take up green fields that would otherwise  <br>

soak up water, preventing it from going elsewhere and causing flooding. It is important that the people who frame such documents understand that if houses are built on fields that previously soaked up flood water, there is a question not only of whether those houses will be flooded, although that is obviously important, but whether they will cause other houses in the area to flood. That concept seems to pass conveniently by people who want to find places to put thousands of houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para4"><a name="08012265000206">I have a home, as does everyone present, I expect. Everyone is entitled to a home, but do we really want to build houses and homes for which the owners are unlikely to get insurance, certainly against flooding, or are likely to have large excesses on their insurance policies if they do get them? It is not unusual nowadays to have a &#163;20,000 excess, which effectively means that those people are not insured against flooding. Should houses be in areas where they might flood or cause other homes to flood, or should we take a more sensible approach, as my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch suggested in his opening remarks?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para5"><a name="08012265000207">Finally, the report starts by stating that its central guiding feature is sustainability. I am not quite sure what that word means, and I am not sure that the report&#146;s authors know what it means. I should like them to give an example of what is not sustainable. Is a house flooding sustainable? Is failing to get insurance sustainable? Is a lack of infrastructure sustainable? The report talks about Ashchurch railway station, which has twice recently had train services cut. It talks about the possible Parkway station and says that it should be built between Cheltenham and Gloucester, but the Government recently turned down funding for it. However, I do not think that they were wrong to do that at this point, as there needs to be an awful lot more thought on it. We do not have the necessary infrastructure or land that is safe from flooding, so will the Minister give us her idea of what is sustainable? The proposals in the RSS to build in large parts of Gloucestershire certainly would not be sustainable on any understanding that I have of the word.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para6"><a name="08012265000209">My constituency falls under South Gloucestershire unitary authority. The original RSS proposed an extra 23,000 houses over a 20-year period, and the panel came back with 30,800&#151;an increase of one third. That takes South Gloucestershire to a very unwelcome second place in the rather dubious league table of all the unitary authorities and district councils. We are second only to Swindon. Our area has already had phenomenal growth in housing numbers with very little infrastructure to go with it. We are worried that the growth is simply unsustainable.</p>

Bradley Stoke. Bradley Stoke is a large new town in our area, and a Bradley Stoke unit is about 7,500 houses. To give my constituents a feel for what is planned, it is four Bradley Stokes, or an extra Bradley Stoke, compared with the last plan. We are worried that we cannot cope with development on that scale. I do not dispute that we need more houses, including affordable houses&#151;indeed, I have twice led debates in this Chamber on affordable housing in South Gloucestershire. This is not nimbyism. It is not about saying no to development but about saying that we need sustainable, manageable development and more affordable housing for local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para8"><a name="08012265000211">The biggest change affecting my constituency is the extra 5,000 houses north of Yate. Yate town council made representations to the panel, but was not allowed to make oral representations. Even the developers asked for only 2,000 houses north of Yate, but the panel said, almost out of the blue, &#147;No, we think there should be 5,000.&#148; It is a regional strategy, not a site-specific local proposal. If the proposal in the original plan had been for 5,000 houses, there would have been a huge response locally, but now it appears to be too late for that. I hope that the Minister will clarify, first of all, what happens inside the Department between now and the Secretary of State giving her response? In other words, is now the best time for the people of Yate to feed in what they think, or should they wait for the Secretary of State to give her response and comment in the consultation period? Clearly, the sooner we feed comments in, the better. The people of Yate want to reopen the process of giving evidence to the panel, because they were denied the opportunity to do that. They had no idea that this was coming and it was a complete bolt from the blue.</p>

 It is a pleasure to contribute briefly to this debate. It is an important debate for the south-west, particularly for Dorset, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) on securing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para15"><a name="08012265000219">Bournemouth, Christchurch and east Dorset is now one of the largest conurbations&#151;perhaps it is the largest&#151;in the south-west, challenging the Bristol and Bath area. For some reason, Bournemouth has been selected as one of 21 key towns and cities across the country for development. Can the Minister explain why Bournemouth has been targeted and why its citizens did not get an opportunity to have a say on whether they wanted to be on that list of 21 key strategic towns and cities?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para16"><a name="08012265000220">We have heard that there will be an increase of 48,000 houses or dwellings in east Dorset. We should place on the record that Dorset has already contributed hugely to an increase in housing. We have already done a massive amount and it is important to continue that point about the not-in-my-backyard consideration. Of course, we need houses, but the massive contribution that Bournemouth has already made means that we are all the more astonished by these increases in the targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para17"><a name="08012265000221">I touched on floodplains. The report specifies north Bournemouth. As I said, I stood in those fields last weekend and they were under water; I had to wear my large wellies to make the point. Now we are seeing these pictures on television&#151;in fact, we see them today&#151;of other areas of Britain where building on floodplains has caused serious problems. I would hate to be here in three or four years&#146; time saying, &#147;I told you so. This is exactly the reason why we should not be building.&#148; I also found it ironic that an organisation based in Exeter can pinpoint so specifically where the housing developments should be in Bournemouth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para18"><a name="08012265000222">Infrastructure has been mentioned. I am astonished to read that the report is saying that the Hurn road links to an international airport, but there is no extra funding or supported funding for that road. Any development of what I would call a country bumpkin road would have to come from local funds, but there simply is not the money available locally for that. If we were to do any decent development, that is exactly the first infrastructure that we would like improved, along with the continuation of the Wessex way and indeed Castle lane, which is close to gridlock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para19"><a name="08012265000223">We are challenging the quality of life and having a social impact on Bournemouth, Christchurch and east Dorset. It will only get worse if we build on this level of density. Bournemouth is already committing more than 640 dwellings every single year. We have now been told to up that number by another 200. That is an astonishing number, when we have also heard that the north-east of England actually wants more dwellings. It does seem to be a disparity in the logic of a unified strategy for the housing requirement for the country as a whole.</p>

I would be grateful for the opportunity to talk with her about the challenges that Bournemouth specifically faces. Because it is such a small unitary authority, we are simply running out of space where we can build the new dwellings that are required of us, so I plead for a few minutes of her time to put the grave concerns that the people of Bournemouth, Christchurch and east Dorset have. That is the key issue beyond any other. As I have said, the character of Bournemouth is being challenged and I would be grateful for her assistance in ensuring that it is not completely wrecked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para24"><a name="08012265000233">A series of problems need to be identified and underlined. It is clear is that growth is not necessarily going where people want it and it seems to be entirely centrally dictated; it is a region, not a local area, making a decision about where growth points should be. Again, I am just thinking of an area, Truro and Falmouth, in my own constituency. There is a golden triangle that is relatively urban and it has been identified as a growth point. Within that same area, there are villages that are crying out for more affordable housing but there will be no opportunity for that housing because everything is being focused and it is easier to lump together 7,000 houses in one place than to allow communities to say, &#147;We would like to be able to begin a negotiation process to enable us to have the housing that we need.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para25"><a name="08012265000234">Another concern that I have is about how effective the liaison will be with the Department for Transport, because the examples that I have seen raise significant concerns. In my constituency, there are plans for a significant number of houses in the Camborne, Pool and Redruth area, which I support. However, the regeneration company itself has said that it is necessary to improve a road link, or build a new one, to support that development. The Department for Communities and Local Government do not have a problem with that, but the Department for Transport&#146;s approved model only considers congestion, journey time and safety, not jobs, employment and housing, which is the remit that the regeneration company has been asked to consider. On that basis, the Department for Transport has turned down that improved road link. Basically, the Department for Transport is saying that the building can go ahead, but people will have to wait until they see the congestion before the issue can be resolved. I worry that there is not sufficient co-operation between the different Departments and that that will be a wider theme emerging from this document, if that situation is not improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para26"><a name="08012265000235">I also wonder whether the demographic issues have really been taken into account. Unlike the constituency of the hon. Member for Christchurch, Cornwall relies on migrant workers to sustain our economy. I do not see that as the driving force, but the fact that many people move to Cornwall to retire, and are not economically active, is an issue. I am not convinced that such specific considerations are taken into account in this document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="80122h0006.htm_para27"><a name="08012265000236">Another concern is the capacity of the building trade. I am not sure that there is sufficient capacity at a sub-regional level. Although representations are made from very large developers, development in many regional areas might be on a smaller scale. In my experience, there have been times when local developers have lacked the capacity to build on the scales that are required. While I welcome the development of more houses, I worry about the capacity to deliver on the scale that this document outlines.</p>

 People are justified in feeling concerned about the effect on the character of their community. The strategy is driven entirely from the top down rather than from the bottom up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="80122h0007.htm_para0"><a name="08012265000239">I have one final concern about the document. In what kind of negotiating position does it leave the local authority? The hon. Member for Tewkesbury said that one does not need to be a specialist to work out what specific sites will be earmarked for development given the numbers specified in the regional spatial strategy. In what negotiating position does that leave the builder, or the people who own the property? They know that the local authority will be absolutely desperate. I am worried that such a measure will drive up prices even further. It is taking away from local areas the ability to negotiate. In St. Agnes, the local authority has successfully negotiated with a landowner over an exception site, which means that it is dramatically increasing the proportion of affordable housing. That kind of local negotiation will be lost if this strategy details the areas earmarked for development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="80122h0007.htm_para1"><a name="08012265000240">The fundamental question concerns the legitimacy of this decision. The decision has been led by the regional assembly, which is not directly elected and is to be abolished. The assembly is setting planning policy for decades and then disappearing. The nearest public examination of the decision took place in Exeter, 100 miles from my constituency and considerably further for those living further west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="80122h0007.htm_para2"><a name="08012265000241">My concern is that the matter reflects my experiences with other regional organisations. When the south-west regional strategic health authority was set up, we spoke to a delegation of MPs about some of the promises that had been made by the Devon and Cornwall SHA. They said, &#147;We cannot be accountable for any decisions made by predecessor organisations. Sorry about that. Our job is to deliver national policy in the regions and not to take representations back up the line.&#148; My concern is that that is exactly what we are seeing here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="80122h0007.htm_para3"><a name="08012265000242">There is another fundamental question: where is the scrutiny process? How many real people are engaged in it? We have heard of specific examples that were ignored. Even if one takes on board the 14,000 representations, that is only a fraction of the regional population. There is a really big difference between consultation and participation, and I feel that this is consultation rather than participation. One just has to see the number of acronyms in the document to know that it is double Dutch to anyone not well versed in such issues. What will the parliamentary scrutiny process be? Today&#146;s debate is led by Back-Bench demand and not in Government time. The regional Minister is not here. Parliamentary answers show that all he plans to do is make representations to the Secretary of State. When the regional assembly was abolished, we were told that we would have an opportunity to make such representations through regional Select Committees. Those are being abolished. Yet, interestingly, in the Planning Bill, the issue of regional accountability is being raised. The  <br>

Minister for Local Government wants to see a super-Committee established so that cross-cutting Committees can scrutinise these national policy statements. Why is there no counter-balance to that in the regional strategy process? Surely we should be considering processes that are led by local demand. That would place local authorities in a much stronger position to negotiate with land owners. Surely there must be proper liaison with other Departments. There is no explicit demonstration that these communities will be sustainable&#151;economically, socially or environmentally. We need to support existing rural communities rather than picking out urban conurbations and saying, &#147;Let&#146;s make them bigger.&#148; That is the easier thing to do when one is looking at a map of the south-west zone.</p>

I have seen him in various ministerial guises and have always found him immensely courteous and keen to listen to what local people have to say.

He appears to be a highly decorated postman. If one sends a letter to him, he passes it on to someone else. If one expresses a view, he asks someone else for the answer. When the hon.

Another projection for this year is that it is going to drop even further. The Minister, with the help of her Parliamentary Private Secretary, might as well take her chair outside, stand it on the piece of land on the other side of Black Rod&#146;s garden and command the Thames not to rise, because although she may increase the figures, nothing will happen unless people are prepared to build houses.

Surely the point is this. It is not that local people are nimbies, but they want to get something out of new development. They want to see something on the human scale. They want to ensure that children can be educated&#151;that development will not mean increased class sizes.

Such proposals were submitted in draft to the Government on 24 April 2006. We have had the 12-week public consultation, which provided opportunities to put comments to an independent panel. The independent panel then held an examination in public between April and July 2007 to discuss and test the draft regional spatial strategy, and to take a range of evidence before considering its report.

It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the content of the regional spatial strategy overall, or proposals from individual areas. Indeed, so seriously do officials take the injunction that I should not comment on it that the first brief that I received from the Department on the subject contained no information about the regional spatial strategy for the south-west, so I sought additional briefing notes.

The latter is crucial. Many areas would not mind extra development if it was matched with an influx of investment in the infrastructure.</p>

 As I said, there are obviously issues around the propriety of the process, so it is important that we respect that. I am happy to discuss specific issues of housing with the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para1"><a name="08012265000282">I wish to make two final points on the question of infrastructure and the wider issues that have been raised. As I said, I cannot comment today on the content of the regional spatial strategy or the overarching housing proposals for the south-west, but I can respond to some of the wider points made about housing that will impact on the rest of the country&#151;for example, the need for more investment in infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para2"><a name="08012265000283">I strongly agree that we need more investment; indeed, the Department for Communities and Local Government is investing &#163;1.7 billion in housing infrastructure over the next three years, but we believe that more is needed. That is precisely why we are legislating through the Planning Bill for local councils to be able to raise a community infrastructure levy, better to link housing with infrastructure. I hope that hon.

However, we also need to consider the quality of life for a 30-year-old who cannot live with his partner and his little baby because they cannot afford to buy a home together&#151;the boomerang kids who are back living with their parents again because they cannot afford a home. We must also consider quality of life for overcrowded families, who also need more housing.</p>

 Thank you, Miss Begg. I am pleased to have the opportunity to consider a very serious and troubling case from my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para5"><a name="08012265000289">Let me start by outlining what happened. In 2005, three men were stabbed&#151;one fatally&#151;and the man found guilty of the murder subsequently committed suicide in custody. That was a complete waste, and the family of the stabbed man want to ensure that lessons have been learned, so that no other family must face the loss and heartache that they have faced. Specifically, family members want to see changes in the way in which the police handle situations of escalating violence and in the interface between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. They believe, with good reason, that their relative would still be alive if both those bodies had operated differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para6"><a name="08012265000290">Time constraints will not allow me to cover the inadequacies, as the family see it, of the Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry or the way in which the judicial system treats victims; suffice it to say that the family believe that they have not been well served in either case. Let me spend five minutes, however, outlining the background to the murder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para7"><a name="08012265000291">My constituent, Mr. Darrell Burrows, set up a haulage business with his brother, Clive Hoyland, in 1974. The business, which was based in Ravensthorpe in the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik), flourished, and other members of the extended Burrows family, including Darrell&#146;s son, David, joined the work force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para8"><a name="08012265000292">The family remember few, if any, problems before 2001, when Mr. Gavin Hogg rented a work space near the business. Within two years, however, the situation had changed dramatically, as the family&#146;s firm, along with several others on the industrial estate, started to be subjected to a campaign of intimidation, damage and antisocial behaviour by Gavin Hogg.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para9"><a name="08012265000293">Matters came to a head in April 2005, when the company gained planning permission for an extension to its premises. The proposed development enraged Mr. Hogg, and there were several incidents involving threats and intimidation, which culminated on 9 May, when he blocked access to the site with a JCB and a car. The police were called for the second time in a matter of weeks to deal with the situation and they believed that they had resolved the problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para10"><a name="08012265000294">Later that day, however, Mr. Hogg told another neighbour on the estate that he intended to kill Darrell Burrows the next day and make it look like an accident, and that is exactly what he attempted. As Mr. Burrows arrived for work on 10 May, he was greeted by Mr. Hogg, who punched him in the face and pulled him from his car before dragging him across a works yard and down a set of steps to a canal, where he intended to drown him. By pure chance, however, Mr. Hogg, not Mr. Burrows, fell into the water, which allowed Mr. Burrows to make his escape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para11"><a name="08012265000295">According to police records, Mr. Burrows was left with a bruised and swollen right eye with a cut above it, four grazes and cuts to his right forearm, cuts and grazes to three fingers on his right hand, grazes to both  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Jan 2008">

knees, cuts to fingers on his left hand, bleeding around a fingernail and both elbows grazed and bleeding. As one can imagine, he feared for his life. His trousers and sweater were also in tatters, his watch was damaged and his car, which had careered off when he was dragged out of it, sustained &#163;13,000 of damage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para12"><a name="08012265000296">Obviously, the police were called again, but the neighbour to whom Mr. Hogg had outlined his intention to kill Mr. Burrows had himself been subject to two years of intimidation by Hogg and refused to sign a statement without police protection, but that was refused. The investigating officer heard his account, however, and it was included in information provided to the CPS later that day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para13"><a name="08012265000297">Despite two years of police involvement in the case, despite the fact that the police database showed Hogg to be a violent man and that at least one independent witness had said that the attack was a premeditated attempt at murder, and despite the injuries sustained by Mr. Burrows&#151;a man in his 60s&#151;Mr. Hogg, who was in his 30s, was later charged with a section 39 common assault and with criminal damage to the car.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para14"><a name="08012265000298">As can be imagined, the family were distraught at that turn of events, not least because Mr. Hogg was bailed to continue his threats and intimidation. A month later, on 10 June, Mr. Clive Hoyland had a long conversation with the police to discuss the deteriorating situation. He is adamant that the police officer whom he spoke to agreed to visit the site to talk to the other factory owners, but that officer did not arrive and later claimed that no such appointment had been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para15"><a name="08012265000299">On 13 September, Hogg was found guilty in the magistrates court of the charges of common assault and criminal damage and was bailed for sentencing the following day. Later that day, however, he again stalked and intimidated Mr. Burrows, who made two telephone calls to the police in the evening to request help, because he believed that Mr. Hogg was breaking the conditions of his bail. Nothing happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para16"><a name="08012265000300">The following morning, on Wednesday 14 September, Mr. Burrows attended a local police station, accompanied by a work colleague and his solicitor, to outline the intimidation that had taken place on the previous evening and to ask the police to act. His request was refused on the officer&#146;s mistaken belief that Hogg had not broken the terms of his bail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para17"><a name="08012265000301">At lunch time that day, Hogg crashed his car into that of Mr.  Burrows, which was parked outside the family&#146;s premises. When Mr. Burrows and colleagues went outside to investigate, Mr. Hogg stabbed him, Clive Hoyland and Darrell&#146;s son, David. David, a father of two, died soon after, and Mr. Hoyland, having missed death by half an inch according to the hospital consultant, was hospitalised for two weeks, while Mr. Burrows senior was hospitalised for a lesser period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para18"><a name="08012265000302">In essence, therefore, the situation worsened greatly over two years, and the police were involved on at least seven and, by some accounts, many more occasions. None the less, a man lost of life, and several families have been devastated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para19"><a name="08012265000303">Perhaps we should just accept that that is the way things worked out and that bad things happen in life. Psychiatric reports that were produced on Mr. Hogg at his trial suggested that he suffered either from a mixed personality disorder of some severity or a schizotypal  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Jan 2008">

disorder, and he had had a psychiatric assessment as early as 1992. He was paranoid and apparently suffered depression for many years, and professional reports variously described him as suffering from social phobia and as being a</p>
<a name="80122h0008.htm_brev0"><a name="08012265000464"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;bomb waiting to go off&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para20"><a name="08012265000304">Well, the bomb went off on 14 September 2005, with devastating results for the Burrows family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para21"><a name="08012265000305">Family members believe that the events could have been avoided if a different course of action had been taken on any one of the many occasions on which they contacted the police to seek help. Specifically, they believe that, if the attempted murder of Darrell Burrows had been seen for what it was and treated as such, Mr. Hogg would not have been at liberty to kill David Burrows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para22"><a name="08012265000306">The family also believe that, if the police had been more persistent in working with the witness to Hogg&#146;s premeditated threat to kill Mr. Burrows, there would have been sufficient evidence for the charge of attempter murder, instead of the derisory charge of common assault. Even a section 47 assault might have made bail less likely. The judge at Hogg&#146;s subsequent trial, however, was quite clear that there had been an attempt to kill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para23"><a name="08012265000307">The family specifically believe that an unseemly rush to clear up matters&#151;no doubt with one eye on the expectations of the public and the media&#151;meant that there was a consistent tendency on the part of the police to underplay the seriousness of what was a steadily worsening situation. Several times, the IPCC reports uses the phrase</p>
<a name="80122h0008.htm_brev1"><a name="08012265000465"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the police were called and the matter was resolved&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para24"><a name="08012265000308">Well, the matter was not resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para25"><a name="08012265000309">The family also specifically believe that finding a series of individual officers guilty of various failings in their duty, as the IPCC report does, misses the point. There appears to be a systemic problem with the way in which the police operate in such situations, with each incident apparently being treated as though there was no context. As a result, its seriousness and significance are missed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para26"><a name="08012265000310">I shall refer at this point to the Peter Woodhams murder of January 2006, in the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick). Exactly the same series of events seems to have happened, with the same response from the police force in question. That two officers were required to resign as a result of the inquiry misses the point, which is the apparent inability of the police system to intervene in such situations before a fatality takes place, despite many warning signs about the danger to the victim and the oft-stated view of the victim and his family that his life was under threat. Darrell Burrows told the police officer in the police station on the morning of the 14th&#151;the morning of the murder&#151;that if action were not taken, there would be a fatality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para27"><a name="08012265000311">I now want to deal with the involvement of the Crown Prosecution Service, which directed the police on the appropriate charges after the attempted murder of Darrell Burrows in May 2005. As we know, and as I have said, its advice was to proceed with charges of common assault and criminal damage. What hon. Members might not know is the process by which that decision and other such decisions are arrived at.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para28"><a name="08012265000312">First, there was no face-to-face meeting between the police and the CPS representative, who sat in a call centre in the midlands and had information faxed and e-mailed to him. That is CPS Direct. That was then followed up by a telephone conversation between the police officer who completed the paperwork and the solicitor who acted for the CPS. However, the police officer who conducted that conversation was not the officer who investigated the crime and had not visited the scene or spoken to any of the other parties involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para29"><a name="08012265000313">The CPS representative accepted that the case was one of premeditated violence against Mr. Burrows&#151;that is apparent from the record sheet&#151;but suggested a charge of common assault, in the face of an apparent refusal by the one witness to sign a statement to attest to premeditated attempted murder. Why was Hogg, I wonder, not bailed for further investigations, rather than being charged with two minor offences?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para30"><a name="08012265000314">The CPS officer made his decision, as is again apparent from his record sheet, without reference to the full police files in the case. It is unclear whether he had police files on Mr. Hogg at his disposal either, although that also appears unlikely. As I said at the outset, the view of the family is that, if an appropriate charge had been brought at that juncture, Mr. Hogg would not have been at liberty to kill David.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para31"><a name="08012265000315">What cannot be denied is the flawed nature of a system of long-distance liaison between the CPS, in the person of a solicitor who apparently had not obtained access to the full background details of the case, and a police officer who had to relay third-hand information given to him by the colleagues who had conducted the investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para32"><a name="08012265000316">As a result of what I have described, I have four or five questions for the Minister. The family believe that it is reasonable, in situations that develop over a period of time&#151;in this case two years&#151;and in which the police have several involvements, to expect the police to act proactively and not just to react to each incident in an atomised fashion. First, if the Minister agrees with the family about that, what changes can be made to police operations to encourage and support that approach? Secondly, has the pressure for results and for crimes to be cleared up reached the point at which, for both the police and the CPS, there is a tendency to downplay offences?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para33"><a name="08012265000317">Let us remember a police officer was told by a credible business man that he was told by Hogg that he was going to kill Darrell Burrows. All the evidence was that he attempted to carry out that threat, but because the witness refused to make a written statement without some support that was dismissed as no longer relevant. Thirdly, should more efforts be made to secure a statement in such cases, as was suggested, again, by the trial judge in Hogg&#146;s case?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para34"><a name="08012265000318">Fourthly, does the need to clear up cases get in the way of overseeing matters, which might have led to a more proactive approach in this case and in the saving of the life of a quiet family man, killed in his prime? Fifthly, what responsibility do the police have for liaison with mental health services? Both services had been dealing with Mr. Hogg since 1990. Finally, the family want to know what changes have taken place in police and CPS operations since the deaths of David and of Peter Woodhams, to ensure that such things never happen again.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen (Mike Wood) on securing the debate, albeit on a tragic subject. As he said, the tragic case of David Burrows, who was murdered by Gavin Hogg on 14 September 2005, is precisely that&#151;a tragedy&#151;and I offer condolences to his family, two members of which, his father and uncle, were also injured by Mr. Hogg. I shall try to address the spirit of my hon. Friend&#146;s questions at the end of my remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para35"><a name="08012265000320">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for describing the circumstances of the events that led to the sad death of David Burrows and for raising concerns about the way in which matters were handled by West Yorkshire police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The IPCC gave instructions on 6 December about disciplinary sanctions and words of advice to be passed on to police officers, but I will ensure that both CPS West Yorkshire and the chief constable of West Yorkshire get a copy of our deliberations today, and will ask them firmly what lessons they have learned from the events described by my hon. Friend. I shall seek assurances that those lessons have been learned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para36"><a name="08012265000321">I shall briefly outline my understanding of the circumstances of the case. My hon. Friend has set them out in some detail and is right to say that there were several disputes between Hogg and the Burrows family, which had on a number of occasions been brought to the attention of the police. As I am sure my hon. Friend will appreciate, decisions on how to respond to matters that are reported to the police are operational ones, and are ultimately the responsibility of the chief officer of the force, who must decide how best to use the available resources in the interest of the community that the force serves. However, I take on, and will feed back into my deliberations with the police more generally, the notion of context and oversight, when things are duly reported. I think that that does happen, but sadly things go wrong, as happened in this case. In defence of the police more broadly, they try to contextualise. I do not think that I accept the point that pressure for results and clear-up gets in the way of due process and the effort to contextualise and ensure that any history of a complaint is taken into account. However, I shall pass on my hon. Friend&#146;s comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="80122h0008.htm_para37"><a name="08012265000322">My hon. Friend knows that David&#146;s father was assaulted in May 2005 and the family certainly think that that was a catalyst for what tragically ensued four months later. He has detailed how Hogg was charged just with common assault. The family believe that that charge did not reflect the seriousness of the attack, and that the police were responsible for that fact. However, as my hon. Friend is aware, the decision on the charge to be brought was made by the reviewing Crown Prosecution Service lawyer. The CPS is responsible for deciding whether criminal charges should be brought and what they should be. It would not be proper for me to comment on the decision that was taken, but I shall try to ensure, as I have said, that the lessons of the case will be learned.</p>

The help desk officer made some checks and concluded&#151;my hon. Friend suggests that he was wrong&#151;that Mr. Hogg had not breached the terms of his bail. Advised of that, Mr. Burrows left the police station and expressed concern at the perceived lack of action. My hon. Friend knows about and has explained subsequent events. Mr. Hogg went to the Burrows family place of business, fatally stabbed David and injured both Darrell Burrows and Clive Hoyland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para2"><a name="08012265000325">In addition to the murder investigation, West Yorkshire police were required, under the Police Reform Act 2002, to refer the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, because the death followed contact with the police&#151;my hon. Friend said that contact was made seven times. It was referred on 16 September 2005. Mr. Hoyland made a complaint to West Yorkshire police on 19 October 2005 about the events that led to his nephew&#146;s death. As my hon. Friend is aware, the IPCC decided that a managed investigation should take place. It might be helpful if I explain what that means. Managed investigations are conducted by the police under the direction and control of the IPCC when an incident, complaint or allegation of misconduct is of such significance, and if it will probably be of such public concern, that it needs to be under IPCC direction and control, but does not need a full independent investigation.</p>

 I am not asking the Minister to comment on specific cases, but does he think it appropriate that the supervising IPCC investigator was not only an ex-police officer, but that he had only recently been a senior officer in the police force that was under investigation?</p>

 I think that it can be appropriate, but I accept the thrust of my hon. Friend&#146;s point. Clearly, the family would have seen a potential conflict of interest, and their sensitivities might have been better accounted for. I do not think that such an arrangement is inappropriate, but I understand that it might have been difficult for people given how they might have perceived the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para3"><a name="08012265000328">As my hon.

required to investigate a matter fully, but I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point. The incident was considered to be serious enough to be allocated to the most senior and experienced IPCC investigator available. That is part of the balance that must be struck when choosing an individual to conduct an investigation. I think that the person chosen was appropriate, despite his background as a serving West Yorkshire officer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para4"><a name="08012265000329">I understand that no concerns were raised about the senior investigator throughout the lengthy period of the investigation, and that the Burrows family and my hon. Friend have said that they have no reason to dispute his integrity or the quality of his investigation. One of the Burrows family is a former police officer and was aware from the outset of the career history of the senior investigator, for whom he had worked directly some years previously. I understand that he confirmed that he had every confidence in the senior investigator. Indeed, the Burrows family and my hon. Friend have met the senior investigator and the IPCC commissioner to discuss their concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para5"><a name="08012265000330">My hon. Friend is aware that the investigation did not find that the conduct of any officer led directly or indirectly to David&#146;s tragic murder. However, it recommended that a number of officers should receive words of advice or disciplinary sanctions in relation to the matter. As I said, the IPCC instructed West Yorkshire police to implement those disciplinary sanctions on 6 December 2006. That brought the process that emerged after the appalling tragedy of David&#146;s murder to an end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para6"><a name="08012265000331">I appreciate my hon. Friend&#146;s comments&#151;he is more concerned to learn lessons than about the individual circumstances of the case or the consequences for the police officers or anyone else who was involved. Like the Canning Town incident, we should ensure that such events are not repeated. That is why I will arrange to forward <i>Hansard</i> and any other materials that my hon. Friend wishes to pass to me not only to the CPS and chief constable of West Yorkshire for their consideration, but to the commissioner of the IPCC to seek its assurances, which I will pass on to my hon. Friend. We need to ensure that if there are lessons to learn from this tragedy&#151;I am sure that there are&#151;they are learnt and fed back in to the police, CPS and IPCC, not only in West Yorkshire but throughout the country. If we cannot learn lessons of substance from such tragedies, we would be in a sorry position, so I shall certainly do that and let my hon.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue. I offer commiserations to the Minister, because I am aware that this is the second time in a fortnight that he has had to come to Westminster Hall to talk about slurry.</p>

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="08012265000335"><a name="80122h0009.htm_spmin0"><a name="08012265000574"><b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b>

 I am not surprised. I, for my part, have not received a great dearth of letters from constituents affected. I am glad that those are getting through to the Minister, and hopefully the points that they raise will be understood and acted upon. Many farmers, and others interested in agriculture, have concerns about the effect of the proposed regulations and the result for many farms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para9"><a name="08012265000337">It would be invidious to read out every letter that I have received on this matter. However, I should mention that I spent a very useful hour or so, on the weekend before last, discussing the matter with one of my constituents, Mr. Phippen, of Court farm in Buckland, and a few of his colleagues from other farms whom he brought with him. I have also received very helpful letters from people such as Mr. Wellstead of Withy farm in Charlton Mackrell, Mr. Churchouse of Manor farm in Castle Cary, and Mr. Howe from Pen Sellwood. They all raised various points about the regulations that need to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para10"><a name="08012265000338">Those points fall into a number of categories: first, the rationale behind the proposals; secondly, the practical consequences, and thirdly, the cost of complying for working farms. The Minister will be aware that, in my constituency, dairy farming is the primary agricultural sector. We like to think that Somerset has some of the best dairy land in the country. Despite the predations of recent years, I still have a large number of dairy farmers in my constituency, who are very concerned about the consequences of the regulations for their farm businesses. I must also mention the pig sector, even though it is not so prevalent, because I used to breed pigs. As he knows, the pig sector has regular economic ups and downs, which will not be helped by the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para11"><a name="08012265000339">I am sure that the Minister is familiar with the formula, which has been widely circulated among dairy farmers, for working out the consequences for their own farms. I have some figures provided by Mr. Griffin of New Barn farm on Godminster lane in Bruton, who has worked out the consequences for his farm. He milks 150 cows on 100 hectares of prime Somerset grassland; he will require 22 weeks of slurry storage capacity and will have a whole-farm manure-loading limit of 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare. Those 150 dairy cows provide an average yield of 8,000 litres and produce 99 kg of nitrogen per animal per year. He also has 20 heifers less than 12-months-old producing 28 kg per animal per year. The total amount of nitrogen produced by those animals is 12,440 kg per hectare. However, when calculated against a loading limit of 170 kg, his 100 hectares of land available for spreading allows for a total permitted  <br>

manure capacity for the farm of 10,200 kg per hectare, which means that he is 2,240 kg per hectare over his limit.</p>

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="08012265000340"><a name="80122h0009.htm_spnew4"><a name="08012265000576"><b>Mr. Woolas:</b>
 That is very useful information from Mr. Griffin. Will the hon. Gentleman repeat the figure on the cap?</p>

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="08012265000341"><a name="80122h0009.htm_spnew5"><a name="08012265000577"><b>Mr. Heath:</b>
 The total capacity is 10,200 kg per hectare, which is why we are left with the excess total of 2,240 kg. I do not want to over-state those particular figures, but they do illustrate the problem. What options are open to Mr. Griffin if he is to comply with the regulations? He could reduce the size of his herd by about 25 cows, but that is an unappetising prospect for any dairy farmer, given the lost milk revenue, which he estimates at &#163;55,000; he could buy more land, but again that would be expensive and possibly impractical, or he could export his manure to another farm, although I cannot imagine that neighbouring farms will be desperate for excess manure given the overall situation. If the proposals are passed, they will pose a real conundrum on the running costs of such businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para12"><a name="08012265000342">I would accept quite a lot of control if I felt that it was having a lasting and beneficial effect on the environment. However, it is extremely difficult to believe that the proposals will result in benefits in any way commensurate with the cost to the industry, and some would argue that they will result in little benefit at all. I have always felt that, in years gone by, the principal cause of nitrate leachate in our watercourses was the overuse of commercial nitrate fertiliser. However, it is no longer overused, and, arguably, as a consequence, levels of nitrate in our watercourses have reduced markedly in some areas of the country. I realise that those figures are disputed, and I do not have access to all those available, but certainly in some parts of the country it is clear that there is either stasis or a reduction in nitrate levels. Certainly there is nothing to suggest that this very expensive and overburdensome regulation will have a desirable effect in anyway commensurate with the cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para13"><a name="08012265000343">It could be argued that the practical consequences of what farmers will be required to do in order to meet the regulations will have a detrimental effect on the environment. Slurry is a natural product that provides the nutrients that the soil needs for growth. If it is not available, substitutes, such as artificial fertiliser, will be used, which I believe to be of more concern for the environment than the spreading of slurry. I find it difficult to understand the justification for the regulations. Will the Minister expand on that? Furthermore, why is it not possible to undesignate nitrate-vulnerable zones? That is completely illogical. If the risk has passed, owing to action taken, and there is no longer a problem, processes should be in place for undesignating particular areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para14"><a name="08012265000344">The closed periods for spreading will present practical difficulties for many working farmers. What determines when it is appropriate to spread slurry? Rainfall is a major factor: one does not want to go out and spread slurry when it is pouring down with rain, as it is in Somerset at the moment&#151;we are under monsoon conditions. Let that be an illustration, because when would have been the best time to spread slurry in the  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Jan 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 414WH</b><br>
fields in Somerset? Back in November and December it was unseasonably dry and we had a real opportunity then, but under the proposals it would have been the closed season. The open season for spreading would have started in mid-January. Ever since the date from which spreading would have been allowed, it has been teeming down with rain. Any farmer that spreads under those conditions would be doing no good to their land, it would all run off into the rivers&#151;exactly where we do not want it&#151;and it would be rank bad husbandry. Any farmer left with a need to spread slurry on land would not be able to do so, sensibly and reasonably, during the current spreading season.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para15"><a name="08012265000345">The difficulty is that if there is a long period of wet weather, which there tends to be nowadays at certain times of the year&#151;not the same times as we used to have them, presumably because of climate change&#151;as soon as there is a dry day, every farmer in the area will need to spread the maximum amount of slurry to meet requirements, without having any choice in the matter. Again, that will be bad farming practice, probably over-dressing the fields in that brief period, and there will be a synchronicity that has not been properly assessed in its environmental effects. Every farmer will be spreading slurry on the same day, and apart from creating the most awful smell across Somerset and a large part of the western counties of Britain, which will not do a great deal for our tourist industry, it will presumably have a cumulative effect of run-off into watercourses. Again, there will be an unlooked-for anti-environmental disbenefit rather than a benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para16"><a name="08012265000346">Another weather problem is temperature. The proposals make no reference to it, but farmers take note of it in deciding when to spread nitrate&#151;slurry or artificial fertiliser. A difference in temperature results in a difference in take-up by the growing crop or grass. Unnecessarily reducing the days available for spreading to days when the temperature is not optimum will again produce an agronomical and environmental disbenefit. That cannot be the purpose of the proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para17"><a name="08012265000347">Mrs. Caroline Gent of Brottens Lodge in Doulting wrote to me about the matter. I do not think that she farms, but she is concerned about the matter. She raised the issue of organics. The proposals show no understanding of organic farming and the particular constraints of organic farmers, yet the Government say that they want to promote that sector. The proposals will have a hugely detrimental effect on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para18"><a name="08012265000348">Tenant farmers must be considered. Where will the capital come from for slurry storage for tenant farmers, who do not own their farms? Why should their landlords put in the necessary capital investment for something that will be of no benefit whatever to them? If tenant farmers cannot get that capital investment, how will they survive?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para19"><a name="08012265000349">I was not going to mention cover crops, as they were dealt with in the debate the other day. They are not a particularly strong problem in my area, but, as the Minister knows, they are elsewhere. There certainly seems to be an inconsistent approach, which brings us back to ground cover and the environmental benefits that we want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para20"><a name="08012265000350">We know that Ireland, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands have sought derogations. I am not clear about the Government&#146;s position on that; perhaps the Minister can explain it.</p>

It is paradoxical and unhelpful that that coincides with the abolition of the agricultural buildings allowance. Many farmers in my part of the world look across the Bristol channel and say, &#147;Why is it different in Wales? Why is it different in Scotland? Why do they have different regimes, which will give farmers in those areas a competitive advantage over English farmers in Somerset?&#148; I noticed that in the debate the other day, there was a reference in <i>Hansard </i>to the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) talking about &#147;deferential rates&#148;. I think that it was intended to be &#147;differential rates&#148;, but I like the idea that we are deferring to the Welsh and Scots in the provision of grants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para22"><a name="08012265000352">There is the general matter of red tape. The compliance regulations pile yet more bureaucracy on farmers who could do without it. I had a real cri de coeur from my constituent Mr. Walford, of Upton Bridge farm in Long Sutton. I shall send his letter on, as it refers mainly to a different matter&#151;it appears that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is telling him that he cannot shoot pigeons, contrary to any law that I am aware of.

I examined carefully his response to the debate two weeks ago, and it seemed that he was not entirely closing the door to further discussion and progress on some matters. He indicated that he was not entirely committed to the date of 6 April, for instance, which we had assumed was the date intended for implementation. There are so many question marks about the proposals, and so many implications for working farmers in the cost of slurry storage and the changes to working practices, that we need at least a postponement for further consideration and for the Minister to take account of the representations that he will have received from not only the industry but colleagues in the House, who have raised the matter with him many times. I hope that that will give him the opportunity to make changes. My preference would be to take away the proposal and accept that it is not necessary for achieving the Government&#146;s objectives, but if he does think that it is necessary, he can improve the design of the regulations and make them much more friendly to our farmers. They have had a difficult few years&#151;he knows that, and I know that. I do not want to make it even worse and lose yet more of our dairy farmers in Somerset.</p>

and Mrs. Gent. I apologise if I have missed out any of them. I often find Adjournment debates that are based on the experience of constituents the most enlightening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para26"><a name="08012265000357">In my defence, I wish to state firmly for the record that the directive in discussion is a 1991 directive. The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) was the Minister at the time and signed up to it. I do not wish to hide behind that, just to point it out in the interests of fairness. I hope that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, having mentioned his constituents by name, will respond to them with that information&#151;perhaps with a copy of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para27"><a name="08012265000358">My time is limited and I always think it best to answer the questions that have been raised, so may I say that the Government are committed to seeking a derogation from the prescribed limit? We are working on the submission, and I confirm my remarks in the previous debate about the date for implementation. I thank the hon. Gentleman again, but emphasise that the proposals before us are part of a consultation. It has obviously closed, and his debate is timely, as it raises several important issues behind the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para28"><a name="08012265000359">The principle of the polluter pays is one to which the hon. Gentleman and I adhere, and we are considering the practical implementation of the policy. Without rehearsing all the arguments to justify the directive, I shall put on record the general policy that agriculture is a significant contributor to the pollutants nitrate, ammonium, ammonia, nitrous oxide, methane, phosphorus and pathogens, some of which are greenhouse gases. For example, agriculture contributes about 60 per cent. of the nitrates, 25 per cent. of the phosphorus and between 25 and 50 per cent. of the pathogens that enter rivers in England, so those pollutants are of widespread concern to those of us&#151;the hon. Gentleman is one&#151;who care about the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para29"><a name="08012265000360">Less prominent in the debate is the cost to the water industry, which is also in DEFRA&#146;s remit, and indeed in my ministerial portfolio. The cost for treating water to meet the drinking water requirements on nitrates during the period 2005 to 2010 is estimated to be &#163;288 million in capital expenditure and &#163;6 million in operating expenditure. I make that point to demonstrate to the House that there is a cost equation. My attitude is to focus on how best to implement the directive, and to consider the arguments that are put forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="80122h0009.htm_para30"><a name="08012265000361">The nitrates directive is subject to enforcement by the European Commission, which is the third side of the triangle. In recognition of the need to minimise the environmental impacts to which I referred, we have developed a range of policies that cover the on-farm management of slurries. Some of those policies involve advice and support, others regulatory controls. An example of an important regulatory measure controlling the on-farm use of slurry is the directive itself, which requires that we establish an action programme within areas that we have identified as nitrate-vulnerable zones. The hon. Gentleman asked whether it was possible to de-designate, a question on which we have consulted, and his views will be taken into account when the Government respond to the consultation.</p>

The consultation document was published in August 2007. As I have said, the consultation was genuine and it involved a well-informed debate, so my point about the amount of correspondence that I have received from Members in all parts of the House and from farmers is important.</p>

Nevertheless, the consultation, having closed on 13 December 2007, is being carefully considered.</p>

For example, we are keen to promote innovative technologies, such as anaerobic digestion&#151;the production of power from slurry. It is a renewable energy technology that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capturing methane from the decomposition of organic materials, such as manures, slurries and other matter.</p>

 This is the first time that you have presided over a debate in which I have taken apart, Miss Begg, so it is an honour and a pleasure to serve under you. May I put on record my gratitude to Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate? It is about a subject that is close to the hearts of my constituents in East Cleveland, especially those in Loftus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para8"><a name="08012265000373">I should like to discuss a set of archaeological finds that were uncovered in the countryside of Street Houses near to the market town of Loftus. I will stress the importance of keeping those treasures on Teesside for my constituents. That would be of great benefit to local people, particularly schoolchildren, as a reminder of the distant past of the area in which they live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para9"><a name="08012265000374">The find was an Anglo-Saxon cemetery near the coast, outside Loftus. The dig was conducted by local archaeologist Steve Sherlock with help from the Teesside Archaeology Society and local volunteers. The discovery is regarded by all the archaeologists who have seen it as one of the most important discoveries in the old kingdom of Northumbria. To set the find in its historical context, it dates from the era after the departure of the Romans from Britain, which left our shores and internal borders defenceless. By 450 AD, the Anglo-Saxons had begun their invasion of the north, colonising all the land north of the Humber in the area they called Deira, which was probably an adaptation of a Celtic tribal region or kingdom. The invasion was led by the Saxon warrior, King Ida the Flamebearer, and spread further north up to the valleys of Tyne, Wear and Tees. That was the early foundation of what was to become the great kingdom of Northumbria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para10"><a name="08012265000375">Spectacular gold jewellery, weapons and items of clothing found at 109 grave sites are believed to be from around the 7th century. The value of the artefacts suggests that they belonged to a member of the Northumbrian royal family. The team&#146;s first clues to the site&#146;s existence came from an aerial photograph showing evidence of iron age activity, but they did not expect to find a royal Anglo-Saxon site, as they are usually found only in the south of England. Steve Sherlock has long worked in the area, and realised the significance of the site from its size. Excavation began in 2005, when 30 graves were found. Another 13 were found in 2006, including the most northerly example in this country of a Saxon bed burial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para11"><a name="08012265000376">Excavations in the summer of 2007 revealed the full extent of this nationally significant royal cemetery. The team eventually uncovered an area the size of half a football pitch. No human remains were found because of the acidic soil, but a range of high-status jewellery survived, as well as glass beads, pottery, iron knives, chatelaines and belt buckles. Five of the graves contained gold and silver brooches, and one grave had a seax&#151;a type of Anglo-Saxon sword. The site included a low burial mound, which is considered an indicator of high status, and an unparalleled arrangement of graves. The graves were laid out with measured accuracy in a square around the bed burial, which shows the planning and order involved in creating this marvellous cemetery. The cemetery also features a Saxon grubenhaus&#151;a building with a sunken floor that is found rarely in cemeteries&#151;which may have been used as a mortuary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para12"><a name="08012265000377">Among the find are three spectacular gold brooches, one of which has red garnet settings and is believed to be an unparalleled example of Anglo-Saxon jewellery. Its workmanship has been compared with finds in the Sutton Hoo royal cemetery. Steve Sherlock, who has extensive experience, believes that such an item must have been commissioned from the best craftsman in Anglo-Saxon England, and he firmly believes that it would have belonged to an Anglo-Saxon princess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para13"><a name="08012265000378">In addition to those spectacular finds, other items of particular interest and value were discovered, including a triangular gold pendant and two silver coins that would have been worn as pendants. The coins were from the iron age, from a tribe that was known to live in what is now Lincolnshire. Mr. Sherlock believes that there may be a connection between the grave and St. Hilda, the abbess who founded the famous abbey at Whitby in 675. He has dated the jewellery back to around that time, when most of Anglo-Saxon Northumbria had converted to Christianity. He speculates that the owner of the jewellery, the princess, and St. Hilda could have known each other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para14"><a name="08012265000379">Amazingly, the site became a double top for Steve Sherlock and the Tees archaeology team, as it was found also to have been a site of habitation in the iron age. Evidence of houses and flooring materials has been found, and a number of iron age artefacts were unearthed and recorded. The fact that both sites survived intact for nearly two millennia is unprecedented. It is amazing to think how much time has elapsed since the princess and other members of Northumbrian communities were buried in those graves. Over the centuries, the graves have survived great upheavals in the world. They provide us with a link to our history and tell us about the order of society in the dark ages. They also show us that those people, far from being remote from us, felt some of the same emotions that we do and had the same sense of curiosity about the world around them and their place in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para15"><a name="08012265000380">Those are the reasons why my constituents want the discoveries to stay on Teesside, as close as possible to East Cleveland, especially Loftus. The objects are being kept by an independent organisation until their ownership can be determined by a court&#151;in this case, a coroner&#146;s inquest. After the inquest, the coroner will have to ask an independent panel of experts to place a value on the relevant objects. The people who decide such matters are usually academics, museum curators and antique dealers who buy and sell similar objects. I understand that the process is overseen by the British Museum, as an agent for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. When a price is set, the purchasing museums service, in this case Redcar and Cleveland, will have a set period of time to raise the money&#151;usually about three months. The owner of the land on which the dig took place has said that he will make no claim on the artefacts, and that he would like them to be kept locally and safely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para16"><a name="08012265000381">The Kirkleatham museum, the nearest museum to the site, is more than suitable to house the collection. It has a fairly eclectic collection of approximately 100,000 objects with key themes including industrial heritage, rural life and social history. The museums service has worked closely with the Teesside Archaeology Society for many years. Together, they have found and collected many objects ranging from second world war aircraft  <br>

remains to dinosaur fossils, and have made a great contribution to many fine exhibitions. They have skilled and dedicated curatorial and display staff, and I have every confidence that the artefacts would be safe if they were placed there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para17"><a name="08012265000382">Redcar and Cleveland borough council, which owns the museum, the Teesside Archaeology Society, Steve Sherlock and the landowner all support the artefacts being kept at Kirkleatham museum. They want the objects to be displayed locally for everyone to see, free of charge within a designated, secure exhibition area. The find has been described by the museum&#146;s curator, Alan Pearce as potentially containing the most iconic objects the museum would have. He is already receiving inquiries from Germany, France, New Zealand and America about the finds. Their monetary value is currently unknown, but their acquisition, conservation, restoration, interpretation and exhibition may cost around &#163;150,000 to &#163;200,000.</p>

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="08012265000383"><a name="80122h0010.htm_spnew3"><a name="08012265000582"><b>Richard Younger-Ross (Teignbridge) (LD):</b>
 Funding for all those aspects is important. One way that local museums gather treasure is by local people finding it literally in the ground. Since Devon appointed a finds liaison officer, reporting of finds has increased by 248 per cent. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if the funding of such people were discontinued, treasure such as that that he is trying to keep in his community would be lost to the community?</p>

 I certainly agree that the treasure is valuable, but I am sure that the Minister could respond more eloquently than me on the situation in Devon. I am making the case for my own area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para18"><a name="08012265000385">The exhibition would make a marvellous contribution to the attractions of the area and to its regeneration. It would obviously have to be done in partnership but, given the enthusiasm of the borough council in particular, I feel that the ambition could be realised. I hope that the DCMS will be sympathetic to the case for the retention of these artefacts at a local museum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para19"><a name="08012265000386">The bond between a specific area and the historical treasures that originate from it is strong in this case. I am sure that the Minister is well aware of the controversy over what are called the Lindisfarne gospels. As she will know, there is currently a tussle between the British Museum and the people in Tyne and Wear over the siting of the manuscripts. I want to avoid such a tussle occurring on Teesside, and I am sure that my right hon. Friend would concur with me on that. With her backing and that of her colleagues in the DCMS, we can be confident that these mementoes of a bygone age, which are important to the people in the rural part of my constituency in East Cleveland and especially Loftus, remain in Teesside at least. That would allow a whole generation of local people from the area of Northumbria downwards to enjoy what we have. I hope that I have sympathetic support from my right hon. Friend, because this is an important issue for my patch.</p>

believe that it was somebody in his constituency who rightly described the objects as iconic, and those that have been discovered at the site are fascinating and beautiful. They certainly play a key role in helping us understand and link ourselves to our identity, history and culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para20"><a name="08012265000388">The fact that this site is the first royal burial ground from the period to have been discovered in the north of England is particularly exciting, and, as my hon. Friend said, the excavations give us an unprecedented insight into the lives of the Anglo-Saxons who ruled that part of the country in the 7th and 8th centuries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para21"><a name="08012265000389">I congratulate Mr. Steve Sherlock, who my hon. Friend mentioned in his contribution. Mr. Sherlock is the archaeologist leading the excavations at Loftus with the support of the Tees archaeology team and local volunteers. They are doing a superb job in helping us better to know and understand a key part of our history. Mr. Sherlock and his team have been digging at the Loftus site for the past three summers, and I look forward with great anticipation to what they will find when they start unearthing the next phase in excavations this year. Who knows what they will find?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para22"><a name="08012265000390">My understanding is that the reports that the archaeologists have compiled about their finds at the site so far have been verified by experts at the British Museum and, as my hon. Friend said, are now with the local coroner. The coroner&#146;s inquest will make the formal ruling on whether the objects from Loftus are treasure, although there seems to be little doubt as to what the ruling is likely to be. Assuming that the objects are determined to be treasure, they will then go to the Treasure Valuation Committee, which is an independent panel of experts who will recommend a value for them to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Once a value has been determined, museums will be given the chance to acquire the objects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para23"><a name="08012265000391">Like my hon. Friend, I look forward to seeing the objects from this burial site in a museum. I am thrilled by the thought of members of the public, young and old, being able to enjoy the beauty of the objects and learn about their history from them. I believe we all agree that a museum is the best home for objects such as these. A museum with the necessary facilities and expertise is the right place to ensure that objects are appropriately displayed and interpreted for the enjoyment of the public and for the education of our children, that they are preserved for future generations and that they are made accessible for any future academic research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para24"><a name="08012265000392">When the Treasure Act code of practice was originally drafted in 1996, the usual practice was to offer treasure finds to the appropriate national museum for acquisition before offering them to regional and local museums. Today, a much more collaborative approach is taken, and the national museums always act in close consultation with relevant local museums over acquisitions of treasure. Indeed, the British Museum, which, as my hon. Friend suggested, would be the most appropriate national museum to acquire the objects in this case, makes its position on acquisition absolutely clear. If he would like to see it, it is available on its website. The policy states:</p>
<a name="80122h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="08012265000467"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Museum normally expects Treasure finds from England to be acquired by regional museums and, in general, will acquire Treasure finds either when those museums are unable to proceed with the acquisition or, in the case of finds of major significance, only with the support of the appropriate regional museum.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para25"><a name="08012265000393">My hon. Friend will see that the British Museum has confirmed that it has always been its understanding that the objects from the Loftus excavations would be acquired by a local museum, so I can assure him that the path will be entirely clear for a museum in Cleveland to acquire the objects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para26"><a name="08012265000394">I agree with my hon. Friend that Kirkleatham museum, which has already had some involvement in the excavation project at Loftus, would make an excellent home for the objects. The artefacts would be a notable addition to its extensive and diverse collections. They will help to show the significant part that the Anglo-Saxons played in the area&#146;s rich history. As he will remember, the Treasure Act code of practice states that ex gratia rewards for treasure finds are not payable to archaeologists. In the case of the Loftus treasures, therefore, the acquiring museum will have to pay only the landowner&#146;s reward. I note what my hon. Friend said about the landowner not seeking a monetary financial reward for the finds on his land, but, even were he to do so, the code of practice means that the acquiring museum has to pay only half the market value of the objects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para27"><a name="08012265000395">There is further good news for my hon. Friend about the sources of potential funding available should local museums have to find money to acquire the objects. For smaller items of treasure, grants are available from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council and Victoria and Albert purchase grant funds, and from the Headley Trust. For the purchase of larger items of treasure, both the Art Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund will consider applications for funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="80122h0010.htm_para28"><a name="08012265000396">I hope that all that illustrates how well the UK&#146;s treasure system works. Indeed, it is a system that is highly regarded internationally, as my hon. Friend will know. Our approach of encouraging finders to report items of treasure, having them independently valued and then paying both the finder and the landowner an equal reward means that more and more items of treasure are being declared each year. If I may give my hon. Friend some statistics, in the period from 1988 to 1997, under the old treasure trove system, 256 items of treasure trove were reported in total. Since 1997, and probably thanks to some of the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) when he held my post, and with the introduction of the Treasure Act 1996, from 1997 to 2007 a total of 4,180 items of treasure have been reported. In crude statistical terms, that is an increase of 1,500 per cent., so there has been a massive improvement.</p>

<p><a name="st_97"><a name="08012265000397"><a name="80122h0010.htm_spnew5"><a name="08012265000585"><b>Mark Fisher (Stoke-on-Trent, Central) (Lab):</b>
 I am interested in what the Minister says and I think that she is absolutely right to say it. When she comes to consider the future of the portable antiquities scheme, which I have no doubt she will be doing in the next few weeks, will she bear in mind this very interesting and important find? Although it was not found under the PAS but by a professional archaeologist, her statistics prove the PAS has done an enormous amount, so to limit the scheme in any way would be a very sad blow and make finds such as this much more difficult and much rarer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80122h0011.htm_para0"><a name="08012265000399">By giving museums and, in particular, local museums the first opportunity to purchase items of treasure for their collections, we are also helping to ensure that the best of what is found locally is available for study and enjoyment locally. This really is a win-win situation. The finder and the landowner get rewarded for their efforts in bringing the treasure into the public domain, and the public benefit by being able to see and inspect these important relics from their community&#146;s past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="80122h0011.htm_para1"><a name="08012265000400">Some people are concerned, however, that our past is a finite resource and that allowing metal detecting to continue unlicensed and unregulated will result in the unsustainable removal of our heritage. Indeed, I know that Channel 4&#146;s &#147;Time Team&#148; website contains a rather gloomy prognosis&#151;I do not know whether hon. Members have seen it on the website&#151;that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="80122h0011.htm_para2"><a name="08012265000401">However, that assertion is not borne out by the facts. In 2006-07, the last financial year for which we have figures, the number of reported treasure items was 744, which was the highest figure for a single year ever. Indeed, it was up from 673 in the previous year, which again was a record figure at the time. Therefore, the data shows that, year on year since 1997, the number of reported finds has grown steadily. That does not give a picture of a resource that would appear in any way to be in terminal decline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="80122h0011.htm_para3"><a name="08012265000402">There is a vast amount that the objects buried beneath us can reveal about our past. In fact, I describe it as modern day fishing&#151;without the water&#151;to see all the individuals using their metal detectors in that way. However, we think that people should carry out metal detecting responsibly. That is why we have a code of practice for responsible metal detecting, which has been endorsed by all the stakeholders, including the museums, English Heritage, landowners&#146; associations and metal detecting groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="80122h0011.htm_para4"><a name="08012265000403">If I may, I would like to commend David and Andrew Whelan, the father and son pair of metal detectorists who discovered the Harrogate hoard early last year. Those of us who are aware of that Viking hoard of coins and other treasures will know that it is the most significant find of its type to have been made in more than 150 years.</p>

This scheme runs parallel to the treasure system and provides a network, as hon. Members have suggested, through which non-treasure material discovered by amateur archaeologists and other enthusiasts can be identified and recorded. The finder gets to find out more about her or his discovery; a bank of information is built up for the benefit of everyone through the publicly accessible database, and the finds can be displayed and interpreted for the benefit of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="80122h0011.htm_para6"><a name="08012265000405">The database that we now have covers more than 300,000 objects. It is available for everybody to use, free of charge, and anyone who wants to research the archaeology of their local area&#151;or anyone else&#146;s local area&#151;can do just that. It does not matter whether someone is doing a postgraduate research degree at one of our top universities or a new entrant to secondary  <br>

 The Minister paints a very rosy picture of the PAS. However, the reality is that funding for the scheme is likely to be frozen, which, in effect, is a cut. Considering the success of the scheme, will she make a very strong case to the Treasury for funding to be continued to the scheme at the rate of inflation, so that it can continue its good work?</p>

 I am proud of the settlement that we achieved within the DCMS in a very tight fiscal environment, when many other Departments faced rather swingeing cuts. Within that tight settlement, we must give flexibility to the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council to dispense its money in the way that it wants. We have ring-fenced the money for the renaissance in the regions budget and I believe that all hon. Members here think that that programme has done a fantastic job in building the capacity of our regional museums. If one looks at the data, it is those regional museums that have really opened up access to museums for people who, in the past, would probably never have gone over the threshold of a museum. Conserving and building on that hugely successful programme is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="80122h0011.htm_para7"><a name="08012265000408">The PAS does a good job. However, in the current environment, I suggest to the hon. Member that to pick out growth for this particular area is a little naive. We have done very well to get where we are. As with all other parts of Government, the PAS has to seek its efficiency savings. There is no organisation in the public voluntary sector that is funded by Government that does not have to go through that task, particularly making backroom savings out of their administrative budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="80122h0011.htm_para8"><a name="08012265000409">As I said, the PAS is funded by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, which recognises its national significance and it is committed, as the Government are, to seeing it thrive and evolve. Indeed, the council has said that, for 2008-09, it will commit to maintaining the current levels of support for the PAS. Given the position that the MLA itself is in, that is a very powerful recognition of the importance of the PAS in the MLA&#146;s view, as indeed it is in the view of all of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="80122h0011.htm_para9"><a name="08012265000410">The MLA has now announced that it will review the PAS over the coming months to look at how best the programme&#146;s objectives&#151;they are what we are interested in&#151;can be delivered in the future and explore whether there are any potential synergies with the renaissance in the regions programme. We need to see whether that process can save some money and ensure that we can keep the scheme, as it operates on the ground at the front level, going. I think that that is good. I support the review&#151;we will see what it comes out with&#151;and I am extremely pleased that the British Museum has agreed to carry out this review in partnership with the MLA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="80122h0011.htm_para10"><a name="08012265000411">I am sure that all hon. Members will agree that the treasure system and the PAS are in rude good health. The Government believe that our policies of encouraging the voluntary reporting of archaeological finds, encouraging responsible metal detecting through a mixture of advice and inducement in the form of rewards and sanctions and penalties for irresponsible or inappropriate metal detecting strike the right balance between protecting our national heritage and allowing people&#146;s legitimate interest and passion for our past to continue to flourish.</p>
