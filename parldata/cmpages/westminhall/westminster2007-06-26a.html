 It is, as always, a huge pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley. I am extremely grateful to you, and particularly to the Speaker, for this opportunity to debate an issue that goes to the heart of what a modern Britain should look like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para1"><a name="07062658000009">The issue of social mobility, by which I mean the ability of children to advance relative to their parents, seems to have become more and more salient in recent months. We can hardly switch on the radio, watch the TV or read a newspaper without the issue being raised. I welcome that; it is a source of great hope for the future of our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para2"><a name="07062658000010">Ministers in this Government have long wanted an open society in which, as the Prime Minister put it all those years ago, people can advance as far as their talents can take them. As I shall argue in a moment or two, the progress made in recent years opens up the prospect of more mobility in future decades, which will follow decades during which there is little doubt that social mobility had slowed down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para3"><a name="07062658000011">Oddly enough, my optimism has been enhanced by the interest that Opposition parties have begun to take in the issue. For example, I read with interest the pamphlet on social mobility published by CentreForum, the Liberal Democrat think-tank. It argued a good case on what needed to be done. I noted with interest, too, what Members from the Conservative party such as the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) and the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) have said about social mobility; I leave aside the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), whose speech on grammar schools is famous&#151;or should I say infamous, at least as far as some Conservative Members are concerned.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="07062658000012"><a name="70626h0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="07062658000215"><b>John Bercow (Buckingham) (Con):</b>

 There might be a division of opinion on that point on the Conservative Benches. All those Conservative Members have argued that social mobility should be the cornerstone, if that is not too factional a word, for modern Conservative thinking inside the Conservative party. I welcome all that, and if we are genuinely about to forge a modern progressive consensus on the issue, that is also to be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para4"><a name="07062658000014">My purpose in holding this debate is to seek an agreed understanding of what has happened to social mobility in recent decades, of why that has happened and of what we need to do to get social mobility going again in our country. First, let us be clear about why social mobility matters. It matters for three fundamental  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="26 Jun 2007">

<notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2007 : Column 2WH</b><br>
reasons. First, if social mobility is stalled, disadvantage is entrenched; for me, that is a fundamental point. The desire to increase social mobility cannot be a substitute for the desire for a more equal society. In my view, it is no coincidence that countries such as Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia and even Japan are both the most socially fluid in the world and the most equal. That is why the Government&#146;s efforts to abolish child poverty are so crucial and why if other parties are serious about creating a society of open opportunity&#151;they say that they are&#151;they need to move beyond expressions of aspiration towards firm commitments that match the Government&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para5"><a name="07062658000015">Secondly, social mobility matters because our success in a globally competitive economy, which we now have, depends on unlocking the talents of all people, not only some of them. The most important resources of any company or country are no longer their access to raw materials or their geographical location but the skills of their people. In the 21st century, what is right on ethical grounds is also right on economic ones; a knowledge economy needs a mobile society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para6"><a name="07062658000016">The problem is this: technological change is skill-biased. Those with higher skills have seen the largest increases in pay and productivity since the late 1970s, while those with lower skills have found that technological change leads to reduced demand for their labour and lower average earnings, with all the consequences that that has for social cohesion. However, the truth is that we ain&#146;t seen nothing yet. If the recent Leitch report on skills is right, the demand for unskilled labour will fall still more dramatically in the years to come, leaving those without skills stranded economically and perhaps cut off socially from the mainstream, unless we can make social mobility take hold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para7"><a name="07062658000017">Thirdly, social mobility matters because when it slows down, it is not an issue only for those at the very bottom of society. It also matters to those whom President Clinton once famously called &#147;the forgotten middle class&#148;. If the aspirations that the overwhelming majority of hard-working families have for themselves, their children and their communities are thwarted, that undermines both social responsibility and individual endeavour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para8"><a name="07062658000018">A good society rests not only on shared values but on a sense of fair rules&#151;so that when people put something in, they feel that they get something back. As a child, I was certainly brought up to believe that effort got its own reward.</p>

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="07062658000019"><a name="70626h0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="07062658000217"><b>David Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 My right hon. Friend is making an important contribution. As I mentioned before the start of the debate, we have a common background. Given that 7 per cent. of young people in this country are educated independently and that about 25 per cent. of young people in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were brought up on council estates, would my right hon. Friend say that the make-up of Labour Cabinets in the past 10 years has been emblematic of the kind of social progress that he would like to see?</p>

reasonably disadvantaged council estate&#151;ending up in the Cabinet 20 years hence; I shall come to the reasons why in a moment. That is a matter of huge regret for our country and a matter of shame for a country as wealthy as ours. We have to be able to explain why that has happened; more importantly, we have to be able to do something about it. Education is critical to that, and I shall address that issue in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para9"><a name="07062658000021">There is a difference, in that I believe that the answer lies not in taking things away from people but in opening up opportunities to some people so that they are available to all. The truth is that good education is available to some people; a very good education is available to a small minority of people, because they can afford to pay for it. We have to make those opportunities&#151;and, dare I say it, those choices&#151;available according not to where people come from, their backgrounds or circumstances, but to their needs.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="07062658000022"><a name="70626h0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="07062658000219"><b>Bob Spink (Castle Point) (Con):</b>
 We are all grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for bringing this most important subject to the House. I am also grateful to him for his initial approach in recognising that the issue is not party political and that we need a consensus to deal with it; the problem is too important to play politics with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para10"><a name="07062658000023">The right hon. Gentleman has talked about various issues of social mobility, such as education and housing, and he will tackle those. Children&#146;s mobility is largely predicted by their parents&#146; circumstances. Will he tackle the issue of lone mothers, and the fact that when they try to go into work, they often lose more in benefits, tax and child care than they gain in wages? Reform of the benefits system would enable young lone parents to work; they could then set an example for their children and bring them up as they wanted. Would that help social mobility?</p>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="07062658000024"><a name="70626h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="07062658000220"><b>Mr. Milburn:</b>
 I agree, and I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention. When I hear the words &#147;lone parent&#148;, I always react slightly adversely&#151;partly because I was brought up by one. I have heard members of his party take a rather pejorative and even punitive attitude to lone mothers, and although he is not taking that attitude, my reaction to it is, as I have said, an adverse one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para11"><a name="07062658000025">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, and it is worth considering what has happened to lone-parent employment during the past few years. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) knows more than me, but it has dramatically increased&#151;by more than a third of a million, I believe. Nevertheless, there is a real issue, and work-life balance is very topical; it is not a chattering-class matter. It bites hardest at the bottom end; particularly for working lone parents, because in order to make ends meet they have to balance their caring responsibilities with sometimes one or two jobs. For them, it is not just the operation of the tax and benefits system, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, that is critical, but whether affordable child care is available. That is one of the keys that unlocks a more mobile society. There has been much progress, but there is a lot more to do.</p>

<notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2007 : Column 4WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para12"><a name="07062658000026">Before the hon. Gentleman intervened, I was talking about what I call the &#147;fairness code&#148; in British society, a code that I believe is very strong. When rules appear to be transgressed, which I suspect many feel to be true in the case of people who cheat the benefits system or who flout the immigration rules, the balance between rights and responsibilities seems to move too far towards rights and away from responsibilities. At that point, the incentive to work hard and play by the rules is undermined, which is why social mobility matters so fundamentally. When it is present, it provides a fair set of easily understood rules&#151;we might call them social incentives&#151;that earn rights through responsibilities and advancement through effort. When it is absent, incentives for individual progress are weakened, rules are transgressed, and people feel that fairness has been undermined. It is then that decent people ask, &#147;What is the point?&#148; Poverty of aspiration kicks in, and, which is worse, social resentment festers and grows, sometimes with ugly consequences in our politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para13"><a name="07062658000027">I should at this point declare an interest. I am the product of the most socially mobile generation that this country has ever seen, Mr. Illsley, as I suspect you might be also. I was lucky; I was born into a good family and a strong community, and into a society that was moving from rigidness to openness. The 1950s and 1960s saw Britain finally emerge from the aftershocks of the war years. There was the most appalling poverty and inequality, so no one should ever view those years as some sort of golden age, because they were not. Oddly enough, however, the fact that people had gone through that gruelling war and made such huge sacrifice meant that there was a shared national determination to win the peace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para14"><a name="07062658000028">That determination found its expression in the post-war Labour Government and in its truly towering achievements: universal education, a new welfare state, and full employment. Those achievements provided millions of people, particularly the young&#151;the post-war baby boom generation, with opportunities that had never been available before. They opened up the prospect of a more classless society. Indeed, Anthony Crosland spoke about that as a very realisable objective. In 1958, the year of my birth, Michael Young published his book, &#147;The Rise of the Meritocracy&#148;, precisely to warn against the downsides of a genuinely meritocratic society. If we are honest, that optimism now looks pretty misplaced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para15"><a name="07062658000029">The nature of inequality might have changed, but it is still present. In the decades since that time, birth, not worth, has become more and more a key determinant of life chances. The Cabinet Office report on social mobility that was published in 2001, which I commend to hon. Members, laid statistically bare what many of us had subjectively feared. It highlighted the fact that there had been steadily decreasing upward mobility of manual occupations toward higher status, professional and technical occupations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para16"><a name="07062658000030">It seems that, as prosperity spread to more people, there was a falling further behind of those without skills&#151;whether hard skills expressed in terms of qualifications, or softer, personal and communications skills that are so necessary to cash in on the opportunities that are available in a modern society such as ours.</p>

 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will deal later with the fact that education is the key. It is the single most important factor in determining income later in life, but income later in life is probably also the most important factor in determining the education of the children of high earners.</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="07062658000033"><a name="70626h0001.htm_spnew8"><a name="07062658000222"><b>Mr. Milburn:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right. To coin a phrase, there is direct correlation between &#147;the amount you learn and the amount you earn&#148;. I think that it was the academic, Michael Sheridan, who said that people rarely spend their way out of poverty. That is self-evident, and we have to give people the tools to &#147;enable&#148; them out of poverty. That means giving them opportunities through higher wages, tax credits and the like, but it also means dealing with the root causes of the problem, by providing education, a stake in society, and a feeling that they have some control in their lives&#151;a point to which I shall come in a moment. In a knowledge economy, education is among the most important of those factors as the motor of mobility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para17"><a name="07062658000034">More people have escaped adversity, but those still in adversity face a bigger gap in getting on the ladder to prosperity. That gap between those at the bottom end and the rest is reflected in recent work by Professor John Hills of the London School of Economics on housing and social mobility. He observes that, nowadays, social tenants are much more likely to be on low incomes and to be economically inactive than in previous decades, and certainly than in the period when I was growing up on a council estate that was pretty mixed in social background.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para18"><a name="07062658000035">Other academic research confirms that the economic status of the cohort of children born, as I was, in 1958, was far less dependent on the economic status of their parents than those born just 12 years later, in 1970. Between the two generations, economic mobility had fallen, so that it became increasingly likely that if someone was born disadvantaged, he or she would stay disadvantaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para19"><a name="07062658000036">Such evidence is sometimes wrongly cited, including, on occasions, by Opposition Members, to argue that social mobility has actually fallen under the present Government. That is a lazy assumption, and in my view a wrong one. It is also a dangerous one for Conservative Members to make. In fact, the 1970 generation was making the transition from childhood to adulthood during a period of Conservative Government, which happened to give Britain the two worst recessions it had ever seen, as well as, according to Professor Hill, a dramatic growth in income inequality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para20"><a name="07062658000037">In the past 10 years, that growth in inequality has slowly begun to be reversed. The very wealthiest have of course continued to get wealthier, but the bottom 20 per cent. have seen their incomes grow at a faster rate than the top 20 per cent. There has been an unrivalled period of economic growth, 2.5 million jobs have been created, and there are almost 2 million more home owners. New measures, such as the minimum wage, have helped to spread more prosperity to more people. The country has seen the biggest increases in public service investment, and the biggest decreases in child and pensioner poverty for decades.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is quite right about the social exclusion action plan. As he points out, there is a particular issue for people at the very bottom end of society, just as there is for people at the very top end. We can compare the top 1 per cent. and the bottom 1 per cent. if that is what he wants to do, but I was actually talking about the bottom and top 20 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para22"><a name="07062658000041">It is worth restating for the record that, unlike in the 1980s and 1990s, when child poverty was rising faster here than anywhere else in Europe and we ended up with the highest rates, we now have the fastest-decreasing rates in Europe. Huge progress has been made. The hon. Gentleman is right to point to a continuing gap, but we are making progress not just on incomes but on many other fronts.</p>

lessons from the Scandinavian countries, which have managed to use universal child care as a weapon to both tackle inequality and speed up social mobility. On each of those fronts, the progress of recent years has laid the foundation for increased social mobility in future years. Indeed, I noted with interest a publication yesterday by the Sutton Trust arguing that although social mobility remains too low compared with other countries, its decline over many decades has finally bottomed out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para25"><a name="07062658000046">Here I must be candid. The ossification of British society, which set in over many decades, will take more than one decade to unfreeze. It is true that the glass ceiling has been raised; it is equally true that we have not yet broken through it. Breaking the relationship between class origin and class destination is a battle for the long term and requires a holistic approach.</p>

That points us to the policy agenda that is needed: one that moves beyond the focus of the traditional welfare state on correcting the outcomes of market-driven inequalities such as low wages and family poverty retrospectively, and towards an approach that proactively reduces inequality and advances mobility by tackling the roots of the problems, not just dealing with their symptoms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para27"><a name="07062658000048">It is assumed by some, even in the House, that individual advance can come only through the state getting off the back of the individual citizen or local community. For others in the House a bigger role for the state is the answer. In fact, a mobile society requires two things: an active state and active citizens. Only the state can equalise opportunities throughout life and empower its citizens. Equally, only individual citizens can seize those opportunities and realise their aspirations to progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="70626h0001.htm_para28"><a name="07062658000049">Tackling inequality and speeding up social mobility have pervaded much of what Government Departments have done in the past decade, whether reforming benefits or building houses. I commend the new focus in the social exclusion action plan on families who suffer multiple deprivation and struggle to get a foothold on the ladder into mainstream society. Family policy in general, and those families in particular, are rightly a priority. With a new Prime Minister and a new Administration just around the corner, there is an opportunity to give the social mobility agenda renewed momentum and new prominence as the core purpose for the whole of Government. There is a strong case for consulting widely and then publishing a White Paper, an action plan on social mobility to parallel our action plan on social exclusion, to set out how the Government intend to get Britain moving socially in the next 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para0"><a name="07062658000050">I shall suggest what some of the key elements of such an holistic approach might be. The first is an economic policy that places renewed emphasis on high skills, not low wages, as the best route to full employment in every region and nation of Britain. The Government&#146;s record on jobs is second to none but, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  <br>

has rightly acknowledged, economic inactivity rates remain far too high. The ethnic minority employment rate gap, although closing, remains at 15 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para1"><a name="07062658000051">Of course, some people are unable to work&#151;those with a severe disability, for example. But in an economy with job vacancies and skills shortages, and when we are importing labour from abroad to deal with those problems, policy makers should not be shy of focusing on those in some of our communities who remain work-shy. We need both more carrots and more sticks to deal with that problem: a rising minimum wage, greater conditionality in the benefit system and a new accent on lifelong learning&#151;all will have a part to play. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para2"><a name="07062658000052">Lifelong learning is key. In the past ten years educational standards have risen and the number of adults without any qualifications has fallen, but my constituency is not alone in having far too many people who still lack any qualification. According to a recent report by Dr. Tony Chapman of Teesside university, results in local schools have risen sharply in recent years, but more than 20 per cent. of adults in Darlington still do not have any qualifications. Unsurprisingly, Darlington&#146;s core economic problem is no longer high unemployment, which has fallen by 50 per cent. since 1997 as new jobs, businesses and business parks have sprung up all over the town. The problem is low wages, linked to the quality of some of the jobs on offer. That, according to Dr. Chapman, limits social mobility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para3"><a name="07062658000053">That is not just a priority to address locally, although the ever enterprising Darlington partnership is working with the local council, colleges, schools and business to deal with it. It must be the core national economic priority. The generation of the late 1950s, of which I am part, were the beneficiaries of a mobility in society that came about because of a change in the economy: the advent of a more service-based economy and the greater professionalisation of jobs, which created what the academics call &#147;more room at the top.&#148; Likewise, today&#146;s generation can potentially benefit from an even more fundamental change towards a more skilled, less unskilled economy that will once again create new room at the top. Realising that potential means recognising that while economic stability is fundamental, knowledge holds the key to Britain&#146;s future both economically and socially.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para4"><a name="07062658000054">Secondly, as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) said a moment ago, a knowledge economy means that education will become ever more significant in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para5"><a name="07062658000055">Despite the good progress of recent years, if we are honest, the attainment gap remains far too wide. A child who is not on free school meals is twice as likely to get five good GCSEs than a child who is. Just over one third of black Afro-Caribbean boys get five good GCSEs when the national average is two thirds, which some believe is because, in some way, intelligence is unevenly distributed in our society. I have never believed that or that ability is unevenly distributed in society. I have always believed that it is opportunity and, in the end, power that is unevenly distributed. I applaud the Government&#146;s efforts to break the cycle of educational disadvantage and welcome city academies and trust schools, personalised learning for better discipline, a focus on early-years development, and the new focus on the so-called softer social skills, all of which will make a difference. However, I also believe  <br>

that we need to do more to ensure that good schools are just as accessible to poorer parents as to those who are better off. The truth is that the wealthier someone is; the more choice they get. We can see that happening in our education system. Selection by academic ability may have largely gone, with the exception of a few grammar schools and the independent schools, to which my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire referred. However, selection by social position still lingers in our school system.</p>

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way; this is not a grunt, but an intervention. A paraphrase of what he said is that the influence of independent education has almost gone. I cannot for a moment think that he really believes that. If he looks at the various levers that influence the direction and pace of our society and economy, he will find that they are disproportionately in the hands of the 7 per cent. of people who have been independently educated. Does he not agree that even in 2007 the influence of private education is widely pernicious and divisive? It may have lessened a little, but certainly not to the extent that he suggests.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right in the sense that people who have a private education&#151;in his country we rather bizarrely call it a public education, which confuses people from abroad&#151;have certain advantages. My point is that, by in large, for the 93 per cent. of children who go to state school, selection has disappeared. That is a good thing. However, the truth is that there is a different and more covert form of selection because if someone is wealthy, they can opt out of the system or buy extra tuition. Alternatively, people can use an indirect market mechanism, such as buying a home near a good school. I am not saying that those are bad things. My point is that if choice is available to some, it should be available to all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para6"><a name="07062658000058">If affluence still buys attainment in our school system, that inevitably restricts mobility. For some, the answer lies in more academic selection and a return to grammar schools, but there is precious little evidence that the selection of pupils by schools does anything to close the attainment gap. The evidence from countries as diverse as Denmark, Sweden and the United States points in a different direction: it does not help if schools select pupils; it is parents being able to choose schools that raises standards generally and helps disadvantaged children particularly. That is why I believe that parents with children in badly performing schools, which are invariably in the poorest areas, should be given a new right to choose an alternative state school. I propose that such parents should be able to choose what I have called an education credit, which would be worth perhaps 150 per cent. of the cost of educating the child in their current school. That would give a positive incentive to the alternative school&#151;the better one&#151;to the take the child and expand the intake numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para7"><a name="07062658000059">I know that whenever such proposals are floated, there are sometimes legitimate concerns and objections, but it is simply not right that we should tolerate so many disadvantaged children still being let down by the schools system. Correcting that injustice means shifting the balance of power to put more choice in the hands of those parents that the system currently disempowers.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend accept that we have identifiable areas of extreme deprivation and poverty in all our towns and cities, which is where poor schools are located? The issue is one of poverty of aspiration&#151;primarily of teachers, but also of parents. Although I understand why he has made the comments that he has, are we not surrendering to that poverty of aspiration by saying, &#147;Well, let people move out&#148;? Is it not time to root out the desperate lack of aspiration for children in the teaching profession?</p>

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="07062658000061"><a name="70626h0002.htm_spnew3"><a name="07062658000230"><b>Mr. Milburn:</b>
 There is sometimes a poverty of aspiration, but we must try to understand what that is and how it has arisen. I think that it has arisen because of a sense of disempowerment in the system. The truth is, if someone is poor, they do not have much power. If someone lives in a poor community, they feel that the world is against them and actually it often is. The school and police system does not seem to work for such people; they bang on the door and are not heard and we must address that. I am not saying that education standards, systems of inspection or rooting out bad teachers does not have a part to play. I believe that it does. Getting the organisational autonomy of the school right has a huge part to play, which is why, like my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, I welcome the city academies and trust schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para8"><a name="07062658000062">In the end, we must find a way to change the accountability of the system and to give more power to parents who feel that they have no power in the system. Conversely, if someone is better off, they feel that they do have some power because they can exercise some leverage and control in their lives. That is a good thing, not a bad thing. Power should not be taken away from people, but should be given to more people, which is why, in my view, my proposal has merit as an addition to and not a substitute for all the other things that are being done to tackle precisely the issue to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para9"><a name="07062658000063">My third point is that if we think that it is only wealth that is unevenly distributed in society, social mobility will not advance. That is not the case; it is also a matter of power. If Britain is to get moving again socially, people need to be able to get not just a job, training or child care, but to enjoy greater control and have a bigger say in how they run their lives. Of course, beating crime, creating jobs and regenerating estates can all help, but in my experience the cloud of despondency that hangs over some of the poorest communities will only ever be dispelled if we allow individual citizens and local communities to share more directly and evenly in how those communities are run. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has properly recognised that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para10"><a name="07062658000064">That is why I argue for a new principle at the heart of our governance, for which David Marquand and others have also argued. The principle is one of subsidiarity, where power is located at the lowest possible level consistent with the wider public good. If it is possible for people to exercise power individually&#151;people can do so by choosing a hospital or school that is right for them&#151;that is where power should be located. When it is not possible for people to exercise power individually&#151;for example most of us would have some  <br>

difficulty in choosing our own police officer&#151;power should be located at the next possible level, which is in the local community. Where services are failing, communities should have the legal right to have them replaced; where communities can run their own services&#151;whether children&#146;s centres, housing estates and local parks&#151;they should be helped to do so. The community should be given a bigger say over other services, most notably local police and health services, by making them subject to direct election at the ballot box.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para11"><a name="07062658000065">The thing that I learned most during my time in government was that government can do much, but there are limits. Doing things to people does not really work; it is doing things with them that is the key&#151;whether that is improving health, fighting crime or regenerating communities. We must move from a top-down to a bottom-up approach towards governance and give citizens and communities far more of a stake in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para12"><a name="07062658000066">That brings me to the final area of policy that I believe can make the biggest contribution to social mobility&#151;giving individuals and families a stake in the future by establishing Britain as a democratic, asset-owning democracy. There is compelling evidence that financial asset-holding improves individual and social outcomes over and above factors such as educational attainment. Certainly, the evidence from the national child development study of a cohort of children born in 1958&#151;incidentally, that seems to have been a good year for surveys&#151;demonstrates a positive link between asset-holding at the age of 23 and welfare outcomes later in life. Those with assets tended to spend less time unemployed and enjoy better health. There is similar evidence from the United States where, for example, home owners are more active in local politics and neighbourhood organisations than non-home owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para13"><a name="07062658000067">Ownership works. Larry Summers once famously observed that no one ever washed a rental car. He was right. It is ownership that encourages people to act responsibly and behave independently. Spreading asset ownership is crucial, therefore, to tackling inequality and speeding social mobility. The most substantial inequity in a modern society such as our own is no longer between income groups, but between those who have a pension, and own shares or a house and those who rely purely on benefits and wages. That is why I favour employee share ownership, which I want us to do much more to encourage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para14"><a name="07062658000068">That is also why I want us to do much more to encourage home ownership, where, as the Chancellor said to the Labour conference on Sunday, there is a need for urgent action. Changes in the housing market threaten to make inequality wider and further impede social mobility. We can see that in London where a child of home-owning parents stands to inherit an asset worth an average of &#163;330,000. A class mate whose family rents stands to inherit nothing. The housing market, therefore, threatens to impede social mobility, rather than enhance it. Of course, in recent decades, home ownership has grown sharply and the Government have ambitious plans to expand it further. However, escalating house prices mean that getting on to the housing ladder is becoming more difficult, which  <br>

is not an issue for London and the south-east only; it is an issue in virtually every constituency in every part of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para15"><a name="07062658000069">The Government are right, therefore, to address the issue of housing supply&#151;we need to build more housing and social housing. That is a priority. However, as two recent reports by the Department of Communities and Local Government suggest, given a choice, most people would prefer to buy, not rent. Well over 1.5 million social tenants still aspire to home ownership and although it is welcome that 80,000 households have been helped to do so through Government shared ownership schemes, again much more needs to be done. With fewer people able to afford to buy outright, more first-time buyers and young families are dependent on parents for financial help and with just five per cent. of tenants given the opportunity to buy through the Government&#146;s &#147;Social HomeBuy&#148; scheme, further reforms are needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para16"><a name="07062658000070">The Government and the new Prime Minister, of course, will want to consider what reforms are necessary, but these are my suggestions: first, remove the minimum share a tenant is expected to take in their home from 25 per cent. to something far more affordable, such as five per cent. in order to get them on the first rung of the housing ladder. Secondly, we should ensure that every social tenant&#151;not just some&#151;has a right to own a share in their own property. Thirdly, we should ensure that the geographical distribution of resources under Government low-cost home ownership programmes is targeted properly to the regions with the lowest owner-occupier levels, including London and my own region, the north-east, which, incidentally, needs its fair share.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para17"><a name="07062658000071">Fourthly, we must develop new ways of helping people on to the housing ladder. In addition to shared equity schemes, which the Government are doing a lot about, we should at least explore community land trusts, mutual housing and developer-led co-housing schemes, which have shown remarkable success in other parts of the world. Fifthly, we should work with mortgage lenders to promote more flexible forms of borrowing, which in the United States, at least, have helped millions more from low and middle-income families into home ownership. In a country as wealthy as our own&#151;we are now the fourth richest on the planet&#151;making ours a genuinely fair shares society is a realisable ambition, because we have a high and growing proportion of people owning homes and shares, and so owning a real stake in the future of our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="70626h0002.htm_para18"><a name="07062658000072">Those are some of the steps that we need to take towards a genuinely socially mobile Britain. They are all about levelling-up, not levelling-down and not just beating poverty, but unleashing aspiration, and they all require, not less of a role for the state, as some mistakenly believe is what the modern world demands, but a different sort of state&#151;one that empowers rather than controls. In my view, the changes that this Government have made in the last decade have laid the foundations for a Britain in which prosperity and opportunity are shared widely. However, unlocking our country so that it is open to aspiration and effort requires a new drive to change fundamentally the distribution of power in our society. I believe that we have made good progress in the last 10 years; I hope that we can make even more in the next 10.</p>

People often say that mobility has stagnated and that it has not got any better, but as I pointed out, and as the Sutton trust report yesterday pointed out, to measure whether social mobility is advancing or retreating takes many decades. What we must do, which is what I was trying to do in my speech, is to look at the factors most likely to give rise to social mobility.

It has been influenced by previous Governments. The right hon. Member for Darlington eloquently described his childhood. I remember growing up and the damaging social impact of many of the policies that were pursued in the 1980s and early 1990s. In many cases, the effect was felt no more harshly than in parts of Scotland and, indeed, remote rural parts of Scotland. The right hon. Gentleman represents an urban constituency and, perhaps quite naturally, did not dwell on the problems of social mobility in rural areas. In some cases, the problems are different, but they are just as great, if not sometimes greater, than in urban areas. He discussed difficulties in accessing services. It may be easier to provide services in cities and towns such as his. It can sometimes be very difficult to provide them in rural areas, which is something that often gets lost in the  <br>

debate. In fact, it sometimes gets lost in the Government&#146;s approach to these policy areas. We must not forget the rural dimension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para1"><a name="07062658000086">We must also consider inequality. There is an equation between rising inequality and falling social mobility. Anyone who has studied the work of Professor Richard Wilkinson will know that there is a huge amount of evidence dealing with different aspects of life that countries that are more unequal tend to have a greater degree of social differentiation and a wider range of barriers that people must overcome. Indeed, differences in concentration of power occur not just between the top and the bottom&#151;there is a much finer degree of gradation right through the social scale. The evidence suggests that, the more unequal the society is, the more competition there is for small advances in position. They take precedence over the larger improvement in position that we are discussing in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para2"><a name="07062658000087">The larger gap between the richer and poorer in the UK is one of the factors in making it harder to move from one income group to another. The right hon. Gentleman made a point about incomes, but we must also consider the role of tax. It is a shameful fact that, in the UK today, the poorest 20 per cent. of people pay a greater share of their income in tax than the richest 20 per cent do. He said that the debate is not about taking away from one group to give to another but, if we are considering the state&#146;s role in enhancing the position of those at the bottom and assisting them, the tax system is important, nowhere more so than in the recent debate about the taxation of wealth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para3"><a name="07062658000088">The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells mentioned the social exclusion taskforce report. It showed that incomes for the poorest 2.5 per cent. of the population have actually fallen. Incomes may have risen among all the other groups, but for the poorest 2.5 per cent.&#151;the most deprived 2.5 per cent.&#151;they have fallen. That important fact partly explains why the measures of inequality&#151;the Gini coefficient, to those who are in the know&#151;show that income inequality in 2005-06 reached its highest level since 2001-02. Statistically, it is significantly higher than it was when this Government came to power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para4"><a name="07062658000089">There are two areas of policy that I wish briefly to dwell on in response to the huge range of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution. The first is in relation to work. As he said, it is critical that we direct our work and welfare policy to the objective of getting people into work, but it is also important to help people progress in work, and to move on and up&#151;especially those groups that are most disadvantaged in employment. I refer particularly to disabled people and lone parents&#151;I agreed with his comments about how that group is sometimes discussed pejoratively; none the less, it is a critically important group in the context of employment&#151;but also workless households. At the bottom level of households, there is an increasing number of two-parent households in which neither parent is in work. That creates an intergenerational phenomenon that entrenches the lack of ability that he described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para5"><a name="07062658000090">The right hon. Gentleman referred to the tax credit system. There is no doubt that it has played a role despite all the administrative problems, which are  <br>

beyond the scope of this debate. It clearly played a role in helping to make work pay, to use the Government&#146;s slogan, but, equally, the high withdrawal rates that then kick in have hindered the ability of people to move on in work, in some cases. There is some evidence to suggest that a withdrawal rate combined with a tax and benefits system of 70 or 80 per cent. is a disincentive. That is something that must be considered in the context of work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para6"><a name="07062658000091">There is also some indication&#151;for example, as provided by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation&#151;that work-related policies help to get people into work, but those entries are not necessarily permanent. Therefore, the exits from poverty that they create are not necessarily permanent, either. People may be moving back and forth across the poverty line in a way that is not actually helping to create the social mobility that the right hon. Gentleman and I want. Job retention and progression are critical to ensuring that employment leads to genuine progression up the social ladder and to real mobility, rather than to people continually moving above and below the poverty line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para7"><a name="07062658000092">It is most important that the intergenerational issues are tackled. It is not an individual&#146;s abilities or skills that determine their educational attainment and future earning potential. Sadly, in this country at present, it is their parents&#146; life circumstances. Improving educational outcomes and the aspirations of children and young people are the most important factors in breaking the intergenerational cycles of poverty that are the defining feature of the lack of social mobility that the right hon. Gentleman described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para8"><a name="07062658000093">In that context, I place a great deal of emphasis on the early years. There is evidence that educational disadvantages emerge very early in life. For example, the millennium cohort study by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the Institute of Education published a report earlier this month that revealed that children from disadvantaged families are already lagging a full year behind their middle-class counterparts in social and educational development by the age of three.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para9"><a name="07062658000094">Early years education must be a top priority, and that should be reflected in spending decisions. It is interesting to note that some of the Government&#146;s investment&#151;for example, in Sure Start&#151;has not always reached the groups that are hardest to help. I think of disabled children, for example. It is not always easy for a low-income family to take up entitlements such as 12 and a half hours of pre-school education a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para10"><a name="07062658000095">With regard to the pupil premium, the Nordic countries are much more effective at allocating resources to schools&#151;to the most deprived areas and to the most deprived pupils&#151;whereas in the UK and certainly in England and Wales, the existing methods for distributing deprivation-related funding are opaque and inconsistent. That is why Liberal Democrat Members have proposed a pupil premium that would attach additional funding directly to pupils who are identified as disadvantaged, which would follow them through the primary and secondary education system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para11"><a name="07062658000096">It is important to say that the impact of disadvantage on a child&#146;s life can be seen even before school age&#151;almost from birth, sometimes. That is why we need to focus not just on policies throughout the education system. There was a bit of a debate earlier about the private education system. By the time that a  <br>

child is ready to attend a secondary school in my constituency or, for that matter, Eton, the advantage or disadvantage of their family circumstances has already had an impact. We need to consider how we can ensure that at the ages of one, two, three and four, we are helping children to beat their circumstances; we must not wait until secondary school age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para12"><a name="07062658000097">I have taken up a great deal of time, but there is a great deal more to say. I hope that there will be a future opportunity to do so, because I hope that the debate will continue, that there will be discussions between parties and that the Government will take up the idea of the action plan for social mobility that the right hon. Member for Darlington described.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley, and to participate in a hugely important debate. The House owes a great debt of gratitude to the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) for initiating it and not least for his brilliant speech. He counts as one of the dwindling number of true progressives in his party today. I say that advisedly, because to be progressive is not just to aspire to progress and to look for improvement, but to be prepared to tackle some received nostrums that may be difficult and to break out of those. That is the mark of a progressive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para13"><a name="07062658000099">Some of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks may have proved uncomfortable for some of his colleagues&#151;from some of the grunting that we heard earlier, I think that that might be the case&#151;but that is necessary in all parties if we are to tackle deep-seated problems that have defeated us in the past. Sometimes, hearing such remarks is uncomfortable, so the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s willingness to address the issues rigorously and clear-sightedly is to his credit and is certainly welcomed by Opposition Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para14"><a name="07062658000100">The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion of an action plan on social mobility is excellent. I hope that, as he suggests, that can be a cross-party endeavour. The particular suggestions that he made as part of that are radical. When it comes to school choice, my party is absolutely behind him on that. It is essential that parents and pupils are given the ability to act on their aspirations. It is not true that, as the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) said, the level of aspiration is so shot to pieces in our society that there would be no takers for that school choice. We need only look at the proportion of parents who, on behalf of their children, appeal against school admissions decisions, even in our most deprived communities, to see that there is a great pent-up demand and great frustration that that enthusiasm cannot find an outlet in terms of the school that the people want, so we should not patronise parents in any of our communities by suggesting that they are not able to exercise choice on behalf of their children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para15"><a name="07062658000101">The remarks by the right hon. Member for Darlington on subsidiarity will, as he would expect, strike a chord with Conservative Members. We have proposed a radical approach to policing, which is one of the areas that he rightly suggests cannot be left to individual choice in the way that the choice of school can be put in the hands of parents and pupils.

that our proposal for elected police commissioners is a step in exactly the direction that the right hon. Gentleman recommends. If he does share our goal, as his speech seemed to suggest, I am sure that my right hon. and hon. Friends, in progressing our policy and fine-tuning it, would benefit from his suggestions and advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para16"><a name="07062658000102">The right hon. Gentleman also spoke in favour of the importance of asset ownership. &#147;Ownership works&#148; was his phrase, and what he said is absolutely the case. It must be one of the imperatives that across all parties we should work to implement over the next few years. The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s ideas are very substantial contributions to the debate, and the House should be grateful to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para17"><a name="07062658000103">I am not sure that I share entirely the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s more sanguine view that things may be a bit better in the future than they have been in recent years. Certainly I think that we have some way to go to achieve the ambition that his own party&#146;s Commission on Social Justice recommended just 13 years ago. In its final report, it recommended that we</p>
<a name="70626h0003.htm_brev0"><a name="07062658000199"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;transform the welfare state from a safety net...to a springboard for economic opportunity&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para18"><a name="07062658000104">That is a noble ambition, but for too many people it has not happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para19"><a name="07062658000105">Let us take just one area of social opportunity or social mobility&#151;income. First, it would be churlish to deny that there has been some progress, especially at the middle levels of poverty. I am referring to the people around the Government&#146;s preferred definition of poverty&#151;60 per cent. of the median. A lot of people have been moved from just below that poverty line to just above it, and I do not in any way underestimate the importance of that for the lives of those people. However, as we have discussed, at the same time as there have been decreases in poverty measured at that level, there has been, over the past 10 years, an increase in the number of people whose income is less than 40 per cent. of the median&#151;an increase in the number of people in severe poverty. That is a shocking statistic, a shocking finding to discover, and it suggests that the springboard to economic opportunity is at least leaving those people behind.</p>

 Will the hon. Gentleman recognise that the effect of labour mobility in Europe, which we all welcome, has been to bring into the UK highly able workers and that, to a certain extent, that has displaced some of the least skilled in society, so we need to focus ever more on those least well-off?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that a number of pressures are making things more difficult for people without skills. The right hon. Member for Darlington mentioned the fact that there will not be the same number of jobs available for people without skills; he mentioned the number in his own constituency. A number of causes result in the pressure on people at the bottom end, which must be our priority.</p>

is falling. The issue is not just the bottom 10 per cent., although last year their income fell from an average of &#163;91 a week to &#163;89 a week&#151;a 2.2 per cent. fall. With regard to income deciles, last year the incomes of people in the bottom 30 per cent. of income groups were falling in real terms. I cited, to some controversy, Polly Toynbee&#146;s image of society as a caravan train moving through the desert. We are finding that the people at the back of the caravan train are becoming detached from the mainstream.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para21"><a name="07062658000109">We cannot accept that situation; we need to do something about it. It is the very opposite of social mobility&#151;it is social mobility in the wrong direction&#151;yet the Government refuse to recognise the central importance of that. They persist with the measure of poverty on which their policy is focused: the 60 per cent. level. They refuse even to publish statistics for poverty at the 40 per cent. level, which I think is very important to inform the debate. Save the Children has not recommended that that should replace the 60 per cent. child poverty target, which Opposition Members share, but we do need a more nuanced approach to the issue than the Government seem willing to take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para22"><a name="07062658000110">The right hon. Member for Darlington was right to quote Professor Amartya Sen, who says that merely correcting family income after the event through transfers of cash will never solve the problems that result in that poverty in the first place. He is wise to draw our attention to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="70626h0003.htm_para23"><a name="07062658000111">As all hon. Members have mentioned, education is clearly a motor for social mobility. In some ways, I share a background with the right hon. Gentleman, because he went to a comprehensive school in Stokesley and I went to one in South Bank. There was probably 10 miles between them, although I went to school 10 years later than he did. Stokesley is in a much more affluent area than South Bank, and that should not make a difference, but the sad fact is that it does. One thing that we know from recent studies is that the chances of attending university are very much determined by the affluence of the area in which one&#146;s school is found. Since the 1980s, for example, the richest fifth of the population has increased its participation in university education from 9 per cent. to 46 per cent., which is a fantastic increase, but the poorest fifth of the population has increased its participation from 6 per cent. to only 9 per cent.&#151;a pathetic increase. Therefore, 90 per cent. of children from the poorest 20 per cent. of our homes do not go to university, and we must address that.</p>

Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey said, the further back we go from university, the more entrenched educational disadvantage becomes. What happens in the education system before the age of 10 is twice as significant as what happens afterwards, according to Blandon, Gregg and Machin. Indeed, I have seen that for myself in my own constituency. I was shocked when I spent a day in one of my local schools observing the behaviour of children in the reception class. If I saw a child who seemed to be sluggish and who was not responding terribly well to the tuition, I would say to the teacher, &#147;Tell me a bit about that child.&#148; Nine times out of 10, the teacher would say, &#147;Oh well, you should understand the child&#146;s  <br>

home life&#148; and add that the family had real problems with drug addiction or alcohol abuse. I would then see a child who seemed to be bright, lively and alert and who was responding to the tuition, and I would say, &#147;Tell me a bit about that child.&#148; The teachers would say, &#147;Oh well, his mother and father work in the local hospital. They come from a professional background.&#148; I was shocked by that determinism and by the way in which the professional background of a four or five-year-old&#146;s family determined, in a way that was already visible to a complete layman, that child&#146;s ability to progress in education. We must do something about the early years because, as Professor Feinstein has noted, poor children who display high ability at 22 and 40 months are overtaken by children from affluent backgrounds by the age of six, which shows how important the early years are.</p>

<p><a name="st_28"><a name="07062658000113"><a name="70626h0003.htm_spnew3"><a name="07062658000241"><b>Mr. Milburn:</b>
 I am very taken by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks about the sad inevitability with which children who are born into poverty will stay in poverty. Does he agree, however, that the eradication of child poverty is one of the vital stepping stones on the way towards a more socially mobile society and breaking the cycle of disadvantage and inevitability? Will he clarify his party&#146;s position on that? I noted with interest that, in a debate in this Chamber on 6 March, the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller), who is the shadow Minister with responsibility for family welfare, said that the Conservative party viewed the realisation of the child poverty target as an &#147;aspiration&#148; rather than a firm commitment. If the hon. Gentleman and his party are as serious as they say they are about eradicating child poverty, will they now commit themselves to what the Government are already committed to?</p>

 My party has made its position absolutely clear. The chairman of our policy review, the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), has said in terms that we are committed to the goal of abolishing child poverty, as defined in the Government&#146;s way. However, we want to extend that definition and to look at aspects of social exclusion that are not covered, such as poverty at the 40 per cent. level. The right hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that these issues are multifaceted, and poverty solutions are a question not just of financial transfers, but of getting under the skin of the problems, whether by helping with the early years or bringing in effective voluntary organisations, which have a fantastic record on helping to cure some of the problems that put people into poverty. Financial poverty is often as much a symptom of other aspects of social exclusion as a cause&#151;it works both ways. If I am critical of the Government, it is because they are inclined to think of poverty exclusively in financial terms&#151;at least when it comes to the target&#151;and we need to take a more multifaceted view.</p>

In my experience, no one chooses to be poor. People want to help themselves and they are as keen to help themselves progress as they are to help their families progress. However, when 1.7 million people are facing withdrawal rates of between 60 and 70 per cent.&#151;the figure has gone up from 760,000 since 1997 and will increase again as a result of last year&#146;s Budget&#151;we are not providing the necessary incentives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para0"><a name="07062658000116">What do we need to do? I suggest that four principles should be part of an approach to curing and reversing the decline in social mobility. First, we must help to equip people with the ability to help themselves. Let us not tie people up in the benefits system and withdrawal rates, with disincentives to work and prosper. Let us get rid of some of the complexity of benefits, which are a great disincentive to people trying out different ways of getting back into the labour market. For example, people might fear that their housing benefit will be withdrawn, and the fuss of reapplying for it makes looking for work not worth while.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para1"><a name="07062658000117">Let us recognise that money is not the only dimension of poverty and that people who become trapped in poverty, particularly severe poverty, face multiple aspects of social deprivation, which need sensitive handling and which are not all susceptible to the cure of financial transfers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para2"><a name="07062658000118">Let us look not just to the state, but to local communities, in the way that the right hon. Gentleman suggested. Let us apply the subsidiarity principle and bring in local charities and voluntary groups, which often have a personalised approach that it is difficult for the state to recognise. I was disturbed to read that the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband), who has responsibility for the third sector, had given an assurance to Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, that voluntary organisations would be limited to the role of supporting the state and would not be able to substitute for it. In some cases, it is appropriate for voluntary organisations to substitute in the delivery of a service if they are better placed to do so. It constrains our ability to tackle social exclusion if we artificially constrain the sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para3"><a name="07062658000119">Finally, I entirely endorse what the right hon. Gentleman said about assets. It must be part of our agenda to allow people to build up a buffer of savings and financial assets to protect them through the ups and downs that we all face in our lives. They must also be able to build up assets that are substantial enough to allow them to own their own homes and to be prosperous not only in work, but in retirement. We need to address that.</p>

Gentleman made some very practical suggestions in that regard, to which I hope that the Minister will able to respond positively. More importantly, I hope that the new Prime Minister will be able to respond positively, so perhaps the right hon.

 I begin by congratulating my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) on his robust speech, which was designed to provoke and to bring about change and action. I have had the benefit of reading the speeches that he has been making for a couple of years now, including the  <br>

Deborah Leon memorial lecture of November 2003 and last month&#146;s 2020 vision for British Government lecture at the university of Durham, and I should say how impressed I was with his account of Government policy failure in Benwell in west Newcastle. There is a lot to be learned from having stable, long-term policies. There was a lot of substance in my right hon. Friend&#146;s speech. He has never been accused of spin, but I note that the &#147;Today&#148; programme is running a series of features on social mobility this week, and I am sure that it is coincidental that only yesterday the Sutton Trust produced its report on social immobility in schools, and the failure of schools, which has been discussed, to tackle the greatest disadvantage. His speech had substance, was timely and topical, and was designed to encourage wider debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para5"><a name="07062658000122">I confess that I am here in a jobbing role today. My colleagues in Government with responsibility for the matters in question have shown their own mobility. I apologise for that, but it gives me an opportunity&#151;not to talk about the detail of policy, but to pick up some of the wider issues. I want to say from the outset that I am a child of the same times as my right hon. Friend. I, too, come from a family with strengths and weaknesses. We lived on a council estate. I was the first person in my family to get a degree and the first to have a professional career; it has gone downhill since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para6"><a name="07062658000123">My right hon. Friend was right to stress the post-war achievements of the Labour Government&#151;universal health provision, full employment, the welfare state and full-time education until the age of 15. That period broke down the social class system, there was greater consumer choice and there were opportunities for people to go further. As he said, the children of the &#146;70s have suffered. One suggestion to come out of the recent report was that that decline has now finished: that we have levelled up and could go forward. Of course, the Government have things to be proud of, such as the fact that 600,000 children have been taken out of poverty, and 1 million pensioner households have been taken out of relative poverty. More people than ever are in work. We have already discussed the point about the incomes of the 20 per cent. of people on the lowest income rising faster than those in the top 20 per cent. The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) was right to counsel that studying the lowest percentage group reveals problems; that is why the social exclusion task force has been commissioned to study the problem and make proposals for change. We need to be honest; meeting our child poverty targets will not be easy. Taking people out of energy poverty when energy prices are going up is quite challenging. I am struck by Government&#146;s willingness these days to acknowledge the problem, and not to try to spin it away, but to present new proposals to deal with the change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para7"><a name="07062658000124">I want to focus on four aspects of the matter raised by my right hon. Friend. The first is the importance of employment in tackling social mobility. Unemployment in May 1997 was 1.6 million and today it is 890,000&#151;a 45 per cent. reduction. In Darlington, unemployment has been reduced by 52 per cent. In my constituency of Sherwood it has halved. In Tunbridge Wells, it is down by 56 per cent. However, it is important, as has been stressed in the debate, to focus on groups of people who are presently unemployed. We have talked about the  <br>

needs of black and Asian people. We need to consider the kind of work that they are undertaking, its value and the pay that they receive. We also need to pay attention, as has been said, to the people who are not in work, and the number on incapacity benefit. We must show real determination to lift 1 million people from incapacity benefit and back into work. We need to work on the pathfinder model. It is expensive, but in the long term, if we are successful, savings can be made down the line. I want to reinforce the old Beveridge tradition, which has been a strand in the debate: work for those who can, security for those who cannot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para8"><a name="07062658000125">My right hon. Friend also talked about the big skills agenda. We live in a global world. As the Leitch report says, unless we skill and reskill, we shall be economically disadvantaged. I find it astonishing that there is a variable pattern in the creation of new businesses across the country. In Wokingham, there are four times more new business start-ups than in Worksop in the Nottinghamshire coalfield. One of the things that we must do is encourage entrepreneurial behaviour, whether in business or in the wider social setting&#151;a point already made by my right hon. Friend. We must persuade ordinary working-class people to have wider perspectives and higher aspirations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para9"><a name="07062658000126">To come to the second issue that my right hon. Friend raised, we have all talked about the value of early years education. All three and four-year-olds who want a nursery place have one. The Sure Start scheme is a flagship project, and there will be a children&#146;s centre in every community. As well as providing universal services Sure Start needs to ensure that those who are most disadvantaged will benefit from those services. That will take subtlety and skill. We can take things further with nurse family partnerships and the incredible years programme. We need to focus on children and their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para10"><a name="07062658000127">Thirdly, we need to make sure that people really have the assets that my right hon. Friend has talked about. I know that there are problems with child trust funds, or baby bonds, as they are called, but they are a vehicle&#151;an example of investing in young people&#151;that will provide long-term solutions. It is also important to provide  <br>

decent housing for all. It cannot be right that young entrants are dependent on help from their parents to acquire property. We need to build more houses. We need to be clear, as the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells knows, about where we should build those houses; and we need to build the right kind of houses, which will meet people&#146;s needs. They need to be smaller, more sustainable houses, near urban centres, not big, ranch-style houses in the countryside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para11"><a name="07062658000128">Fourthly, we need to transfer power. I am struck, as I go round the country, by the fact that people know the problems in their community, and often know the solutions, too. We should listen to those people and trust them. That requires a radical devolution of resources and decision-making. Like my right hon. Friend, I have closely studied what the Chancellor, the next Prime Minister, is saying about those issues. It must be right that people in Darlington can provide different services from those provided in, say, Devizes; and that those in Nottingham can provide different ones from those in Newcastle. We must trust people, consider grass roots experience, identify and develop good practice, and give public services back to local people. Public services will survive only if they are owned by local people. That is a big challenge and we should take it forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para12"><a name="07062658000129">There are tests for the Conservative Opposition in what I have said. There has been consensus in the debate, but there are tests, too. The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells needs to commit himself to full employment, flexible policies for families, universal child care and its costs, and education for all rather than selection for a few in grammar schools&#151;looking to the future, not the past. The debate has provided a platform for further discussion of the issue of an action plan on social mobility. I cannot promise it, but at least it is on the agenda. This discussion is about not just policies and priorities, but politics. People from the coalfield communities that I represent have always aspired to better for their children and grandchildren. It is a universal sentiment. We must be ambitious and aspirational. Politics, for all parties, will survive only if we are in a position to promise for the future, not look to the past, and to present policies for the many, not the few.</p>

<a name="time_4"><a name="70626h0004.htm_time1"><a name="07062658000212"><h5 align="left">11 am</h5>
<p><a name="st_31"><a name="07062658000131"><a name="70626h0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="07062658000244"><b>Mr. Andrew Tyrie (Chichester) (Con):</b>
 I shall give the Minister a second to settle in. I gather that he has just got back from Washington, so I am very grateful that he is here. I am not a human rights expert or a lawyer; I am a libertarian, and that is where my interest in this subject stems from. When I first got into Parliament, a decade ago, it never crossed my mind that I would ask for a debate on this issue, but then it never crossed my mind that Britain&#146;s leading ally, probably with the complicity of many western powers, including, perhaps, Britain, would develop a global programme of kidnap and torture. If someone had told me in 1997 that within a few years the United States would be arranging the torture of people and imprisoning large numbers of them in an illegal, offshore black hole for years on end, I simply would not have believed them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para13"><a name="07062658000132">It was Guantánamo that first led me to look into rendition. As a consequence of tabling many parliamentary questions to try to establish the limit of Britain&#146;s involvement in Guantánamo, the practice of extraordinary rendition was brought to my attention&#151;first, as a consequence of some remarks made to me by a high-quality investigative journalist, Stephen Grey, who has since written a book on the subject. Shortly afterwards, the practice was again brought to my attention by an official who must remain anonymous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para14"><a name="07062658000133">Before I go any further, I must define some terms. What is extraordinary rendition? Rendition generally means the transfer of someone from one country to another outside all judicial or administrative due process. In that sense, it is not new: it has been practised and will continue to be practised between countries that do not have extradition agreements to cover such cases. Neither is it always wrong&#151;Carlos the Jackal was rendered. Historically, many such renditions could be considered renditions to justice, as they enabled someone to be brought before a court. A uniquely pernicious aspect of the recent renditions, often called extraordinary renditions, is that their primary purpose is to keep those who are being transferred from justice. Worse still, a further purpose in many cases appears to have been to transfer those people to a place where they can be tortured.</p>

 I was pleased to accompany the hon. Gentleman to Washington and New York, last December, to meet several Administration officials and others to discuss these very issues. Does he agree that apart from extraordinary renditions being morally wrong, they are wholly counter-productive given the efforts of this country and others to tackle global terrorism?</p>

 I completely agree; indeed, it was a central point that we both made to a number of people in the US Administration and on Capitol Hill, where we found wide agreement right across the party political spectrum&#151;contrary to the impression that one might gain from UK press reports.</p>

to countries such as Syria, Egypt and Morocco, where a number of them have been horrifically tortured. That has all been planned and implemented by US personnel with assistance from several western and middle-eastern allies. I have been appalled by what I have uncovered in the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para16"><a name="07062658000137">In December 2005, I set up the all-party group on extraordinary rendition with the help of the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), who was subsequently replaced when he was elevated to his current position, by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb). We have had three main objectives throughout, the first of which is to bring these disgusting practices to wider public attention. The second is to do whatever we can to ensure that the UK is not involved in rendition. The third is to do what we can, however little, to persuade the US Administration to desist from the practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para17"><a name="07062658000138">We have gathered a lot of information in support of the first objective. We have taken evidence from many lawyers who represent detainees who have been rendered, and from their relatives. Some of the accounts of their treatment are truly horrific. I do not intend to go through them all in detail, but it is important that people get a grasp of the scale of the problem. When one hears credible accounts of a British resident begging for mercy as his penis is cut with a razor, one gets a sense of what the innocuous phrase &#147;extraordinary rendition&#148; really means. An unnamed CIA operative was quoted in <i>The Washington Post</i> as saying:</p>
<a name="70626h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07062658000200"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We don&#146;t kick the shit out of them. We send them to other countries so they can kick the shit out of them.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para18"><a name="07062658000139">With others, the all-party group has given greater public prominence to what has been going on, and we have tried to bring pressure to bear on several specific cases, including those of Benyam Mohammed and Bisher al-Rawi. Several MPs, some of whom might speak today, have worked tirelessly for the families of people who have been rendered, and I congratulate them on their work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para19"><a name="07062658000140">On the second objective&#151;UK involvement&#151;despite numerous requests from me and others, we have been unable to persuade the Government to condemn extraordinary rendition. In like fashion, the Government refused to condemn Guantánamo for years, but finally did so in 2006 as a consequence of pressure from the Law Officers. I do not want to live in a country whose Government choke at condemning kidnap and torture.</p>

 May I challenge that? I think that I was the first Minister to condemn Guantánamo Bay in the Chamber of the House of Commons, and I cannot recall ever in my career in this place any Law Officer putting pressure on me about anything. I did it for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman has given: because it is counter-productive to the fight against terrorism. I am sure that many of our colleagues in this House would condemn it for the very same reasons.</p>

 I note the sense of joined-up government that that reply implies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para20"><a name="07062658000145">In at least one case, that of Bisher al-Rawi, the UK security authorities appear to have been directly implicated in rendition. That case has yet to be investigated properly. I shall say more on UK involvement later but, first, I shall return to what I was saying about trying to persuade the US on this subject. As the hon. Member for North Norfolk pointed out, we went to Washington, with Mark Pallis, who is an extremely knowledgeable legal adviser to the all-party group, and met Condoleezza Rice&#146;s chief legal counsel, John Bellinger, and many other people in the National Security Council and on Capitol Hill. I was heartened that so many of those people find this practice as repugnant as we do. Indeed, a good number of them agreed with what the Minister just said, that Guantánamo Bay is counter-productive, and were prepared to tell us privately that they think that rendition is as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para21"><a name="07062658000146">It is important to understand that rendition has not come as a bolt from the blue, but is part of a revolution in US foreign policy under George Bush that has made the whole of the west less secure. I shall say a few words on that subject at the end of my speech if I have time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para22"><a name="07062658000147">When I first expressed concern about the issue in the autumn of 2005, I was repeatedly challenged to provide evidence; by implication, the challenges suggested that there was no evidence and that the matter had been got up by a press brouhaha. Much remains to come out, but the existence of the practice whereby people have been kidnapped and taken to places where they may be tortured has now been confirmed by President George Bush, Condoleeza Rice and numerous CIA officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para23"><a name="07062658000148">That comes on top of overwhelming evidence from a number of specific cases, such as those of Maher Arar. He is a Canadian who was detained in New York before being sent to Syria to be tortured. That created such a massive scandal in Canada that, after his release, the Canadian Government were forced to launch an investigation, after which they paid Canadian $10 million in damages for their complicity in his kidnap. Khaled Masri, a German citizen, was the subject of a Bundestag inquiry. He was kidnapped while on holiday in Macedonia and rendered to Afghanistan, where he was badly maltreated for several months in the so-called dark prison in Kabul. Abu Omar was kidnapped in Milan and transported to Egypt. His case is sub judice in Italy, I believe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="70626h0004.htm_para24"><a name="07062658000149">When challenged on extraordinary rendition, the US Administration qualify their admissions in several important ways. First, they challenge the allegation that they transfer people for the purpose of torture. Looked at closely, this is nothing more than legal obfuscation.

When Ministers have written to me on the subject, they have always used that phrase. A &#147;real risk&#148; means a significant risk. Laymen might take that to invite the question, &#147;Would a reasonable man take that risk if he thought that he might be tortured?&#148;, to which the answer is clearly no.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para1"><a name="07062658000152">The US Administration, on the other hand, have placed a reservation on their acceptance of that part of the torture convention. They take the UN convention&#146;s stipulations to prohibit rendition only when the risk of torture is more likely than not. That is how they have got off the legal hook. They would argue that they acknowledge that there might be a risk of torture when they transport a person to Egypt, for example, but that if the risk is less than 50 per cent., they are not in breach of the convention. It is on such legal casuistries that rendition has been allowed to take root in one of the world&#146;s leading democracies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para2"><a name="07062658000153">The US Administration add a second qualification to their obligations in their definition of what constitutes acceptable treatment. It is widely documented that in extra-territorial US bases, sleep deprivation, waterboarding, hypothermia and sensory deprivation have been widely used. Indeed, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 has further entrenched the legality of some of those techniques. The US Assistant Attorney-General, Jay Bybee, has further narrowed the definition of torture to mean only that which involves suffering equivalent in intensity to the pain of organ failure or death. As a Congressman has pointed out to us, both those qualifications bring shame on America and on the west.</p>

in such atrocities? There have been many reports that airports in the UK, particularly in Scotland, such as Glasgow, Edinburgh and Prestwick, have been used for rendition flights. Does he agree that it would perhaps be useful for those airports to adopt anti-rendition policies similar to Derry airport&#146;s, because that would give our constituents some peace of mind that we are not partaking of this horrific activity?</p>

 I strongly agree with those sentiments. If I get the chance later, I shall talk about some of the proposals that the all-parliamentary group has put forward to tackle the problem which, incidentally, build on proposals put forward by a Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para8"><a name="07062658000161">I said that I did not believe that the Minister knew all the facts, and I am reasonably confident about that. I hope that the Security and Intelligence Committee may be able to delve further and to retrieve more information. More than one year ago, the all-party group vigorously pressed the Committee to initiate an inquiry. I am pleased to say that it has done so, and that it has been working on the issue for some time. I have given oral and written evidence to the inquiry, and made the latter available to the public and to the Government. The Committee&#146;s report may not be conclusive, but it will make an important contribution to finding out the truth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para9"><a name="07062658000162">Although the Committee is better than nothing, we need to bear it in mind that it is a relatively new Committee and that it is still finding its feet in difficult territory. The fact that it does not have the investigative powers of a Select Committee, still less the powers of a United States congressional committee, is a problem. Also, it reports to the Prime Minister, who may redact its conclusions. I was particularly perturbed by the Committee&#146;s recent decision to sack its investigative officer rather than replace him. A Committee without such an officer will find it more difficult to perform its function to a level at which the public will have confidence that it has got to the bottom of the issues that it investigates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para10"><a name="07062658000163">I am sure of one thing on the issue of what has really happened: it is extremely implausible that the information provided by the Government, which the Minister will no doubt rehearse, represents the full extent of our involvement. In support of that, it is worth setting out the chronology. When challenged initially, the Government said that they had no knowledge of any renditions. Later, they identified two renditions, plus a couple of applications that they refused. Still later, they identified at least one more informal request.</p>

 The Minister is welcome to intervene on that. In addition to that, there is an enormous amount of anecdotal evidence that UK airports have been used for rendition, as the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) said. The Council of Europe report provided some of the extensive circumstantial evidence on the issue.</p>

Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), made it clear that what little we know has come from officials&#146; personal recollections and that scarcely any documentation has been retained. In my view, that is wholly unacceptable. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para12"><a name="07062658000167">Worse still, the Government have still not put in place a mechanism for ensuring that renditions do not take place in future. Nor have they reassured us that proper records will be kept. On the contrary, we are supposed to rely on assurances that the US Administration will make a request if they want to fly someone through the UK, and we are expected to leave it at that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para13"><a name="07062658000168">The truth&#151;it will out, as it does in most democracies&#151;is that the Government have almost certainly turned a blind eye to rendition. They have been determined not to allow a cigarette paper to come between them and their US ally, but Ministers are under no illusion that that is causing deep embarrassment. That was made clear in a leaked memo a little while ago, which suggested that whenever the subject is discussed the Minister concerned should do his best to move the discussion on to wider issues of UK participation in the war against terror. I do not have the leaked memo to hand, but if he wants to challenge me on it, I shall give him a quotation from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para14"><a name="07062658000169">The UK&#146;s policy has quietly hardened, as illustrated by the tone of some written answers. The Minister will probably tell us today that those assurances will be demanded vigorously, but we cannot rely on assurances from the US Government; we need much more. With a group of leading public lawyers, including Nicholas Blake QC, Andrew Lydiard QC and Professor James Crawford, dean of the Cambridge university law school, and with the help of a number of pressure groups, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Liberty, as well as help from the New York university law school, we have put together a proposal to provide the public with something more reliable to give them confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para15"><a name="07062658000170">That proposal has been set out in documentation published by the all-party group. In summary, it says that this country must demand the basic information concerning any rendition: the destination, the legal regime that will apply when the person has been transferred, the legal safeguards that are available in that state, and evidence that the detainee was provided with an opportunity to challenge his or her transfer on the basis of his or her reasonable fear of being tortured or suffering ill treatment. It should also be a legal requirement that those requests, and the information obtained are recorded and that those records are retained. We should not have to rely on officials&#146; anecdotal evidence from years back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para16"><a name="07062658000171">With the help of lawyers, I have examined carefully how such a measure could be brought into effect and I have been advised that it could be done by a relatively simple amendment of the Air Navigation Order 2005. Primary legislation would not be required, and I strongly urge the Minister to examine that proposal carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para17"><a name="07062658000172">I was heartened that the Minister told me in a letter dated 7 June, which I received by fax yesterday&#151;I am grateful to him for giving me a copy of it without the day written on it this morning on his return from Washington&#151;in response to my request in May for a  <br>

Government response to my proposals. But I was depressed to note that the Minister said in his letter that he is</p>
<a name="70626h0005.htm_brev3"><a name="07062658000206"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;yet to be persuaded that legislation would add real value...over and above the understandings which already exist&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para18"><a name="07062658000173">He must grasp the fact that those understandings will not satisfy the public, and the reason is clear. First, there is a heap of circumstantial evidence about far more renditions than the four that the Government have been able to identify with the help of absent-minded officials. Secondly, so much material has been put before us during the past few years that public confidence has been corroded. There have been misused intelligence reports, dodgy dossiers, the suggestion that our troops could be attacked by Saddam Hussein within 45 minutes, and the Prime Minister&#146;s suggestion in the House that Saddam Hussein was within a year of obtaining a nuclear weapon. All that has eroded public trust, which is now at a low ebb. Assurances will simply not be enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para19"><a name="07062658000174">My proposal is scarcely radical, and I fear that some hon. Members on my left may suggest that it is wholly inadequate, but at least it would make it clear that reasonable steps should be taken by public authorities to establish whether a rendition is taking place, and to collect the facts about it. What is the danger to the Government of pushing through such a modest statutory instrument? I hope that such a change, or something like it, will have the support of my Front-Bench colleagues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para20"><a name="07062658000175">I have a number of specific questions about UK involvement. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me specifically whether it is now UK Government policy to oppose extraordinary rendition. Do they believe that it is morally wrong, as they now believe that Guantánamo Bay is wrong? What assessment have they made of its overall effectiveness as an anti-terrorist tool? Of course, I understand that the details of such an assessment cannot be put in the public domain, but surely some of the general conclusions should be made available in a democracy. Do the Government agree with Richard Dearlove&#146;s comments that were quoted in a recent programme and a recent journal that rendition has damaged the ability of the UK and the US to recruit high-quality spies? What is the UK&#146;s policy on the CIA&#146;s programme of so-called high-value prisoner transfers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para21"><a name="07062658000176">Do the Government believe that when a CIA chartered plane comes to the UK, it falls in the category of state aircraft for the purpose of permission, or in the category of civilian aircraft? What steps have the Government taken to check the allegations made in two of those programmes and in a book that UK intelligence personnel travelled in a number of planes that were being used for rendition?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para22"><a name="07062658000177">A number of the Minister&#146;s colleagues seem to be as concerned as I am, and some have told me so privately. From time to time, the veil is lifted and they say so publicly. The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), has demanded a radical change in the rules&#151;more radical than I have proposed. She has highlighted a loophole in international regulations and demanded that it be closed by renegotiation of the  <br>

so-called Chicago convention, which ensures that signatories tell one another if hazardous substances or important people are being flown in or out. Unfortunately, that convention does not cover prisoners at the moment. She said that we needed to</p>
<a name="70626h0005.htm_brev4"><a name="07062658000207"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;be absolutely certain that we don&#146;t have a situation where we are complicit in torture because our airspace is being used or planes are landing in our country and then taking off again.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para23"><a name="07062658000178">I agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para24"><a name="07062658000179">Other Members want to get into the debate, and rather than go into further detail with more questions, I shall ensure that the Minister has enough time to answer thoroughly. I may have further questions for him if he permits me to ask them during his response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para25"><a name="07062658000180">I shall draw a few general conclusions. In pressing this campaign, I have been motivated by five arguments, each of which is enough to require that the west&#146;s rendition policy should be challenged. First, there is the basic ethical point that to subject people to torture or to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment is always morally wrong. Secondly, and this point has already been made in interventions, any information obtained or confessions signed in such circumstances are likely to be highly unreliable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para26"><a name="07062658000181">Thirdly, the evidence obtained can probably never be used to secure convictions. The maltreatment of so many detainees at Guantánamo Bay has turned the issue into a legal albatross for the Americans, making it difficult for them to secure convictions of detainees even when the evidence is strong. The Americans cannot bring those people before any court that the international community would recognise as being fair. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para27"><a name="07062658000182">Fourthly, torturing people, and particularly the knowledge that we do so in many of the communities in which the terrorists may hide, makes counter-terrorism much harder. That is the point that Richard Dearlove made when he said that it made recruitment and the gathering of information much more difficult. I am confident that our intelligence services are against extraordinary rendition. They know that it makes us less not more safe, and it makes their job more dangerous, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para28"><a name="07062658000183">Fifthly, and just as importantly, the countries that practice or condone rendition undermine the very values that we in the west seek to export. Rendition inflames the very communities whose support we most need to combat terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para29"><a name="07062658000184">For all those reasons, I hope that the Minister will make a start by speaking out strongly against rendition, and by working vigorously to persuade the Americans to change policy. The &#147;hug them close&#148; approach that the Government have pursued has left Britain without any foreign policy at all on those issues. The Minister looks shocked, but I assure him that that is what the vast majority of the British public think. However, every time I ask a Minister to dissent from that policy, even a little, they persistently fail to do so. The Prime Minister&#151;I admit he is Prime Minister for only one more day&#151;failed to do so at the Dispatch Box late last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para30"><a name="07062658000185">As with the US Administration, we have grown accustomed to hearing apparently firm statements that Britain is not involved, that we have searched our files and found nothing and the like, but so far we have not had that core condemnation from the Government to  <br>

match their belated opposition to what has happened at Guantánamo Bay. Even ignoring the wider impact of the issue, or the immorality of it, a policy of torture will always be counter-productive. It makes us less secure, which is why Israel and the Israeli army abandoned its use. The French learned that lesson in Algeria, and the British learned it very early on in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para32"><a name="07062658000187">Extraordinary rendition is part of a wider, failing US foreign policy. By setting aside international law and compromising the standards that all western democracies aspire to, the US has let us all down in the west. It is part of their radical unilateralist departure from post-war multilateralism, sitting alongside regime change and pre-emptive action. The plain fact is that all those policies have failed and are now seen to have failed. Extraordinary rendition has failed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="70626h0005.htm_para33"><a name="07062658000188">One cannot torture and expect democracy to grow at the same time; one cannot sing the praises of western open societies while kidnapping people from the very communities and faiths that one wants to convince; and one cannot win hearts and minds with the illegal use of force.</p>

I wish to tell the stories of two of my constituents. I am in the unusual and undoubtedly invidious position of having two constituents who have been victims of this insidious practice. I am also chair of the all-party group on Guantánamo Bay, which is where both constituents ended up after they were picked up from various African countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para1"><a name="07062658000195">One of those constituents, Martin Mubanga, is now home and trying to piece his life together. I saw him this week, and he still has nowhere to live. He is lucky, however, because he has dual British-Zambian citizenship, and the Government eventually got him out of Guantánamo Bay and returned him to his home just before the 2005 general election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para2"><a name="07062658000196">The other of those constituents, Jamil el-Banna, is a refugee. He is Palestinian and of Jordanian nationality, so he is effectively stateless in the context under discussion. The Government have disclaimed any responsibility for him, effectively leaving him to rot, and the worry is that he will be returned to Jordan, where he was tortured before coming to the UK. That would be an absolute disaster, so he remains in Guantánamo Bay, where he has been for four-and-a-half years, despite the US having cleared him for release a couple of months ago. The UK Government refuse to bring him home. Martin&#146;s and Jamil&#146;s cases are deeply disturbing, not least because in both there are serious allegations about British security service involvement in their rendition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para3"><a name="07062658000197">Martin Mubanga is an Islamic convert of Catholic parents. In October 2000 he left for Pakistan to study Islam and Arabic. He spent time in Peshawar before entering Afghanistan, studying at madrassahs in Kabul and Kandahar. He had intended to return to Britain on a flight from Karachi on 26 September 2001, and planned to travel across the border by bus, but all the buses stopped running after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. He hid in Kandahar during the American bombing, and there he realised that his passport and will had gone missing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para4"><a name="07062665000004">Eventually, he managed to get to Pakistan. From there, he used his Zambian passport to go to Zambia, where he was joined by his sister and stayed with family members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para5"><a name="07062665000005">In March 2002, <i>The Sunday Times </i>reported that Martin Mubanga had been arrested in Afghanistan, but of course he was not in Afghanistan. He was in Zambia; it was somebody travelling on his passport who had been arrested. He was eventually arrested in Zambia, held in a police station for two nights and interrogated by an American official and a British official who called himself Martin and said that he worked for MI6. The man produced Martin&#146;s British passport, along with a list of Jewish organisations in New York and a military training manual that he claimed Martin had handwritten, and said that they had been found in a cave in Afghanistan. The handwriting in the manual did not match Martin Mubanga&#146;s. He says that they tried to recruit him as an agent, asking him to settle in South Africa or Leeds so that he could go undercover. He refused.</p>

who could prove that he travelled on a valid Zambian passport. In October 2004, his combatant status review tribunal confirmed that the grounds for his detention were that he had travelled to Zambia on false documents and that he had been on a mission to assess targets in New York. Military lawyers later reviewed the evidence and found that it was deeply flawed. Martin was eventually cleared for release and he returned to the UK in January 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para7"><a name="07062665000007">Martin appears to be the first British citizen known to have been subject to rendition. Handing him to the Americans without an extradition hearing was illegal. The question is, to what extent were British agents involved? Interestingly, published flight logs show that the CIA Gulfstream executive jet used in March and April 2002 to transport Martin to Guantánamo Bay was the same jet that had visited British airports more than 20 times since 11 September 2001 and that was used to render my other constituent, Jamil el-Banna. It is curious that there is such an overlap in the two cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para8"><a name="07062665000008">If there are questions about the involvement of British security officials in Martin&#146;s rendition, there are many more about their involvement in Jamil el-Banna&#146;s. Jamil el-Banna and his close friend Bisher al-Rawi, to whom the hon. Member for Chichester referred, were arrested with their travelling companions, who were both British, on their arrival in Gambia at Banjul airport. Their story began much earlier, because Bisher al-Rawi had been working as an intermediary for MI5 for many months, possibly years. I hope that when Bisher tells his story, we will know the extent of his involvement and the extent to which his handover based on information from British security officials was a breach of their relationship with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para9"><a name="07062665000009">Bisher had been helping MI5 make contact with the radical cleric Abu Qatada. Jamil el-Banna&#146;s contact with Abu Qatada was also known to MI5, and some of it was sanctioned. For example, when Abu Qatada was arrested, Jamil was called to taxi his wife and children home, and officials expressly thanked him at the scene. We have learned since then that MI5 had also tried to recruit Jamil el-Banna, offering him a new life and identity. He said that he did not want it; he wanted to remain where he was, because he was a family man and his five British children&#151;four at that point&#151;went to British schools. We have also learned since then that MI5 passed on to the US authorities the information leading directly to the men&#146;s arrest, and that that information was deeply flawed, because the telegrams sent by the security services to the unidentifiable foreign Government have been released. They were released during court cases and investigated by the all-party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para10"><a name="07062665000010">On 1 November 2002, when the two men first attempted to travel to Gambia, they were arrested by British officials who believed that an electrical device in their luggage appeared suspicious. They were released days later, claiming that the device was entirely innocent, but during the period between their first and second attempts to travel, telegrams were sent stating expressly that a suspicious device was in their luggage, that both of them were members of Abu Qatada&#146;s circle of close friends and that Jamil was assessed to be  <br>

Abu Qatada&#146;s financier&#151;a statement that even the CSRT in Guantánamo Bay rejected, I hasten to add.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para11"><a name="07062665000011">The telegrams claimed that Abu Qatada had extensive links to a wide range of terrorist groups, including the al-Qaeda network, and that the security services would be interested to learn whether the Gambians could cover the individuals while they were in Gambia. When the men attempted to fly again on 8 November, a telegram gave exact spellings of the men&#146;s names for check-in, their flight details and their time of arrival, saying that this communication should be read in the light of earlier communication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para12"><a name="07062665000012">It would be hard to show that British information did not lead directly to those men&#146;s arrest. I understand that the Intelligence and Security Committee is investigating the extent to which Britain was complicit, but surely it is not controversial to state that the information led directly to their release. Whether British intelligence knew that it would lead to their release is a matter of semantics, but it is not controversial that information provided by the British led to the men&#146;s arrest. It is also clear from the information that has come from Guantánamo Bay that both Bisher al-Rawi and Jamil el-Banna have been questioned almost exclusively on the basis of information provided by British security services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para13"><a name="07062665000013">In the months during which the two were first questioned, about a month of questioning took place in Gambia. On 8 December 2002, while habeas corpus procedures were pending, Bisher and Jamil were flown from Banjul to Kabul, where they were sent to the dark prison. It appears to have been a classic CIA rendition. They were detained by a group of seven or eight men dressed entirely in black and wearing full-face black masks. The prisoners&#146; clothes were cut off and they were dressed in nappies and jumpsuits and rendered aboard CIA Gulfstream jet VN379P, which began from Washington Dulles airport and then flew to Banjul. The flight left Banjul and flew to Cairo, where it refuelled, and then to Kabul in Afghanistan. Gulfstream VN379P was re-registered as N8068V, so we know which jet took them. As I said, it appears to be the same one that rendered my other constituent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para14"><a name="07062665000014">In Bagram and in the dark prison, both men were subjected to extreme torture&#151;sleep deprivation, extremes of noise and temperature, and beatings. If you will forgive me, Mr. Illsley, I shall place on record what would otherwise be unparliamentary language. At this point, Jamil el-Banna was subjected to a threat &#147;that they would fuck his wife&#148;&#151;a clear and particularly offensive threat to rape his wife in the UK. Both men allege that they were subjected to similar mistreatment in Guantánamo Bay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para15"><a name="07062665000015">A few months ago, Jamil el-Banna was finally cleared for release. I am delighted that the Minister has been willing to put on record his condemnation of Guantánamo Bay. I hope that today he will similarly put on record his condemnation of the extraordinary rendition of both my constituents, but I add that I do not want just condemnation. We have heard the British Government&#146;s condemnation of Guantánamo Bay for some time now, but that has not forced them to act on it. My constituent remains in Guantánamo Bay, one of a number of British residents still there. If this Government really believe that Guantánamo Bay should close&#151;if they really believe that it is so morally  <br>

 One of the poets of the first world war, when asked what he was fighting for, picked up a chunk of English earth. It graphically described what he believed. I think that if one were to ask British soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan what they were fighting for, they would not do quite the same thing, but they would say that they thought they were fighting for freedom, liberty, the rule of law and democracy&#151;for concepts important to them. If one reflects on those concepts and then on the reality of Guantánamo, one sees that it is the antithesis of everything that we in this House collectively believe in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para16"><a name="07062665000017">I voted against the war in Iraq simply as a lawyer. I believed it to be contrary to international law, not having the necessary UN approval. It is no joy to those of us who felt that way that that lack of legal authority has made the coalition&#146;s situation throughout the conflict in Iraq very much more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para17"><a name="07062665000018">Guantánamo was deliberately set up to be outside the legal structures. Only yesterday, an article in the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> stated:</p>
<a name="70626h0006.htm_brev0"><a name="07062665000258"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Guantánamo was chosen for the prison camp in the first place because, while it is an American military installation, it is not on American soil and thus not as subject to American law as are prisons within the United States...Administration hard-liners have opposed housing the prisoners in the United States, at least in part because they would presumably have legal rights and thus be able to challenge the conditions of their confinement and interrogations.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para18"><a name="07062665000019">Everyone in this House must start from the premise that deliberately setting up an extra-legal jurisdiction, to exclude individuals from the rights of law and the basic concept of habeas corpus, destroys everything in which this country has believed since Magna Carta and beyond. If a major ally pursues those policies, its approach is fundamentally flawed&#151;and, what is more, totally counter-productive. If the United Kingdom and the United States seek to say, &#147;We believe in democracy and have the moral high ground,&#148; how on earth will Guantánamo play out in the refugee camps of Gaza, the streets of Peshawar or the back alleys of Kandahar? It is all completely counter-productive, and I think that we all agree on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para19"><a name="07062665000020">Given that background of actions by the United States, the Minister has to accept that it is not a huge leap to infer reasonably, from the evidence of the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)&#151;eye-witness evidence from UK citizens who have been rendered&#151;that such practices have been going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para20"><a name="07062665000021">I want to draw the attention of the House to two recent incidents; the first has not been raised until now. A couple of weeks ago, the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> reported that a US CASA 212 plane landed at RAF Mildenhall on Saturday 2 June. The flight took off from Camp Peary, which is reputed to be a CIA training facility. It was last seen in Malta, clearly close to the middle east. I understand that the plane registration number was one that the European Parliament and the Council of Europe had identified as being used to render prisoners. When the flight landed at Mildenhall, it was surrounded by US military. The Minister has to accept that each and every  <br>

time such incidents occur, the very strong suspicion that US flights are rendering prisoners through UK airspace is further reinforced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para21"><a name="07062665000022">There are also the interesting observations of the new deputy leader and chairman of the Labour party, the former Minister at the Department of Justice; I am not sure exactly when the transition will take place. Those of us who have been in government know that one of the difficulties is reconciling lines to take. Understandably, that is a particular issue for the Foreign Office because one has to clear, around Whitehall, the position that one is taking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para22"><a name="07062665000023">We know that the Minister whom I mentioned, the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), is a decent person, and I am sure that that is why she has been elected deputy leader and chairman of the Labour party. Presumably, she will become Deputy Prime Minister, but she was recently Minister at the Ministry of Justice. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) said, very recently, in that capacity, she asked for what was perceived to be a loophole in the convention on international civil aviation, known as the Chicago convention, to be closed. That loophole means that although the UK Government have to be formally notified if flights contain hazardous material or VIPs, they do not have to be notified about those that contain prisoners. To me, what she did looked like the Ministry of Justice trying to reconcile lines to take&#151;why, otherwise, would the Minister have raised the issue at all?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para23"><a name="07062665000024">It strikes me that the Minister was seeking to say to other Government Departments, &#147;Look, the suspicion must be that the Foreign Office says that it knows nothing about anyone being rendered through UK airspace because the US Government do not have to tell us, so we officially do not know. Actually, we do know and there is heavy suspicion that it happens, so we should reconcile the situation by making it obligatory for us to be told and removing the loophole from the convention.&#148; That was a clear signal that something is amiss&#151;otherwise, why would the issue be raised at all?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para24"><a name="07062665000025">I thought it pretty feeble of the Association of Chief Police Officers simply to look at media reports. Given that reports have been done by the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and others, it must be in the Government&#146;s best interests to co-operate fully with the Intelligence and Security Committee so that we put the issue to bed once and for all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para25"><a name="07062665000026">The bottom line is this: clearly, rendition has been established to remove people from a civilised legal jurisdiction and take them to places where things that others would rather we did not know about&#151;and would be unacceptable if they occurred here or in the United States&#151;can happen. At the beginning of the 21st century, that is morally wrong and extremely short-sighted. I suspect that it puts our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan in jeopardy. If we are not treating other human beings with respect, some may believe that when our soldiers are captured, they do not have to treat our men and women with respect. The situation is wrong, short-sighted and counter-productive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para26"><a name="07062665000027">The Minister is very forthright. I hope that he will condemn the practice of extraordinary rendition with the clarity and fervour with which the Prime Minister, the Foreign Office and now Ministers collectively have been condemning Guantánamo Bay.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) on bringing this issue to the House and on all the hard work that he has done on it as chairman of the all-party group on extraordinary rendition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para27"><a name="07062665000029">We are debating an important and serious issue today. I shall come to what the hon. Gentleman said in a minute, but first I turn to my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather). She outlined two cases for which there is documented evidence of British citizens and others being rendered with the complicity and help of British intelligence services. Her evidence alone brings me to one of the two promises that I want the Minister to give today. That is that there must be, should be and has to be a full and proper inquiry into the allegations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para28"><a name="07062665000030">As has been said, we need to go further than previous inquiries, which considered only newspaper evidence. We need an inquiry that will not only take evidence from people such as those whom my hon. Friend mentioned, but go to the places from which they were rendered and conduct a proper investigation into what they allege happened to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para29"><a name="07062665000031">Only when that has been done, and we have firm evidence, can those allegations be proved false or correct and will the point just raised by the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) be dealt with. It is a serious point. Why should other countries or groups respect international law when they can clearly claim that we&#151;Great Britain and America&#151;are not respecting it? Why should they not kidnap and hold people, as they currently do, if they believe that we are doing the same? It is one rule for one, and a different one for others. That is a justification that they use, and, unless we can put it to rest, it will be hard for us to argue that they are wrong and to negotiate with them on the basis that they are morally and legally wrong. In an inquiry, we would be able to say, &#147;Yes, we have committed an error and we will correct it and ensure that it does not happen again.&#148; However, whatever course we take, I hope that the Minister will take up that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="70626h0006.htm_para30"><a name="07062665000032">The hon. Member for Chichester listed a number of cases that need to be answered. The evidence that he gave today and that he has found from his own inquiry both reinforce the need for a full and proper inquiry. I shall not address all his remarks, but he made some very good points on definition. I notice from the papers that we have been given that the definition of real torture is used, and is used even by the Minister. The foreign affairs spokesman for the Conservative party, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), tabled a written parliamentary question that said:</p>

It is quite possible that those in the UK who might be complicit have not even told their superiors or advised Ministers.

done the House a great service. I congratulate the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) on her erudite description of the circumstances of her two constituents and my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) on his usual clear and concise exposition of the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para4"><a name="07062665000042">There is a long history of rendition: the handing over of someone by force from one place to another&#151;sometimes one country to another. There are many examples; the exile of Napoleon might be taken as one. More recent examples include Ramzi Yousef, who masterminded the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre, and Carlos the Jackal, to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester alluded. The European Commission on Human Rights, however, interestingly rejected Carlos&#146;s claims that his rendition from Sudan was unlawful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para5"><a name="07062665000043">There is a difference between rendition and extraordinary rendition. Extraordinary rendition involves the transferring of individuals either for interrogation to countries that might have a record of using torture or to prevent the judicial system of a country operating against an individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para6"><a name="07062665000044">US laws and international treaties prohibit the transfer of suspects to countries where they are likely to face torture. Indeed, the US has given us assurance that it does not render detainees to any country for the purpose of interrogation that uses torture, or to a country where he or she will be tortured&#151;I stress the word &#147;will&#148;. Those assurances are welcome. However, there is still a risk that, when detainees are rendered to a third country, that process might lead to torture. In such cases, there is a risk of losing control over the conditions such that a detainee might be held and tortured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para7"><a name="07062665000045">Our Government and security services bear a great responsibility to act effectively against that threat; they must be vigilant and act decisively, sometimes even pre-emptively. The security of a state&#146;s citizens is a paramount obligation of that state. Since the dreadful events of 11 September 2001, we have all faced a particular challenge and a huge difficulty in locating those who would attack us, and in being at war with an entity that is not a state. My party recognises that one of the many difficult issues in such a conflict is what to do with captured individuals whom we know or believe to be terrorists. They come from many countries, and are often captured far from their original homes. Among them are those who are effectively stateless. The hon. Member for Brent, East indeed said that her constituent was rendered effectively stateless at one point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para8"><a name="07062665000046">Many such people are dangerous, and some have information that might save lives&#151;perhaps even thousands of lives. Nevertheless, we must uphold those values whose benefit we enjoy, that we want to protect, and that we want to encourage others to take up. Extraordinary rendition is an emotive subject that requires objective examination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para9"><a name="07062665000047">We understand that captured terrorists of the 21st century do not fit easily into traditional systems of criminal or military justice, which were designed for different needs.

They serve as a reminder of the reach of terrorists and the extremes to which they will go to hit our civilisation. Human rights do not apply solely to the western world, nor are they standards from which particular cultures or religions can choose to opt out. They are, and should be, universal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para11"><a name="07062665000049">Likewise, international prohibitions of torture are universal and absolute. The law is absolutely clear that there can be no derogation from those prohibitions under any circumstances, including those of war. That is the key issue, and the debate has not yet quite got to it. It is not just a legal issue; where there are abuses, despair and resentment will surely grow. That serves the interests of those seeking to recruit for violent causes. If we are to win the war on terror it is absolutely paramount that we have the moral advantage. If we do not, as my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury asked, how can we expect others to uphold the same values? If we succumb to lower standards, it gives the terrorist the excuse to carry out his dreadful acts and to recruit others to do the same.</p>

Will the Minister assure us that he has no information of British territories or airspace actively or passively being used for extraordinary rendition? Have any arrangements been made to enable the refuelling at military airfields of civilian aircraft with passengers destined for extraordinary rendition? The essence of the finding of reports by Amnesty International on 4 April and 14 July 2006 was that civil aircraft on charter to the CIA, with people on board selected for transfer by the CIA, were permitted to land and refuel at our civil and military airfields, possibly for the purpose of extraordinary rendition.

Did the Foreign and Commonwealth Office instruct the DFT and, if not, at whose behest were the instructions given? Why were they given without the Government having full knowledge of the purpose of the arrangements involved? Why was not any attempt made over the years to discover the purpose of the 185 flights in question?

 I am sorry that I have barely 12 minutes to answer a huge number of questions, but I welcome the opportunity to try to do so. I thank the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) for giving us the opportunity to debate the issue. There have been persistent allegations that the Government have refused to address rendition fully and openly and that we have somehow sought to evade accountability to Parliament. The debate is an opportunity to set the record straight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para22"><a name="07062665000068">I wish at the outset to tackle two persistent myths about rendition. First, and in answer to some of the questions asked by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), who made a typically thoughtful and measured speech, I reiterate that the Government have not approved and will not approve a policy of facilitating the transfer of individuals through the United Kingdom to places where there are substantial grounds to believe that they would face a real risk of torture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para23"><a name="07062665000069">Secondly, I reject totally the allegation that the Government have refused to address the issue fully and openly. In fact, we have done everything we can to keep the House informed and co-operated fully with international inquiries into rendition, including by the Council of Europe and the European Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para24"><a name="07062665000070">I recently wrote to the hon. Member for Chichester, further to the work that he and the all-party extraordinary rendition group, which he chairs, have done on the issue. I underlined in my letter that we carried out extensive searches of official records and found no evidence that detainees were rendered through the UK or overseas territories since 1997 if there were substantial grounds to believe that there was a real risk of torture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para25"><a name="07062665000071">In his letter, the hon. Gentleman called for new legislation to prescribe how any future requests for rendition through the UK should be dealt with. I am not persuaded that new legislation would add practical value, but, given the work that he and the all-party group have done, I have asked my officials to consider the matter further to confirm that assessment, and I hope that he will welcome that.</p>

However, the Government&#146;s policy is clear: the facts of each individual case will determine whether any particular rendition is lawful. Neither the hon. Member for Chichester nor the hon. Member for Cotswold mentioned that there are many other states that &#147;rendite&#148; people. Some of them are  <br>

geographically close to us. If we are requested to assist another state and our assistance would be lawful, we will decide whether to assist, taking into account all the circumstances. We would not assist in any case if it would put us in breach of UK law or our international obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para27"><a name="07062665000073">In 1998, the US made four requests for permission to render one or more detainees through the UK or overseas territories. Records show that the Government refused two requests and granted two others. In both cases where permission was granted, the detainees were subsequently tried on criminal charges in the US. One pleaded guilty to murder, and the other was charged for his part in the 1998 attack on the US embassy in Nairobi. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. I do not believe that the hon. Member for Chichester is criticising the substance of the decisions that Ministers took in 1998. Certainly no other commentator has criticised the decisions. The hon. Gentleman made a fair case for improving our procedures and made several helpful proposals to that effect, but we should keep the issue in perspective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para28"><a name="07062665000074">In its fourth report, &#147;Foreign Policy Aspects of the War against Terrorism&#148;, which was published last summer, the Foreign Affairs Committee concluded that although there had been speculation about the complicity of the British Government in unlawful rendition,</p>
<a name="70626h0007.htm_brev4"><a name="07062665000266"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there has been no hard evidence of the truth of any of these allegations.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para29"><a name="07062665000075">I commend that conclusion to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para30"><a name="07062665000076">I followed the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument closely. At one point, he said that the Minister almost certainly would not know the facts. I believe that he said that a couple of times. He will not enjoy my saying this, but that is the usual conspiracy theory mantra. The only people who know the facts are, of course, the conspirators and those who indulge in conspiracy theories. They always know the truth; they always know the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="70626h0007.htm_para31"><a name="07062665000077">Ministers can never know the facts because, as the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) said, their superiors would not tell them the facts. I know that the hon. Gentleman has not been a Minister&#151;chances are that he never will be one because of the party that he belongs to&#151;but I can tell him that he clearly does not know how Departments work. Also, it is incredibly insulting to be told that I have been kept in the dark, and that I would not know about such things, as if perhaps I do not care enough to try to find out about them.</p>

Since before 11 September 2001, we have worked closely with the US to achieve our shared goal of fighting terrorism. As part of that close co-operation, we have made it clear to the US authorities that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace, and that we will grant permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations. We have explained our understanding of our obligations under the UN convention against torture and the European convention on human rights. Indeed, it was this country that moved the UN General Assembly resolution&#151;we co-sponsored it last year. It sets out our opposition to any form of deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing a detained person outside the protection of the law.</p>

There is always a willingness, especially among members of the Liberal Democrat party, to throw mud at anything in the hope that it might stick, but it is an irresponsible thing to do. This country stands not for torture or the kinds of practices that have properly been criticised today but against terrorism. I have never yet come across a single acknowledgment of that fact, or heard a good word about the process of democracy and justice in this country.</p>

 I will allow the combatants to disperse before we start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para4"><a name="07062665000124">I am sure that many people are wondering what this issue&#151;protocols and the Channel Islands&#151;is about. The subject is relevant to medicinal products that are channelled through other parts of the United Kingdom, on which I will concentrate today. The protocol was put in place some 30 years ago and keeps the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey&#151;the Channel Islands&#151;outside the European Union, but allows free trade in manufactured items and agricultural produce between the islands and EU countries. The protocol was a fudge to try to keep Crown dependencies in place with what happens in Europe. It was signed in 1972.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para5"><a name="07062665000125">I shall talk about the particular effect that the agreement has on business. The business that I will discuss today&#151;I have also considered others&#151;is that of vitamins, minerals, herbal remedies and food supplements. I shall also talk about how that exchange takes place and how it affects consumer protection issues in this country&#151;England&#151;and other parts of the United Kingdom. In considering that issue, I have talked to many different people, manufacturers&#146; associations, individuals and groups. The industry is huge in this country and has a lot of support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para6"><a name="07062665000126">As I have said, the Channel Islands are not members of Europe per se, but some European laws do apply. I will explain those in a minute. Our attitude to the EU directives that cover such health products has until recently been that they do not apply. In March 2007 in the other place a Minister said:</p>
<a name="70626h0008.htm_brev0"><a name="07062665000267"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The legislation...does not apply to the Channel Islands. The islands...are responsible for the regulation of activities relating to medicinal products.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 5 March 2007; Vol. 690, c. WA10]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para7"><a name="07062665000127">Then the Government&#146;s view changed: first, as stated by a Minister on 2 May 2007 in the other place and then when a Minister in the other place said:</p>
<a name="70626h0008.htm_brev1"><a name="07062665000268"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The United Kingdom (UK) view is that the nutrition and health claims directive, the food supplements directive and the medicines directive remove barriers to the free movement of goods within the European Union...it is our view that the directives should apply to the Channel Islands under protocol 3&#148;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 May 2007; Vol. 692, c. WA113.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para8"><a name="07062665000128">The position changed and directives that were originally thought not to apply, now seem to do so&#151;or rather they should apply because, as I am arguing, they are not in effect at the moment. Jersey and Guernsey have undertaken to meet EU obligations and I hope that those undertakings are reliable and will eventually be acted on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para9"><a name="07062665000129">The market has been substantially affected by the failure to extend the directives. In the last decade, the turnover of Channel Island businesses dealing with such products rose from zero to around &#163;70 million and it is increasing. Consumer protection measures are failing and will increasingly do so unless the relevant directives are applied and put into practice. There are two main reasons for that exceptional growth. One is the low-value consignment relief that enables VAT to be avoided on purchases of less than &#163;18 and creates a  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="26 Jun 2007">

<notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2007 : Column 49WH</b><br>
significant price advantage for Channel Island companies. Many sectors are affected and, as I said, the health product sector is just one of those. The second reason for rapid growth is the freedom of Channel Island businesses to ignore any rules governing medicinal claims and sell, I believe, banned substances. I have seen such products advertised and sold over here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para10"><a name="07062665000130">It is a truism in the sector that claims sell products. However, it has long been the enforced UK practice that claims should be truthful and accurate and should stop short of being medicinal. Some medicinal claims in the brochures sent from the Channel Islands almost exclusively to UK consumers are deplorable. There are claims that products are good for cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer&#146;s, dementia, coronary heart disease, strokes and diabetes. Those are just some of the commonplace claims. Hon Members will know the problems that have arisen in this country when effective drugs are provided through the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the Government. Those companies are exploiting that situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para11"><a name="07062665000131">The products have not been licensed at all and there is no evidence that they work. There is a spectrum of standards and some operators are much worse than others. However, all would fall foul of the standards set by the EU directives, as the competent UK authority, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&#151;MHRA&#151;has said. The Channel Islands are, of course, sensitive about their reputation and want to protect their large financial services industry, but I cannot see how allowing this unsavoury practice to continue will enhance their reputation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para12"><a name="07062665000132">The position now is that the directives have not been applied to the Channel Islands. Guernsey, which has no medicines legislation, is currently consulting on a law that will not meet EU standards. Jersey has basic medicine law and proposes to discriminate against the fulfilment houses that simply provide logistics, distribution and the valuable Channel Island address. That will have no effect on the rules covering medicinal claims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para13"><a name="07062665000133">The Channel Islands sector is a problem. The chief executive officer of the MHRA wrote on April this year that the MHRA&#151;the regulatory authority&#151;</p>
<a name="70626h0008.htm_brev2"><a name="07062665000269"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;shares your concerns about the activities of companies operating from the Channel Islands...we take action wherever possible to limit the illegal activities...the MHRA has already identified that the legislation proposed by Guernsey does not reflect the current European position. We have voiced our concerns on this in our response to the consultation exercise.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para14"><a name="07062665000134">The recent recognition that the relevant directives should apply to the Channel Islands came as welcome relief to a UK sector that has invested large amounts to comply with the directives. It has suffered some pain in doing that and I was grateful for the recognition that the relevant directives should apply. The turnover of the UK sector has stagnated while that of the Channel Islands has gone from zero to &#163;70 million in the last decade and is increasing, as I have said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para15"><a name="07062665000135">There appears to be no plan to introduce the directives and the Channel Islands sector continues to grow and enjoys advantages on cost, and VAT relief. It also makes medicinal claims that need to be substantiated. In some cases, those claims are false and not proven. The Channel Islands sector drives its sales  <br>

up and avoids the extra costs with which companies on the mainland must comply as part of the European directive framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para16"><a name="07062665000136">The various health food organisations have engaged in debate on the issue with Ministers. The Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), said that Guernsey was updating its legislation to address marketing issues and that Jersey has given assurances that it has taken steps when it has become aware of a problem. However, the roll-out of the directives was not mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para17"><a name="07062665000137">It is incorrect to hold up the Jersey position as satisfactory, even on a temporary basis. It is also wrong to think that if Guernsey had a similar law, there would be any serious impact on medicinal claims there. In 2005-06, the MHRA referred nine complaints to Guernsey and seven to Jersey, which has responded to three of the seven. The Guernsey sector is larger, but Jersey also contributes and its current medicines legislation does not affect companies such as Healthy for Life, Life Healthcare, Woods, Prime Health Direct, Nature&#146;s Range or Elixir of Life&#151;a company that was subjected to what I can only describe as a roasting from the eminent Esther Rantzen on her programme. Or course, that company has since skilfully changed its name, which shows that there is a game going on regarding the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para18"><a name="07062665000138">The words of Dr. David Jeffs, Director of Public Health Strategy for Guernsey, are quite illuminating. He wrote,</p>
<a name="70626h0008.htm_brev3"><a name="07062665000270"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we will progress this as rapidly as we can, but...the law is unlikely to be enacted within the next several months&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para19"><a name="07062665000139">In early 2004, it was reported that Guernsey was well advanced towards the introduction of legislation and in 2005, Dr. David Jeffs wrote to a UK consumer who had made a complaint after falling ill following taking such medicine. He said that our hope is that</p>
<a name="70626h0008.htm_brev4"><a name="07062665000271"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;new legislation will come into effect within the next 12-18 months&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para20"><a name="07062665000140">The idea that it would be in place by 2003-04 has become a hope that it will be enacted much later on in 2007. I could tell many other stories about Ministers who have made such claims. I think that there is a lot of dragging of feet and somebody, somewhere, is having a laugh. No pressure is being applied to make them obey and develop the directives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para21"><a name="07062665000141">Laws that have been proposed do not meet EU standards and will have no effect on the medicinal claims, which of course is the central issue, by which I think that some people are being fooled. It is time that urgent steps were taken to extend the directives. The Government admit that, but we need to do something about it now before more legitimate businesses go to the wall and, in the worst cases, more UK consumers are duped into paying fancy prices for inappropriate, dangerously-promoted and, occasionally, illegal products. If consumers do not visit their doctors, or do, but do not get prescribed medicines, they might turn to such products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para22"><a name="07062665000142">I have some questions for the Minister: does she support the comments from the chief executive officer of the MHRA about the proposed Guernsey law? What action has been proposed to extend the directives to both Channel Islands and in what time scale? And  <br>

how are they going to be enforced? Why has it taken so long for officials to wake up to the impact on UK businesses of the failure to apply the directives? Has the liability of Government been considered should the industry bring a legal case based on the failure to implement the directives? What discussions have taken place with the EU about the failure to implement them? In what sense, if any, does the view of the Channel Islands on implementation of the directives matter? What is the prevailing UK view?</p>

 It is a pleasure to appear under you chairmanship, Mr. Martlew. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on taking on this issue, obtaining this debate and on putting his case strongly. He represents a substantial head of steam and has made clearly and strongly the major points that that head of steam represents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para24"><a name="07062665000145">It would be useful to set out in a few words what protocol 3 is and the constitutional position of the Crown dependencies, not just on this issue, but generally. Protocol 3 to the treaty of Accession to the European Community governs the relationship between the Crown dependencies&#151;the Channel Island and the Isles of Man&#151;and the European Union. It does not govern the relationship between the UK and the Crown dependencies or between the UK and the EC. It is worth knowing that it is the Commission&#146;s role to monitor compliance of the Crown dependencies with Community rules, by which they are bound.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para25"><a name="07062665000146">I shall turn briefly to the constitutional position&#151;irresistible for a lawyer. The term &#147;Crown dependencies&#148; is unique to the relationship that the UK has with those three territories. For the purposes of this debate, key points about their status need to be made: unlike the overseas territories, they are not part of our colonial past and have no representation to Government at Westminster. They are not part of the UK, but are self-governing dependencies and have their own directly-elected legislative Assemblies, their own fiscal and legal systems and their own courts of law. We are constitutionally responsible for their defence, international representation and good governance. They are not part of the European Union, but have a relationship with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="70626h0008.htm_para26"><a name="07062665000147">What is protocol 3? It has been negotiated and defines the extent to which the three islands are part of the EU. Under that agreement, the Channel Islands are part of the customs territory of the Community, and common customs tariffs, levies and agricultural import measures, which apply to trade between the Channel Islands and non-member countries. So there is free movement of goods and trade between the islands and member countries, but other Community rules do not generally apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para0"><a name="07062665000148">The roots of protocol 3 can be found in the treaty of Rome 1957, which applies to European territories for whose external relations a member state&#151;in other words, us&#151;is responsible. That is how they got included. When we looked to membership of the EU, the islands saw three ways in which their relationship with the Community could develop: they could become part of it, become independent, or create this special relationship. Their primary concerns were to retain unchanged the link with the British Crown, which is 100 years old, and to protect their indigenous industries, which principally are&#151;or were then&#151;horticulture and agriculture. That led to the negotiated settlement that was unchanged by the treaty on European Union 1993 and the treaty of Amsterdam 1997 and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para1"><a name="07062665000149">I set out that relationship in order to emphasise the constitutional position and who is responsible for enforcement of the directives.</p>

 Well, I really do not know. That is a matter for them and not an issue on which the Ministry of Justice is actively engaged. But it was a very interesting question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para2"><a name="07062665000152">My hon. Friend raised more specific concerns about the medicinal claims, supplements and suppliers of food supplements. That is the thrust of it, although there is a question also about the impact of the Channel Islands&#146; VAT-free status on the UK food and medicinal products industry. I am sorry if he thinks that we have changed our minds. We have more full legal advice and, having seen Treasury solicitors&#146; communications, are satisfied that these EU directives apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para3"><a name="07062665000153">Discussion continues between this Government and those of the Channel Islands, but I am told that we have been reassured through those discussions that Guernsey, in particular, which might not have been quite so receptive to our conversations, is committed to matching international standards in these products and to ensuring that they apply in Guernsey. Of course there is an internal issue that knocks on to us and which is highly relevant to its own good governance and people. There has been substantial recent dialogue between the Guernsey Government and UK officials to seek agreement on what the UK can expect to see in Guernsey&#146;s legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para4"><a name="07062665000154">My hon. Friend referred to legislation on the quality of those products. The UK is negotiating to ensure that this legislation meets obligations to its own people and ours. Officials in my Department continue to talk to Guernsey representatives to ensure that our concerns are understood properly. I think that they can be relied upon to do that with considerable forcefulness. And there are grounds for optimism. Guernsey&#146;s Parliament has approved the preparation of legislation to regulate the manufacture, supply, export, labelling and prescribing of medicines with the express twin aims of ensuring that the requirements of the MHRA are met and of safeguarding the reputation of the islands. That must be a very important tool in the whole issue. Legislation has been drafted and has gone out to consultation which closed recently. Guernsey&#146;s authorities are currently  <br>

considering the results of that consultation process and remain committed to ensuring that all legitimate concerns are met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para5"><a name="07062665000155">To put it colloquially, clearly the Ministry of Justice is working with UK policy makers to persuade the Crown dependencies that not only is the export of unregulated products in the UK a problem for us, but is bad news for them as well, because their reputation and relationship with us, upon which much weight was laid at the time of the treaty of Accession, as I have said already, remain hugely important to them. Of course, if they fail to meet international standards for regulation, supervision and governance, they stand to lose a huge amount of that reputation and good will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para6"><a name="07062665000156">Obviously, there is justification for ensuring that Crown dependencies are subject to the sort of constraints applied in the UK, and the Ministry of Justice is hoping to move the Crown dependency Governments to an acceptable position although also we need to have regard to the indigenous industries of those dependencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para7"><a name="07062665000157">The Food Standards Agency and the Health Food Manufacturers Association&#151;the UK industry lobby&#151;of which my hon. Friend has spoken, have recently met to talk about the two issues of quality and competitiveness, and the impact on the UK market. My officials were party to those discussions. I hope that that gives my hon. Friend some reassurance about my Department&#146;s determination to ensure that good quality and good standards are dealt with by legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para8"><a name="07062665000158">Low-value VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands, whether they are health food supplements or CDs and DVDs&#151;that is the other big issue, but my hon. Friend is concerned about health food supplements&#151;do have or are capable of having negative effects on the UK economy, and the issue is kept under close scrutiny by the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para9"><a name="07062665000159">The current position is that all goods posted to the UK from outside the EU are normally subject to UK VAT, but for consignments under &#163;18 in value, no VAT is charged. That applies to consignments from the Channel Islands because they are outside the EU. It is goods valued under &#163;18 that cause a certain amount of difficulty. Although the goods are given a benefit in competing with indigenous UK goods, it is a perfectly legitimate position at law that those exports are not subject to VAT. The Governments of the Channel Islands are very aware of UK concerns about competition and, in particular, the medicinal products about which my hon. Friend is worried but, again, we have to strike a balance.</p>

 Are the Government in the Channel Islands, whether it is Guernsey, Jersey or wherever&#151;or the Isle of Man, for that matter&#151;concerned about the products that are unregulated and in respect of which false claims are made about their effectiveness?

 My hon. Friend makes a very strong point. NICE has been very influential and powerful in this regard, and I can see what he means about advertisements. What I can refer to is limited to what I have said here already, which is that my Department is trying to drive the Guernsey Government into legislating, as they now seem to be doing, to ensure that both quality and the way in which the goods are promoted are controlled. I hope that in due course a bundle of legislation emerges from the current consultation, which we will then have further input into. As I have said, we are talking to the UK trade and industrial representatives about the issue. I hope that we can ensure that there is protection of a kind that we would wish to have for all people in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para10"><a name="07062665000164">A fairly obvious point, although a pretty easy one to miss because we are the &#147;victims&#148;, in heavily inverted commas, of the exports&#151;imports, to us&#151;is that there is, none the less, an impact on the people of the Channel Islands. That is a very important point and one that we have to make to those Governments. It is not the case that two different qualities of product are being produced and marketed. Exactly the same damage&#151;if damage is being done&#151;will be inflicted on Channel islanders as will be inflicted on the UK. That is a powerful piece of leverage.</p>

Friend has played a role and the parliamentary questions that have been raised recently about these issues must have had an impact on UK public opinion, but presumably also on Channel Islands public opinion about the way in which the relevant businesses have historically been conducted. That is probably a reasonable deduction by me, but I can assure my hon. Friend that the Channel Islands Governments are apprised of our concern. In all the negotiations, we have to strike a balance, because we do not want to spoil indigenous, established, local businesses in the Channel Islands, but there has to be a very strict limit on our tolerance. Indirect tax advantages and access to UK markets, if they become increasingly detrimental to the UK economy, have to be revisited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para12"><a name="07062665000166">Returning to the crux of the debate, I am told that, today, Guernsey&#151;I think that Guernsey is the important one in this regard&#151;has reiterated that its underlying policy is that it is essential that the island has similar legal provision to that of the UK. In particular, provision is to be made to ensure regulation to UK standards of the quality of medicinal products throughout the entire supply chain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para13"><a name="07062665000167">I was sufficiently taken by surprise when I read in my note that &#147;today&#148; the Guernsey authorities had reiterated that underlying policy that I asked those who advise me whether the imminence of my hon. Friend&#146;s debate here today had played any role in recent contacts. I am pleased to say that it has been confirmed to me that it is almost certainly the case that initiating this debate today has brought that reaffirmation. It is a clear and up-to-date reaffirmation of the policy, which I hope goes some way towards alleviating his concerns.</p>

 I am delighted that the Minister is in his place and that we are starting this very important debate early. May I put the issue in context? It is one of the hottest local issues in my constituency. On 19 June, Christchurch borough council, which has recently been voted the most improved district council in the country&#151;I am delighted that the leader of that council is coming along to follow the debate today&#151;passed a resolution in the following terms:</p>
<a name="70626h0009.htm_brev0"><a name="07062665000272"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This Council is appalled at the proposal to close the Jobcentre Plus Christchurch office as contained in the Jobcentre Plus District Manager&#146;s letter dated 17 May 2007. This Council objects most strongly to the proposals which would lead to the loss of a vital local service causing unnecessary distress and inconvenience to some of the Borough&#146;s most vulnerable and needy residents especially those who would have to travel to the Bournemouth Jobcentre Plus office.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para14"><a name="07062665000169">On Thursday 21 June, there was a public meeting at the Grange school in Christchurch, which is in the heart of the most deprived area of the Christchurch constituency and one of the most deprived wards of any borough in the whole of south-west England. I think that it is fair to say that many customers of the Jobcentre plus office come from that area. At the meeting, which was very well attended, there was a unanimous vote of all those present, other than members of the civil service, in support of that resolution. As a further indication of how strongly the issue is running in the local community, a petition that will be presented to Parliament before the end of the consultation period has already gathered more than 4,000 signatures. This is a big local issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para15"><a name="07062665000170">I am somewhat perplexed about the Minister&#146;s role in the proposal to close the Jobcentre Plus office. He wrote to me on 15 May, saying:</p>
<a name="70626h0009.htm_brev1"><a name="07062665000273"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Since the original Service Delivery Plan was developed we have seen significant reductions in our running costs budgets in relation to both salaries and non-salary funding. This is linked to reductions in staff numbers and a pressure on the size of our estate and the continued low levels of customers in the catchment area.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para16"><a name="07062665000171">The area manager, who came to the public meeting last Thursday, said that his department had to shed 30,000 jobs in the three years to March 2008. The Minister wrote that letter as though the reductions in running costs budgets were not his responsibility, but if he is not responsible for the requirement, who is? Is it the Chancellor of the Exchequer, perhaps? Is the Minister not also responsible, not for the administration of those reductions but for ensuring that the implementation of any budget cuts is rational, fair and puts the customer or client first?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para17"><a name="07062665000172">The Minister&#146;s letter of 15 May further states:</p>
<a name="70626h0009.htm_brev2"><a name="07062665000274"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;These combined pressures on resources&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para18"><a name="07062665000173">it does not say, of course, that they are self-inflicted&#151;</p>
<a name="70626h0009.htm_brev3"><a name="07062665000275"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;and relatively low numbers of customers lead us to believe that closure of this site is a reasonable way forward&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para19"><a name="07062665000174">Yet, I am not even sure whether the Minister knows how many customers there are. Following his letter, I tabled a series of questions for answer on 23 May. In one, I asked</p>

<a name="70626h0009.htm_brev4"><a name="07062665000276"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;how many people obtained advice on benefits from the Christchurch office of Jobcentre Plus in each of the last six months&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14 July 2007; Vol. 461, c. 1292W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para20"><a name="07062665000175">On 14 June&#151;three weeks late&#151;Mel Groves, the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, told me that information about customer usage &#147;is not recorded&#148;. Then, however, I was told that customers who visited the office would be asked to complete a questionnaire as part of the consultation so that usage could be analysed. Surely, that survey should have been done before the Minister accepted the proposal to close the jobcentre for consultation. How could he assert in his letter to me that the number of customers was relatively low when he did not even know the number? Surely, the business case for closure must have been submitted to the Minister once it had been approved by the Jobcentre Plus board. That was certainly the information that I was given, so why does the Minister refuse to disclose the details? Is it because that would reveal that the basic information needed to justify the closure is not available?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para21"><a name="07062665000176">The issue of numbers was much discussed at the public meeting. The area manager said that there were 1,440 sickness and disability benefit claimants, but that is 15 per cent. less than the 1,720 referred to in Mel Groves&#146;s letter of 14 June, which was annexed to the Minister&#146;s written answer of the same date. That is a 15 per cent. reduction in one week. Which of those figures is correct? How do we know? Does the Minister also realise that only pre-booked customers are being given questionnaires and that those who use the jobpoints, telephones or interview rooms do not receive them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para22"><a name="07062665000177">Last October, the jobcentre manager did an exercise, which showed that there were</p>
<a name="70626h0009.htm_brev5"><a name="07062665000277"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;over 1,200 visits by customers to the Christchurch office to use the jobpoints or the free telephones&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14 December 2006; Vol. 454, c. 1338W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para23"><a name="07062665000178">The Minister shared that information with me in a written answer late last year, but it appears not to have been updated. Is it in the business plan for closure? What is proposed for the users of jobpoints and free telephone services in the event of closure? At last Thursday&#146;s public meeting, the area manager could say only that he would be interested in proposals to relocate those services locally. Surely, specific proposals along those lines, together with the costs of implementation, should form part of the business plan. If the Government are serious about maintaining that service, and it cannot be maintained in the office because the office is closed, why have they not engaged in discussions and reached conclusions on a hypothetical basis? Part of any normal business planning arrangement would be to ask how one would replicate the essential elements of a local service that was to be closed down so that local people could access them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para24"><a name="07062665000179">What about the valuable work of some of the other specialist services at the jobcentre? The jobcentre employs seven full-time and three or four part-time staff. We are told that there are too many staff in the service, and the number of staff at the managerial level could be reduced if that was the Minister&#146;s decision. However, there is no evidence that the staff at Christchurch are under-employed, although if there was evidence to that effect, the numbers could be reduced accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para25"><a name="07062665000180">One member of staff who certainly could not be removed, however, is the disability employment adviser. That officer&#151;I hope that the Minister will pay heed to  <br>

this&#151;not only gets people who are out of work into work, but works closely with local employers to ensure that disabled people who are already in work stay in work. Let me give one example. The local B&amp;Q store has a policy of referring disabled employees to the disability employment adviser if there is a problem at work. B&amp;Q does that to ensure that it can continue to employ those disabled people, so the adviser plays an important role. Is the Minister saying that those people should have to go all the way down to Bournemouth to have contact with a disability employment adviser? The arrangement with B&amp;Q shows the close way in which the local office works with local employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para26"><a name="07062665000181">What about the work of Connexions&#151;the organisation whose name is not spelled correctly, but which adds to the advice that is available to young people? That organisation comes to the jobcentre every Thursday and arranges things in such a way that it can interview young people about job prospects at the same time as they are being interviewed about benefits. That takes place in one of the interview rooms, but how will it be replicated if the jobcentre is closed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para27"><a name="07062665000182">A whole host of other activities take place in the jobcentre, although I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of them. If he is, what alternative proposals have been made in the event of closure? I assume that he would want to be satisfied that the activities that I have outlined had been drawn to his attention and were part of the business case for closure before he was prepared to accept it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para28"><a name="07062665000183">Another issue, which was raised by the former mayor, who is disabled and a former user of the jobcentre&#146;s services, was whether a social cost-benefit analysis had been done on the proposals. Those present also asked whether an environmental cost-benefit analysis had been done. There is much talk about the need to reduce travel, but does the Minister have before him in the business plan any indication of the extra travel that customers and staff would need to undertake? At the meeting, it was said that certain categories of customer would be able to have their travel costs paid, but that does not alter the fact that there would be additional travel as a result of the closure, which would have environmental consequences, or that many people who use the jobcentre would not have their travel costs paid when they went to an alternative location. In essence, therefore, my question is whether the Minister has been given a full picture of what happens in the jobcentre and what will happen in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="70626h0009.htm_para29"><a name="07062665000184">In his letter of 15 May, the Minister said:</p>

his assertion that closing the jobcentre in Christchurch will improve the service for constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para1"><a name="07062665000187">The only service improvements that Mr. Taylor-Blake could claim were a better level of support and advice and a quicker service. It is fair to say that the audience treated both those claims with derisive laughter, based on incredulity. The proposed Christchurch office closure is the only full-time office closure proposed in Dorset. Although the argument for a fuller service could be applied to the closure of part-time offices staffed by secondees, that is manifestly not the case in Christchurch. What has happened, I suspect, is that a circular letter has been sent out, which applied to part-time offices, but manifestly not to the full-time Christchurch office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para2"><a name="07062665000188">As the Minister knows, I have been pressing him to justify his assertion that we will have a better service. In a written answer published yesterday, it would be fair to say that he again ducked the question, referring to the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus. That lady speaks only of increasing numbers of customers accessing services by telephone or internet, but she does not address the significant minority who do not and cannot cope with a remote bureaucracy accessible only by electronic means. That group is by definition composed of the most vulnerable members of society. Its members want and need face-to-face contact with real people, not faceless bureaucrats in some remote location. The people in the Jobcentre Plus service to whom I have spoken welcome that face-to-face contact, and feel that it was for that that they came into the service in the first place. They do not want to be on the end of a telephone with a system that uses computer prompts allowing no flexibility or individual discretion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para3"><a name="07062665000189">How can a better service be provided to the group of people that I have described by closing the jobcentre? Mel Groves has spoken of the critical need to secure the most effective and equitable use of resources. What better cause for the equitable use of resources could there be than helping vulnerable people in face-to-face interviews, close to home? It is a matter of regret that in recent weeks home visiting by staff from the Christchurch jobcentre office has been curtailed. I have been told that home visiting will be possible in the future, but one must remain sceptical about such promises when the existing home visiting service is being reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para4"><a name="07062665000190">It is to the credit of the Minister and his Department that the staff at the Christchurch office are so highly regarded by their customers. They have won departmental awards for just that. The area manager includes in the case that he makes the fact that not many people in Christchurch are out of work in the long term. That is true, but I regard that low number as testimony of the quality of the advice and help that people get from the Jobcentre Plus staff. The advice that they get is tailored to individual circumstances and enables them to get into work and stay in work. That is a justification not for closing the office and reducing the service, but for keeping the office open. I fear that the criteria that the Department is using for deciding which offices to close may be based on the idea that the larger the number of long-term unemployed an area has, the stronger the reason is for keeping its office open; the Department should be considering the success rate of the office in getting out-of-work people back into work. Christchurch Jobcentre Plus has a proud record in that respect.</p>

I have always thought that there might be a case for localising all benefit and welfare advice under the aegis of the local authority, which already deals with council tax and housing benefit. That might, indeed, offer a way forward, providing a better service for vulnerable people while preserving accessibility and increasing accountability. In the absence of such a radical alternative, the proposed closure will undoubtedly lead to significant disruption to customers and will damage the interests of some of the most vulnerable members of society.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Martlew, for giving us the opportunity to start the debate earlier than scheduled. I congratulate the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) on securing this debate on what, as he has shown, is an important local issue, in which he takes a keen interest. I also welcome the opportunity not only to talk about the Christchurch office but to express my appreciation, and that of the whole Government, of the work that Jobcentre Plus does in the south-west and throughout Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para8"><a name="07062665000195">As the hon. Gentleman knows, Jobcentre Plus was launched just over four years ago. The roll-out of the national network of offices and modern services commenced in 2002, and with only 10 more offices to go it is virtually complete. As of 21 June 2007, a total of 855 new offices have been opened around the country, enabling Jobcentre Plus to play a key role in delivering our modern welfare system. The initial local service delivery plans for the roll-out in Dorset and Somerset were agreed after consultation in early 2003. Most of the modernised offices in the district were set up in 2004, and they included the one in Christchurch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para9"><a name="07062665000196">The launch of Jobcentre Plus is rightly acclaimed as the most far-reaching organisational reform of welfare in past decades. Gone are the days when the only way of obtaining job vacancy information was physically to go to a jobcentre and browse a bewildering array of vacancy cards on display stands. Comprehensive information is now available on the internet. The award-winning Jobcentre Plus website regularly records the highest number of visits for any Government website, with many thousands of user visits each week. We are using modern technology to make many services accessible from the comfort of people&#146;s homes, or from public premises such as local libraries. Similarly, our touch-screen job points are increasingly being installed in convenient locations, as well as our offices, making more than 400,000 vacancies readily accessible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para10"><a name="07062665000197">In the south-west region, unemployment has, as the hon. Gentleman knows, gone down by more than 35,000 in the past decade, and there are more than 130,000 more people in work. Meanwhile, the jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimant count is down 9 per cent. on the year. In Dorset and Somerset district in the period June 2005 to June 2006, the unemployment rate was 3.8 per cent. and the employment rate was 77 per cent. The jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimant count was 7,775, which was down 15 per cent. on the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para11"><a name="07062665000198">I want now to discuss the situation in Christchurch. As Jobcentre Plus has significantly improved its services, through advances in telephony and e-enabled services, it has ensured that its resources are put in place so as to support the most disadvantaged, with special focus on the local authority wards that are the most deprived, and which have poor labour markets. Therefore, in March, Jobcentre Plus developed a case for revising the 2003 service delivery plan. The revised plans have led to the consultation on the possible closure of Christchurch jobcentre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para12"><a name="07062665000199">In proposing the closure of an office, Jobcentre Plus takes into account the following criteria: first, the volume of business transacted in the office that it is proposed to close; secondly, how the full range of customer services will be provided following closure; thirdly, the impact on customers, in such matters as travel, journey times and the cost of travel to another office; fourthly, how employers will be affected; fifthly, how staff will be affected; and lastly, costs and potential savings. All those criteria are considered carefully during the consultation period, which in this case began, as the hon. Gentleman knows, on 21 May, and will end on 2 July. The consultation includes the local Members of Parliament in all cases, local advice and welfare groups, employers, staff, trade unions and many other community groups, to which the hon. Gentleman rightly paid tribute. I take a personal interest in ensuring that a minimum of six weeks is allowed for local communities and stakeholders to make formal responses to such proposals. Meaningful consultation is vital in gathering all the information to help me to consider all the relevant facts before making my decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para13"><a name="07062665000200">We shall take into account all the views expressed in relation to the criteria that I listed. However, it is necessary today to consider those criteria in turn to show why Jobcentre Plus has entered into the consultation on proposed closure. First, as to volume of business, Christchurch jobcentre is one of our smaller offices, and now has only 14 staff. In the period July 2005 to June 2006 the relevant unemployment rate was only 2 per cent., with an employment rate of 77 per cent. Both of those rates were better than the national average. The jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimant count in May 2007 was only 256, which was down more than 20 per cent. on the year. The new deal figures show that no 18 to 24-year-old customers were on the programme after 12 months and that only 15 customers aged 25 or above and only five customers aged over 50 were on the programme after 18 months. Those are historically low levels, and those factors, especially the levels of high employment and low unemployment, raise questions about the operational viability of the jobcentre, given the intention to focus resources where they add most value in Dorset and Somerset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para14"><a name="07062665000201">The second consideration is how the delivery of services would be affected by closure. The Christchurch office is not structurally friendly for public access, especially for customers who have disabilities, as services are sited on the first floor of the building, which is accessed via a lift. In addition, the social fund cannot be delivered through that office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para15"><a name="07062665000202">The third consideration is customer travel. The hon. Gentleman reasonably asked about contingency plans and alternative arrangements. I tell him, and others through him, that I shall not consider specific alternative transport arrangements until we have taken a decision on closure. I do not think that he would welcome me talking about the alternative arrangements that will be put in place, given that we have not yet taken a decision. He well knows that Bournemouth is served by regular bus services from Christchurch, and I am told that customers can purchase a day-tripper bus ticket for &#163;3. Services could also be made available to customers at Winton and Ringwood jobcentres if that would better suit their personal needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para16"><a name="07062665000203">Fourthly, in respect of the impact on employers, Bournemouth, where most local employers are located, also offers an improved range of services. Employer activity at Christchurch jobcentre is very low: in the past five months, only four employers have used the office for interviews on just eight days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para17"><a name="07062665000204">Fifthly, Jobcentre Plus will be able to redeploy any and all Christchurch staff to the new Bournemouth office if there is a decision to close the Christchurch office at the end of the consultation. The hon. Gentleman rightly paid tribute to the staff in the Christchurch office&#151;as do I to the staff in all our offices across the network&#151;and to the work of disability employment advisers. When it came to deciding whether to invest in the new deal and disability employment advisers, I voted to invest money in such services. I have voted for every penny piece of new investment into Jobcentre Plus in the past decade, but that has not been a universally consensual approach. There was a bitter, party political divide on whether having disability employment advisers was the right way to progress, but I am glad that the hon. Gentleman now welcomes the investment that he and his party so strongly opposed 10 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para18"><a name="07062665000205">Lastly, if we were to go ahead with any proposed closure, the likely impact on costs and savings would be an important consideration. It would be wrong to identify any specific savings or costs, because if we were to go ahead with a closure, the subsequent contingency plans and the nature of any community-based service would lead to additional costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para19"><a name="07062665000206">Those are the six major issues that we will consider at the end of the consultation process, before Ministers take a decision.

would certainly be quite a lot of contention regarding some of the information that the Minister has given. He said that the building is not structurally sound and is not friendly to disabled users, but one of the staff members there is disabled and chooses to work there specifically because she finds it an accessible and friendly place. He will know from the area manager&#146;s reports that many disabled people said at the public meeting that they choose to go to Christchurch jobcentre because it is local, friendly and accessible and is not intimidating. Those issues are highly contentious, so why cannot we see the revised service delivery plan to assess whether it is accurate?</p>

Gentleman&#146;s point about ease of accessibility, as we progress with the proposals in the Welfare Reform Act 2007, it will become increasingly important to offer tailored support to people with disabilities as we will, rightly, offer more support to disabled people to get them back into work. Their involvement will be a condition of continuing to receive employment support allowance. Those who can undertake work focused interviews and work-related activity will do so in return for those benefits. That tailored support will be particularly important from 2008 onwards, with the introduction of the employment and support allowance, and will be underpinned by the extension of pathways across the country. Pathways is another new investment and innovation, and is the single most effective investment and programme of its type in supporting disabled people and giving them the chance to get into work.</p>

 I tabled this debate because I visited recently the Palestinian occupied territories with a delegation organised by War on Want. It consisted of War on Want staff, myself, and Rodney Bickerstaffe, the former general secretary of Unison. I am grateful for the opportunity to report on our findings, and I hope that the Minister will take account of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para23"><a name="07062665000218">I have previously visited the west bank and Gaza on a number occasions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, at the time of the first intifada&#151;a Palestinian uprising involving peaceful disobedience or, at worst, children throwing stones at soldiers. Despite the injuries inflicted on children by the Israeli army, the intifada was full of hope, and it led to the negotiation of the Oslo peace accord and the return of Yasser Arafat to Palestine. I was hopeful at that time that a two-state peace&#151;Israel and Palestine&#151;was possible, that the new Palestinian state would be based on 1967 boundaries with East Jerusalem as its capital, and that there would be a negotiated settlement on Palestinian right of return. Those are the three essential components of a negotiated peace. I was hopeful; but it is now impossible to believe that there will be such a peace. Instead, I fear that unless we change policy, we face the prospect of years and possibly decades of bloodshed and conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para24"><a name="07062665000219">I have followed developments in the middle east carefully over many years, and I was well aware before my recent visit how bad things are for the Palestinian people. Nevertheless, I was deeply shocked by Israel&#146;s blatant, brutal and systematic annexation of land, demolition of Palestinian homes, and deliberate creation of an apartheid system by which the Palestinians are enclosed in four bantustans, surrounded by a wall, with massive checkpoints that control all Palestinian movements in and out of the ghettos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para25"><a name="07062665000220">The Israelis are clearly and systematically attempting to take the maximum amount of land with the minimum number of Palestinians. As things stand, Israel has taken 85 per cent. of historical Palestine, leaving the remaining 15 per cent. for Palestinian ghettos. More shocking than that is that the international community, including the UK and the EU, does nothing to require Israel to abide by international law, despite all the claims made about European support for human rights and international law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="70626h0010.htm_para26"><a name="07062665000221">During its visit, the delegation spent a day with the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which is the agency responsible for humanitarian emergencies. It briefed us on the way in which the wall, the closures, the settlements and the separate system of settler roads were imprisoning the Palestinians. It published a map in the <i>Financial Times</i> to mark the 40th anniversary of the occupation, which is available for all to see.</p>

combination of formal and informal settlements, and systematic house demolition, was encircling East Jerusalem and how that constrained, displaced and ethnically cleansed the Palestinian population. When we were with ICAHD, we witnessed a house demolition. A massive machine with &#147;Volvo&#148; emblazoned on its side destroyed a substantial house that was built by a Palestinian family on their own land and in territory that belongs to the Palestinians under international law&#151;formally, it is occupied territory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para1"><a name="07062665000223">Women relatives of the occupants quietly wept at the side of the road. Later, a young man was held back by his friends&#151;he wanted to throw himself at the soldiers who were protecting the demolition, to do something about the destruction of his family home. The representative of ICAHD, a young Israeli, said that the demolition was, of course, a war crime. The point about that is that under the Geneva convention, an occupying power is not entitled to impose new laws or to settle in occupied territory. Houses are being demolished because Palestinians do not have permits to build, even on their own land. However, Israel is not entitled to introduce such a permit system. It never gives a permit to build a house, or after a house has been built. When Palestinian families expand, they must live somewhere, but Israel will never issue a permit because of its determination to drive Palestinians out of East Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para2"><a name="07062665000224">According to ICAHD, Israel has demolished 18,000 Palestinian homes in the way I described since 1967. Each demolition was a war crime. More shocking than that is the fact that no action is taken to force Israel to adhere to international law. Later, the delegation visited a family whose house had been demolished and rebuilt by volunteers from ICAHD&#151;Israelis and Palestinians worked together to rebuild a home for a Palestinian family. ICAHD is committed to acts of peaceful civil disobedience in order that international law is upheld. The family said how grateful they were to once again have a home. A Palestinian who works for ICAHD said that his house had been demolished four times. He said that most Palestinian homes in Jerusalem were subject to demolition orders, so everyone lives with the fear and insecurity that when they arrive home, they might find that their home has been destroyed. He said that when the Israelis arrive to demolish a person&#146;s house, they give them 15 minutes in which to collect their family and belongings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para3"><a name="07062665000225">Normally, people refuse to co-operate. The ICAHD worker told me that in such a situation, the demolition people use tear gas. He told me that he stood there, with his wife fainting and his children crying while their property was being thrown out of their house on to the ground. He said that it made him feel like a useless man who could not even protect his family in their home, and that three possible courses of action passed through his mind. First, full of hate and anger, he thought about obtaining a suicide vest and destroying his own life and that of others. Secondly, he thought about whether he could get out of Palestine and Jerusalem, being unable to bear the pressure being put on him and his family, but that would be to co-operate in the ethnic-cleansing that he opposed. Thirdly&#151;he said that this kept him sane&#151;he said he thought about working for ICAHD to rebuild the demolished homes in peaceful civil disobedience.</p>

I hope that all people of good will will support ICAHD financially and politically in that endeavour. Importantly, the organisation brings radical Israelis and Palestinians together and creates a space for hope in an otherwise hopeless situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para5"><a name="07062665000227">The delegation&#146;s third day was hosted by the Grassroots Palestinian Anti-Apartheid Wall Campaign, which is War on Want&#146;s partner in Palestine. We were briefed about how the closures have destroyed the Palestinian economy&#151;that has subsequently been underlined by a World Bank report&#151;and also how more and more Palestinians are forced to work for the Israeli settlements to produce agricultural products and other goods that are exported largely to the European market, to which trade agreements give Israel privileged access. Illegal settlements using Palestinians as cheap labour is another element of the new apartheid system in which the EU and the UK fully collude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para6"><a name="07062665000228">The delegation went to visit the Jordan valley with a representative of the Grassroots Palestinian Anti-Apartheid Wall Campaign. The situation there is truly terrible. All fertile land near the river has been confiscated by Israel, supposedly for security purposes under the Oslo peace accords. In the remaining territory, there are occasionally settlements, some of only one person, which lead to Palestinian families being removed from their land for security reasons. There are acres of plastic greenhouses that are organised and worked by settlers and which are strategically located over water sources. They grow organic herbs and other agricultural produce for the European market and yet, when we visited a totally impoverished nearby Palestinian village, we found that there was no school and, that day, no water&#151;the one tap in the village gave no water. The impoverished Palestinians must buy water by the bucket from the settlers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para7"><a name="07062665000229">We visited farming families whose relatives had lived on the land in the Jordan valley for generations to grow crops, herd sheep and goats, and to make cheese. They were being threatened and moved constantly as new settlements of only one or a few people brought in the army, which claimed that they had to moved for security reasons. We stopped to talk to another family who had a compound at the side of the road. A house bought for their son and his family on their own land had been demolished, and their aubergine crop was rotting in a heap in front of the house because they could not get it to market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para8"><a name="07062665000230">There is terrible poverty and abuse of human rights in the Jordan valley. The people there are being grossly neglected.

The Hamas takeover in Gaza is not the cause of the problem, but the consequence of it. The refusal of the UK and the  <br>

EU to provide aid to the Palestinian Authority following the Hamas election victory has helped to create the problem. The arming of Fatah by US and Israeli forces to enable it to fight Hamas in Gaza made the takeover inevitable. Now it seems that efforts are to be made to offer money and inducements to President Abbas to accept the monstrous ghettoes as the promised Palestinian state. As Uri Avnery, the great Israeli peace campaigner, said, they want him to act as a quisling, and that will not bring peace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para10"><a name="07062665000232">In conclusion, the situation in the Palestinian territories is deeply distressing and depressing, and the Government and the EU are colluding in that oppression and the building of a new apartheid regime. In particular, Israel has privileged access to the EU market under a trade treaty that, like all EU trade treaties, contains human rights conditions. I hope that the Minister will explain why those conditions are not invoked to insist on Israeli compliance with international law. That is a big lever, and Israel would be frightened of losing access to the EU market. I wish that we would make use of that for everyone&#146;s benefit.</p>

The UK and the EU are, sadly, colluding in that, and the consequences are causing terrible suffering, and endangering the future. I truly hope that our new Prime Minister will reconsider that policy, and that the Opposition parties will reconsider and bring pressure to bear to bring the situation back from the brink and to ensure that the centrepiece of UK policy is a just peace and Israeli compliance with international law.</p>

On my last visit but one, I went to see some old lefties&#151;I do not know how to describe them&#151;in a kibbutz up on the old Jerusalem road. Very reluctantly, they told me that life had become easier since the barrier was built because they were not worried about their kids going out, as suicide bombers were finding it much harder to come in from Nablus and other towns. I tried to argue then, and I argue now, that they will find ways of getting in and killing innocent citizens, because resentment will continue to build up unless the core issue is tackled.</p>

release of captives on both sides&#151; Corporal Shalit, the soldiers who were kidnapped by Hezbollah, the councillors and elected parliamentary representatives of the Palestinian people. Now is the time to make such moves, and I hope that after the disaster in Gaza there will be a sense that this historic opportunity should not be missed, and that misery should not be heaped on the existing misery.</p>

He brought to the situation a sharp series of observations, which the right hon. Lady complemented today, and he understands the gravity of the situation. If the west bank statelet&#151;that group of cantons&#151;fails, one wonders where the conflict will spread to next. Jordan, with its huge Palestinian population, would be in grave danger, and King Abdullah is well aware of that. He was at Sharm el-Sheikh, as were Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para20"><a name="07062665000245">We welcome Prime Minister Olmert&#146;s statement that he will work, with President Abbas as a true partner, towards the establishment of a two-state solution and the implementation of the road map. There are some positive aspects, but I agree with the right hon. Lady that it is a pretty bleak picture. It is as bleak as I can ever remember it, but the decision by Prime Minister Olmert to transfer the withheld revenues is probably a positive step forward, and we look forward to the implementation of the commitments to increase freedom of movement and expand trade connections in the west bank. Such actions are not rocket science; they can easily be done and they could make a big difference, if only to that family about whom the right hon. Lady spoke, with their crop of aubergines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para21"><a name="07062665000246">Such actions are vital to the Palestinian people, and they have helped to improve the humanitarian and economic situation, which is critical. We welcome Prime Minister Olmert&#146;s pledge to ensure the continued supply of humanitarian aid to Gaza. As the right hon. Lady knows, we have earmarked funding for that project. It does not address the central issue that she has raised today, but there is an immediate humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which the international community must address. It is important that the international community works together to help all Palestinian people.</p>

Lady did not mention this point, because time is always limited in such debates, but President Abbas, among others, has said that there ought to be an international peacekeeping force in Gaza certainly, if not on the west bank. I can see the right hon. Lady shaking her head, and one cannot imagine who would donate the troops to such a force. They would have to fight their way in, there would be bloodshed and mayhem on a huge scale, and quite frankly, I cannot see the idea coming off.</p>

hard as we possibly can to think again about its policy of incorporating Palestinian villages and land within the confines of that wall. As she said, the Israelis have a perfect right to defend themselves, and if they want to build a wall, it is up to them, but it ought to be along the agreed frontier&#151;such as it is&#151;that was defined in 1967. It ought not to encroach on Palestinian territory. </p>

In so many ways, that is what such debates are for&#151;so that we are reminded constantly of the reality of what can sometimes look like great, strategic trends and events on the world stage. However, for the family whom the right hon. Lady described so vividly, the reality is that their lives have been shattered. Many other families&#146; lives have been, too. I have always considered myself to be a friend of the Palestinian people and the Israeli people. I was brought up in a home in which the dreams of everybody who was interested in the subject were about people living alongside each other peacefully, not even in separate states.</p>

I have seen the successive invasions of Israel, and what the Israelis have done in an attempt to head off what they perceive as threats to the Israeli heartland, which has usually meant extending territory. My message to the Israelis is simple; if they are to live in peace side by side with their neighbours, the Israelis must help them become viable states with economies that can live in a competitive world. They need the education, skills, infrastructure and wherewithal to do all that, but most important, they need the self-respect and dignity that we enjoy as members of sovereign states.</p>

 May I press the Minister to reconsider his view on Israeli access to the EU market?

that point, but with respect to the right hon. Lady, &#147;colluding&#148; is certainly the wrong word to use. I know that she chose that word very carefully, but I do not think that it is the right one. I can speak only subjectively from my meeting with other European Ministers. She, too, met her counterparts from the EU and other nations many times. There is at one extreme a sense of hopelessness, which she also described today in a very grim analysis of the situation. I am at the other extreme. I keep telling myself that we have material to work with, and that it is a very small part of the world. What is Gaza? Ten miles wide, and at the most, 35 to 40 miles long. It has a wonderful beach on the Mediterranean, and I remember vividly the first time I ever walked on it, thinking, &#147;Why is this a poor part of the world? Why haven&#146;t people here got any jobs?&#148; It seemed mad to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para27"><a name="07062665000254">The right hon. Lady expressed the hope that my right hon. Friend the new Prime Minister would take the issue by the scruff of the neck and try to do something with it. She knows that he has been very interested for a very long time in trying to work with the Israelis and the Arab countries in the area to do something about that economy and that infrastructure. I disagree with her about the effect of that general sense of good will towards Israel and Palestine&#151;the desire throughout Europe that there should be a good outcome, and peace and prosperity in the future. In the end, we disagree about whether applying a screw to the Israelis on the question of human rights compliance would achieve a great deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="70626h0011.htm_para28"><a name="07062665000255">We should at every possible opportunity engage the Israelis on human rights and on compliance with their undertakings, which, as a consequence, enable them to enjoy access to the European market. We should talk to them about that, but I have a feeling that there are already far too many strictures on all sides to add another one. It would just create more tension, and we should try to build on what we have, aim for the high ground and figure out how we can get there by engaging with both sides.</p>
