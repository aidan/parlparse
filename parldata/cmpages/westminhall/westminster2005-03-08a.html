<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50308h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Prisk  (Hertford and Stortford)</b>  (Con): I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delighted to have secured this debate on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impact of the Government&#039;s policies on the M11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growth area and on my constituency in particular. For those who do not have the pleasure of knowing where my constituency is, Hertford and Stortford is in East Hertfordshire, which is the only rural district left in the county. As I shall explain, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government&#039;s planning and development policies represent the greatest challenge in a generation to my constituents&#039; environment and quality of life.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">Indeed, the east of England plan, which puts those policies into practice, is currently out to consultation. For my constituency, it would mean 20,800 new houses or a 36 per cent. rise in population. We would have 47,000 extra people, using up to 28,000 more cars. The plan would mean 2,500 more peak-time commuters on a railway service that is already overstretched, as most hon. Members who use the line will know. It would also create the need for 3,700 extra school places, which would mean 300 more pupils for every secondary school in my constituency. Just as importantly, perhaps, the plan would mean the destruction of thousands of acres of green fields and the wildlife that lives in them. For those and other reasons, the plan is opposed by the overwhelming majority of my constituents. We believe that it is unnecessary and unsustainable, and that the process driving it is, frankly, undemocratic.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">No one is suggesting that there should be no development; of course, there is a need to provide more housing for those on lower incomes. Yet the scale of the developments proposed is far in excess of the need in our area. Indeed, my constituents are not the only people withholding their support from the plan. Somewhat bizarrely, the sponsoring body itself, the East of England regional assembly, has withdrawn its support for the plan. Thus, we have the nonsense of a plan being promoted by a body that does not support it to a community that does not want it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">Underlying the regional plan are the Government&#039;s policies on the green belt and on what they like to call sustainable communities, and I want to examine those policies further. About two years ago, in, I think, February 2003, the Deputy Prime Minister proudly announced the launch of his sustainable communities plan. It was an ambitious statement, but it had some rather fundamental flaws. First&#151;this may seem somewhat strange to hon. Members&#151;there was no definition of what a sustainable community actually is. Secondly, the policy failed to incorporate the understood and accepted principles of sustainable 
<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
development. Indeed, as the Environmental Audit Committee put it in its recent report,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;environmental considerations remain a bolt-on rather than a primary concern.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">Two years on, in January 2005, after much labouring on the issue and, no doubt, thousands of consultants&#039; studies and investigations, the Deputy Prime Minister finally came up with a definition:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;Sustainable communities are places where people want to live and work, now and in the future.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">Wow! What a lot of money was well spent. I can see that we got good value for money and incisive thinking, but what does it mean in practice? What are the key determinants that make up a community that is deemed to be sustainable? How do we balance growth against protecting our environment? What does all this mean for my constituents and the constituents of my right hon. and hon. Friends in the plan&#039;s growth areas? For a sustainable communities plan to be worthy of its name, surely it should be founded on the environmental principles of sustainable development. Yet these policies lack that foundation. As the Government&#039;s own Environment Agency put it, the housing plans for the south-east and my area are &quot;an environmental time bomb&quot;. Those are its words, not mine.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">I shall talk briefly about green-belt planning. Ever since it was introduced by Duncan Sandys back in the 1950s, green-belt policy has been accepted across the House as a great success. It has contained communities and helped them to renew, and it has allowed us to prevent urban sprawl. In 2003, however, the Government changed the rules as part of their new plan. That went largely unnoticed by the experts, let alone the public. The Deputy Prime Minister announced that the Government would


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;maintain or increase green-belt land&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">&#151;and this is key&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;in every region in England.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5 February 2003; Vol. 399, c. 275.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">In other words, the policy has changed from protecting specific sites and is now based on the total acreage, but as hon. Members will know, the essence of a green belt is that it is the permanent prohibition of development in a specific location. For example, the metropolitan green belt in my constituency should be permanent to prevent London and towns and other areas in my constituency from becoming one large urban mass. Yet the Government&#039;s policy is that they could release such land if they were to re-badge land somewhere else in the region as green belt. I assume&#151;perhaps the Minister will clarify this point&#151;that if the Government were to de-designate a couple of hundred acres in east Hertfordshire from the metropolitan green belt, they could redesignate land around Peterborough and claim that they had fulfilled the policy. However, people would regard that as nonsense.
</p>






<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50308h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire)</b>  (Con): Surely there is another danger in that agricultural land that will be protected as such and would not be developed can be called green belt? Green belt can thereby be eaten up by re-branding agricultural land.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 369WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>






<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50308h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : My hon. Friend highlights another problem with this policy change, whose implications are enormous. In principle, any land in any of the constituencies represented in the Chamber today that is currently designated green belt could be developed. That is why I argue that there is no longer a green belt, but an elastic band that is designed to stretch as far as possible to accommodate any change or proposal. That is a huge mistake.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">Loosening the constraints on urban development undermines the redevelopment of existing towns. After all, why would property developers waste their time and money on a complex, time-consuming and less profitable urban renewal project when more profitable green-belt sites only a mile or so away might come on to the market? My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and I have already seen speculators from abroad pegging out greenfield sites to encourage people in this process. I hope that the Minister will explain why the Government have made the change and how she can justify it to my constituents.
</p>






<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50308h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. John Hayes  (South Holland and The Deepings)</b>  (Con): My hon. Friend is advancing a powerful argument about the elastic belt of the Deputy Prime Minister. He is not the only one who holds the view that he has expressed. The Library has made it absolutely clear&#151;I refer directly to what it has said&#151;that the land that has been added to the green belt since 1997 is in areas where development pressure is not the greatest. That is exactly as my hon. Friend says, and it comes from an empirical source rather than a partisan one.
</p>






<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50308h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, which highlights the fact that such a view is held not only by a small group, but by the professionals involved and the experts who study these issues.
</p>






<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50308h01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Edward Davey  (Kingston and Surbiton)</b>  (LD): Is the hon. Gentleman concerned that there is a 17.5 per cent. tax incentive to build on greenfield sites rather than to repair, convert and use existing buildings?
</p>






<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50308h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : I am aware that the Liberal Democrats are hoping to increase the tax on new homes by equalising the VAT levels.
</p>






<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50308h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Simon Burns  (West Chelmsford)</b>  (Con): Oh.
</p>






<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50308h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : I did not know that my hon. Friend was not aware of that, but that is the Liberal Democrats&#039; proposal. There is a danger in such an approach, because many young first-time buyers who are hoping to buy new homes will face those costs, but I understand the underlying issue that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) raises.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">Given those flaws in the Government&#039;s policies, some of us had thought that they at least understood that none of their ambitions could be fulfilled without the necessary infrastructure. Indeed, Lord Rooker is on record as saying this in evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;We are not going to have growth without the infrastructure.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">On the back of that assertion, he encouraged many members of the East of England regional assembly to back the regional plan by saying that the Government 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 370WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
would of course fund essential infrastructure, and so the assembly backed the plan. Yet when the initial bid for funds, particularly for transport, was submitted, 75 per cent. of the value of the bid was refused. That is why EERA members have withdrawn their support. Will the Minister tell us why Lord Rooker made a promise that he could not keep? Why should we believe that bids for future years will fare any better?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">There is one speculative development scheme that highlights all the worst aspects of these policies and how damaging they could be to our environment if they are not amended. The scheme in question is promoted by an oil company&#039;s pension fund, and it is a plan for a new settlement of at least 10,000 houses to be built on 3,000 acres of green belt. While the owner, BP, calls the development &quot;Harlow North&quot;, hon. Members may be surprised to learn that it is not actually in Harlow. It is not even in Essex. Rather peculiarly, it will be built in Hertfordshire. First, the scheme relies on the release of at least 1,500 acres of green-belt land, and 3,000 acres of land in total. &quot;BP New Town&quot;, as I have christened it&#151;sadly, I suspect that that is what it will be known as&#151;would swamp the villages of Eastwick and Gilston, High Wych and Hunsdon, and link Harlow with Sawbridgeworth, Ware and Hertford, making one long urban sprawl. That would result in the loss of some of the most beautiful landscape in Hertfordshire, and according to the expert report of the 1974 plan that last looked at Harlow&#039;s future, the damage to the character of Harlow would be &quot;irreparable&quot;.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">Harlow, as a 42-year-old new town, certainly needs renewing. I accept that, as do many local people. However, by creating a new settlement next door to Harlow, this scheme, which draws on some of the worst aspects of the Government&#039;s policies, would divert much-needed resources from the town&#039;s regeneration. It would be bad not just for the countryside, but for the town. As if that were not enough, BP&#039;s new town would be sited on a hill directly below Stansted&#039;s flight path. The roofs of some 10,000 homes&#151;and, I assume, of 20,000 to 25,000 people&#151;would be just 600 m beneath the wheels of incoming aircraft. Who on earth would want to live there?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">The reality of the Government&#039;s policies on development along the M11 is that our communities would not be sustained; they would be swamped. In lacking the principles of sustainable development and in allowing urban sprawl across green-belt land, the Government&#039;s policies will be bad both for the environment and for the much-needed renewal of our existing communities. We need new homes, but we also need to ensure that our ambitions for growth do not ignore our environment and our quality of life. As they stand today, these Government policies are wrong in principle, and I believe that they will prove to be unworkable in practice.

that could have such a harsh impact on so many communities in Essex, Suffolk, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire.
</p>






<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50308h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b>  (Mr. John McWilliam): Order. Before the hon. Gentleman develops his argument&#151;this point does not relate to what he is saying&#151;I wish to say that this is a local debate, and that in the circumstances, having seen the hon. Members who wish to speak, I am content not to use Mr. Speaker&#039;s ruling in respect of limiting the winding-up speeches.
</p>






<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50308h01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : Thank you Mr. Deputy Speaker.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">I rise both in sorrow and in anger about what the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government are seeking to do by imposing a top-down&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solution to house building that, frankly, is environmental vandalism on a scale that has not been seen since the introduction of the original planning laws in this country. The devastation that it will cause to environments throughout the region is incalculable, and it will never be possible to turn back the clock. Once greenfield and green-belt land has been built on and concreted over, there is no way for it to be successfully restored to its original condition.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">The Chelmsford local authority area adjoins the M11 corridor and is part of the growth area for those horrendous plans. The impact will be particularly difficult in that area. We have been told that we have to produce 14,000 homes as part of the Government&#039;s schemes. That is unsustainable, unwarranted and grossly unfair. To add insult to injury, the Chelmsford local authority area has been used in some ways as a dumping ground for housing to fulfil the Government&#039;s diktat. As everyone accepts, 2,500 of the 14,000 houses being imposed have nothing to do with the local housing needs of the Chelmsford local authority area, or even of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mid-Essex area. They are being imposed on Chelmsford simply and solely to relieve the pressure on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;housing in the south of Essex. To my mind, that must be as wrong as the decision to put such a large scale of housing into one local authority area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">The sad fact is that nobody has given any thought to the implications that that will have with regard to the existing infrastructure. Seeking to relieve pressure in such a way in the south of a county logically suggests that the vast majority of the people who will live in the homes in question will probably work in the south of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;county&#151;particularly, in this case, in the Thames gateway, which is being developed at the moment. Such people will have to travel to work mostly by car, not by train, and that will cause even more congestion and problems for our transportation system in Essex.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">On top of that, we do not have the sustainable infrastructure to carry the 14,000 houses. The policy of the last Conservative Government and this Government has been that there must be maximum use of brownfield sites. I suspect that no one disagrees with that common-sense policy. It is important that brownfield sites should be redeveloped rather than greenfield sites, or before they are moved on to.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">Chelmsford local authority has spent a considerable amount of time successfully identifying brownfield sites in the borough and developing them to help meet the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;targets that have been thrust upon it. It has been imaginative and, as I have said, successful. However, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 372WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to tell the Minister that there is a limit to the local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authority&#039;s brownfield land, and that limit is well&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short of being able to accommodate the target of 14,000 houses that the authority has to fulfil. That means that greenfield sites in the borough will have to absorb the extra housing, and that will be a loss to the borough as more and more of them are concreted over.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">We have an interesting situation in Chelmsford; where would the houses go? To date, no definitive decisions have been made, because two years ago, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incoming local authority threw out the structure plan proposed by the previous Liberal Democrat administration. That was an interesting episode in terms of how Liberal Democrats operate. There is a village called Boreham in the north-east of my constituency; it is a small, compact village community that identifies itself with its local population. It used to be a Liberal Democrat council seat, and when the Liberal Democrat councillor retired three years ago, forcing a by-election, the Liberal Democrats descended on the village, giving categorical assurances that none of the extra housing would be imposed on it. The electorate were wiser than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Liberal Democrats gave them credit for: they replaced the retiring councillor not with another Liberal Democrat, but with a Conservative, on a 30 per cent. swing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">Within six months, the Liberal Democrat council had drawn up its plans to place 2,200 houses in the village, despite the promises not to do so that it had given only five months before. Fortunately, the Liberal Democrat administration was thrown out by the general electorate of Chelmsford in the last local elections. The proposal, which was a breach of the voters&#039; trust, was abandoned. Chelmsford went back to the drawing board and it is successfully going through the procedures. That does not detract, however, from the difficult decisions that will have to be taken as a result of the Government&#039;s diktat on how many houses we should have.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">As to the knock-on effect, swathes of greenfield sites&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be concreted over. As my hon. Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Hertford and Stortford rightly said,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infrastructure would be needed to sustain those communities and help them develop. That includes the health service, education, the transportation system and water. There is a water shortage, and winters such as the one that we have just had are placing increased pressures on the eastern region and the south-east of the country, because of lack of rainfall. There are not enough natural resources to sustain such house building.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">There will also be pressures on our budgets. Given the amount of house building going on already, it is extraordinary that the Chelmsford local authority area&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does not get extra help from the Department of Health in the way that other communities closer to the M11 do. When lobbied, the Department of Health has steadfastly refused to accept that the growth areas attached to the M11 corridor should get more funding to take into account the ever-increasing population. Because of house building on brownfield sites, there is already an ever-increasing population. In the past five years, the electorate in my constituency has grown from 75,000 to 81,000 people. That is 6,000 extra bodies, excluding children under 18, who are living in the area, and using and requiring the local services. But the Government are turning a blind eye to those increased 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 373WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
pressures and demands, and they are refusing to help in the transition as the population increases. That must be wrong.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">In the final analysis, it is totally wrong that a Government in Whitehall who, not unnaturally, are not familiar with every area of a town should impose their will on local people and local elected representatives, and say that an area has to take its proportion of the extra housing demanded in the area by central Government.
</p>






<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50308h01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : My hon. Friend is representing his constituents powerfully and effectively, as always. Will his constituents be as concerned as mine that, unbeknown to them, the planning policies have changed? Instead of planning guidance being just that&#151;non-statutory guidance&#151;constituents will find that their local authority may have to put such housing proposals in place in future, even if they have elected a council whose clear policy is the reverse?
</p>






<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50308h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : My hon. Friend makes an extremely powerful and worrying point, and he is absolutely right. There is grave concern that the Government, through their constant interference, are placing more power at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the centre in Whitehall, which can overrule representatives who were elected because they wanted to take one type of planning decision, but find that their hands are tied and that they are unable to take such action because of the decisions of central Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">The other matter that causes grave concern and upset in my constituency is the role of the East of England regional assembly. It is unelected and it has made&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decisions that disregarded the interests of Essex, Hertfordshire and parts of Suffolk and south Cambridgeshire.
</p>






<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50308h01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : I am almost hesitant to interrupt my hon. Friend&#039;s flow, but several constituents have expressed to me the worry that the crossover with the Government&#039;s policies on the standards board may mean that when councillors are campaigning on whether the assembly is wrong, they may preclude themselves from engaging in a debate in council in due course. There may be a bizarre scenario in which elected members of local authorities are precluded from participating in such activity.
</p>






<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50308h01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : Absolutely. As my hon. Friend will undoubtedly agree, such a development would be complete nonsense and a travesty of local democracy. We must face up to such matters, however, because we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a Government who are determined to interfere and lay down the law. My hon. Friends and I believe in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local democracy and think that decisions should be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken locally; there should be bottom-up decisions, not superimposed top-down decisions. Local elected councillors and local communities have the best understanding of their area and its present and future requirements. They are far better qualified to make the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decisions that best meet the needs and the future requirements of local communities than central Government, who probably have little knowledge of the local area and certainly have little interest in it.

<a name="50308h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">I believe passionately that what the Government are doing is wrong. It is dangerous because it will destroy so much of our environment. It will have the knock-on effect of impacting adversely on local communities as more urban sprawl leads to soulless communities that will have no true identity with their area. It is wrong that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Government should superimpose those decisions, which are irreversible, on communities that do not want them. In no way are they prepared to listen to a just argument or to think again, however passionate, reasonable and right the pleas are for them to do so.

I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisk) on securing such an important debate.

Let us consider the area of Cole Green and its five greens in the south of my constituency. Those areas have already had to put up with a great deal of gravel extraction over the years. To add on top of that the threat of extra housing development seems extremely unfair.

However, does it really have to tolerate extensive extra housing development? Standon and Puckeridge are other historic centres on the junction of the A10 and the A120. Are they expected to take hundreds of extra houses?

<a name="50308h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">The Environmental Audit Committee considered the Government&#039;s so-called sustainable communities plan and found that it had not been thought through at all. No evidence had been taken about the environmental impact. The Committee wrote an incredibly critical, savage report attacking the Government&#039;s ignorant approach. I want to ask the Minister whether any serious thought has been given to the plans as they relate to one to another. The growth area that we are talking about&#151;the M11 corridor&#151;is next to, or quite close to, the growth area for Milton Keynes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">It is worth recording that the north of the M11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corridor has some large cities and towns, such as Peterborough and Cambridge, which are surrounded by sparsely populated areas. However, the south of the corridor, in Hertfordshire, is quite the opposite. It is made up of small market towns and villages, quite close to one another, and they are not large places. They have populations of 20,000 or 30,000.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">The Government seem to think that we have got it wrong in Hertfordshire and that we ought to have large towns with sparsely populated areas around them that could be developed. That is exactly what they propose for Harlow and Stevenage&#151;that Stevenage should have 14,400 extra houses tacked on the side. Interestingly referring to what my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford said, they will not be under the flight path for Stansted this time, but the flight path for Luton. Why should we change Hertfordshire from what it has always been&#151;a tracery of lanes with small market towns and villages&#151;into something like Cambridgeshire?
</p>






<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50308h01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : As always, my hon. Friend highlights both the beauty of his constituency and why that should be preserved. There is another difference between us and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cambridgeshire; we are abutting London. The metropolitan green belt is the essence of why the pattern of communities that we have now is right. Does my hon. Friend share my view that if we were to follow the diktat of the reports presented by the Government, the danger is that we will get not a Cambridge with a sparse population around the edge, but one large urban mass from the Thames all the way up to Stansted airport?
</p>






<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50308h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : That is exactly the point, and my hon. Friend puts it very well. If we develop the most densely populated county as though it were not, we will end up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with something unbearable. As with the Harlow scheme, the scheme for Stevenage is to build the houses in the North Herts district rather than the Stevenage district. We will therefore end up with half of Stevenage in north Hertfordshire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">At the same time as the plan to develop Stevenage is the plan in the Milton Keynes growth area to develop Luton, which is the second largest conurbation in the eastern region. It needs development&#151;no one could argue with that&#151;but what will happen if we develop both Stevenage and Luton, given that they are only about five or six miles apart? We will end up either with the two merging or with competition that is damaging to one or the other.

<p>
<a name="50308h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">Did anybody think about what will happen on the border between the growth areas? It is silly to try to develop Stevenage and Luton in that way, side by side. As my hon. Friend said, there is a danger that we will end up with a conurbation that I would call &quot;Hevenage&quot;&#151;Hitchin and Stevenage&#151;but it could also be &quot;Bevenage&quot; if Baldock is included, or &quot;Levenage&quot; if Luton is included. There could be a massive conurbation in north Hertfordshire, which would impinge on the areas that are the lungs of the county. The villages that I have mentioned, which are also supposed to take extra housing, would be threatened. We would end up with a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;massive conurbation and every village and small community would have large numbers of houses tacked on to it. The area, which people value, would be spoiled not only for the people who live in the villages, but for those who go to the rural areas to walk and enjoy the countryside.
</p>






<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50308h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : Does my hon. Friend agree that there is illogicality at the heart of the Government&#039;s proposal? People want to go to districts such as East Hertfordshire and North Hertfordshire because of the quality of the environment, so is it not ironic that the plan that seeks to respond to that demand will destroy the very reason that people go there?
</p>






<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50308h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : Yes, of course. I have always thought it unfair on other parts of the United Kingdom to put all the effort, resource and money into the south-east and east of England. Surely, we ought not to knock down 400,000 houses in the north and put 400,000 houses in the south. That is nonsense. The Government need to get a grip of their regional policy and to allow the market to work; there is obviously a market in housing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">My hon. Friend raised the issue of resources. In the south of my constituency between Hertford and Stevenage, and in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, is the River Beane, which is very dry. It does not have the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water it once did, and local residents are extremely worried about that, as is the River Beane Preservation Society. That problem reflects the fact that our area is the driest part of England. I cannot see where the water for the developments will come from. The Minister may say that it can be found and, of course, the water authorities have a statutory duty to achieve that result, but how will they get water down from the north of England to the south for these developments? There certainly is not enough water that can be brought up through boreholes; as I said, the River Beane is already short of water.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">There is also a problem with roads. We are talking about the M11, but nearby is the A1(M). If the Minister were to go on the A1(M) one morning, she would see that it is already snarled up. It is extremely congested between our area around Baldock down to Stevenage and beyond, and coming into London. What is the plan to widen that road? I am not aware of any such plan, but there should be one. If the proposals are going to go ahead, money should be spent on the A1(M). Will the Minister tell us when the A1(M) will be widened, because we would love to know?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">What about the trains? If there is to be this extremely large population increase, a lot of the extra people will want to travel to London to work. The Welwyn viaduct

is narrow; it has two lanes for trains. If the number of trains going into London is to be increased, either that viaduct must be widened or longer station platforms must be provided so that the trains can be longer&#151;and, in any event, extra power on the line will be needed. Will the Minister tell us when we will get those things, because we would like to know? If the Government are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seriously considering building a second Welwyn viaduct, that would be very big news for the <i>Hertfordshire Mercury</i>.

Therefore, he makes a powerful point.
</p>

I had a meeting last Friday with representatives of the rail company to talk about those problems, and about improving Letchworth station. They said that we might have a better idea about whether we will get longer platforms by 2012. That is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;almost eight years away, which is quite a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mentioned the Welwyn viaduct, and the representative from Network Rail almost fell off his chair at the thought of the hundreds of millions of pounds that would need to be spent to build a second one.

<a name="50308h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">We are 300 doctors short for the next three years, so we need to recruit 300 doctors in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire over that time. How many doctors does the Minister think we will need to cope with the M11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corridor growth, and where will they come from? The current plans of the work force study are based on the hope that some asylum seekers will be doctors and that they might fill the gap. Is the Minister relying on people who might accidentally come to this country as a way of us getting the more than 300 extra doctors that we will need?

We pay a lot more tax than other parts of the country, but we get a lot less for our it. Can the Minister tell us what will happen about services?

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50308h01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Edward Davey  (Kingston and Surbiton)</b>  (LD): I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congratulate the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) on securing this important debate, which gives us a chance to air our views on this Government development proposal. I would like to start off by taking an overview, because the Government have four growth areas around London and the south-east. The Thames gateway is the largest such area, but there is also Ashford, Milton Keynes and the M11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corridor, and of those four growth areas, the M11 corridor is the least proven and the most controversial.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">I am certainly in favour in general of the things that are proposed in the Thames gateway and around Ashford and Milton Keynes. There are problems with transport infrastructure in all three of those growth areas. There are one or two problems with flooding in the Thames gateway, with the Association of British Insurers saying&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that perhaps 10,000 homes would be in danger of flooding if the plans were to go ahead. There are individual problems in those three growth areas, but, on the whole, they seem to make some sort of sense, and the local councils have, in general, been prepared to accept some of the thrust of the Government&#039;s policy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">However, the M11 corridor has generated a degree of controversy that we have not seen for a long time. The three Conservative Members&#039; speeches explained why that concern is so deeply felt. While I am giving the overview of the sustainable communities plan, I want to take up the point that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) made about other parts of the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">There is no doubt that there are other parts of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country that would welcome more homes, less&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demolition and more economic regeneration. My colleagues on Liverpool city council have been doing a tremendous job in the past six years of turning that city around and attracting more than &#163;2 billion of private sector investment in the city centre alone. With the award of the status of European capital of culture, Liverpool is experiencing a big regeneration. Yet Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prescott is asking parts of Liverpool to have more homes demolished.
</p>






<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50308h01_spnew26"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. Hon. Members should refer to other Members by their constituencies or the title of their office, not by name.
</p>






<p><a name="st_27"><a name="50308h01_spnew27"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : I was tempted by the new name of the county, which I had not heard before, so you were right to pull me up on that, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">There is no doubt that, although some demolition in the city of Liverpool was accepted by the community, the Deputy Prime Minister has pushed ahead with a much higher number of demolitions, which goes against 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 379WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the wishes of the community. It seems absurd, as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire has said, that we should force homes on areas that clearly do not want such a high number, and demolish them in areas that have the potential to attract more people; they are quality homes, and it sometimes costs &#163;60,000 to demolish a home in pathfinder scheme areas. The Government have the overall balance of the sustainable communities plan wrong, particularly with respect to the M11 corridor and cities such as Liverpool.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">To focus on the M11 corridor, some of the greatest concerns that have been expressed to me by council leaders such as Lorna Spenceley of Harlow or Alan Dean of Uttlesford are about lack of local democratic involvement. Hon. Members have this morning talked about the need for elected representatives and local communities to have a real say, so that the decisions are local ones, not imposed ones.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">It is bizarre that we spent 18 months passing the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, which the Government told us would set up new local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development frameworks, with community involvement statements and so on, but at the same time a plan is being pushed forward to override all that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nonsense. A different approach would be to persuade and incentivise people and to involve them in planning.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">For example, it is clear that there are small villages and market towns in parts of the M11 corridor that are prepared to accept some housing. There is no doubt about that. The people there see a need for local housing and regeneration and a need to make vulnerable rural settlements sustainable. However, that is a matter of an affordable housing programme&#151;one that is diffused, not focused in one or two areas.
</p>






<p><a name="st_28"><a name="50308h01_spnew28"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : I recently discussed this matter with Councillor Mike Carver, who is the leader of East Hertfordshire council, and Councillor F. John Smith, who is the leader of North Hertfordshire council. They made the point that only about 60 per cent. of the housing in question is being provided to meet local need. About 40 per cent. of it is being provided on the basis that the Government want to attract people into our area. Can the hon. Gentleman understand why they would want to do that?
</p>






<p><a name="st_29"><a name="50308h01_spnew29"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : There is a concern&#151;although I am not sure that it has been expressed in these terms this morning&#151;that Stansted, for example, will attract huge amounts of development. The Government are trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plan houses for an extension of an airport that is not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wanted by local people, which is probably the most&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsustainable form of transport infrastructure imaginable and which is not the top priority for the area. The whole idea is perverse.
</p>






<p><a name="st_30"><a name="50308h01_spnew30"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can help me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solve the mystery of why the East of England Development Agency thinks that we need about 500,000 new homes, on the basis of a second runway at Stansted, but the east of England regional assembly also thinks that we want 500,000 new homes, yet does not take account of the second runway. How does the hon. Gentleman think that that happened?

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="50308h01_spnew31"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to describe me as an expert earlier, but he was in danger of going beyond my detailed knowledge of parts of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposal. I am afraid that I cannot address the quandary that he raises. I do not know whether he was asking a rhetorical question, but I take the point about the kinds of homes that are needed in such areas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">One of the problems with the sustainable communities plan is that we have adopted a top-down, predict-and-provide approach towards the homes that are needed. There has not been a bottom-up linking with the question of who will live there, what types of homes people actually want and what is the housing need there now.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">The evidence that I have seen suggests that there are problems in rural communities and market town communities with people who are hidden homeless&#151; adults still living at home and older people wishing to downsize yet facing a lack of available properties. A sustainable approach that worked with the community would be based on a different way of thinking about the types of houses that are needed and where they should be sited. That is why local government should be involved. If the decisions are taken based on a report by Professor Barker or some analysis by the ODPM, we are likely to get things wrong, because we will not be focusing on local needs and the local situation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">I have talked to local councillors in the region and it is interesting that some say that there are small villages crying out for a little bit of affordable housing&#151;on exception sites, for example. There is huge local support in some places for perhaps half a dozen or a dozen homes, to support the local services&#151;the post office, pub or school. Some services in such areas are not overstretched and need more people to support them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">If the Government had taken that approach&#151;building up from little pockets&#151;they could probably have provided a solution that did not extend to the 500,000 homes proposed in some of the plans that hon. Members have mentioned. The Government could have dealt with the need in those areas and provided real sustainable community planning.
</p>






<p><a name="st_32"><a name="50308h01_spnew32"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : The hon. Gentleman is rightly highlighting a number of issues, not least the democratic deficit and the ability of local people to get involved. Does he share my view that it is time to scrap the regional assemblies?
</p>






<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50308h01_spnew33"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : That was a good try. There is a case for having some sort of body that takes a wider view, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can give an example from the area. There is concern that some local authorities are saying that homes for the workers who will be needed for the Cambridge science arc development should be built in other local authority areas. There is a need for local people to come together, across local authorities. There is therefore a role for a body such as the regional assembly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">The assemblies should be far more accountable, although we cannot now look to directly elected regional assemblies&#151;the buck has passed on that model. However, I am concerned that the current regional assemblies have people on them who have vested interests that are not covered by Nolan requirements for declaration and people who are not accountable in any way&#151;indirectly or otherwise. There 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 381WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
is a case for a big reform of regional assemblies to ensure that they are better linked to local people. The need for a strategic view on some of the issues is important for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local people. If things do not come from them, they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will come from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. That is the real concern. So, people who are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talking about getting rid of regional assemblies are talking about giving more power to the Deputy Prime Minister.
</p>






<p><a name="st_34"><a name="50308h01_spnew34"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : People in the M11 area, and in my constituency in particular, are looking for someone who will give back powers over what is built and where to the people of Hertfordshire. Is that not what we should do?
</p>






<p><a name="st_35"><a name="50308h01_spnew35"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : I believe that some of the planning powers that were given up to the regional planning boards under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 should be handed back down to county councils, and we pressed that position in the other place.
</p>

</p>






<p><a name="st_37"><a name="50308h01_spnew37"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : Some of them came down from the ODPM to the regional planning boards under that Act and some came up from county councils. Therefore, it depends which powers we are talking about.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">When that legislation went through this place, we wanted the powers not to go up from county councils. We did not get support from Conservatives in the other place on that point, and the hon. Gentleman should be wary of that. We tried to stand firm, but, unfortunately, we did not get the support and the measure was included in the Act. We very much regret that, and we wish that we had had support from the hon. Gentleman&#039;s colleagues in the other place.
</p>






<p><a name="st_38"><a name="50308h01_spnew38"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : Surely the hon. Gentleman recognises that the only reason why the counties are even consulted now is that Conservative amendments were passed in the other place which provided for that to happen?

<p><a name="st_39"><a name="50308h01_spnew39"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : The hon. Gentleman needs to be careful, because the powers that he talked about were a shoddy compromise. We wanted to ensure that county councils did not lose the powers at all, but they were taken up. We were prepared to stand and fight on that one. Unfortunately, his colleagues were not.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">We can welcome some aspects of the M11 corridor development, particularly those around Harlow. I think that there is some cross-party support. Harlow, as a new town, has seen deterioration in its housing stock, and in some of its leisure services and social infrastructure. There is a real case for investment there. Harlow could benefit from extra homes and extra infrastructure investment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford was right to warn that while regeneration and extra investment is needed, how that is done is crucial. North Harlow/ BP new town would not be sustainable. One must ensure that we are not being told where to put houses by oil companies; the local people must make the decisions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">I also want to focus a little more on infrastructure. As I said, the likelihood of railway investment is minimal. The investment funds that the Government have been putting forward for transport infrastructure are also minimal. There seems to be no real strategic long-term thinking about the infrastructure needs of the area&#151;besides making it worse with the investment in Stansted. The Government must go back to the drawing board.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">What Mr. Justice Sullivan said about the case on Stansted was interesting. He said that the Government had overstepped the mark by trying to specify all the detail about the second runway. They were not prepared to leave some of it to local government and they ignored the principle of subsidiarity. They should learn a lesson from that, and, in future, ensure that such infrastructure and transport decisions take account of local opinion.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">However, when one is criticising the Government, one must put forward an alternative. That there has not been a clear alternative is my only criticism of what we have heard so far today. We must recognise that young people need homes, and that there is an affordable housing problem and some thought needs to be given to it. The Liberal Democrats have looked at a range of policies on using existing homes, buildings and land in our urban conurbations. We have looked at getting the tax incentives right and ensuring that the public sector uses its massive land holdings more effectively. There is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a strong case for cutting VAT on repairs and conversions to give the private sector a real incentive to reuse buildings that are lying idle. I have such buildings in my constituency; they are a real eyesore and a waste of land. We need that alternative.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">We also need to come up with innovative housing plans to ensure that the affordable housing that is built remains affordable and available to local people. My party has published its housing policies, and we have talked about mutual homes, about giving a boost to shared equity and about the golden share schemes that Liberal Democrat administrations have piloted in places such as south Shropshire. Our proposals provide a way of dealing with some of these problems that is far&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more sustainable and involves local elected representatives. There is time to think again on these key issues, and I hope that the Government will do so.

Friend the Member for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) on bringing this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important issue to the attention of the House. This is a debate about the environment and protecting the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;green belt; about local democracy and what my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burns) described as the need for a bottom-up, rather than a top-down approach to deciding such important matters; and about developing genuinely sustainable communities and the missed opportunity for urban and suburban regeneration.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">My hon. Friends have made a convincing case. Could there be any better representatives of their respective constituencies than the three who spoke from the Conservative Benches? I doubt it very much. They have described the Government&#039;s plans as a savage attack on the character not only of the countryside, but of existing settlements. The figures that they quoted were stark. My

hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford spoke of a 36 per cent. growth in population in his constituency, with 3,700 extra school places needed. My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford spoke of 14,000 new homes in his constituency and described the plans as unsustainable, unwanted and unfair.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) painted a dreadful picture, and the Minister will have been as shocked by it as you will have been, Mr. Deputy Speaker. He spoke of a sprawling, ugly, soulless conglomeration of hastily built properties, which will damage for ever the character of the beautiful part of our country that he represents. He told us that his constituency would require 300 more doctors over the next three years. I was appalled at the prospect of people in that part of Britain being in desperate circumstances but not being able to access the medial care that they needed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">Conservative Front Benchers share the views expressed by my hon. Friends. We also share those expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan Haselhurst), who has been mentioned in the debate, and my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), who, in the interests of his constituents, is fighting a vigorous campaign against the Government&#039;s proposals to concrete over much of his constituency. Indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister wants to bulldoze the north of England and concrete over the south.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">Resistance is not limited to the Opposition Benches, however. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Committee has considered the matter, and its damning indictments of the Government are worthy of amplification here. The Committee said that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;the impact of such a housing programme on the environment could be unsustainable.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">It also said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;The impact of developing so many homes in the South East, one of the most densely populated regions in Europe, has not been fully assessed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The additional homes could place excessive demands on the environment, leading to the loss of green-field sites and excessive pressure on the water supply and other natural resources&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Government&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has yet to estimate the costs of providing the transport links, health care, education and all the other facilities which new neighbourhoods require.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">The Environmental Audit Committee was equally critical of the Government, saying that

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;the principal loser will be the environment.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para68"><a name="stpa_69">It added that

<p>
<a name="50308h01_para69"><a name="stpa_70">It said that the Government had yet to produce a definition of sustainable communities. Imagine a sustainable communities plan with no real definition of sustainability or what such communities comprise.

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="50308h01_spnew41"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : My hon. Friend is describing the problem eloquently, but perhaps I can cause him even more concern: such a definition is absent two years after the policy was announced.
</p>

Committees have concluded about their own Government&#039;s appalling policy. The Environmental Audit Committee said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;There is disturbing evidence that the sum so far allocated for infrastructure funding will not be anything like sufficient to meet the requirement generated by the Growth Areas.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">That criticism comes not only from Opposition Members; throughout the country, communities are beginning to realise what these proposals&#151;the communities plan and the growth areas&#151;mean for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, their communities and their quality of life. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Medway area, local campaigners such as Mark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reckless, Tim Butcher and Anne Jobson are campaigning with local people against those prospects. My hon. Friends are campaigning in Essex and Hertfordshire, and in Harlow people such as Robert Halfon are taking up the campaign on behalf of local people. In Northampton, Brian Binley and others are doing so. People are leading this campaign across the country.
</p>






<p><a name="st_43"><a name="50308h01_spnew43"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : My hon. Friend should not forget Brooks Newmark, a good campaigner on this issue in Braintree.
</p>






<p><a name="st_44"><a name="50308h01_spnew44"><b> Mr. Hayes </b> : Indeed. I am hoping to visit Braintree and many of those other communities in the next couple of weeks to look at the work being done there.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">There are alternatives, and they have been teased out of me by my hon. Friends. Of course, Conservatives believe that the provision of new housing could play an important part in building, regenerating and sustaining genuine communities, but for that to happen we must ensure that we have the right homes in the right places. An agreed settlement between central and local government on housing growth should balance the need for extra houses with a consideration of landscape and the character of existing settlements. That balance would lie at the heart of a genuinely sustainable housing and planning policy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">I shall pose a series of questions to the Minister. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservatives will scrap the communities plan and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;focus on incremental development of existing settlements. We will protect the green belt more than the Government have done&#151;we could hardly protect it less; my hon. Friends have rightly identified abuse of the principle of the green belt&#151;by putting in place more and tighter green belts. Why do the Government not reappraise the designation of brownfield sites? If 50 per cent. of all brownfield sites in the south-east that are intended for employment purposes were instead used for housing, it would yield 27,000 extra homes at current density levels.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">As I said last week, Barratt Homes tells me that 80 per cent. of its new houses are already built on brownfield land. In the south and south-east, that figure is 90 per cent. The truth is that many more houses could be built on brownfield sites. We could help developers by: reforming the planning system sensibly; making more land available through re-designation; freeing-up public sector land; and lifting some of the burdens and regulations that hamper good practice and enterprise as only Labour Governments can.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">Why do the Government not streamline the planning process for regenerative brownfield development by standardising the processes for gaining planning 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 385WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
permission under section 106 agreements? Why will they not put in place fiscal incentives to bring empty homes back into use&#151;there are 700,000 empty homes across the country, according to the Empty Homes Agency? Why will the Government not scrap the prescriptive bureaucratic standards that stifle innovation, hamper brownfield development and promote monotonous, uniform housing estates? We should emphasise quality of design, rather than compliance with Government diktats. Local authorities should be encouraged to acquire the skills to devise in communion with local communities and developers plans that satisfy the need for housing development without compromising the local environment and quality of life.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">Why will the Government not establish more and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tighter green belts, and redefine suburban back gardens so that they are protected from undesirable development&#151;town cramming, as it has become known under this Government? Why will they not extend the rural exceptions policy to allow small-scale expansion of villages with a mix of new homes, so that we have market housing cross-subsidising the social homes that can play such a useful part in servicing local needs? We must focus development where infrastructure can support it, so why will the Government not ensure that local authorities make infrastructure capacity a key factor in the development control process?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">Today&#039;s debate has highlighted a Government policy that is undeliverable, unsustainable, unneeded and unwanted. Britain needs the right homes in the right places. It needs development on a human scale&#151;incremental, organic, inspiring and shaped by local people. Britain needs to support house builders to regenerate urban and suburban Britain, and it needs to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value the land and safeguard our countryside. There is a shining light at the end of this dark Labour tunnel, and the people of Hertfordshire, Essex and other communities across Britain will be able to bask in that light when this Government are driven from office and an enlightened housing and planning policy is put in place.

</p>






<p><a name="st_47"><a name="50308h01_spnew46"><b> Yvette Cooper </b> : If the hon.

I shall say a little more about the consultation and planning process shortly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">We need to be clear about our starting point: we need to provide more homes for families across the south-east. People are living longer and more people are living alone. Without more homes, people will not be able to live in the communities where they grew up and key workers will not be able to find homes in the communities where they need to work.
</p>






<p><a name="st_48"><a name="50308h01_spnew47"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : The need that the Minister has just outlined is a requirement for 60 per cent. of the houses in the east of England plan. Why must we have the other 40 per cent.?
</p>






<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50308h01_spnew48"><b> Yvette Cooper </b> : The problem faced by Conservative Members here is that they simply do not recognise the close links between the housing market, housing supply and the regional and national economy in this country. They need to recognise the importance of the links with economic growth and the need to support economic growth and prosperity in the region.
</p>

Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald), why has it been accepted that 2,500 of the houses that Chelmsford is expected to build are not to meet the current or future needs of local people, but to relieve pressure on house building in another part of the county?
</p>






<p><a name="st_53"><a name="50308h01_spnew52"><b> Yvette Cooper </b> : At this stage in the process, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual proposals or on specific locations. However, let me again remind the hon. Gentleman of the broad issues. More housing is needed in the eastern region, the south-east and London. We cannot ignore that fact. If we do,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will be to the detriment not only of those who want to get into the housing market but cannot afford to do so, but of our public services, because we will not be able to recruit the people whom we need if they cannot afford anywhere to live. Such an approach would also

&nbsp;<br>

impact on the number of people who are homeless or in temporary accommodation and harm the economy, affecting the prosperity of the region and the nation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">We are already falling short of what is needed. In the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past five years, 550,000 new households have formed in the wider south-east&#151;London and the eastern and south-east regions&#151;but fewer than 400,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new homes have been built. In the past 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years, 12.5 per cent. fewer houses have been built than in previous decades. The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) spoke of allowing the housing market to work. Unfortunately, the evidence of the Barker review is that the housing market is not working in the way that is needed. The rising house prices across the country are not triggering the necessary increase in housing supply; they have not done so for 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years. The issue needs to be confronted, and hon. Members must recognise that.
</p>






<p><a name="st_54"><a name="50308h01_spnew53"><b> Mr. Hayes </b> : The Minister has been generous in giving way, and I hope that she will agree that I was, too. She will understand that demand-side factors&#151;things such as the relative unattractiveness of alternative investment vehicles, the level of borrowing secured against housing equity, the net migration into the country, as recognised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, and interest rates&#151;drive up house prices and keep them up. To address affordability by supply-side means would be to build countless houses. That would be neither sustainable nor deliverable, and it would take a very long time. Why does the Minister not address some of the demand-side factors?
</p>






<p><a name="st_55"><a name="50308h01_spnew54"><b> Yvette Cooper </b> : I know that Opposition Members have tried to maintain that the only problem in the housing market is on the demand side, and that the issue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can somehow be resolved by demand-side measures. Of course, house prices are determined by the relationship between demand and supply, and there are issues in relation to housing as an investment good in various ways. Nevertheless, housing is also a critical consumption good. We cannot deny that; the Barker review was very clear about it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para80"><a name="stpa_81">Given a choice between the economic analysis of the Barker review, produced by a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, and the economic analysis of Conservative Front Benchers, with their previous record on economic policy making, I would go with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate Barker. The Opposition have to recognise the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relationship between the housing market and the economy, and the fact that the housing market is not delivering enough houses to meet need. That problem will get worse unless serious action is taken. The Conservative party&#039;s position of simply abandoning the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustainable communities plan, making huge cuts in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sustainable communities budget and thinking that the matter can be resolved in an incremental way is a position for people living on another planet. It is not realistic, given the scale of the problem and its impact on homelessness, house prices, public services and the regional economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">The east and the south-east already face serious housing pressures. Hon. Members have referred to the need to recruit more doctors and public service professionals. That is a serious issue, but we will have far greater problems recruiting nurses, teachers and health

<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 388WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
professionals across the board if we do not address the housing problems across the region. Several speakers, including the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), have said that we need to offer alternatives, but the Opposition parties are not offering alternatives. Of course we need to do more to increase development on brownfield sites. We have already substantially increased the amount of development on such sites, and we need to do everything that we can to increase that development.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para82"><a name="stpa_83">The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) mentioned building more on employment land. I agree that we need to reappraise employment land in many areas, but he will agree that we should also recognise the need to maintain it and not simply develop dormitories without employment land closely linked to the development of new housing. Nevertheless, we agree that employment land in many locations may be more appropriate for housing. That is exactly why we made changes to planning policy guidance note 3, which was published earlier this year, to require local authorities to do that. So we agree that other measures also need to be taken, but we simply cannot avoid the important need to expand housing in the southern and south-eastern regions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">Several hon. Members have voiced concerns on behalf of their constituents. The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford referred to the concerns of his constituents in East Hertfordshire, which is the least deprived district in the east of England and the eighth least deprived in England as a whole. Like every other part of the east and south-east, it has seen a significant rise in house prices, which are a problem for people who live there and have an impact on the ability to recruit public sector workers. That is why all districts throughout the region need to work together to address the matter. Opposition Members have also voiced concerns about the regional planning process.
</p>






<p><a name="st_56"><a name="50308h01_spnew55"><b> Mr. Prisk </b> : I fully accept, as does East Herts district council, the need to provide homes for people who are described as being on lower incomes and as needing affordable homes, but the independent housing survey 2004 showed that we would need to build 594 homes per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;annum over the next 20 years or so to accommodate all the households that will be needed. Yet the Government&#039;s plan suggests that we should build at twice that rate. Why?
</p>






<p><a name="st_57"><a name="50308h01_spnew56"><b> Yvette Cooper </b> : The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Government&#039;s proposals were based on analysis of the overall need to increase housing throughout the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;region. That is what we need to do. We cannot simply sit by and allow the problems with the housing market, homelessness and economic constraints to continue. I cannot reiterate enough to Opposition Members the importance of the relationship between housing and the overall regional economy. We cannot allow the situation to continue; we need to recognise the importance of responding to housing market pressures throughout the area, not simply in individual districts operating in isolation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">Hon. Members talked about the regional planning process. The east of England plan was developed by local partners, and it will be tested by an independent public examination. The plans are not being imposed by

the Government through the back door; they are being developed through an extensive and rigorous process that is open to public scrutiny. The whole process started back in September 2002 with community workshops, stakeholder events and consultation on options.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">The East of England regional assembly&#151;70 per cent. of its members are local authority members, the majority of whom are Conservative&#151;has worked on a draft, and it has done more work on the London, Stansted, Cambridge and Peterborough area. The public consultation began in December and will end in the middle of next week. The next stage is that an independent panel will review all the issues and hold an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;examination in public.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">Hon. Members asked detailed questions on issues ranging from the water supply to the impact on particular locations and on particular roads. Those matters, and others such as airport noise or the regeneration of particular towns, are exactly the sorts of things that the examination in public needs to address. All such issues need to be properly addressed and openly scrutinised and discussed by the examination in public. It is right that that should happen and that we should go through that process. It is proposed that, in early 2006, the panel would publish a report recommending amendments to the draft regional spatial strategy. There would then be a further opportunity for consultation on the revisions. There are considerable opportunities for discussion and debate across the region and at local level.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">I should also make it clear that we shall not support housing growth at any cost. New housing must respect the environment and be more sustainable than in the past. That is why, as I said, 67 per cent. of new homes are now built on brownfield land, compared with just 56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent. in 1997. We need to continue with brownfield development.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">In 2003, the average density of new homes was 33 per hectare, compared with 25 between 1996 and 2001. In the east of England, about 20,000 homes were built every year between 1996 and 2001, at an average density of 22 homes per hectare. If those homes had been built at a density of 30 homes per hectare, another 7,200 homes could have been built every year on the same land. We are committed to building homes more sustainably and are consulting, for example, on changes to the building regulations to deliver a 25 per cent. improvement in energy efficiency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">Of course, this is not just a matter of individual homes. Homes should be in communities that are more sustainable, and close to jobs and the services that

&nbsp;<br>

people need, so that people can be less dependent on cars and so that we do not repeat the low-density, car-dependent suburban sprawl of previous generations.

<p>
<a name="50308h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">We have made a clear commitment that every English region will maintain or increase the area currently designated as green belt in local plans. The fundamental aim remains to keep land around urban areas permanently open and to prevent urban sprawl. In some exceptional circumstances it may be appropriate to consider whether the most sustainable option may be to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revise green belt boundaries; that would depend on transport links and the location of jobs and services. However, those instances should be the exceptions. The east of England has been considering that.

<a name="50308h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">Hon. Members asked specific questions about funding for services. Funding allocation for public services such as health and education must respond to housing growth. We are already announcing substantial new funding packages for growth areas. For example, there is funding to enable the NHS to increase local service capacity and to ensure that the Department for Education and Skills responds to planned housing growth in forecasting pupil numbers. That is in addition to substantial extra investment in those services&#151;investment that Opposition Members would cut across the board, not only for the growth areas, but throughout the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">The Opposition need to recognise the need for additional housing and for economic prosperity. It is a shame that they still refuse to understand the importance of economic prosperity and of the links between the housing market and the regional economy. That shows that their approach would be not simply to cut houses, but to cut economic growth.

<a name="50308h02_head0"><h3 align=center>British Cellophane</h3>

<a name="time_6">
<a name="50308h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_62"><a name="50308h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ian Liddell-Grainger  (Bridgwater)</b>  (Con): I am delighted to have secured this debate on British Cellophane in Bridgwater. Its name is, in fact, Innovia Films, but it is known to all and sundry as British Cellophane. I wish, unusually, to thank a few people before I start my speech, the first being the Labour candidate for the constituency of Bridgwater at the next general election, Mr. Matthew Burchell, which may seem slightly strange. He works for the Leader of the House of Commons, and without his help it would have been a lot harder to reach the point at which we are today.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para0"><a name="stpa_94">I wish to thank the Transport and General Workers Union for its help, especially Mel Dando. I wish also to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thank John Bloomfield, the managing director of Innovia Films, Bridgwater. He has supplied an enormous amount of information. When the news was announced, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was incredibly helpful and made it clear that she would do all that she could to help.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para1"><a name="stpa_95">British Cellophane has a long and honourable history. It has an enormous background of industrial muscle and might in Bridgwater. It came there more than 50 years ago. I suspect that members of the community did not mind about the smell and were not worried about it environmentally, but just wanted manufacturing capacity. Bridgwater is the only industrial town in the west country. Over the long term, the work force at British Cellophane has been reduced, but it has always had outstanding productivity and an outstanding relationship with its employees and given outstanding help to the town at all levels. I believe that there has only been one industrial dispute and not once throughout its time in Bridgwater has Cellophane been anything other than a massive asset.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para2"><a name="stpa_96">Thirty or forty years ago, Cellophane produced about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500,000 tonnes of cellophane. Cellophane is on everything. In fact, you are probably drinking out of a cellophane container at the moment, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is a massively important commodity throughout the world. However, over the years, its production has reduced from about 500,000 tonnes to 60,000 tonnes. The commodity has to be produced in highly productive, motivated and profitable plants.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para3"><a name="stpa_97">Believe it or not, 124 different types of cellophane are made in Bridgwater. There is an enormous number of different ways to use the film. That shows the level that cellophane has reached. It is a film that can be used for almost anything and it is now in use every day, almost without parallel. However, problems have occurred. Over many years, there have been changes of company and ownership and, in the past few years, the company has changed dramatically. It was bought by Candell Investments. I want to talk about three of its five plants. Two plants are in Britain and one is in America. The two in Britain are productive, motivated plants&#151;one is in the north and one is in Bridgwater.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para4"><a name="stpa_98">I wish to dwell on the plant in Kansas. Over the past few years, Cellophane has felt the strength of the pound. I do not expect the Minister to be able to solve that problem overnight. We know that it is a problem for all manufacturing companies in the United Kingdom. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 392WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that the Minister agrees that manufacturing matters strongly in this country. The problem is something that successive Governments have wrestled with and not always been able to solve because of outside forces, such as the strength of the pound, dollar and euro, but manufacturing should be protected at all times. We cannot allow it to disappear.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para5"><a name="stpa_99">Last year in Bridgwater, we lost Federal Modal; 400&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobs went to Poland because we could not compete. The Government were helpful and, although we have ongoing problems with the pension fund, I cannot fault them for what happened. However, I am greatly worried about the situation in Kansas. I hope that the Minister can help. Kansas state legislators have passed an enormous amount of money to the plant in Kansas&#151;we are talking about millions of dollars, not a few hundred thousand. They voted publicly to give public money to a plant to enable it to undermine us in the United Kingdom. It does not stop there. The plant is unproductive and does not make a profit. Why would one give money to a plant that does not make a profit and is not productive, whether it is in China, Australia or America?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para6"><a name="stpa_100">I hope that the Minister agrees that it is worrying that British jobs in a profitable, highly productive plant are being put under threat by a plant that is not profitable, not productive and makes about half the types of cellophane that we do. It cannot even keep up with our production levels, yet we are losing to that plant money that should come to us.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para7"><a name="stpa_101">Today at 3.30 pm, a deputation from the Transport and General Workers Union and Glyn Ford, the MEP for the south-west, are meeting Peter Mandelson in Europe to discuss this matter. I know that the Minister is fully aware of that, and I am sure that she has been fully briefed by her staff. The subsidies are unfair trade, unfair dumping and the use of unfair competition against profitable plants, and we should not allow that to happen. I hope that the Minister will give some assurance that, in this world of free trade, the World Trade Organisation should be asked to consider this matter, either through the EU or the British Government&#151;ideally both.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para8"><a name="stpa_102">Innovia Films has started a 90-day consultation. Last night we had a meeting with Sedgemoor district council, which was attended by all the political parties&#151;well, both of us, there were no Liberals present&#151;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief executive of Innovia Films, Mr. David Beeby, and Mr. John Bloomfield, the managing director at Bridgwater, at which they laid out their stall as to what they need. This is the crux of the matter, and why we are here today. The Minister is aware that we have a meeting in just over a week to try to move the matter on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para9"><a name="stpa_103">One of the biggest costs at the plant is the production of power. There is a power station on site, as there has always been. If one drives down the M5, one will see the chimney of the power station. However, the power station is old. I am sure that the Minister knows that a few years ago British Cellophane paid 12p a therm for gas whereas today it pays 116p a therm. That gives some idea of the difference in the cost of the energy that it needs to produce.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para10"><a name="stpa_104">I have here some figures from John Hall Associates, which show the difference between Dutch and French production and levels of cost as of today. Ours are 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 393WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
enormously higher&#151;about a third. I am happy to give the Minister those figures after the debate. That shows that Innovia Films, or British Cellophane, is finding it hard to compete in the market. In yesterday&#039;s <i>Financial Times</i>, there was a quote&#151;it has just dropped off the desk, so I will not hunt around for it&#151;saying that energy costs are making it so hard for companies in this country to compete that they are considering moving abroad for that reason alone.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para11"><a name="stpa_105">I will return to the issue of the power station, but there is also a problem with water. The plant uses a massive amount of water in its production process. Last year, the cost of water at the plant went up by &#163;200,000 in one year. If one takes 2000 as a base year, the cost of water for British Cellophane has gone up by 25 per cent. in four or five years. It gives some idea of the cost to the company that it now hopes to buy in its energy services. Never mind the actual cellophane itself&#151;we are talking just about production costs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para12"><a name="stpa_106">What can I ask the Minister to do to help? We need a new power station. Sedgemoor district council has a proposal on the table for a wood-burning power station. That would create not only 20 jobs but enough power to look after British Cellophane, put 15 per cent. back on to the grid, use 145,000 tonnes of wood that normally goes into landfill and help the Government to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hit their targets on biodiversity, biofuels and renewables. I say that with four nuclear reactors down the road at Hinkley Point.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para13"><a name="stpa_107">We have the opportunity to do something special in Somerset. The power plant is there, and there will be no change of use. If we could get the permission, it could be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done. However, we need an indication from the Government, either through the regional development agency or directly, or from Europe on energy production, that that could happen. The company needs to know that we are listening and doing what we can&#151;I mean all of us&#151;to help.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para14"><a name="stpa_108">It will be an enormous challenge. Every year, &#163;20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million goes into the economy from British Cellophane&#151;in wages and direct and indirect goods. It has been the lifeblood of Bridgwater in many ways. Going down the M5, it can be smelt at every turn. However, that is British Cellophane; that is what we are proud of. On Saturday, on the march organised by the Transport and General Workers Union, I marched with Matthew Burchell together with hundreds of people, from all walks of life, in Bridgwater, a manufacturing town whose lifeblood is making things. We need Government help.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para15"><a name="stpa_109">It is rare that an MP pleads with the Government, but I am doing so on behalf of Bridgwater. I have laid out a stall of what we need. We have deputations going to Europe and people who are prepared to sign petitions in their hundreds, and I hope that the Minister will listen. I give another pledge to the Government; we will do what we have to. Sedgemoor district council has cut business rates to the plant straight away. Although it can give no direct money, the county council has passed a resolution to do what it can to help. Last night, at the meeting, the RDA said that it would do everything that it could to help via government, directly and indirectly.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para16"><a name="stpa_110">The challenge, Minister, is to look after manufacturing per se&#151;
</p>






<p><a name="st_63"><a name="50308h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. The hon. Gentleman is speaking directly to the Minister, when he should be addressing me.
</p>






<p><a name="st_64"><a name="50308h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Liddell-Grainger </b> : I stand castigated. I think that you can tell, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that there is a certain passion in this situation, and I apologise.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para17"><a name="stpa_111">As you are aware, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and as the Minister is aware, we are now in the 90-day consultation period, which will end in the middle of May. If we get&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this right and get the right feedback from the Government, we can consider the proposals. The plant and the company are prepared to do so. That is the challenge that we face.

</p>



<a name="time_7">
<a name="50308h02_time1"><h5>11.13 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_65"><a name="50308h02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Industry and the Regions  (Jacqui Smith) </b> : I start by congratulating the hon. Gentleman, not only on obtaining this debate but on the obvious passion that he has shown and the action that he has already taken in talking to my right hon. Friends and pressing the case very strongly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para18"><a name="stpa_112">I also thank him for the deserved and well-natured credit that he gave to Matthew Burchell, the Labour prospective parliamentary candidate in Bridgwater and to the T and G, which has also strongly lobbied the Government on the issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para19"><a name="stpa_113">I would like to start by expressing my sympathy for the position in which the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents find themselves. It is certainly the case that the company&#039;s recent decision to begin consultations with a possible view to closure of the Bridgwater site is disappointing and distressing news to those people who, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, have in many cases put a lifetime of commitment into the plant. It is because we understand the seriousness of the issue and the impact on the local community that as soon as we learned that Innovia was considering the future configuration of its manufacturing operations, officials from my Department and from the South West of England Regional Development Agency immediately visited the company to understand the background and to explore what assistance might be available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para20"><a name="stpa_114">The hon. Gentleman emphasises the importance of manufacturing, as I frequently do. The company has received assistance from the Process Industries Centre for Manufacturing Excellence, an organisation that promotes the development of lean manufacturing, and was established with financial aid from the Department of Trade and Industry. However, we wished to see whether there was anything further we could do to assist the company. We also wanted to understand the background to any decisions that might be made. Part of the background is the current situation for cellophane production. Although the hon. Gentleman made a strong case for the continued importance of cellophane, cellophane production has been in decline for many years, as alternative products have been developed to meet the needs of the market. At the peak of demand, there were 23 production units in Europe and 15 in the United States, and they were operated by a number of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different companies. Today, Innovia supplies 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 395WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cent. of the world market&#151;outside Japan&#151;of cellophane products from only three manufacturing sites. As the hon. Gentleman said, one of those sites is in the USA, another is at Wigton in north-west England, and the other is at Bridgwater. Despite that, we understand that Innovia&#039;s production capacity is currently 50 per cent. higher than demand for the product. Put simply, there is a continuing decline in worldwide demand for cellophane products, and no company can continue producing more than the market requires. It is that dramatic change in the market that is forcing the company to consider rationalisation of its production capacity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para21"><a name="stpa_115">Of course, the company will need to base its decision on any rationalisation on sound commercial grounds, including the relative strength of the remaining markets, product range, proximity and time to the markets served, plant condition, and operating costs. As the hon. Gentleman points out, account will also have to be taken not only of specific financial assistance but of the whole framework of support that may be available in different areas. Alongside the support that is already provided, the local community, the local authority&#151;Sedgemoor district council&#151;and local agencies are making major efforts to find a solution that retains the manufacturing jobs in the area. I understand that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;district council is exploring whether the company could pay less in business rates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para22"><a name="stpa_116">As recently as last night, the regional development agency&#151;the prime agency in the region for economic development and business support&#151;met with the hon. Gentleman, and senior representatives of the company and the community. Today, the hon. Gentleman raised important points about power and the power plant. He also mentioned the pressure that manufacturers are currently feeling in respect of energy prices. I do not dispute that that is a considerable challenge for manufacturers, but I slightly dispute the angle that the hon. Gentleman took. He put us in a very bad position in respect of international competition, but the DTI estimates that UK gas prices remain below the EU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;median in 2004. However, it is an important issue. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry met representatives of energy-intensive users last December, and why my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and E-Commerce has had meetings to discuss the issue with some of the most affected companies. It is also why I discussed it recently with the Engineering Employers Federation. We are determined to find ways both to make sure that the market operates effectively to maintain competitiveness in energy prices and to ensure support for manufacturers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para23"><a name="stpa_117">The hon. Gentleman made a specific point about the development of a new power plant at Bridgwater. I want to look carefully at the figures that he and the company have forwarded to us about that challenge. I also want to set that in the context of the considerable support that the Government have already provided for alternative sources of energy, including exemption from the climate change levy for fuel inputs and electricity outputs from good-quality combined heat and power, eligibility for enhanced capital allowances, and a reduction in VAT to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 per cent. for certain grant-funded domestic micro-CHP.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 396WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para24"><a name="stpa_118">More recent developments include securing the future of the community energy programme until at least March 2008 with a total funding of &#163;60 million, creating incentives to develop innovative products and putting in place shortly revised guidance for power station developers, obliging them to consider fully the options for CHP and community heating.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para25"><a name="stpa_119">I also understand that within that framework the particular situation in Bridgwater is important. While I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot give the hon. Gentleman any undertakings this morning, I can ensure that across government we will carefully examine the issue and see whether or not further support is available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para26"><a name="stpa_120">Let us be clear about one important point. We are not discussing a company that is deserting the UK&#151;far from it. The company has its group headquarters in Wigton in the north-west, where it employs 850 people in both manufacturing and research and development. In 2002, it invested &#8364;12 million in a new global research and development centre at Wigton. That was in addition to more than &#8364;100 million invested in production facilities at the Wigton site during the past decade. There is a commitment to UK manufacturing, although that is not, I accept, a comfort to the hon. Gentleman, who is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rightly concerned about the Bridgwater site in his constituency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para27"><a name="stpa_121">The hon. Gentleman raised the particular issue of the funding that, it is argued, the US authorities and local authorities in Kansas are providing to the American plant. He rightly highlights the fact that the route for identifying whether or not that complies with World Trade Organisation rules is through the European Commission, which, of course, negotiates for the European Union on such issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para28"><a name="stpa_122">I was pleased to hear about the meeting that is taking place with the Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred. I can also assure him that my officials have been talking to the Commission to confirm whether the US support complies with WTO rules. We want to maintain that contact so that we can interrogate the facts about the extent of the support in the US and whether it constitutes unfair trade under WTO rules.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para29"><a name="stpa_123">So, while it is hard for those involved, this is, in some ways, a story of change and of companies in the UK responding to such change. In manufacturing&#151;even manufacturing within this particular area of support&#151;one of the difficulties with the market is that as we innovate and develop new products that compete with cellophane, there is a change in the way such manufacturing happens. There is not, incidentally, a shift of manufacturing out of the UK.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para30"><a name="stpa_124">Other companies in the UK are producing the new alternatives that are replacing cellophane. For example, last September, my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade and Investment formally opened a new &#163;65 million investment by the Japanese company Nippon Gohsei at Saltend, near Hull. That plant uses cutting-edge technology to produce a new environmentally-friendly polymer used in the food packaging industry, 90 per cent. of which is exported to Europe. That, once again, creates new jobs in the UK.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 397WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>






<p><a name="st_66"><a name="50308h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Liddell-Grainger </b> : The Minister is right in everything that she says, except that we are talking about a profitable and highly-productive plant. It has done everything to change and it outperforms the Americans by far. It produces more and it produces better quality. I accept what she says, but I take issue on one point. The plant has done everything to stay profitable and we should not allow it to be sacrificed simply because an American plant can get away with something that we cannot. Does she agree?
</p>






<p><a name="st_67"><a name="50308h02_spnew4"><b> Jacqui Smith </b> : I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, which is why I said two things. We need to investigate the extent of the aid being offered in the US&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ensure that we do everything possible to assist the UK plants, particularly the Bridgwater plant. However, we also need to do that with an understanding of the market. Where there is massive overcapacity, rationalisation is needed. The hon. Gentleman is quite right to argue the case for the plant in his constituency. I certainly hope that we can create and maintain jobs in the sector in the UK. As a Government, we will do what we can to support that, but in the end those decisions must be taken by the company, taking into account the market situation and a range of commercial factors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para31"><a name="stpa_125">We will continue to provide support for manufacturing, through the manufacturing advisory service and the investment that we are putting into science and innovation. For example, in the 2004 spending review we provided an extra &#163;515 million in new money to boost science and innovation. Those incentives are being provided at a time when the UK is enjoying the longest period of sustained low and stable inflation since the 1960s, with interest rates close to historically low levels.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para32"><a name="stpa_126">The effect of that is obvious. Gross domestic product has grown strongly over the past year, as has manufacturing output. As the hon. Gentleman said, we need to put in place the framework to enable UK manufacturers to compete. We need to add specific financial assistance to that, whether it is for innovation or is put into those areas that have been identified for selective investment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para33"><a name="stpa_127">We must ensure that local economies are doing as well as possible. I know that the hon. Gentleman will share my satisfaction that the economy of Somerset is now 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 398WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
performing better than the national average. For example, unemployment is 1.3 per cent., which is relatively low compared to regional and national averages. More specifically, in Bridgwater more than 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million sq ft of new factory space is being built at the recently opened 100-acre Express Park, less than a mile from the Innovia site.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para34"><a name="stpa_128">At the end of last year, a planning application was submitted for an additional 50-acre employment site just two miles south of Bridgwater. Further from Bridgwater, there are two new development sites, at Glastonbury and Taunton. The Glastonbury development alone is expected to create 850 jobs, on a 35-acre site. To help with training, the South West of England Regional Development Agency has assisted in the establishment of an &#163;11 million training programme through the Somerset skills alliance, as well as a single regeneration budget programme and a &quot;Building Communities&quot; pilot project in Bridgwater.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para35"><a name="stpa_129">My argument is that, although the Government cannot always influence or determine commercial decisions about rationalisation and plant closure, we can provide support where possible and maintain the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;macro-economic framework to allow the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency to flourish and ensure that there are jobs for local people. That is not to diminish in any way the painful position in which Innovia&#039;s Bridgwater work force find themselves, through no fault of their own. However, in that specific case a number of both local and national agencies are already engaged in seeking ways of assisting those who will be affected if&#151;I stress &quot;if&quot;, because I do not think that the decision has been taken yet&#151;a decision is taken to close the Innovia plant.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h02_para36"><a name="stpa_130">I know that the cellophane plant in Bridgwater has been a key feature of the area for several generations. The announcement that it is being considered for closure was bound to be sad news for the employees, their families and the local community. I can only give the hon. Gentleman and that community my assurance that officials at local, regional and national levels will continue to explore what assistance might be provided.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="50308h03_spnew0"><b> Jeremy Corbyn  (Islington, North)</b>  (Lab): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I also thank Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaker for selecting this issue for debate. The non-proliferation treaty review conference is due to be held in New York in May.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para0"><a name="stpa_131">First, I should declare an interest. Before everyone gets too excited, I should say that I do not have shares in BAE Systems, Boeing or anything like that. I am, however, a lifetime member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. I am also the chairman of the parliamentary group on CND, although it has not yet been declared an all-party group, and we are awaiting Tory Members to make up the numbers. Finally, I am a vice-chairman of CND and a member of its national council.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para1"><a name="stpa_132">The issue could not be more important for the future of the world. Nuclear weapons have been a cloud over us all throughout my lifetime and that of everybody in the Chamber, and that has been the case ever since the first bombs were exploded in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Efforts were constantly made to obtain some degree of disarmament through controls, test bans and the various arguments that were put forward internationally. The non-proliferation treaty of 1970 was seen as an enormous step forward and a way to get us out of the dangers of a nuclear holocaust. The five declared nuclear weapons states&#151;the United States, the then Soviet Union, Britain, France and China&#151;all agreed to the treaty, which would do two things. First, it would prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology outside the five nuclear states. Secondly, those five states would, in the longer term, disarm. In other words, we would begin to see the end of nuclear weapons.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para2"><a name="stpa_133">The conference this May is part of the five-yearly review process, and this debate is intended to allow hon. Members to express their views about it. Above all, however, the Minister will be able to tell us what stance the Government will take at the review conference and whether we shall see a development of the exciting statement that was made after the 2000 conference.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para3"><a name="stpa_134">Before I go into that, however, we should reflect for a moment on the proliferation that has taken place since 1970. Several states now have nuclear weapons; some of them have a delivery capability, and many would have the ability to manufacture many more nuclear weapons if they were minded to do so. This year&#039;s conference is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore not simply a five-yearly review: it is an important watershed. Are we to stop the proliferation of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nuclear weapons by following the two pillars of the 1970 treaty&#151;disarmament by the five states plus disarmament by non-declared nuclear weapons states?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para4"><a name="stpa_135">We should remember that one pariah state developed nuclear weapons and gave them up. Under apartheid, South Africa developed nuclear weapons, but with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end of apartheid and the installation of the African&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Congress Government under Nelson Mandela, it renounced them and helped to make the continent of Africa nuclear-free. We should applaud South Africa for that and recognise that the moral 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
stature that it enjoys in the world is the product not only of the end of apartheid, but of the fact that it is not threatening anybody.
</p>






<p><a name="st_69"><a name="50308h03_spnew1"><b> Tony Lloyd  (Manchester, Central)</b>  (Lab): May I ask my hon. Friend to make a similar point about Argentina? At one time, it had at the least plans to move towards nuclear weapons, but it gave them up because it realised that, rather than making Latin America more peaceful, nuclear weapons would massively destabilise relations with Brazil and, indeed, around the globe. So, Argentina also deserves some credit.
</p>






<p><a name="st_70"><a name="50308h03_spnew2"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : Absolutely; that is a good point, which I endorse. Argentina, too, was developing a capability, although I do not think that it had got as far as South Africa. However, it gave up that capability.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para5"><a name="stpa_136">Other states have been less promising in that respect. We know that Israel has developed nuclear weapons and that it has a delivery capability and an advanced missile system. We know that because Mordecai Vanunu had the courage to tell the truth about Israel&#039;s nuclear weapons and subsequently spent the best part of two decades in prison as a result. He is still under control orders in Jerusalem, which we hope will be lifted on 21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April. He will then be free to come to the House and tell us the truth about the nuclear threat in that region.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para6"><a name="stpa_137">Of the other countries that have nuclear weapons, India and Pakistan are in negotiation about no first use and, I hope, possible long-term disarmament, although when President Musharraf addressed a meeting in the House, which I and many colleagues attended, I was not encouraged by his remarks about nuclear weapons. Given the poverty in India and Pakistan, it is unconscionable that either country would spend the resources that are required for developing a nuclear delivery system when they should be developing education, housing and health and making all other necessary social developments in their countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para7"><a name="stpa_138">Clearly, North Korea has developed nuclear weapons and, tragically, has withdrawn from the NPT system. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that the negotiations by all the countries involved will bring North Korea back. The Minister&#039;s colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell), is not here today, but he went to North Korea to engage in that discussion. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that his efforts will be redoubled, so that there is no prospect of another war breaking out on the Korean peninsula.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para8"><a name="stpa_139">The issue of Iranian nuclear weapons is discussed loudly, principally by the Pentagon and others, although Mohamed el-Baradei, the United Nations weapons inspector, has made several visits to Iran and has confirmed that he thinks that it has ceased the development of enriched uranium that could lead to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development of weapons-grade material and that it is taking part in negotiations. I hope that, when the Minister replies, he can tell us that he supports that process, too, and that we will continue engagement with Iran to ensure that there is no development of nuclear weapons in the area, and that we will have no more of the bellicose statements from either President Bush or Secretary of State Rice in which they seem to be overtly threatening Iran. Surely enough life has already been lost in Iraq, without threatening Iran. Disarmament must be the order of the day.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para9"><a name="stpa_140">Mohamed el-Baradei, the UN weapons inspector, made some interesting comments in the run-up to the NPT. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;It is clear that recent events have placed the NPT and the regime supporting it under unprecedented stress, exposing some of its inherent limitations and pointing to areas that need to be adjusted&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para10"><a name="stpa_141">He then proposed seven steps that would strengthen the NPT regime and, with it, world security. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;Some of the needed fixes can be made in May, but only if governments are ready to act.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para11"><a name="stpa_142">Those steps, which would not require amending the treaty, include a five-year moratorium on building new facilities for uranium enrichment, plutonium separation and materials that can be used for nuclear weapons production. He went on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;There is no compelling reason for building more of these proliferation-sensitive facilities. The nuclear industry already has more than enough capacity to fuel its power plants and research facilities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para12"><a name="stpa_143">We should listen carefully to Mohamed el-Baradei because he has important things to say, more so because he was not listened to properly about Iran and has put a huge effort into Iraq and North Korea. He is a force for good in the world and a force for peace. He should be treated with the respect that he deserves.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para13"><a name="stpa_144">Item 6 of the final document that was referred to at the 2000 conference states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;An unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament, to which all States parties are committed under article VI.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para14"><a name="stpa_145">That was a very welcome statement. The declaration put forward a series of proposals that included:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;Further efforts by the nuclear-weapon States to reduce their nuclear arsenals unilaterally; increased transparency by the nuclear-weapon States with regard to the nuclear weapons capabilities&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons, based on unilateral initiatives&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Concrete agreed measures to further reduce the operational status of nuclear weapons systems; a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies to minimize the risk that these weapons will ever be used and to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facilitate the process of their total elimination&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para15"><a name="stpa_146">and

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;The engagement as soon as appropriate of all nuclear-weapon States in the process leading to the total elimination of their nuclear weapons.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para16"><a name="stpa_147">Those are important items, and important to remember as we go to that conference, which will take place just a few weeks before the 60th anniversary of the explosion of the world&#039;s first nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para17"><a name="stpa_148">In some ways, the conference ought to be held in Hiroshima. Those who believe that nuclear weapons provide security, safety or a solution of any kind to the world&#039;s problems should think for a moment of all those who died in 1945, of all the resources that have been wasted since then on developing nuclear weapons and of those who continue to die from the cancerous fallout from those explosions or from nuclear tests that have taken place since 1945.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para18"><a name="stpa_149">The British Government have to face up to some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serious, very important questions; any British Government would have to. We are signatories to the

<br>&nbsp;<br>
1970 treaty, therefore we should not be developing any new nuclear weapons. I understand that the Trident submarine system is coming to the end of its usable life. I should like to hear a declaration from the Government that when that happens, the system will not be replaced and that we see it as our obligation under the 1970 treaty, to which we adhered, to get rid of our nuclear weapons at that stage.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para19"><a name="stpa_150">Work is going on at Aldermaston on what I believe to be the preparatory development of a new generation of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nuclear weapons. I should like to hear from the Government about that work, about what weapons are being developed and about the United States&#039; participation in that process. We are required by the treaty to pursue a nuclear-free world, so are we developing a new generation of nuclear weapons and prepared to start the development of a new delivery system or are we going to play our part in nuclear arms reduction? It is all very well for us to lecture the rest of the world on the danger of nuclear proliferation and on how bad nuclear weapons are&#151;it is a danger, and they are appalling&#151;yet we ourselves are developing them and continuing to develop and hold them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para20"><a name="stpa_151">I recognise that the number of nuclear warheads has been reduced. However, I also recognise that under the NATO umbrella we have our own weapons that are theoretically independent of the United States. Under the NATO treaty system, nuclear weapons are also held in non-declared countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, because they are part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NATO command structure. We need to be clear about how that fits with what we are trying to achieve.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para21"><a name="stpa_152">I want others to take part in this debate, so I shall conclude by drawing attention to the preparatory work for this year&#039;s conference in New York, which gives us an enormous opportunity to move forward. There was a great deal of hope around after the 2000 conference. In his contribution to that conference, my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), then a Foreign Office Minister, made it clear that he saw Britain as on the fast track towards disarmament and as playing our full part in that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para22"><a name="stpa_153">We have not heard such welcome statements from the Secretary of State for Defence or any Defence Ministers since 2001. Indeed, the Secretary of State for Defence indicated that there were circumstances in which he would be prepared to authorise the use of nuclear weapons by this country, ending the no first use policy. I hope that we will hear something clear to the effect that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is no longer the case and that we would not be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prepared to use nuclear weapons under such circumstances. I also hope that, given all the insecurities that have existed in the world from September 2001 onwards&#151;the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq and all that has gone with them&#151;we will ask ourselves the obvious question: what good are nuclear weapons in any of those circumstances? Do they not just threaten the destruction of this planet and eat up valuable resources that could be better used on something else, and should we not say that we intend to get rid of them? I hope that the British Government are prepared to take that step.

weapons, I suspect that it will become much more of a centre-stage political issue. It is up to this House to declare its views on the matter before the conference. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get the feeling that the majority of the public in this country have had enough of the losses brought about by the wars in which we have recently been involved, and have no stomach or wish for getting involved in preparation for the destruction of this planet, which is what nuclear weapons could bring about.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para24"><a name="stpa_155">Many people have campaigned on the issue with great principle and verve for many years. Many have given up lives and careers to do so. Mordecai Vanunu is only one; many others, including Joseph Rotblat, have done a great deal. We should listen carefully to what they have to say, and use this opportunity to move in the direction of a more peaceful globe, not a world at war.

<p><a name="st_71"><a name="50308h03_spnew3"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis  (New Forest, East)</b>  (Con): It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), who, as he says, has had a lifelong commitment to the cause of the abolition of nuclear weapons. I have had almost as long a commitment to the cause of nuclear deterrence and this country&#039;s retention of nuclear weapons. We have debated the subject many times. Although it was styled as a debate on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference, when I saw that he was fortunate enough to have obtained this debate&#151;on which I congratulate him&#151;I knew that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could rely on him to go into the broader issues of whether Britain, in particular, should continue to possess nuclear weapons. I hope to follow his example of not out-speaking my allotted time, so I shall straight away address some of his points.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para25"><a name="stpa_156">The hon. Gentleman asked us to think about Hiroshima and all the lives that were lost, but one point that is often overlooked is that Hiroshima was probably the first ever example in the atomic age of a nuclear-free zone. The western allies faced the question of what they were going to do to end the war; the bloody campaign was scheduled to continue, and a full-scale invasion of Japan would have cost many more lives than the bombing of Hiroshima did. When that was being considered, what would the allies have had to think about if the Japanese held atomic weapons of their own? I am not saying that I would have wanted the Japanese to hold atomic weapons, but the fact is that when one side has atomic or nuclear weapons, it completely alters the situation if its actual or potential adversary possesses them too.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para26"><a name="stpa_157">The hon. Gentleman referred to wars such as that in Afghanistan, and others that are undoubtedly below the nuclear threshold. I can recall debating these matters with the CND 20 years ago, and in those days the argument was, &quot;What on earth does Britain want nuclear weapons for? They didn&#039;t do us any good in the Falklands.&quot; My response now is what it was then: just because a given antidote to a particular deadly disease does not work against all sorts of other diseases, that is no good reason to throw it away. Nuclear weapons are not a deterrent to all forms of aggression, but the nuclear deterrent undoubtedly works against certain forms of aggression that exist when one country has weapons of mass destruction and another does not.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para27"><a name="stpa_158">Let us consider the question of our treaty commitments under article 6 of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. That is often said by unilateral

<br>&nbsp;<br>
nuclear disarmers to commit us to a nuclear-free world and to the abolition of our nuclear weapons. Well, yes it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does, but only in a way that encompasses such ideal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goals as the abolition of all weapons worldwide, and of war in particular. If there were a practical policy to which we could all sign up, and if we could all march up to the lectern and raise our hands and vote one thing out of existence, I am sure that we would all agree that war was top of the list. We would love to vote conflict out of existence, we would love to vote nuclear war out of existence and we would love to vote conventional war out of existence. However, if we cannot do it all at once, we have to ask ourselves whether we are making the world a safer or a more dangerous place by voting one of those elements out of existence before the others. The case of those of us who have argued for 20 years or more in favour of the nuclear deterrent, is that in a world in which wars continue to happen, the abolition of nuclear weapons in the hands of the democracies and in those of worldwide society, would make the world a safer place for conventional warfare.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para28"><a name="stpa_159">Let us return to the example of Hiroshima. Did the fact that nuclear weapons did not exist until 1945 make the world a safer place? Possibly, the 50 million people who were killed on both sides, including victims of the holocaust and other innocent civilians, would, if they but had a voice, disagree with the proposition. In reality, nuclear weapons can sometimes make the world more dangerous, and sometimes they can make it safer. Who would really argue now that in the situation that we faced for half a century&#151;confrontation between the totalitarian Soviet bloc and the western democracies&#151;the prescription of the CND should have been followed; the west and NATO should have abandoned the nuclear deterrent and left the Soviet Union with a monopoly of nuclear weapons? I remember the great debates about the deployment of Cruise and Pershing missiles, when it was said that we were five minutes from Armageddon, four minutes from Armageddon, a minute and a half from it or whatever time the nuclear clock was supposed to be ticking off; I remember all those apocalyptic statements. However, in the end what got rid of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nuclear weapons was multilateral negotiations, compounded by a change in the political system in the Soviet Union.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para29"><a name="stpa_160">They say that all simple speeches should have a single main point, and I have come to the single main point of this one: that it is not the weapon systems per se that matter, it is the nature of the political systems of the countries that possess them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para30"><a name="stpa_161">Look what happened when we came to the end of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cold war. Did the Russians suddenly abolish all the nuclear weapons that we had been so fearful about for so many years? Of course they did not. But we suddenly stopped being anything like as fearful of them as we had been for such a long time. That was because Russia took great strides towards democracy. The only reason that subsequently&#151;so long as Russia remains, as we hope that it will, on the democratic road&#151;we are fearful of the Russian nuclear arsenal is the danger that those weapons could somehow leach out from Russian control into that of other societies and groups with no commitment to democratic principles. Then we would be concerned once again.

<p>
<a name="50308h03_para31"><a name="stpa_162">Therefore, the real answer to the question is not to ask, in some false egalitarian way, how we can lecture the dictatorships of the world that they should not have nuclear weapons when we keep our own. The answer is simple; I certainly do not have a problem with it. It is that they are dictatorships and we are a democracy. Nuclear weapons are good in the hands of democracies faced with dictatorships in the world; they are bad in the hands of dictatorships, as are other potential means of waging war. I have no difficulty at all in saying that Britain giving up nuclear weapons would not make a scrap of difference to whether a dictatorship continued to possess them. In those debates for so many years, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;challenged again and again those who said that we should give up our nuclear weapons with the simple question: &quot;Who are you saying would follow our example? Name a specific country.&quot; Nobody ever did.

<p><a name="st_72"><a name="50308h03_spnew4"><b> Tony Lloyd </b> : I am listening to the hon. Gentleman very carefully. Would he accept that, according to his logic&#151;ignoring the issue of dictatorship and non-dictatorship because we are clear that North Korea is a dictatorship&#151;it is highly unlikely that North Korea will invade the United States but it is not improbable that there could be circumstances in which the United States used military power against the North Koreans? Does the hon. Gentleman agree that his logic, alas, is that North Korea secures its future by developing a nuclear weapon? Would he advise the North Korean regime to pursue the nuclear option?
</p>






<p><a name="st_73"><a name="50308h03_spnew5"><b> Dr. Lewis </b> : I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is falling into precisely the trap that, as I was saying, people who subscribe to his point of view continually fail to avoid. I do not need to advise North Korea. North Korea will do what it considers to be in its best interests. If it genuinely believes that it is at risk from being invaded by the United States, and if it has nuclear weapons, which apparently it has, nothing on earth&#151;certainly no advice from the likes of me or, dare I say it, from him&#151;will persuade it to abandon them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para32"><a name="stpa_163">I return briefly to what the non-proliferation treaty actually says. Article VI states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para33"><a name="stpa_164">Most people would say that we have done that. I do not believe that most people would say that we, at any rate, are involved in a nuclear arms race, given the reductions that have been made. The article goes on to say


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;and to nuclear disarmament, and on a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para34"><a name="stpa_165">The article therefore commits us to a disarmed world in the same breath as it commits us to a nuclear disarmed world. I long for the day when we have worldwide disarmament of every sort, because that will imply that there has been a revolution in the minds of man and that we no longer want to kill each other when we have the chance. Unfortunately, as we know from our own history and from present-day conflicts, the minds of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 406WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
man have not undergone that revolution. Until they do, people who do not want to be killed will have to defend themselves and deter attack.
</p>






<p><a name="st_74"><a name="50308h03_spnew6"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : The hon. Gentleman is describing an appalling prospect for the human race. Does he believe, however, that some people learn to live in peace and harmony with each other, that not everyone around the world kills each other, and that most countries have survived perfectly well without nuclear weapons?
</p>






<p><a name="st_75"><a name="50308h03_spnew7"><b> Dr. Lewis </b> : Absolutely. I would even go so far as to say&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that most people subscribe to those views. Unfortunately, we have a perfect analogy in crime, particularly murder, in our own society. Most people in civilised societies do not approve of crime, and certainly do not approve of murder. However, the reality is that if enough people in domestic society are willing to commit murder, then domestic society must be able to prevent it, deter it, and if necessary, punish it. The same applies in international society.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para35"><a name="stpa_166">In conclusion, Iran and Iraq were mentioned. It is too early to say what the final outcome will be of the war in Iraq, which I supported before, during and after it was carried out, but the signs are that for all the criticisms that were made of President Bush and for all the dire predictions of the impossibility of bringing any form of democracy to the middle east, the effect of those elections in Iraq is already beginning to resonate throughout the other countries of the middle east.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para36"><a name="stpa_167">Progress of a sort has recently been made in the Lebanon, which I doubt we would have seen had it not been for recent events, particularly the successful elections, in Iraq. I believe that there is hope for the world of surviving the nuclear threat. That hope does not depend on making the mistakes that were made way back in the 1930s when people wrongly believed that aerial bombardment would destroy civilisation, and were therefore determined to limit the weapons and, in a sense, abolish the war. They limited the weapons, but they did not abolish the war. Instead, they brought it about. The way to limit the threat of nuclear weapons is to promote the spread of democracy. If democracy spreads, the nuclear problem will take care of itself.

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="50308h03_spnew8"><b> Dr. Gavin Strang  (Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh)</b>  (Lab): We all agree that we are discussing an important subject, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) on initiating this debate. As he reminded us, the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons&#151;the NPT&#151;came into operation in 1970. The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) also referred to the treaty, which originated during the cold war. Looking around, I see other colleagues who took part in similar debates during that period; some of us had most of our adult political lives during the cold war.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para37"><a name="stpa_168">I wish to make a simple point, which is not intended to be a response to the previous speaker. At the time when the SS20s and the cruise missiles were being deployed, we were justified in being very worried that there might be a nuclear exchange. It might first occur at the theatre level, but most of us were convinced that, if such a nuclear exchange occurred in Europe, it could

<br>&nbsp;<br>
quickly escalate to a major all-out nuclear attack. Of course, that would have been Armageddon; the survivors really would have envied the dead. It is worth acknowledging that we are now free of that threat, which is a tremendous advance. Whatever the problems facing us&#151;I shall refer to them shortly&#151;the fact is that that threat and fear is behind us, because the cold war is over.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para38"><a name="stpa_169">New problems have arisen since the end of the cold war. Recently, there was the 9/11 attack in the United States of America in 2001. As a result, there has been a huge focus on the need to counteract international terrorism. Our Government and other western Governments, including that of the US, have certainly taken such a focus. Furthermore, this week is the first anniversary of the Madrid train bombing. I shall not be drawn into some of the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for New Forest, East, but I point out that there is an issue in relation to the possibility of a terrorist organisation eventually getting its hands on weapons of mass destruction; in the long term, there must a risk of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;al-Qaeda or another such organisation getting hold of a dirty nuclear bomb. In that context, I simply wish to make reference to the proliferation security initiative, which is intended to interdict the movement of WMD-related materials. Importantly, the group of 11 states involved includes the United States, France and the United Kingdom.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para39"><a name="stpa_170">I was quickly going to list some of the pluses and minuses of the period since the NPT came into operation, and particularly the &#039;90s and beyond. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North covered some of them, and I shall not repeat what he said, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was glad that he referred to the achievement of the African National Congress in South Africa; we should always acknowledge that that incoming Government made a tremendous decision.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para40"><a name="stpa_171">It is not all gloom; we also have the strategic arms reduction treaties, START 1 and START 2. It is fair to say that START 2 has not yet fully delivered. Instead of START 3, we have the strategic offensive reduction treaty or SORT, on which I know that some Members might wish to comment, because in several respects it does not offer as much as we would have liked. The particular treaty I wish to highlight is the comprehensive test ban treaty or CTBT, which the United Nations General Assembly adopted in 1996 and which France, Russia and the UK have ratified. That is important, because the five official nuclear states must ratify it before it comes into operation. It has not yet come into operation because neither China nor the US has ratified it, but it is an important treaty, and I hope that it will come into force.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para41"><a name="stpa_172">My hon. Friend referred to the minuses. There are lots of them; not least, they include the fact that the five official nuclear states&#151;those that existed when the NPT was established&#151;have been joined by what they officially call nuclear-capable states: Israel, India and Pakistan. In the context of Pakistan, there was the worrying revelation that A.Q. Khan, who was a senior scientist and manager of the Pakistani nuclear programme, was part of a network that was involved in selling nuclear weapon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know-how and materials to other countries. It is a negative development when any new country develops nuclear weapons, and it is a positive development when any country gives up nuclear

<br>&nbsp;<br>
weapons, as South Africa did. I could touch on Iran and North Korea, as my hon. Friend did, but I will move on, because I know that some of my colleagues want to take part in the debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para42"><a name="stpa_173">Given the run-up to the last two NPT conferences in 1995 and 2000, I think that there is a feeling in many countries, which is shared by many people, that the world has not delivered sufficiently and that nuclear weapon states in particular have not delivered enough. The treaty was a bargain struck in 1970 between nuclear weapon and non-nuclear weapon states that nuclear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapon states would be allowed to keep nuclear weapons on the basis that they would get rid of them and help non-nuclear weapon states to develop nuclear power peacefully.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para43"><a name="stpa_174">As a reflection of many non-nuclear countries&#039; frustration with the lack of progress, the new agenda coalition of eight states was set up in the 1990s. That was an important development, as the coalition is a positive force for nuclear disarmament. In 1999, at the General Assembly of the UN, it called on nuclear weapon states to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;make an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the speedy and total elimination of their nuclear arsenals and to engage without delay in an accelerated process of negotiations, thus achieving nuclear disarmament to which they are committed under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para44"><a name="stpa_175">That resolution was carried by 111 votes to 13, with 39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abstentions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para45"><a name="stpa_176">The new agenda coalition has called for the negotiation of a general convention banning all nuclear weapons, using the model of the 1983 chemical weapons convention. As hon. Members recognise, there is currently an implicit understanding that France, the UK and China will be let off the hook a bit until the US and Russia further reduce their arsenals. Much as we want those arsenals to be reduced, we may well have to consider other ways in which to get better responses from nuclear weapon states and to have more impact on the situation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para46"><a name="stpa_177">I look forward very much to hearing what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has to say. I have no doubts about his personal commitment to ensuring that the British Government do their best to achieve progress. Indeed, I think that we all recognise that the present Government have made some progress. The British permanent representative to the UN conference on disarmament, which is the main disarmament body and is based in Geneva, set out some the things done in the preparatory committee for the fourth conference last year. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will add to what he said, but I point out that the UK has provided working support for a fissile material cut-off treaty, which would be an important advance if we could achieve it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para47"><a name="stpa_178">We have a long way to go. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North has a long-standing, consistent interest in this matter, and there is a general consensus on the Government side, even if it does not extend to the other side of the House, that we need to give this matter high priority and that more needs to be achieved, not least at the conference. It is remarkable that the 1995 and 2000 conferences came out quite well in the end, although there was a lot of pessimism in the preceding years. The same might happen with the next

Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) on securing the debate, on his thought-provoking speech and on the work that he has done over many years in raising this highly important issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para48"><a name="stpa_179">There is common agreement that the British Government are right to want to use their presidency of the G8 and the European Union to tackle two of the great world problems: climate change and global poverty. However, it could be said that proliferation is possibly an even more crucial issue facing us this year. The recent report of the UN high-level panel warned us that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;We are approaching a point at which the erosion of the non-proliferation regime could become irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para49"><a name="stpa_180">It said that&#151;despite the fact that, in some ways, one could say that until now the non-proliferation regime has been remarkably successful at limiting proliferation. Indeed, ironically, the invasion of Iraq showed that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nuclear non-proliferation treaty plus containment diplomacy were much more successful than most of us had expected. Iraq had probably abandoned its nuclear weapons programme and abolished its weapons of mass destruction by the mid-1990s.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para50"><a name="stpa_181">Some apologists for that war claim that it has been successful in putting pressure on countries such as Libya. I find that a difficult argument to follow, because I think that Libya was already showing signs of constructive engagement since the negotiations on Lockerbie. It could at least as easily be argued that countries such as North Korea and Iran might see the risk of a US invasion as a reason for wanting to develop a nuclear deterrent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para51"><a name="stpa_182">Iran and North Korea reflect one of the weaknesses of the existing treaty. First, the treaty assumed that civil nuclear production and military nuclear production can be separated. In practice, there is an increasing possibility of dual use. The same centrifuges that are used to enrich material up to civil nuclear use might further be used to achieve the enrichment to weapons-grade material. That is so even when one is applying the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional protocol. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strang) said, Iran and Libya also illustrate the tremendous danger that was represented by the A.Q. Khan network and the possibility of nuclear weapons coming from a nuclear black market and their being used not only by states but by terrorists.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 410WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para52"><a name="stpa_183">The second great weakness in the treaty is the situation of the de facto nuclear weapons states&#151;India and Pakistan, and particularly Israel, because it is a catalyst to proliferation in the middle east.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para53"><a name="stpa_184">In the eyes of many countries, the third great weakness has been the position of the nuclear weapons states. There has been a perceived lack of commitment on their part to pursuing nuclear disarmament and particular concern about the position of the Bush Administration. One must have considerable sympathy for the leaders of the new agenda coalition states when they said that the Bush Administration seem to be treating the treaty more as if it were an &#224; la carte menu from which they could pick the bits that they liked than as a proper international treaty.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para54"><a name="stpa_185">The review conference of 2000 was a considerable success, not least because Britain played a very constructive role in bringing together some of the nuclear weapons states and the non-nuclear weapons states. There was an action plan, which contained 13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steps. Various people are to blame, but I must say that the Bush Administration are particularly to blame for having virtually discarded that. They have abolished the anti-ballistic missile treaty and are refusing to make any progress towards the comprehensive test ban treaty. They share blame with China for the fact that the production of fissile materials ban has been stalled in arguments over the possibility of weapons in space. The Moscow treaty is widely perceived as not doing nearly enough to produce irreversible and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para55"><a name="stpa_186">Then, of course, there is the worrying talk about producing new nuclear weapons systems, including ones that would make nuclear weapons more usable, thus breaking the nuclear taboo that has been common to all states for several decades. There is also talk of breaking the negative security assurances that we give to non-nuclear weapons states. That is also worrying, because it gives the impression that there is something arbitrary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and capricious about the way in which the Administration regard not only bits of the treaty but the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;designating of states as to whether or not they are entitled to nuclear weapons. We need not an arbitrary but a fair system of international rule of law by treaty if we are to build a stable world.

<p>
<a name="50308h03_para57"><a name="stpa_188">Obviously, there have been some hopes that the Bush&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second term might prove to be slightly more conciliatory. I have to say that the announcement yesterday of the appointment of John Bolton, who could be described as one of the most virulent and outspoken opponents of arms control and the United Nations, as the US ambassador to the United Nations bodes very ill for the future of the treaty and of the planet.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para58"><a name="stpa_189">The UK needs to play a constructive role, as we did in the previous review. Some states will obviously go to the conference purely to try to be disruptive by criticising the United States. The United States needs to be persuaded to be more flexible. We have to oppose absolutely any suggestion by the US that the agreements of 1995 and 2000 can be regarded as history. Allowing a new Administration of any state to ignore everything that that state has agreed in the past breaks down not only the NPT but the whole basis of international law. We must try to reinforce the NPT and the previous agreements of 1995 and 2000 and try to preserve as many of the 13 steps as possible.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para59"><a name="stpa_190">Many positive proposals have been put forward by Dr. el-Baradei, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North, by some of the NGOs and by various of the states, such as the new agenda coalition. We will not make much progress on the CBTB, but we should at least try to get agreement to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintain a moratorium on testing. We should try to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get the fissile material ban through and agree to Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;el-Baradei&#039;s proposal to try to modify reactors to reduce the flow of production of weapons-grade material. We need to strengthen the additional protocol, bring in the de facto states and take firm action with states that withdraw from the NPT.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para60"><a name="stpa_191">The nuclear weapons states must abandon the idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new nuclear weapons programmes. We must make some proper progress towards nuclear disarmament by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strengthening treaties such as the Moscow treaty or going well beyond them. Other countries should listen positively to what Britain has done in de-alerting nuclear weapons. It is absurd that so long after the end of the cold war we should have nuclear weapons on a hair-trigger. We need to develop the work that Britain is doing to improve verification, reduce the role of nuclear weapons in strategic thinking, strengthen the negative security assurances and the International Atomic Energy Agency, and try to extend nuclear-free zones, which now cover most of the Southern Hemisphere.

<a name="50308h03_para61"><a name="stpa_192">In 2000, Britain played a positive role in bringing the states together. I hope that in 2005&#151;a far more difficult and dangerous time&#151;we can also act as a bridge between the different states. The stakes could not be higher. If the NPT breaks down and there is proliferation and nuclear arms racing, we could face not only nuclear terrorism in future decades or centuries, but regional nuclear war or even major nuclear war, which, in a worst-case scenario, could endanger the very survival of the human species.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para62"><a name="stpa_193">There are important reasons why we should debate the issue, not simply&#151;and rightly&#151;because of the run-up to the review conference this year. As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North pointed out, during the next Parliament this country will probably have to consider its future as a nuclear power. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Minister will tell us on this occasion what decisions are being prepared. However, it is important in considering such matters to recognise that the world is moving to higher levels of security, or insecurity. Currently, there is a strong thesis that suggests that the proliferators are in the ascendancy and that those who argue against proliferation are losing the battle.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para63"><a name="stpa_194">It is worth restating the fact that one of the commitments of the nuclear states under the NPT was to de-escalate tensions, and seek more stability and security. Over the past few years Britain has played a part in that and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) said, in some respects we have made real progress. However, it would be difficult to argue that the collective world of non-nuclear powers has been given the signal that the nuclear powers have been keen to move forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para64"><a name="stpa_195">For example, one of the major drivers in the near future might be serious movements by the United States to adopt its strategic defence initiative. That programme could be a vehicle for vertical proliferation, by which I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mean that it could encourage existing nuclear states to upgrade their nuclear stocks. I do not speak for or against China, but it is the obvious example. China&#039;s nuclear doctrine has always included the capacity to do serious damage to a number of north American cities in the event of nuclear attack by the United States. There are enough deterrents in place, but if the Chinese felt that they could no longer achieve that, the obvious answer would be to increase massively the number of decoy missiles and the number of active warheads available. The knock-on effect of that on China&#039;s 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 413WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
neighbours, principally India, could be profound. India may choose to respond; and if it did, Pakistan would up the ante, and so on. Proliferation will take place among the nuclear states if we do not actively seek to de-escalate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para65"><a name="stpa_196">We face real and different dangers nowadays&#151;that is the flaw in the cold war logic. My hon. Friends referred to A.Q. Khan as driving proliferation. As we know, that proliferation has extended to other non-nuclear states, as has by now been well demonstrated. The problem is not just unfortunate: it is a serious flaw in the mutually assured destruction canon and means that there are now states that have been drawn, by their internal logic, into that proliferation agenda. We know, for example, that if Iran were to move along the road towards nuclear weapons, it would have a profound effect on its neighbours. Israel, as a nuclear weapons state in any case, might want to respond in some way&#151;not, it is to be hoped, militarily, but in any case by increasing security.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para66"><a name="stpa_197">However, those two drivers might have an impact on countries such as Turkey, with the prospect, perhaps, of a country such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia seeking nuclear weapons. The idea of a country with the political instability of the present Saudi Arabia becoming a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nuclear weapons state is not the cheery matter that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Member for New Forest, East would have us believe; it would be incredibly destabilising for the whole of the middle east. There is a real question about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Saudi Government in the future perhaps being&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replaced by what the hon. Gentleman himself described as non-democrats. Nuclear weapons would be catastrophic in those hands, and we should realise that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para67"><a name="stpa_198">The other big difference that is now apparent is proliferation not just to previously non-nuclear states but to non-state actors&#151;terrorists. That is the real challenge for us all, because the most likely driver for that process is the Soviet legacy of nuclear stocks in Russia. In addition to that, there is capacity in the furtive world of nuclear proliferation for sideways leakage in a way that, from the point of view of a proliferating Government, may seem orderly&#151;missiles in North Korea or, in the past, nuclear technology in Pakistan. It may leak into the hands of organisations such as al-Qaeda. That is a phenomenally dangerous prospect for the world, so there are strong and cogent reasons, in a situation as potentially unstable as the present, to re-examine our nuclear doctrines&#151;our nuclear theologies, so to speak&#151;and bring them forward into the 21st century. Britain can play a key role in that context and has done so at critical points in the past. The Government, with a genuine commitment to seeking more stable levels of security, may not be prepared to take the great leaps that were argued for in the past. Perhaps we are living in an era in which it would be sensible to take incremental steps forward. However, Britain could take the lead in arguing for those incremental steps, which could make the world considerably safer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para68"><a name="stpa_199">Part of what I am talking about might involve, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh mentioned, the fissile material cut-off treaty. It would be very significant if we could make progress with that.

the test ban treaty. A big flaw in the existing NPT structure, although it is very difficult to reorganise, is the role to be assigned to the nuclear states that are outside the treaty provision&#151;India, Pakistan and Israel. It is far&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more sensible for them to be brought into the framework so that they can play a constructive rather than destructive role.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para69"><a name="stpa_200">I hope that the Government will consider&#151;it is vital in the context not just of Iran but of proliferation around the world&#151;that it would not be ridiculous to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give Iran some military guarantees against attack. Those need not be military guarantees for all circumstances, but guarantees against attack, and particularly nuclear attack. It would not be unreasonable to tell the Iranians that we recognise that, with two nuclear near-neighbours, the world could give some guarantees.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para70"><a name="stpa_201">Whether the Iranians would believe the guarantees would always be a matter for negotiation, but there are practical steps that a well-disposed British Government, which I believe we have, could take part in to move us away from the current increasing insecurity of the planet, and towards increasing security. There will not, perhaps, be the great romance of the clashes of the days of the cold war, but instead a rather miserable future for parts of the world, if not the world, if we allow nuclear proliferators to proceed not just with proliferation of nuclear weapons but with their use. There could be a much better world if we moved the agenda towards greater stability.

In the 1990s, there was a great deal of confidence that substantial progress was being made in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eliminating the threats of nuclear war, but the growth of international terrorism and the exposure of the international nuclear bazaar run by A.Q. Khan dented that optimism somewhat and shook any complacency out of the system.

<a name="50308h03_para73"><a name="stpa_204">The review conference comes at a crucial time; not only has the context of nuclear weapons discussions changed, but the activities of key states such as North Korea and Iran are giving us cause for concern.

recent years. The UK Government deserve continued recognition for the serious steps that have been taken: the withdrawal of the RAF&#039;s freefall nuclear weapon; the reduction to a single nuclear weapons delivery system in Trident; and a 70 per cent. overall reduction in the explosive power of the UK&#039;s military capabilities. The Government also signed up to the comprehensive test ban treaty in 1998, and they have undoubtedly played a significant and leading role in international diplomacy, not least in their work with France and Germany in relation to Iran.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para74"><a name="stpa_205">Elsewhere, as others have said, South Africa renounced its illegal nuclear weapons programme, setting an important precedent a decade ago, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Libya&#039;s more recent disposal of its capability was a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welcome step forward. Against those welcome developments, there are some real difficulties to consider. At the heart of the NPT is the tension between the five nuclear weapons states that wish to prevent proliferation in other states and, increasingly, non-state actors and the remaining 184 signatories that are willing to thole being outside the club on the understanding that real disarmament among the five will proceed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para75"><a name="stpa_206">Previous review conferences have experienced all the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficulties associated with that basic problem. In 2000, the conference eventually made some progress with the agreement to the so-called 13 steps. That highlighted, among other things, the need to bring the comprehensive test ban treaty into force, preserve the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anti-ballistic missile treaty and adopt new verification procedures. The United States of America has rejected the first of those propositions and has withdrawn from the second, and we still await details of how the verification capabilities are to be enhanced. Meanwhile, states such as India, Pakistan and Israel continue to be weapons capable and are showing few signs of volunteering their systems for disarmament. North Korea taunts the world about its intentions, and Iran is engaged in a dangerous game of bluff.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para76"><a name="stpa_207">Whatever historical perspective is taken on the possession and usefulness, or otherwise, of nuclear weapons, there can be no escape from the central deal at the heart of the NPT. The non-weapon states will allow the five nuclear states to possess their weapons on the basis of article VI, which demands the cessation of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arms race at an early date, and of a treaty on general and complete disarmament. Alongside that central issue are the security concerns, legitimate or otherwise, real or imagined, of those who possess or aspire to possess nuclear weapons; allusion has already been made to Iran. Equally, the nuclear weapon states themselves and others have a common interest in enhancing the verification procedures in order to ensure that non-state actors, as the jargon has them&#151;international terrorists, as we might fear them&#151;do not gain access to the technology and capability. The existence of A.Q. Khan&#039;s network suggests that we might be a bit off the pace, and real progress is needed on all sides at the conference to help us all catch up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para77"><a name="stpa_208">I hope that the Minister will tell us what he believes are the main features on the agenda at the conference. There is no doubt that we need to see some progress on the CTBT. We also need to see whether there is any prospect of a fissile material cut-off treaty. The welcome nuclear arms reductions of the early 1990s have been mentioned, and we need to ensure that they continue.

We must also recognise that the anti-proliferation efforts of the United States and others will gain enhanced credibility if those countries are seen to participate in the whole nuclear disarmament process and not just in the bits that concern them most.

<a name="50308h03_para79"><a name="stpa_210">I have always believed in multilateral nuclear disarmament and I retain that view very strongly. My concern is growing, however, that the process is stalled. Without further progress on disarmament, we shall not only fail to achieve the ultimate objective of a nuclear-free world, but increase the risks of proliferation and fail to equip ourselves to verify the state of nuclear capabilities throughout the world. As a nuclear weapons state, this country bears a particular responsibility and must take a lead at the conference in re-establishing some momentum in the disarmament process. The stakes have rarely been higher.

Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) on securing the debate. He has been a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doughty, consistent and passionate advocate of unilateral nuclear disarmament, although I, like my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewis), would be just as passionate in disagreeing with his perspective. None the less, he has maintained a level of consistency of which he should be proud.

The review is a real opportunity to test parties&#039; commitment to the three pillars of the NPT&#151;non-proliferation, disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para81"><a name="stpa_212">The geopolitical climate has changed immeasurably since the last review in 2000. We have seen the horrific events of 11 September in New York and the rise of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;international terrorism. We have seen the case for war in Iraq based on inaccurate intelligence about weapons of mass destruction. North Korea has withdrawn from the NPT and recently withdrawn from multilateral talks, subsequently claiming that it already has nuclear weapons. Iran appears to be misleading the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAEA and the international community over its apparently peaceful nuclear programme. Such events have underlined the importance of the non-proliferation treaty and of the IAEA continuing to work towards preventing nuclear proliferation and reducing nuclear arms throughout the world.

<a name="50308h03_para82"><a name="stpa_213">Unlike several hon. Members in the Chamber, Conservative Members are not anti-nuclear, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recognise the many benefits that nuclear technology has given the world because of its ability to create large amounts of relatively clean energy. Like my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East, I recognise that nuclear weapons played an important strategic role during the cold war years. The mutual threat between the two relatively rational adversaries ensured that nuclear weapons were never used. The non-proliferation treaty has subsequently played an important role in gradually downsizing our nuclear arsenals and preventing other countries from building new weapons through the strategic arms reduction treaties and, more recently, the strategic offensive reductions treaty. Indeed, that fact was recognised by the hon. Member for Islington, North and the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang).

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para83"><a name="stpa_214">The hon. Member for Islington, North was right to say that countries without nuclear weapons have been concerned for some time that nuclear powers are not progressing under article VI to reduce nuclear arsenals, and that there is a resistance to disarmament, despite disarmament being a stated objective of the treaty. I am sure that some hon. Members in the Chamber today would argue that that is not so. Indeed, the United States, the Soviet Union and more recently Russia have worked very hard through various treaties to reduce their nuclear warheads to secure a satisfactory resolution of at least part of article VI of the original treaty.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para84"><a name="stpa_215">We accept that, in a utopia, the globe would be free of nuclear weapons, but proliferation must be controlled, and reductions through bilateral treaties between the United States and Russia must continue before the UK commences disarmament discussions. That must happen only when the Government of whichever political party are convinced that our national security will not be undermined.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para85"><a name="stpa_216">Unfortunately, the debate must take place against a threat posed by nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction that may be greater now than it has been for some considerable time. I was intrigued by the comments made by the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd), who seemed to be arguing that the world is now a safer place than it was during the cold war.

<p>
<a name="50308h03_para86"><a name="stpa_217">The danger came with the break-up of the Soviet Union and the transfer of nuclear technology and fissile materials. Rogue states and non-state actors&#151;terrorists&#151;can now obtain nuclear technology and fissile materials with the intention of holding the world to ransom.

</p>

<a name="50308h03_para87"><a name="stpa_218">Sadly, rogue states and non-state parties are not the only ones who pose a problem.

nuclear power in the middle east prevents that most dangerous area of the world from becoming a nuclear-free zone. Thankfully, the India-Pakistan situation appears to have stabilised in recent years, but there is always the possibility of a crisis developing. I want all three states to be encouraged to join the NPT to help them to join the international community in this area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para88"><a name="stpa_219">Furthermore, the activities of the Pakistani scientist Qadir Khan show that Pakistan&#039;s refusal to comply with the wider implications of the treaty has created a significant problem, which became clear when Libya&#039;s decision to dismantle the nuclear programme revealed a clandestine market in nuclear material. Although some states have refused to sign the NPT altogether, other states&#151; Iran and North Korea are the two most obvious ones&#151;used it as a cover for the development of nuclear weapons.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para89"><a name="stpa_220">Although all signatories of the NPT are entitled to use&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes, Iran&#039;s huge wealth of natural resources makes its large-scale nuclear programme cause for concern. Despite what the hon. Member for Islington, North says, Iran has continued to mislead the IAEA over its acquisition of centrifuge technology and enrichment, which, with modern-day technology, is not necessary for the pursuance of domestic nuclear capabilities. It also refused to allow nuclear inspectors to visit parts of a key military complex at Parchin only 10 days ago.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para90"><a name="stpa_221">North Korea is another country that has flouted the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NPT&#151;indeed, it has withdrawn from it&#151;since the previous review meeting. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) argued that the North Koreans have acquired a nuclear capability because of the threat of an invasion by the United States. I argue that that is not the case, evidenced by the fact that, again following Libya&#039;s welcome disarmament, it was clear that North Korea sold uranium hexafluoride to Libya for the enrichment of nuclear weapons.
</p>






<p><a name="st_93"><a name="50308h03_spnew25"><b> Mr. Savidge </b> : I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way in a very interesting speech. I did not suggest for a minute that that was North Korea&#039;s sole purpose for acquiring a nuclear capability; I said that that might be an influence on such states.
</p>






<p><a name="st_94"><a name="50308h03_spnew26"><b> Mr. Simmonds </b> : I am grateful for that clarification.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para91"><a name="stpa_222">There are two main problems with North Korea. First, it is creating regional instability. The Minister will know of the domestic debate in Japan that questions whether is it right that Japan should be the only major power without nuclear weapons when North Korea has gone nuclear and South Korea wants to go nuclear. That political situation in Japan is causing great consternation. Secondly, rogue states with nuclear weapons and fissile material may provide nuclear weapons on the black market to non-state actors who could create dirty bombs and mayhem in many towns and cities throughout the world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para92"><a name="stpa_223">Clearly, some distinct factors need to be resolved at the review conference, which is to take place in May. The NPT needs to be strengthened to prevent the spread of technology and knowledge. Steps must be taken to secure military and civilian nuclear materials and technology in every country, including Britain, in order to avoid materials going missing. That is particularly appropriate for the ex-Soviet states.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para93"><a name="stpa_224">A number of key areas need to be discussed and decisions must be taken. There is the issue of the comprehensive test ban treaty; can the Minister update us on his view of the position of the United States and China? There is the ban on the production of fissile material. Does that relate just to existing stockpiles, or only to future production? That subject was mentioned by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North. Countries that withdraw from the NPT should immediately be referred to the United Nations Security Council.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para94"><a name="stpa_225">Nuclear suppliers should consider limiting the supply of enrichment and reprocessing plants to those states that already possess them. We should discuss creating a special committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors that would focus intensively on safeguards to ensure that nations comply with their international obligations. We should consider allowing only those states that have signed the additional protocols to import civilian nuclear programmes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para95"><a name="stpa_226">We should discuss raising inspection programmes for additional protocols. Many states have signed up to the additional protocols, but have not yet ratified them. That includes significant players, such as Russia, Iran, Uganda, Niger and Mexico. It is clear that the technology for proliferating resistant nuclear energy systems exists. Enrichment and reprocessing are not necessary for nations seeking to harness nuclear energy for peaceful means. That technology must be shared and facilitated, and there must be verification to ensure that those who are genuinely trying to benefit from nuclear energy and to facilitate the provision of it for peaceful purposes do not transfer technology across for military means. There should also be discussion of the adoption of an additional protocol to ensure that states and parties are unable to divert fissile material to secret weapons programmes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para96"><a name="stpa_227">The 2005 conference needs to succeed. In an ever-more dangerous world, members of the responsible international community need to stand together&#151;both those with nuclear weapons and those without. It was not anticipated that the previous review, in 2000, would be a success, but I give credit to the Government: through hard work and a willingness to take a strategic view and to compromise, they played a major role in ensuring that it was a success. Whatever political party is in government in May when the review takes place, Britain needs to play a full and constructive role in the meeting.

As I am sure he knows, no decision has yet been taken, but we are keeping our options open. A decision will need to be taken during the next Parliament. He asked what is going on at Aldermaston and whether it is consistent with the NPT. My advice is that what is happening is consistent with the treaty and that the modernisation of facilities at Aldermaston and the decommissioning of those no longer required, of which we have made no secret, is an ongoing programme of work to meet safety, regulatory and operational requirements. Were there to be significant developments, we would, of course, inform Parliament.

<a name="50308h03_para99"><a name="stpa_230">The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime.

The treaty is strong; it has the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;widest membership of any arms control treaty and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retains the wholehearted support of the United Kingdom and the majority of the international community. We want universal membership, although that may not be achievable in the current circumstances. We are also committed to strengthening the treaty to face new challenges.

<p>
<a name="50308h03_para100"><a name="stpa_231">Several hon. Members have asked what we want out of the review conference that will take place soon. The UK&#039;s main goal will be to emphasise the need for greater efforts in the non-proliferation and compliance parts of the treaty. Recent events have shown that a number of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;states continue to seek clandestine nuclear weapons programmes and also that individuals are willing to assist them in the proliferation of sensitive materials and technology. The treaty must therefore be strengthened and the political will generated to prevent such action.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para101"><a name="stpa_232">The treaty remains at the core of our nuclear counter-proliferation policy. It has proved successful in limiting the number of countries deciding to develop nuclear weapons. It provides the essential underpinning to maintain international cohesion when addressing the challenges posed by Iran and North Korea, as it did recently in respect of Libya&#039;s nuclear programmes. It also serves to strengthen the controls on the transfer of sensitive technology, without which progress in the International Atomic Energy Agency and other forums would become more difficult.

It says in my briefing document that that was not often acknowledged, but the main Opposition party, the Liberal Democrats and Labour Members have acknowledged today that the UK&#039;s record on disarmament is good. The United Kingdom has made considerable progress on the 13 practical steps towards nuclear disarmament that were agreed at the previous review conference five years ago. For example, we are working on a programme to develop UK expertise in verifying the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons internationally. It is a three-part exercise, which sets out the methodologies for the verification of nuclear disarmament.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para103"><a name="stpa_234">We will focus at the review conference on monitoring the nuclear warhead complex. We shall also summarise the range of technologies and approaches that have been researched during the five-year programme. The work will provide the basis for methodologies that could be used in a verification regime for a future disarmament treaty. We will publish a consolidated paper on that work at the conference. The United Kingdom remains fully committed to all aspects of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, including global and verifiable nuclear disarmament. We have a good record of fulfilling our NPT obligations on nuclear disarmament. The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) spelt out some of the measures that we have taken, but I shall describe them in slightly more detail.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h03_para104"><a name="stpa_235">We have withdrawn and dismantled the RAF&#039;s freefall bomb, so Trident is now our only nuclear weapons system. We dismantled the last Chevaline warhead in 2002. We have reduced our operationally available stockpile to fewer than 200 warheads, which is a reduction of more than 70 per cent. in the potential explosive power of our nuclear forces since the end of the cold war. We have reduced the readiness of our nuclear forces: only one Trident submarine is now on deterrent patrol; it carries 48 warheads. The submarine on patrol is usually on several days&#039; notice to fire and its missiles are detargeted.

All enrichment and reprocessing facilities in the United Kingdom are now liable to international inspection. We have continued to press for negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. Indeed, we announced in 1995 that we had stopped the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices.

We are committed to working towards a safer world in which there is no requirement for nuclear weapons. We continue to play a full role in international efforts to strengthen arms control and prevent proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. However, the continuing risk from the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the certainty that a number of other countries will retain substantial nuclear arsenals means that our minimum nuclear deterrent capability, currently represented by Trident, is likely to remain a necessary element of our security for the foreseeable future. We continue to support multilateral negotiations towards mutual balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons worldwide. When we are satisfied that sufficient progress has been made to allow us to include British nuclear weapons in any negotiations without endangering our security interests, we shall do so.

<a name="time_19">
<a name="50308h04_time0"><h5>3.59 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_100"><a name="50308h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ben Chapman  (Wirral, South)</b>  (Lab): I am delighted to have secured this debate on planning applications at Port Sunlight village. It presents an opportunity for me both to highlight the importance of the village to our heritage and to represent the concerns of residents, which I substantially share. This self-contained residential area is hugely significant, not only to the region, not even solely to the country as a whole but internationally, as I hope that a short history will help to illustrate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para0"><a name="stpa_243">Port Sunlight was born of a most laudable combination of human qualities, which is often found in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the throes of the industrial revolution&#151;the entrepreneurial spirit and philanthropy. English Heritage has said that Port Sunlight is arguably the finest remaining example of the so-called workers&#039; village and a forerunner to the garden city movement. In common with Bourneville, the home of the Cadbury brothers&#039; chocolate factory, and Saltaire, established by the wool baron Sit Titus Salt, Port Sunlight was founded in order to provide self-contained, clean, modern and sanitary accommodation for workers employed at the adjacent factory. William Hesketh Lever, born in 1851, expanded his father&#039;s already prosperous enterprise, before beginning to specialise in the marketing of soap in 1884. Business boomed and, to cater for demand, construction of new premises began in 1888. In the following two years, land was purchased to allow for 28 houses to be built.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para1"><a name="stpa_244">The architect of the initial round of construction was William Owen but, subsequently, a plethora of people lent themselves to design homes, which has resulted in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the creation of the unique mix that we enjoy at Port&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunlight today. Uniquely, and in contrast to Bourneville, Lever and Owen married the philanthropic endeavour of improvement of the working class with the visual tradition of the sylvan suburb. By the turn of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;century there were 400 houses, and the village continued to expand; today, there are nearly 1,000 dwellings. Port Sunlight possesses a character which it has preserved well; my constituency, the community and the country are richer for it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para2"><a name="stpa_245">A rich tapestry of features contribute to making Port Sunlight what it is. The Lady Lever art gallery contains one of the most beautiful collections of fine and decorative arts in the country, and the recently refurbished Gladstone theatre is a gem. They are but two such institutions, and they are not merely minor curiosities&#151;they are part of our cultural heritage. The importance of Port Sunlight was recently recognised, when a project of &#163;1 million, to construct a heritage centre befitting its status, received funding partly from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Heritage Lottery Fund and partly from the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European Union objective 1 programme for Merseyside.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para3"><a name="stpa_246">Port Sunlight is also a living place, with a pub, a school, a church, a bowling green, and, until recently, a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post office&#151;the Post Office, with a shortage of sensitivity, recently announced its closure. In addition, there have been places of work in the village&#151;a garden centre, offices, and a gardeners&#039; compound. The village also has its own railway station. It needs to be a living and working place, not a &quot;Disneyfied&quot; dormitory.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para4"><a name="stpa_247">However, there is a problem. After Unilever&#151;as the company became&#151;set up a new company to manage the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;village at arm&#039;s length in the 1960s, a process began that eventually led to housing being sold, either to residents whose tenancies had expired, or on the open market. In 1999, management of the village passed to an independent charitable organisation established for the purpose, the Port Sunlight village trust. Its declared responsibilities include to preserve


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;and maintain the Port Sunlight Conservation Area&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in Merseyside for the benefit of the nation at large, the present character and amenities of that area and whatever of the historical, architectural and constructional heritage may exist in the Port Sunlight Conservation Area aforesaid whether in the form of buildings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. open spaces or otherwise which are of particular beauty or historical, architectural or constructional interest.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para5"><a name="stpa_248">I regret that the proposals made jointly by the trust and Miller Homes, which I will outline shortly, threatened those terms of reference and the character of the village. The trust appears by omission tacitly to admit that the plans do not fit with the mission statement I have quoted, by referring to it as setting out what


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;the trust may do and does not in any way determine what the Trust must do.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para6"><a name="stpa_249">It is not the fact of the proposed developments per se that cause me and many of my constituents concern, although by their nature plans for development in conservation areas with listed status such as Port Sunlight should be treated with the utmost caution. Any development, no matter how it fits in with existing designs, can alter a village&#151;in this case a village of 1,000 dwellings already&#151;if it is of sufficient scale.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para7"><a name="stpa_250">New homes have been constructed in the past decade or so, but have not presented a particular problem. However, they were designed in the traditional arts and craft style and blend in with the village as it stands. Rather, it is the background to the trust&#039;s insistence on recent proposals that requires close attention, for the justification is claimed, substantially, to be financial.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para8"><a name="stpa_251">The village trust says that the planning permission that it seeks is essential to its needs if it is to comply with the covenant established with the trust&#039;s inception. The trust says that, for various reasons, it needs to develop and raise money by selling new properties for capital and by building properties to rent. Accordingly, the trust and Miller Homes submitted six applications, which could have provided 296 new dwellings, apparently on the questionable basis that if enough applications were submitted for enough dwellings, at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least some would get through. By themselves, 296&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwellings would change Port Sunlight village, whatever their design.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para9"><a name="stpa_252">From that swathe of applications made to the Wirral borough council planning department, for dwellings of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;varying design and location, two were accepted on 11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;January 2005. Just for the record, they are for 21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apartments on Water street and 62 apartments on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wharf street. The two approved applications may involve the least offensive of the designs proposed and at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least one is in the arts and crafts style, but the development of 62 apartments raises the greatest concern, because those apartments represent a deviation from the character of the village.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para10"><a name="stpa_253">The trust&#039;s financial predicament, which is claimed to be the cause of the development, has two elements. First, prior to the establishment of the trust a financial audit was undertaken with a view to making the trust self-sufficient in building and public space upkeep, with the aid of an annual income provided by Unilever as part of a &#163;25 million settlement with which the trust was established. Even now, Unilever does not accept that that dowry was insufficient for the purpose. Moreover, it was for the trustees who first joined the trust to establish that it was adequate&#151;including, in my view, by showing due diligence in relation to it. In the light of further studies conducted after the trust&#039;s inception&#151;and, effectively, by the trust itself&#151;that sum was claimed to be insufficient to cover the costs of maintaining and refurbishing the complex.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para11"><a name="stpa_254">Secondly, the trust&#039;s finances were hit by losses suffered as a result of the stock market downturn in 2000. That the stock market has declined is beyond question, but it seems to me that what goes down must eventually come up. In any event, although consistently prayed in aid of what is proposed, finances should not be a material issue in such planning matters. Before any account is taken of the finances, I would need to be satisfied that the trustees had done all that they could through, for example, benchmarking with other model villages and learning from them, responsible tourism, exploiting the grants regime and so on. After all, Merseyside is an objective 1 area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para12"><a name="stpa_255">Many other aspects of the consideration of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications were questionable, not least the consultation with residents. The problem is that, although only two applications were approved, they were particularly open to debate. For the residents, it appeared that the council may have been acting against its own planning guidance, which states that local planning authorities should reject poor design where decisions are supported by clear planning policies, and that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;special regard should be had for such matters as scale, height, form, massing&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para13"><a name="stpa_256">in respect of


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;the traditional pattern/frontages&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and detailed design.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para14"><a name="stpa_257">Furthermore, it was felt that the consultation with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;residents was somewhat unsatisfactory and not in the spirit of the code of conduct. Some of the residents&#039; objections, for example, were not included in reports submitted for consideration by the planning committee.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para15"><a name="stpa_258">The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment has lodged objections to the designs themselves. Although the guidelines were not ignored, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot say without compunction that the designs are in keeping with the character of the village. Some of the proposed apartments would be three storeys high, but adjacent to two-storey existing buildings. The materials to be used would not be wholly sympathetic to the surrounding buildings. Moreover, there would be a high density of apartments, which would be at odds with William Lever&#039;s leafy suburban vision. The problem seems to be that the designs are confused; they are neither one thing nor the other.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para16"><a name="stpa_259">As part of the planning committee&#039;s consultation, CABE submitted the following comment:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;The footprint of the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. proposal for Wharf street that has been implemented is extremely large and is completely out of character with the other buildings in Port Sunlight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. CABE do not think any&quot;&#151;</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para17"><a name="stpa_260">I emphasise the word &quot;any&quot;&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;of the schemes are of a high enough quality to receive planning permission.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para18"><a name="stpa_261">However, two did.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para19"><a name="stpa_262">When the applications were approved, the trust expressed its disappointment that the remainder were rejected. It said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;We will have to go away and come up with some other plans about how we take things forward&#151;whether that be appealing some of the decisions that haven&#039;t gone in our favour or coming up with alternative developments&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para20"><a name="stpa_263">The chairman of the planning committee said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;The concept of conservation means to some that nothing ever changes. Others say that if anything does happen it must take on the spirit and flavour of the original architecture and form of an area. I hold the second opinion. I believe that so long as things are handled properly change and improvement can be achieved.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para21"><a name="stpa_264">I do not dissent from that, but the problem is that one wholly inappropriate design was recommended by the planners for approval. The very body entrusted with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protection of the village is now casting itself as a developer. Is the village properly protected in such circumstances?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para22"><a name="stpa_265">As I said, the final word may not have been spoken. Decisions were taken on 11 January, but more will be sought. It is commonplace for developers who have had applications turned down to appeal, unlike protestors against proposals, who get no appeal. Developers can appeal ad infinitum, but I hope that they will be more responsible and that there will be pause for thought.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para23"><a name="stpa_266">Before any further steps are taken or any proposals are made, I ask that certain items are considered. First, full account should be taken of those for whom the development will form part of the fabric of their lives. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay tribute to the Port Sunlight Conservation and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents Society and its campaign group Save Port Sunlight, which have attempted to limit inappropriate development. Those involved have organised, deliberated, written letters and collected 2,200 signatures for a petition. None of those efforts should be underestimated, but it saddens me that they became necessary.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para24"><a name="stpa_267">I am afraid that there seems to have been a lack of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constructive dialogue between the residents on the one hand and the trust and Miller Homes on the other. I hope that that will be put right, because dialogue is essential. It should not be merely cosmetic, because, in the long run, no one will benefit, and there will only be losers. The refusal by the trust and, to some extent, Miller Homes to engage seriously undermined the consultation process. What consultation there was with residents consisted of a four-hour presentation in a pub. Now, four hours is a long time, but the residents felt that they were being talked at, not listened to. The trust and Miller Homes were either unable or unwilling to answer many of the questions put to them. If residents had approached the issue with the mind of a saboteur, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could understand the trust&#039;s reticence, but that was not the case.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para25"><a name="stpa_268">The second point that I would like the Minister to consider is that there needs to be a master plan before any planning decisions are taken. As part of Liverpool&#039;s capital of culture year in 2008, Port Sunlight is, rightly, being promoted as a major attraction. Visitors will come from all over the United Kingdom and around the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 428WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
world. They will all congregate on Merseyside, and many will come to Port Sunlight. With the capital of culture year, we on Merseyside have only one crack of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the whip. The trust has cited long overdue maintenance and repairs that need to be carried out in advance of that as its overriding concern. Thus, there is a motivating factor for the cash-raising developments. It is right in so far as it recognises that work is needed and overdue. However, it is my belief and that of residents and other interested parties that not enough has been done to exploit other potential sources of funding.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para26"><a name="stpa_269">There should have been a greater focus&#151;admittedly limited by inadequate heritage centre facilities&#151;on attracting tourists and exploiting the tourist stay. The new visitor centre will help in that enterprise, but there are other initiatives to be taken. Some buildings may have lain idle for want of a realistic rental price being sought.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para27"><a name="stpa_270">Thirdly, a proposal for a conference on the future of Port Sunlight, put forward by English Heritage, is coming to fruition. It will bring together representatives from model villages across the UK in order to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, as well as for the development of best practice in respect of long-term management. That is well overdue and much to be praised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para28"><a name="stpa_271">In addition, English Heritage has offered to provide advice and, possibly, financial assistance to help the trust come up with a sustainable vision for long-term upkeep of the village. That is to be welcomed. I am delighted to have been asked to chair the conference, which will take place at Port Sunlight&#151;hopefully, in the autumn.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para29"><a name="stpa_272">Fourthly, English Heritage will be producing an authoritative book on Port Sunlight in its Informed Conservation series and I hope that that will act as a reference point for any future steps that might be taken in the village.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para30"><a name="stpa_273">Fifthly, we need to take account of the potential for world heritage site status. If Saltaire and New Lanark can qualify, some would say, surely Port Sunlight could qualify&#151;perhaps even more so. Lord McIntosh of Haringey, the Minister for Media and Heritage, has told me that the earliest that it could be included on a tentative list for nominations is 2006. We therefore have an opportunity to help Port Sunlight to get the best possible chance of being judged a site of &quot;outstanding universal value&quot;, which I think it is, as is required by the criteria for eligibility. I hope that when we move forward with that, we can get more support than we have had in the past from Wirral metropolitan borough council.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para31"><a name="stpa_274">Sixthly, and finally&#151;you will be glad to learn, Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Speaker&#151;I urge Unilever to use its good offices to ensure that any future development that is necessary at Port Sunlight is responsible. Not only does Unilever still have a vibrant factory as part of the Port Sunlight site&#151;as a consequence, it objected to the proposals that were put before the planning committee&#151;but that vast international company has, after all, Port Sunlight as its birthplace. It is a key&#151;possibly the key&#151;element of the Lever heritage. Unilever has a vested interest in the success of the village and I hope that it will do all that it can to stress that.

<p>
<a name="50308h04_para32"><a name="stpa_275">Let us hope that on the basis that I have outlined, all the parties concerned will reflect long and hard before making any further proposals for development at Port Sunlight.

</p>



<a name="time_20">
<a name="50308h04_time1"><h5>4.18 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_101"><a name="50308h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapman) on securing this debate. He raises an issue that is clearly important to a good number of local residents and, indeed, more widely.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para33"><a name="stpa_276">Until this debate I was not particularly aware of Port Sunlight or its story and fascinating history. As my hon. Friend so eloquently explained, it is an important part&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the legacy of efforts made by a number of philanthropic Victorian factory owners to secure decent homes for their workers. Thankfully, we now have our own decent homes strategy to redress that problem in the 21st century, but historically Port Sunlight ranks very much alongside the examples that he quoted of Saltaire and Bournville.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para34"><a name="stpa_277">Port Sunlight village follows from the Levers&#039; decision in the 1880s to move to new premises. That provided the opportunity for a fresh start, in the form of not only a new, modern soap factory&#151;by the standards of the day&#151;but nearby decent housing for workers, with schools, a library and other public buildings to encourage tenants towards self-improvement. That was, perhaps, an early example of sustainable community development.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para35"><a name="stpa_278">The first houses were built in the late 1880s and the building continued up to the start of the second world war. Different phases of building are distinguishable by the materials used, and they are all laid out in a landscape garden setting. I understand that no two blocks of houses in the village are identical. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that from the very beginning, in the late 19th century, every home was provided with a bathroom. That is quite exceptional. Because I was not familiar with the site I found some photos on the internet, so that I could visualise what my hon. Friend has been describing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para36"><a name="stpa_279">Modernisation and renovation work over the years has brought the village up to date, but without affecting its essential character and appearance adversely. I think that that has been acknowledged locally by the council in the designation of the village as a conservation area, and, nationally, by the fact that so many buildings&#151;900&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of them&#151;have been included in the statutory list of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buildings of architectural or historical importance. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very much agree with my hon. Friend that Port&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunlight village is a nationally&#151;indeed, internationally&#151;important place. It enjoys an international reputation and attracts a great number of visitors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para37"><a name="stpa_280">My hon. Friend has suggested, here and elsewhere, that the village might be a candidate for world heritage site status, under the terms of the UNESCO convention. I think that my hon. Friend will know, because he has been in touch with her about it, that that is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. To qualify for world heritage status a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 430WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
site must be of outstanding universal value judged against the criteria set out in UNESCO&#039;s operational guidelines. However, I might add that following a consultation exercise in 1998 and further discussions the Government drew up a list of 25 potential sites.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para38"><a name="stpa_281">After a rule change by UNESCO, which took effect in 2002, the UK is allowed to submit only one nomination per year for what is described as a cultural site for world heritage status. Some 17 sites remain of that initial tentative list of potential and future nominations. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think, therefore, that my hon. Friend can see that there will be a substantial number of sites for the Government to put forward in future years. That said, the Government expect to review the list in the next couple of years, and that will provide an opportunity to make the case for Port Sunlight. No final decisions have been taken about the form that the bidding process might take, or the precise timing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para39"><a name="stpa_282">The criteria are very demanding, so a strong case would need to be mounted to persuade the Secretary of State to put Port Sunlight on the list of potential UK sites. I shall of course communicate this debate to my right hon. Friend so that she is aware of the bid that may be on its way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para40"><a name="stpa_283">Since 1999 the responsibility for the management of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the landscape and environment of the village, in particular, and of the heritage centre there, has rested with a charitable trust, the Port Sunlight village trust. For reasons that I think my hon. Friend has explained, the trust was not adequately funded for the work that it took on, and it now needs to generate additional future income and capital to fund a backlog of work and help to secure the future management and maintenance of the village. That is a debate that my hon. Friend has raised; the question is how to go about the task.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para41"><a name="stpa_284">My hon. Friend suggested that the trust might not fully have explored the availability of grant aid to support its aims and that it might do more to generate income through tourism development. I can only suggest that he and his colleagues continue to exhort the trust to pursue those possibilities with the borough council and other agencies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para42"><a name="stpa_285">Of course, the main issue that concerns my hon. Friend, about which he has spoken, is the proposal by the trust to generate capital receipts by releasing land in the village for housing development. To that end, the trust, with, in some cases, the developer, Miller Homes, submitted a batch of six planning applications for a housing development on sites that overlap or lie adjacent to one another at the edge of the village, quite close to the factory buildings and straddling the boundary of the conservation area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para43"><a name="stpa_286">The planning applications have been determined by Wirral metropolitan borough council. In January it granted permission for two of the applications and refused permission for three. Those three are now the subject of appeals to the Deputy Prime Minister, together with the sixth, on which the applicants have appealed because of the council&#039;s failure to determine it in the prescribed period. Arrangements have been made for a public inquiry to be held into the appeals, and that is scheduled to open on 20 June.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para44"><a name="stpa_287">My hon. Friend will appreciate that, in the circumstances, it would not be right for me to say anything today about the merits or otherwise of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 431WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
developments proposed, because that might be seen as prejudicing the outcome of the appeals. Nor do I think it right to comment on the decision of the council to grant permission for the proposed apartments on Wharf street that so concern my hon. Friend and his constituents. Those were decisions for the council to take, and in doing so I am sure that it paid particular regard to the comments of CABE and English Heritage, as well as the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many representations that I understand it received from other organisations, local people and, of course, my hon. Friend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para45"><a name="stpa_288">In determining such planning applications, the council will, I am sure, have paid close regard to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely effect of the proposed development on the setting of nearby listed buildings and the character and appearance of the conservation area. Indeed, planning Acts require them to do so. The two main planning policy guidance notes relevant to the case appear to be PPG15 on planning and the historic environment and PPG3 on housing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para46"><a name="stpa_289">PPG15 provides a full statement of the Government&#039;s policies for the identification and protection of historic buildings, conservation areas and other elements of the historic environment, and then explains the role of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning system in their protection. It explains the importance of early consultation with the local planning authority on development proposals that would affect historic sites. The planning guidance also emphasises the importance of the requirements, set out in planning Acts, for local planning authorities to pay special regard to the effect of the development on the setting of listed buildings, and to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character of conservation areas, when considering applications for planning permission. It is important to remind the House that that planning guidance exists, and that local authorities are expected to pay due regard to it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para47"><a name="stpa_290">The aspects of PPG3 relevant to this subject are the requirements to give priority to the reuse of previously developed land in urban areas, to make efficient use of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land by building in a net density of no less than 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwellings to the hectare, and to promote good design in new housing developments.

<p>
<a name="50308h04_para48"><a name="stpa_291">Proposals to build near listed buildings, and in or close to conservation areas, can, as the proposals for Port Sunlight amply demonstrate, lead to considerable debate about the form that the development should take, and indeed about whether any development should be allowed at all. It is a most difficult balancing exercise. It is disappointing that the development permitted at Port Sunlight caused such strong local opposition, particularly if, as my hon. Friend suggested, a better solution might have been achieved through more meaningful dialogue. It is for the local planning authority to ensure that there is proper consultation on these matters. My hon. Friend&#039;s points about the future and about the importance of effective dialogue are well made and, I hope, will be well received.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para49"><a name="stpa_292">I tend to agree with my hon. Friend that if similar problems are to be avoided in future, it may be prudent for the trust and the borough council to agree a master plan for the village after appropriate consultation, particularly with local residents. That can only be of benefit to the site, but of course it is for those parties, and not the Government, to decide. Under the new regime in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, it is open to the local authority to develop an area action plan, and that would feed into the wider local development framework. I hope that that will provide opportunities for taking this matter forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h04_para50"><a name="stpa_293">My hon. Friend mentioned that he is chairing a conference that is taking place this year with English Heritage on the future of the site; I am sure that that, alongside the planning process currently in train, will provide another opportunity to consider the many issues that he has raised, and will provide a good opportunity to think afresh about the way forward. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congratulate him on securing this debate, and on making an impassioned plea on a topic that is clearly of great concern to his constituents.

<a name="50308h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Shoreline Management (Norfolk)</h3>

<a name="time_21">
<a name="50308h05_time0"><h5>4.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_103"><a name="50308h05_spnew0"><b> Norman Lamb  (North Norfolk)</b>  (LD): I am very pleased to raise an issue of great concern to people in my constituency. I am also pleased to see the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright) in the Chamber. We have worked together on the issue, and I think that our views on it are similar.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para0"><a name="stpa_294">The draft shoreline management plan has hit coastal communities in north Norfolk like a bombshell. Some of the people most directly affected are present today. They feel strongly about the issue and its impact on their futures and livelihoods. I hope that the Minister will also take their concerns seriously and understand why they feel as strongly as they do.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para1"><a name="stpa_295">My purpose today is to inform the Minister of the local reaction to the draft plan, which has been prepared in accordance with his Department&#039;s approach as outlined in the consultation document &quot;Making Space For Water&quot;. As the Minister will know, we are in the middle of our own consultation process on the draft plan. It is fair to say that there is great public cynicism these days about the process of consultation. Most people assume that decisions have already been taken and that whatever the reaction to such a consultation exercise, it will make no difference. My first question to the Minister is therefore whether he will listen to what we are saying and act on the genuine and serious challenges that we are making to the proposals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para2"><a name="stpa_296">It is important to make a few things clear. I do not claim to speak as an expert on coastal erosion and I do not claim fully to understand, for example, the impact of offshore dredging. However, I speak on behalf of a number of coastal communities who feel deeply disturbed by a change in approach that threatens their homes, their security and in some cases everything that they have ever worked for.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para3"><a name="stpa_297">I accept and understand that the management of the coastline is a massive challenge for any Government. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can remember walking along the cliff top in the mid-1990s with the then Conservative Minister. The district council was putting forward a proposal for a defence scheme for Happisburgh and seeking grant aid from the Government. The money was not forthcoming and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food stated as its policy that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;to attempt to protect every inch of coastline from change would not only be uneconomic but would work against the dynamic processes that determine the coastline and could have an adverse effect elsewhere and on the natural environment.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para4"><a name="stpa_298">That was the Government&#039;s position in 1993.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para5"><a name="stpa_299">I also understand that erosion of the coast has been going on for centuries. Many lost villages along the coast of East Anglia bear testament to that. None the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less, people want their homes and communities protected. That is their main wish and top priority.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para6"><a name="stpa_300">I am also aware of the potential impact of climate change. We are told that the country is tilting, with the east coast dropping by a millimetre or two every year. With climate change causing sea levels to rise by 4 or 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mm a year, the combined effect is that the sea level is rising by about 6 mm a year. Given that much of north and east Norfolk is close to sea level, the potential implications are clear for everyone to see.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 434WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para7"><a name="stpa_301">We do not approach the subject seeking to deny clear and stark facts. But we demand that people are treated fairly and in accordance with the principles of social justice. I want to demonstrate to the Minister the immediate impact of the publication of the draft plan. The plan, as he will know, contains maps, which are already inaccurate because of the rate at which erosion is changing the contour of the coastline. Those maps show clearly properties that are expected to be lost to the sea within specified periods of time. Without the plan&#039;s even having been approved, there has been an immediate and significant impact on property values, particularly in certain locations, on the saleability of property and on people&#039;s ability to secure a mortgage and to obtain insurance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para8"><a name="stpa_302">However, the impact goes well beyond the properties shown to be at risk on the shoreline management plans. Predicting the rate of erosion is a notoriously inexact science, as the Minister will recognise. For example, a plan drawn up for Happisburgh in 1992 by Halcrow, which is now responsible for the shoreline management plan, showed a line where the coast would be in 60 years&#039; time. We overtook that line in 2004, after just 12 years&#151;an inaccuracy factor of five. The uncertainty that results from the inexact nature of the science means that the plans have blighted far more properties than might be imagined. Just last weekend, I heard about a property situated a mile from the coast that had lost 25 per cent. of its value. It is in no realistic danger for a considerable time, but it is suffering the real effect on property values.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para9"><a name="stpa_303">Let me read from a letter from a constituent, who makes the point very well:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;My wife and I moved to Overstrand&#151;&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para10"><a name="stpa_304">one of the villages affected&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;just over two years ago. Because of my wife&#039;s ill health we decided to move from our current period property to a bungalow which would be easier for her to manage. We received and accepted an offer for our property in the middle of January and had an offer for a bungalow accepted. The moving process was well under way and we anticipated completion by the middle of March. Last week, our buyer pulled out because of the present uncertainty regarding the future of Overstrand. They were very keen to move to Overstrand and they had registered their children at the local school&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para11"><a name="stpa_305">That is an example of the impact of the proposed shoreline management plan on two families. It is having a devastating effect and must not be allowed to go forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para12"><a name="stpa_306">In the past few weeks, we have held public meetings in Happisburgh, Bacton, Mundesley and Overstrand. About 1,000 people have attended, at very short notice. That number in itself demonstrates the strength of feeling on the issue. People have told me of their circumstances both at those meetings and by letter. How does the Minister respond to people who have purchased property in the past few years, when the official policy was to hold the line, to defend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coastline? They are likely to have bought with the benefit of a mortgage, and could suddenly be plunged into negative equity. They will be left paying off their mortgages in the knowledge that there will be little or no capital asset left when they have finished paying.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para13"><a name="stpa_307">The situation has been described as &quot;a creeping paralysis&quot; by Clive Stockton, deputy leader of the district council and a business owner in the village of Happisburgh, who is here today. His business is a pub, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 435WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
which is profitable and successful. He has now had it valued at less than half what it cost to buy 14 years ago. That illustrates the real and current impact of the plan. I challenge the Minister to tell us whether he believes that it is socially just that a generation of people who happen to own properties in the affected villages could lose everything as a result of the Government&#039;s decision that it is too expensive to defend the coastline. What is disturbing is the absence of any indication that the Government recognise the human cost of effectively abandoning stretches of coastline.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para14"><a name="stpa_308">I want to consider the matter of compensation. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand that in France there is a compensation scheme called, in a typically French way, a solidarity fund. The Minister will be aware that I have written to him about compensation. When he wrote back to me on 16 November 2004, he confirmed that there were &quot;no current plans&quot; to introduce a compensation scheme, and that there was &quot;nothing to discuss&quot;. However, I have spoken to civil servants in his Department who tell me that the matter is being considered. In his letter, the Minister did, perhaps, hint at the possibility of some movement, when he recognised that the issue was &quot;of great interest&quot;, and that the Government would consider


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;the issues further with a view to clarifying future policy and its implications&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para15"><a name="stpa_309">in the Government response to the consultation &quot;Making Space For Water&quot;.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para16"><a name="stpa_310">The introduction of the compensation scheme would immediately address the problem of blight. Our suggestion is that payment is made at the point when the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property is lost to the sea, and that it is based on the value of that property without the problem of erosion. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recognise that such a scheme must be carefully designed, and I understand that any Government must&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be careful about open-ended commitments, but the case for such a scheme is overwhelming. It would immediately address the problem of blight described in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the letter that I read to the Minister, because it would give people renewed confidence to buy into these communities. Purchasers would know that their investment was safe. What hope can the Minister give those communities that do not have such a scheme?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para17"><a name="stpa_311">Importantly, the scheme would also have another very beneficial effect. At the moment, a decision to abandon a stretch of coastline is a no-cost option for any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government, so it looks very attractive. A compensation scheme would force any Government to judge more effectively whether to abandon the coastline or to defend it. They would have to balance the cost of compensation against the cost of defence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para18"><a name="stpa_312">I therefore directly challenge the Minister on this crucial subject. Does he accept that the principle of compensation is being discussed in his Department? Does he acknowledge that the publication of the shoreline management plan has now made this an urgent and pressing issue, because of its immediate impact on communities? Does he also accept the real and serious risk of blight in coastal communities unless the Government act?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para19"><a name="stpa_313">Two other issues have not been adequately dealt with in the draft shoreline management plan&#151;the impact of dredging, and the basis on which we establish the total cost of what is at risk if coastal erosion is not controlled.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 436WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para20"><a name="stpa_314">Extraordinarily, given its implications, the draft shoreline management plan says little about dredging. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;Whether or not there are links between offshore dredging and coastal erosion is uncertain&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para21"><a name="stpa_315">That is all it says, but at least it acknowledges that the impact is uncertain. I become very frustrated when I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear the dogmatic assertion that dredging has no effect on the rate of erosion.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para22"><a name="stpa_316">I pay tribute to Malcolm Kerby of the coastal concern action group, who is in the Chamber today. He has put body and soul into representing the interests of these communities, and does it very responsibly. He and I,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Peter Frew from North Norfolk district council, travelled to Brussels some time ago to meet Stefan Lombardo, who was head of the research project Eurosion, which is funded by the European Commission. He made it clear that offshore dredging could increase the rate of erosion. One must examine each case to determine the potential impact. Furthermore, he made it clear that he was not satisfied that the process of environmental impact assessments in applications for dredging licences was robust enough. The precautionary principle must be applied.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para23"><a name="stpa_317">The problem is that substantial sums of money are made from dredging. In 2002 alone, the Crown estate received &#163;5.2 million, which is 40 per cent. of its total income from the whole country, from marine minerals dredging off the Norfolk coast alone. The construction industry inevitably demands ever-increasing volumes of aggregate to meet, apart from anything else, the Government&#039;s own building plans.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para24"><a name="stpa_318">When the Minister replied to a parliamentary question from me back in January 2004, he confirmed that research was under way on the impact of dredging. Will he provide any more information on the outcome of that research? I know that research has been done, but what about the research that he said was under way last year?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para25"><a name="stpa_319">Many people argue that until we have a greater understanding of the impact of dredging, there should be a moratorium on dredging anywhere close to the coast. There must surely at least be a case for tougher assessment of new licence applications. Alternatively, there is surely a case for some of the revenues raised from dredging to be used for defending our coastline, or for building up a compensation fund.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para26"><a name="stpa_320">The draft shoreline management plan presents a false picture of the real cost of doing nothing. Appendix H.3.1.1 states that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;losses and benefits have been calculated only on the basis of residential and commercial property values. Other assets, such as utilities, and highways, and intangibles such as recreation, impacts on the local economy or environment, have not been valued or included&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para27"><a name="stpa_321">That makes nonsense of the whole plan. Surely, before taking decisions on how to progress with something so fundamental, which affects so many people&#039;s lives, we should have a clear understanding of the full cost and of the impact on the Norfolk broads, tourism, relocation of communities and our precious heritage.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para28"><a name="stpa_322">It is ludicrous that a decision of the district council to refuse an application for planning permission in a place close to the cliff edge where it is ludicrous to build new properties can be overturned on appeal by Government 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Mar 2005 : Column 437WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
inspectors. I accept that that is not the responsibility of the Minister&#039;s Department, but it is a failure of joined-up government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para29"><a name="stpa_323">The draft shoreline management plan is fatally flawed. It touches on the crucial issue of dredging in one sentence, but reaches no conclusion; it says nothing about the real social and economic impact of abandoning the coastline; it cannot address compensation because that would require Government action; and it fails properly to identify the full cost of doing nothing. Unless and until those crucial issues are addressed, the plan will be overwhelmingly rejected by local people and, no doubt, by members of North Norfolk district council.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para30"><a name="stpa_324">Finally, I repeat my request to the Minister to meet local people. Will he meet them, preferably in Norfolk but, if not, here? This matter is crucial to them, and they deserve the chance to tell him their views directly, as well as having me represent them and put forward their views.

I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be brief because I respect the fact that this is the debate of the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb); I simply want to make a few pertinent points. The hon. Gentleman has made all his points admirably and I agree with many of them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para31"><a name="stpa_325">As far as the coastline is concerned, my responsibility for my constituents is from Winterton down to Hopton. Some issues affecting that area may be different to those raised by the hon. Gentleman, but I want to raise one or two relevant issues with the Minister, some of which have been touched on. The first such issue has been raised by my constituents. Responsibility for different parts of the coastline falls to different agencies. In one area in Winterton, it is probable that Great Yarmouth district council is responsible for one part and the Environment Agency for another. We should consider making one agency responsible for the whole coastline.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para32"><a name="stpa_326">Property blight, on which the hon. Gentleman touched, will probably affect many areas along the coastline. There is also the issue of planning blight. Most planning legislation looks only 20 years ahead. Development is already under way in areas that could be lost. What should we tell people when issuing land searches?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para33"><a name="stpa_327">Important wildlife habitats could be under threat should the shoreline management plan go ahead. We have limited or no resources to fund coastal defence work through the borough council strategy. New sea walls would cost around &#163;10,000 a metre; one groyne would cost around &#163;30,000. Are more resources available? Is there a relationship with offshore dredging? The report says conclusively that there is no scientific

evidence; I call again for the immediate cessation of at least the export of aggregates, which would reduce the need for dredging by 40 per cent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para34"><a name="stpa_328">The SMPs were prepared using guidance and methodology provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Perhaps that is why issues such as social justice are not considered. In nature&#039;s terms, the coastline is totally interrelated; what is taken from one part must affect another. If North Norfolk district council invests in defences and we further south do not, the coastline lower down will suffer accelerated erosion.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para35"><a name="stpa_329">Will the Minister consider our proposal for an underwriting scheme under which the Government may pay the market value for properties that are lost? That would enable them to withdraw from sea defence expenditure in certain areas without punishing those who live in affected areas. Will they take control of all coastal protection issues in order to give consistency, put resources in place and deal with defence?

</p>

Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) on securing the debate. He has written to me on several occasions and I am aware of local residents&#039; concern. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a great deal of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman about many of the points that he raised. Indeed, my hon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para37"><a name="stpa_331">I want to respond by setting out the strategy in context. There has been some misinformation on the issue and people have been misled. Also, many people want to look for simplistic solutions when the situation involving coastal dynamics is complex.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para38"><a name="stpa_332">The hon. Member for North Norfolk will know that the Government have provided major increases in investment for the funding of flood and coastal erosion risk management in recent years. That is set to continue in the next three-year spending period. However, we cannot mislead people and suggest that we can defend every inch of the coastline. I know that the hon. Gentleman was being very reasonable and realistic about that in the case that he made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para39"><a name="stpa_333">The issue is not just finance but sustainability, technical solutions and what will work. My understanding is that the original shoreline plan, even where it currently recommends holding the line, was arrived at by overruling the expert engineers and consultants. They advised local authorities at that time that the defences were not sustainable and would not withstand the coastal movement and dynamics that were involved. They have been proved right.

However, we must set priorities for who gets schemes first, on the basis of need. We have tried to operate them in an open and transparent way, through such things as a priority scoring system, so that people can see their position on the list and why the scores have been set as they have. That is new, and we have done it so that we can be open and honest with people, and not mislead them.

<a name="50308h05_para40"><a name="stpa_334">DEFRA encourages operating authorities to take a strategic approach to flood and coastal defence problems. As part of that, it has indeed issued guidance for coastal defence authorities, to assist with the preparation of shoreline management plans. Those plans are designed to enable a strategic approach to be taken to flood and coastal defence works along the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coastline, based on the detailed understanding of its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;natural processes, planning issues, current and future land use, defence needs and environmental considerations. All the points that the hon. Gentleman raised about infrastructure and the Norfolk broads are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken into account in relation to shoreline management plans.

<p>
<a name="50308h05_para41"><a name="stpa_335">The draft SMP for north Norfolk is one of three to be used to carry out a trial of guidance for the second generation of SMPs; the aim is to provide a large-scale assessment of the risks associated with coastal processes and present a policy framework for reducing risks to people and the developed, historical and natural environment, in a sustainable manner. Those are the very points that the hon. Gentleman raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para42"><a name="stpa_336">The draft was published in December last year and people living in North Norfolk, Great Yarmouth and Waveney are being asked for their views on how the coastline from Kelling to Lowestoft Ness should be managed. The consultation ends on 31 March. The work is funded by DEFRA and is the culmination of two years&#039; work by engineering consultants who have been appointed by, and work for, North Norfolk district council, Great Yarmouth borough council, Waveney district council, the Environment Agency, English Nature and Great Yarmouth port authority. They engage experts and consider the coastal dynamics.

<a name="50308h05_para43"><a name="stpa_337">The draft SMP has, of course, not been completed. It has not been sent to DEFRA for agreement. That happens at the end of the process. I have not seen the details of the shoreline management plan. I am not involved in such matters, nor should I be. It is a locally-led process and it should be based on local consultation. The hon. Gentleman raised many points. If there were errors in the plan, the consultation process is the right way in which to deal with such matters and to bring about amendments. He asked me to meet residents, but that would be a pointless exercise. I am interested in people&#039;s views, and he knows that I read his letters

in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great detail, but there is nothing that I can input into the shoreline management plan because it is determined locally. I will not see the final plan until it is complete and sent to me. People are being misled if they think that, by lobbying me, the plan will change.

<p><a name="st_110"><a name="50308h05_spnew5"><b> Norman Lamb </b> : But the Minister knows that, even under his existing priority scoring scheme, there is no chance of the communities having a scheme that will meet the criteria to obtain funding. It is nonsense to suggest that there is any possibility of their obtaining funding from DEFRA. The process is being driven by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFRA. The Minister has already said that the new&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shoreline management plan is being prepared on the basis of guidance from his Department and in accordance with &quot;Making Space for Water&quot;, which was issued last October. He cannot opt out of it.
</p>






<p><a name="st_111"><a name="50308h05_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : I repeat that I have no input into the shoreline management plan. Each one has to be designed to take into account local circumstances and needs, and that is right and proper. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument. There are communities that think that they are facing immediate threat, but which may not face a threat for 50 or 60 years. At present, the scheme could cost millions and defend houses in single figures, but in 50 years the cost-benefit analysis and the scoring system may have changed. It is likely that there will be several revisions of the shoreline management plan during that time. So it is wrong therefore for people to think that they are immediately under threat, that the shoreline management plan will be the only shoreline management plan and that there will not be changes in the future. It is true that some people may be more immediately affected than others, but we must recognise that those are the circumstances of the case.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para44"><a name="stpa_338">As for assistance to communities&#151;my time is short, so I must be quick&#151;I confirm that there are no current plans for compensation. The present arrangements have been the same for all Governments. I note that that is also Liberal Democrat policy. It is certainly the Conservative party&#039;s policy, although we are in a pre-election period and I very much fear that some people will make all sorts of false and unsustainable promises. I am trying to be honest about such matters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50308h05_para45"><a name="stpa_339">As for our plan, we recognise the impact on communities so we are considering issues further with a view to clarifying future policy and its implications. We hope to publish a formal response soon to the points that have been made on such issues as part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consultation on &quot;Making Space for Water&quot;. Compensation is one of several different approaches to help individuals and communities adapt to change. However, there has never been a compensation scheme in this country, given that we provide coastal defences under permissive powers. The implications are not only for Norfolk. If a scheme is introduced, it will apply throughout the country. We must then ask ourselves whether it should be applied to flood victims or people who have already lost their homes to coastal erosion. It is difficult.

<p>
<a name="50308h05_para46"><a name="stpa_340">I am always open to evidence that aggregate dredging is a problem. We insist that a coastal impact study is carried out to provide information on a scheme to make sure that proposed dredging is far enough off shore to

ensure that there is no beach draw-down into deepened areas. There has not been evidence that offshore dredging has caused coastal erosion. We keep an open mind on such matters. We look for such evidence, but those people who say that it does cause coastal erosion have an obligation to bring forward the evidence. None has been forthcoming from any source, including the

European Union source that was mentioned. No criticism has been made of the environmental impact assessment study that is applied in such cases. I regret that my time is coming to a close. The hon. Member for North Norfolk might wish to raise other points with me as a result of the debate and I shall be only too pleased to answer them in further detail.
