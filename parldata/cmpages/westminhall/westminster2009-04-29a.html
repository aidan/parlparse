 It is extremely good to see a respectable sprinkling of MPs who want to talk about honey bee health at 9.30 on a Wednesday morning. It is several months since we last met to discuss this topic in a debate organised by the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), and we were all pleased that he managed to do that. A lot has happened since then, and it is important to record what has happened and to start discussing what needs to happen next.</p>

During that debate, a fair number of my parliamentary colleagues&#151;marvellous though they all are&#151;showed an unfortunate weakness for what I can only call weepingly awful bee puns. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> They are coming already. I simply say this to colleagues on both sides of the Chamber: &#147;If you feel the urge coming on, don&#146;t do it.

It is worth stopping to congratulate everybody involved on the campaign. We  <br>

should also congratulate the Minister on bringing home the bacon&#151;hon. Members will notice that I did not use any honey puns there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para4"><a name="09042944000018">As I have said, we have something to celebrate. We have &#163;10 million of research funding from a variety of sources, including two different research councils and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. We also have an additional &#163;2.4 million over two years, which will go to the National Bee Unit. Those are real achievements, and everybody should be grateful to the Government for having listened to the points that were made and a little proud of the fact that the campaign was launched and has been successful. But&#151;this is a big but&#151;the topic is too important for us to leave it at that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para5"><a name="09042944000019">In our last debate, points were rightly made on both sides of the political divide about the importance of honey bee activity to our national economy&#151;particularly our agricultural economy&#151;and to our national environment and ecology. It is worth repeating that honey bees are probably the single most important source of insect pollination in the British isles, although there are other pollinators. We all understand that moths, butterflies, hoverflies and bumblebees play a part, but honey bees are crucial, particularly in the early season; indeed, they still play a large part even in mid and later summer. The reason for that is straightforward: they are more active in the early season, when the weather is cooler, and there are an awful lot more of them. A typical honey bee hive will have several bees in it over the winter, and that means that it will start from a stronger position than a bumblebee nest, which will start with a solitary queen and certainly no more than one or two bees. By the middle of the summer, a honey bee hive can easily have 40,000 bees in it, and a strong colony may have even more. At the height of its powers, a bumblebee nest will have a couple of hundred bumblebees in it. Although other pollinators are important, honey bees are the main event and are the most important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para6"><a name="09042944000020">What led us to debate this issue last time, and what led me to seek this debate, is not only an economic imperative, but an ecological imperative. Honey bees pollinate not only economically important crops, but an awful lot of the wildflowers and trees that we take for granted as part of the British countryside and which contribute enormously to the landscape that we all know and love.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para7"><a name="09042944000021">Clearly, therefore, honey bees are important, but their health has been suffering. It must be said that it has not suffered as badly as it has in some other countries around the world. There are horrifying stories from America of commercial beekeepers suffering the near complete loss of hundreds of colonies in the space of a few weeks. Losses have not happened on quite the same scale here, thank goodness, but they have still been significant. Last year, the losses were something like triple the normal seasonal average, and it is important to understand why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para8"><a name="09042944000022">It is important that we do not rely only on research into honey bee health conducted in other countries. Although some of the factors highlighted in research that is done in, say, the American environment apply to Britain, there are important differences. Our climate is obviously different from that in many other countries, because our island is comparatively wet and chilly. Our agricultural practices are also different, so there may not be direct comparisons. Equally importantly, our  <br>

indigenous honey bees&#151;albeit that they have been quite heavily mongrelised by successive waves of imported bees&#151;have evolved to suit the local environment and may therefore not be identical to, or may indeed differ significantly from, indigenous honey bees in other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para9"><a name="09042944000023">It is therefore important for us to have our own research so that we can understand the particular combination of factors affecting honey bee health in this country. Although there is not as yet any cold scientific certainty about what is causing colony losses, there is an emerging hypothesis, and it seems likely that we are dealing with a combination of several factors. Those factors may include agricultural practices, diseases and parasites such as varroa and even climate change and the weather&#151;all sorts of factors could be involved. There is no certainty, only an emerging consensus, and that consensus is still very much open to challenge, which is why work on the issue is so necessary.</p>

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="09042944000024"><a name="90429h0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="09042944000458"><b>Rob Marris (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate and on persevering with the issue. Does he agree that although we welcome the vastly increased research funding from various sources, including the Government, there is a risk that too much of the money will be sucked into a registration scheme, rather than being used for research, and will be used to focus much more broadly than some of us would wish on pollinators, rather than honey bees?</p>

 I completely agree. In fact, that issue will make up a substantial part of the second section of my contribution, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman will bear with me and hold that thought. If I do not cover any of his points in quite the way that he would like, perhaps he can top up my contribution later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para10"><a name="09042944000026">We have had the welcome announcement of &#163;10 million for pollinator research, plus the extra &#163;2.4 million over two years for the National Bee Unit. We therefore need to move from campaigning to setting up a programme to ensure that the money is spent productively and in a way that hits the various bases that need to be hit to ensure that we genuinely understand the problems of honey bee health. I therefore suggest that we consider setting up an all-party parliamentary group to track progress and make sure that the money continues to be spent in a way that meets the objectives that we and the British Beekeepers Association have laid out, and that that happens with a greater degree of public accountability. Perhaps any hon. Member who is interested in setting up such an all-party group will contact me in my office later; or I could give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) who may want to suggest something. Does my hon. Friend want to make an intervention or is he signalling that he would like to be involved in the group?</p>

is congratulating themselves and her on the progress so far, but we need to go into the detail now, so perhaps I can press her on a couple of important issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para12"><a name="09042944000030">My first point is the one made in the intervention by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), which is that the Government&#146;s support is labelled as being for research on not only honey bees but pollinators. I am sure that all hon. Members present agree that other pollinators may need some research, too. Bumblebees, for example, are undoubtedly under pressure, and some species are dwindling rapidly in the UK. I have been told that the same thing is happening to some species of butterfly and moth as well. I do not think that anyone is saying that all Government money must go on honey bee research or the world will end, but the right balance is important. I hope that the Minister&#146;s response will reflect the fact that, as I have said, honey bees are the main event for pollination in this country and therefore, from an ecological and economic point of view, it is sensible to give them the lion&#146;s share, while not trying to close off research on other worthy causes. Perhaps the Minister will suggest, as far as she can at this stage, what the proportions of the spend will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para13"><a name="09042944000031">It is important to ask what kind of research will be involved. It is possible that robust proposals that are scientifically extremely interesting will come before one of the research councils for funding from the pot of money that has been announced&#151;I understand that the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council may well take many of the detailed allocation decisions on research grants&#151;and that those proposals will advance the frontiers of human understanding of pollinator behaviour, or even honey bee behaviour, but that will not help with the problem that we are debating today of honey bee health and the reason why honey bee colonies in the UK are under pressure as never before. Therefore an element of the process must be to ensure that applied criteria, as well as pure science criteria, are involved. There may be a place for pure science, but applied criteria will be important, and it would be helpful to have the Minister&#146;s reassurance about that.</p>

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="09042944000032"><a name="90429h0001.htm_spnew9"><a name="09042944000462"><b>David Taylor:</b>
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree&#151;my intervention is linked to what my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) said a moment ago&#151;that there will no doubt be a tendency as part of the research to reach for the compulsory registration of beekeepers, so that they can be required to supply information? Should that not be avoided, as my constituent, John Dickinson, who is a beekeeper, pointed out when there was a consultation on the strategy last year? We do not want to squeeze out of existence the small hobby beekeepers, because they have a part to play in finding a solution to some of the problems. We must not make it more difficult for them.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention; if he will preserve his soul in patience for just a little longer I will come on to the point, but if I do not cover it in sufficient detail perhaps he will round it out later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para14"><a name="09042944000034">To come back to the point I was making about whether the research that is supported will be pure or applied research, it is important to understand what mixture is likely. Since we have a pressing practical  <br>

problem in this country of British honey bee colonies collapsing for one reason or another, it is important to understand why that is happening happens and to prioritise research that may help in understanding it. I recommend to the Minister a document entitled &#147;Honey Bee Health Research Concepts&#148;, issued by the British Beekeepers Association, as a good starting point to show some of the questions to which we need answers. It might be helpful if the Minister would reassure hon. Members that a response is in the works, from her Department or the National Bee Unit, to the paper from the BBKA, which is one of the leading authorities. I understand that the BBKA presented the paper to the NBU a while ago and that a response has not so far been forthcoming; it would be right and proper to provide one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para15"><a name="09042944000035">That brings me to my final point, which has been raised in interventions by the hon. Members for Wolverhampton, South-West and for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)&#151;the question of the &#163;2.3 million or &#163;2.4 million of additional money over two years for the National Bee Unit. There is a lack of clarity among the general public about how that money will be spent, and it would be helpful if the Minister were to put much more flesh on the bones. In the absence of detailed information, theories are going the rounds. The most current one, which may be behind the two interventions, is that the money will be spent on an increase in the number of bee inspectors, funded by the NBU, and that those inspectors will spend much of their time ferreting out unregistered beekeepers and inspecting their hives&#151;there is nothing necessarily  wrong with that&#151;to get them registered on BeeBase, the Government&#146;s all-singing, all-dancing database of beekeepers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para16"><a name="09042944000036">The reason why it is important for the Minister to clarify what is happening is that that analysis of how the money will be spent is creating a fair degree of concern among the beekeeping fraternity and, I think, more widely. I should own up at this point and say that I am a beekeeper. I am one of the small hobbyist beekeepers, so there is no financial interest to declare, or anything of that kind, but I have been a beekeeper for a great many years and may therefore be affected by what happens. I understand that historically the main purpose of bee inspection was, rightly, to find and deal with cases of notifiable diseases, such as American foul brood and European foul brood. That is clearly a sensible use of public funds and has been happening for many years&#151;I think that the process was set up soon after the second world war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para17"><a name="09042944000037">Increasing the number of bee inspectors will not necessarily help us in getting a large marginal improvement in the incidence of notifiable diseases; if it will help, perhaps the Minister will give us some figures. My reason for saying so is that the total annual number of cases of European and American foul brood combined is usually fewer than 500. If we spend &#163;2.3 million to &#163;2.4 million on reducing that number by, say, 10 per cent., that is a very high figure for cutting notifiable disease cases in Britain as a whole. We have a low-level background problem with foul brood, but it is not the burning issue, which is clearly the number of colonies that are dying. Most of the scientific research points the finger not at those two notifiable diseases, but at things such as varroa, which is not notifiable because it is pretty much endemic in this country now and which may play a much larger part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para18"><a name="09042944000038">Why increase the number of bee inspectors, if not to deal with notifiable diseases? The suspicion is that it is to find beekeepers who are not registered on BeeBase and get them to register. If that is so, it seems an exceptionally expensive way of creating a mailing list, and, if that is the Government&#146;s intention, there must be better ways to do it. What was the Government&#146;s intention in creating and maintaining BeeBase in the first place? I hope that the Minister will forgive the degree of justifiable cynicism on both sides of the House about any project that involves a Minister saying, &#147;I have got this great plan for a big database funded by the Government, which is going to be cheap and quick to organise.&#148; The history of most Government database projects is not that great.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para19"><a name="09042944000039">We need to understand the purpose of BeeBase. If we are trying to improve the state of honey bee health, we must first understand what is causing its collapse. If it is something to do with a combination of agricultural practice and climate change, for example, having a database and a mailing list of beekeepers will not make a blind bit of difference. In all probability, it is not just about those two factors, and there are things that beekeepers could and should be doing to improve standards of insect husbandry. If that is what we wish to achieve, having a socking great database of beekeepers is not necessarily an intelligent first step.</p>

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="09042944000040"><a name="90429h0001.htm_spnew11"><a name="09042944000464"><b>Mr. David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. Surely one of the ways in which we can improve knowledge is to be more transparent about which pesticides are used, who uses them and how much they are used, as that affects humans as well as bees. The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, and the advisory panel on pesticides are still far too covert in the way in which they operate. It is time that we had decent information, which would no doubt provide us with interesting facts about the impact of pesticides on bees as well as human beings.</p>

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="09042944000041"><a name="90429h0001.htm_spnew12"><a name="09042944000465"><b>John Penrose:</b>
 I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. Many in the farming community would point out that over the past 20 years or more, the incidence of honey bee hive death has been dramatically reduced because of changes in agricultural practice. However, it may be that additional changes since then have created some kind of cumulative effect or combined with other factors, which we need to understand. That is why it is essential for this research to take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para20"><a name="09042944000042">If there is an unintended new side effect from some kind of agricultural practice&#151;I am sure we all hope that that is not true&#151;we must ensure that we shine a light on it. Farmers will be the first to say that they have an interest in ensuring honey bee health, since many of their crops depend on it. They will want to understand this matter and modify their behaviour, if necessary. However, it is important not to victimise farmers and accuse them of anything unless and until we have cold, hard, scientific facts about the contributing factors. If pesticides are a factor, I am sure that farmers will want to adjust what they do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para21"><a name="09042944000043">It is important for the Minister to explain what the money is to be spent on, and what the Government&#146;s intention is behind the building of BeeBase. This will not be a one-off job. Figures from the BBKA indicate that roughly 10 per cent. of the beekeeping population  <br>

start or stop keeping bees in any one year, so there is a high rate of churn. The Government cannot build BeeBase as a one-off operation, as it will not be accurate. They must maintain the database, for whatever purpose it is intended, and that will not be cheap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para22"><a name="09042944000044">The concern is that there might be an element of Big Brother on the horizon. At the back of the mind of someone in the Department, there might be the intention that once most beekeepers are enrolled, enrolment could become compulsory. Once it is compulsory, why should we not start charging beekeepers to register on BeeBase? That would be dangerous, because the British beekeeping population is different from that of other countries. It is not the same as in Australia, for example, where there is a smaller number of very large, industrial-scale commercial beekeeping operations. The vast majority of British bee hives are kept by small, hobbyist beekeepers, such as myself, who have two or three hives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para23"><a name="09042944000045">If compulsory registration is introduced, perhaps attached to a compulsory cost, the likelihood is that the number of beekeepers and hives in this country will fall dramatically. That is important, because given the impact on bee health, honey bees in the wild are far less numerous than they used to be. A typical wild colony set up by a swarm from a beekeeper&#146;s hive will last a couple of years before it becomes vulnerable to collapse for some reason, typically varroa or a combination of parasites and infections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="90429h0001.htm_para24"><a name="09042944000046">The number of colonies in the wild is dramatically lower than it used to be. A reduction in the number of beekeepers will have a direct and significant effect on the total number of bees kept in the British isles. It is therefore essential that the Minister provides us with more details about how the money will be spent over the next two years and tells us about the Government&#146;s ultimate intentions regarding BeeBase and registration. I know that there are others who wish to speak, so I will draw my remarks to a close. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to the questions that I have raised.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) on raising this issue once again. It is important to follow through on achievements and to comment on some of the things that we would like to see happen. The hon. Gentleman he speaks as only a beekeeper can, with knowledge of the organism itself. That is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para0"><a name="09042944000049">This has been one of the most delightful campaigns in which I have been involved since joining the House. It has been an amazing success that started from rock bottom. I remember a Minister once telling us&#151;I will not use the exact language&#151;not to bother, as there was no money in the kitty. Well, &#163;10 million is not bad, and it could be the start of much more funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para1"><a name="09042944000050">The campaign has been successful, and congratulations must go to the British Beekeepers&#146; Association and its past presidents: Tim Lovett, Ivor Davies, David Aston and Norman Carrick, who has been a sterling adviser  <br>

to the association. Tim Lovett was once a student of mine, and on Friday he will be awarded an honorary fellowship from the new vice-chancellor of the university of East Anglia. I promised that I will re-mark his final papers if they are still in existence on a database somewhere, as I do not think that he got the credit due to him. He has been a real success&#151;it is nice to have a student who makes it, as many have not&#151;but I congratulate all those individuals on what they have done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para2"><a name="09042944000051">I also thank the Minister and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. My right hon. Friend took this issue seriously when he was approached about it, and has been a sterling supporter throughout the campaign, which has been picked by the media and the public. In many walks of life, we talk about public understanding of this, that and the other, and how that interacts with the media, but there can be no better example than the campaign on bees, which has been handled well. Indeed, there was even a march to Downing street of beekeepers with puffers and white suits, which received a lot of media publicity, and people such as Martha Kearney have made programmes and so on. That puffing display in Whitehall happened on the day that President Obama got elected, so we did not do too badly in getting some media interest at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para3"><a name="09042944000052">We must congratulate the campaigners on their cool, quiet approach. The campaign has been effective, not only in this place but elsewhere. It has involved beekeepers right from the beginning, and I am sure that they are pleased to see their hard work recognised. To achieve recognition that this is not only about different types of honey bee, but about the fact that they pollinate crops and are essential to many industries in this country, was put forward as the big plan. I look forward to other campaigns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para4"><a name="09042944000053">I see an old foe of mine, the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey), sitting on the other side of the Chamber. We are going to have a real battle over open access for journals, and about bringing this matter into the public sphere so that people can see what is published and what is not published. I hope that he does not rise to the bait&#151;there will be other occasions when we can enjoy that kind of campaigning.</p>

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="09042944000054"><a name="90429h0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="09042944000468"><b>David Taylor:</b>
 Will my hon. Friend extend his remarks to note that the campaign has received not only national but international recognition? Some of the things that the UK does at the Food and Environment Research Agency in York, such as the creation of BeeBase, provide probably the best and most credible source of information for good beekeeping advice in Europe. Other countries are sitting up and taking notice, as this is an international issue, not something based only in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="09042944000055"><a name="90429h0002.htm_spnew2"><a name="09042944000469"><b>Dr. Gibson:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend. It is true&#151;the problems have been much the same across the planet. The value of bees in development and other aspects of agriculture has been recognised in other places. Britain is taking a major lead in trying to find out the causes of the collapse, and that will help other countries to develop their programmes. I know that there is plenty of contact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para5"><a name="09042944000056">The public campaign was not bad. Petitions with 140,000 signatures were presented to Downing street&#151;suddenly, from nowhere, bees were everywhere. When campaigners hear bees mentioned on &#147;The Archers&#148;  <br>

they should know that they have arrived. It is the only time that I would listen to &#147;The Archers&#148;. I had better not say what I think about the programme because we are talking about Radio 4. None the less, many people listen to it and say, &#147;We did not know that there was a problem with bees until we listened to &#145;The Archers&#146;.&#148; After that, the whole campaign took off. The Minister was not the only person to help the campaign. Lurking in the background was a man called Prince Charles, whose science I have argued with for many years. Although his understanding of nanotechnology is nil and of genetic modification is minus 10, he was correct on this issue, which shows that we should not condemn somebody for everything that they think.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para6"><a name="09042944000057">In the past month or so there has been a new funding initiative, which is something that many scientists and medics would die for. The National Scientific and Technical Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Scottish Government&#151;my goodness&#151;and the Wellcome Trust have come together to put money into that hybrid fund. It is how the money is used that I want to discuss, because we have a once in a lifetime chance to ensure that we do something with it of which we can be proud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para7"><a name="09042944000058">The five funding bodies have different interests, which will make reaching a decision very difficult. It is bad enough when one funding body has to make a decision, but when five of them come together in the same room with different agendas, real skill is required to address the needs of the bee community. The right direction must be chosen; the area of study must be neither too broad nor too narrow. The aim is not to win Nobel prizes in this field, but to resolve a practical problem. The Wellcome Trust itself has an ambition to research pollinators rather than just honey bees, which has already been mentioned. That will have to be addressed in the joint meetings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para8"><a name="09042944000059">The inclination on the side of the funders to be too ambitious has been fanned by the media interest. We must rein back a little and be cool and hard-headed about the decisions we make. Sometimes, scientists get carried away and go down crazy avenues without thinking about the real purpose and effectiveness of a campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para9"><a name="09042944000060">As I have mentioned, there are limitations on the &#163;10 million because we want the funding to continue. Understanding bees will be a continuing problem. What we learn from this research will be important in other areas of research as well. We must work out the problem carefully. If public understanding and involving people who know something about the subject are to mean anything, it is essential that research councils stop being hoity-toity and thinking that they know it all just because they have a few greybeards from the science community and fellows of the Royal Society attached. The research councils do not know it all. It is essential that the beekeepers are present, because they have lived with the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para10"><a name="09042944000061">Engaging with the beekeepers will be a real challenge, but once councils learn how to do that they will be able to apply the skill to the many young people in this country who study high-flying science but never get involved in funding decisions. Such decisions are made by a few men&#151;I say men because only the odd woman is involved, but the Equality Bill should sort that out. There should be a real change in the way in which research councils operate and engage with people. I am  <br>

talking about not just getting the money and making decisions, but involving the people who tell them about the problems and how the money can be effectively used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para11"><a name="09042944000062">We are not talking about Nobel prize-winning stuff, although it feels that way because the topic is in the limelight. When an issue gets in the press, some people tend to get carried away and think, &#147;This must all be about molecular biology with a bit of DNA and protein involved. All we need are a few high-fangled pieces of research and that will be all right.&#148; That is not what the bee campaign is about. We will not see much cutting-edge technology because it is risky in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para12"><a name="09042944000063">I was very impressed by Professor Ratnieks at Sussex university. He is the first professor of apiculture&#151;bee culture. Taking on such a subject is a real initiative by the university and should be complimented. Ratnieks has a five-year study in which he wants to look at honey bee research. Four of his projects, which cost &#163;250,000 each, should be supported. He wants to breed disease-resistant &#147;hygienic&#148; honey bees, which remove dead or infected larvae and pupae from their cells, thereby reducing the spread of diseases within a colony and disrupting the breeding cycle of varroa mites, which carry the viruses and activate viruses when they bite. &#147;Hygiene&#148; is a natural genetic trait among bees, meaning that it can be bred from normal and low-cost breeding methods. Once a stock of &#147;hygienic&#148; bees has been bred, they can then be provided to beekeepers and introduced into hives. Such a project will produce practical results that can easily be passed on to beekeepers, and it employs a breeding method that has been tried and tested by Professor Ratnieks. Another project takes advantage of successful research developed in other countries on the control of varroa mites and adapts it to the British climate. Such research has been carried out and was successful in the initial experiments and is a low-cost enterprise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para13"><a name="09042944000064">We are in a unique position. We must think practically and logically rather than ambitiously to prevent the decline of the honey bees. We do not need much more media attention&#151;one can have too much of that, as I keep telling the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), whose economics I have engaged with. His economics are not as sound as the press often think. He is rather miserable; I call him &#147;el miserablo&#148; because of the gloom and doom he spreads in this country when he could be talking about some of the good stories in industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para14"><a name="09042944000065">The reason I became interested in this issue was not because a student of mine was involved, but because I could see that if we did not look after these creatures, on which we depend for more than just honey on toast, we would lose control over food production and the wild environment. Even this morning, I realised that the almonds and the croissants in Portcullis House depend on bees. It cannot be better than that. The establishment of the research fund is very good news so, let us take the opportunity and ensure that it is used wisely and for practical purposes that benefit agriculture and industry and ensure the survival of the honey bee colonies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para15"><a name="09042944000067">The demise of the honey bee and its catastrophic impact have been well covered this morning, particularly in the contribution of the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson). I will set out a case study, which is focused on my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para16"><a name="09042944000068">In the southern part of Essex, the number of beekeepers is very low. Some 35 years ago, there were more beehives than dogs in walking distance of Castle Point council, but now it is quite different. The only bees belong to Doug Beard, who keeps two dozen hives, but not many in Castle Point because we have built on our green belt and bees need trees and so on for foraging. A superb local lady, Margaret Thomas, runs a beginners class in Essex with an amazing 28 pupils and struggles to find bees for them. Margaret is a rarity; she is probably one of the UK&#146;s best and most professional teachers of beekeeping.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para17"><a name="09042944000069">After world war two, every county had its own agricultural college&#151;in Essex, it was Writtle college. Embedded within each college was a county beekeeping lecturer. In Essex, it was Ted Hooper, who eventually got a well deserved MBE. In the 1980s, all the CBLs were made redundant because they were deemed to be unprofitable. Looking back, we could question the foresight of that. Many of today&#146;s problems might have been exacerbated by the fact that we no longer have professional, properly qualified teachers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para18"><a name="09042944000070">Beekeeping is now taught mostly by volunteers. They are wonderful, superb and enthusiastic volunteers, but they might not always impart the professional knowledge that is needed to keep hives healthy. The Government need to fund qualified beekeeping teachers. The national diploma in beekeeping is a degree-level qualification that is recognised worldwide. I hope that the Minister will address the problem. I know that she is interested in animal welfare&#151;I thought it was just greyhounds, but I am delighted that she is also interested in bees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para19"><a name="09042944000071">The NBU employs seasonal, regional bee inspectors, who should inspect all hives for disease once every three years, but we have not seen one for at least 10 years in Castle Point. The inspectors now spend more time searching for beekeepers than inspecting hives. I am now going to upset a few hon. Members by saying that compulsory registration might not be such a bad idea if it enables those inspectors to do their job more effectively. I realise that others disagree with that view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para20"><a name="09042944000072">It seems that every problem must have a ready solution and that it must not be the fault of the individual beekeepers or even Government policy, so varroa is very convenient: if we all hang our hats on it, we need not do anything. Of course it is a major problem, but it is not the only problem, and it does not mean that we can ignore everything else. That is particularly true in Britain, as opposed to the USA on one extreme and Australia on the other. In Britain, we have two products&#151;Apistan and Bayvarol&#151;to control the mites. When honey bees began to become immune to those treatments, Apiguard was produced and improved bee husbandry methods were introduced. In the past two years, some keepers have applied oxalic acid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para21"><a name="09042944000073">In 2007, Doug Beard had 16 colonies and lost none; last year, he had 24 colonies and lost none. Losses are not inevitable to those who practise good husbandry and have understanding. Typically, beekeepers lose about  <br>

10 per cent. of their hives during the winter months and that percentage can be much higher, as everyone knows, but the explanation is not rocket science. As was mentioned, pesticides can be a problem. Combined, cold and wet conditions kill bees, so good keepers ensure that water cannot get into their hives. They ensure&#151;using decent mouth guards, of course&#151;that there is good air circulation and that there is no condensation in the hives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para22"><a name="09042944000074">Lack of teaching must be a major factor in the demise of honey bees in this country. Many of today&#146;s problems are exacerbated by poor bee husbandry, as the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare explained. We need research so that we understand better the connection between varroa and viruses, particularly deformed wing virus and acute paralysis virus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para23"><a name="09042944000075">Government funding is very welcome, but what about some finance from the beekeeping industry? The Minister will have heard that. A search of the Charity Commission&#146;s website reveals many beekeeping associations with cash in the bank. The International Bee Research Association has &#163;300,000; Surrey Beekeepers Association has &#163;100,000; the associations in Cheshire, Essex and Yorkshire have money; the BBKA has &#163;200,000; and the association in Kent has &#163;100,000&#151;as the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) once said, I have a little list. Actually, my list is quite long, and those are only the registered charities: the C. B. Dennis British Beekeepers Research Trust has the best part of &#163;1 million in the bank.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para24"><a name="09042944000076">Perhaps the Minister will find the suggestion of funding from the industry the most helpful one that I make today, even if the beekeeping community does not. Perhaps Government money should be match funded from the beekeeping side. The latter could at least make some effort. Ministers are used to MPs asking for them to provide money&#151;it happens all the time&#151;so I shall end my speech on that note and leave the Minister with a smile on her face.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) on his entertaining and knowledgeable speech. I am disappointed, however, that the BBKA will not get rich from what has been said in the debate so far. Perhaps hon. Members will now make awful puns, so that the association makes a fortune. However, so far, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s warning has had a significant effect. I congratulate him on that and on how he presented his case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para25"><a name="09042944000078">The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) was right to preach caution. There has been great enthusiasm and excitement about Government funding, but we need to be cautious about what we can achieve with it. It is a long haul and a lot of ingenuity and energy will be required to achieve success. The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) was brave in suggesting that the beekeeping associations should contribute. I am not sure how many beekeepers are in his constituency, but they may well be writing to him with their views from now on.</p>

benefit of the late summer heather up in the moors of Glenturret. I can reveal that after 30 miles in the back of a van, bees are not very happy. One has to learn to run extremely fast when one opens the hive. Perhaps that early training is why I enjoy running half marathons and hill races.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para27"><a name="09042944000080">Despite those early experiences, I have great admiration for bees: for their military discipline and incredible hard work, and for their generosity with their produce. If the Liberal Democrats had half of bees&#146; military-style organisation, we might be sitting on the Government Benches. However, I am pleased that the Government have recognised&#151;some say belatedly&#151;the importance of the honey bee. That a significant sum of money has been forthcoming is great and I hope that more will be provided if it is required. It is important to recognise that the Government have made progress and that they have given the matter the necessary priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para28"><a name="09042944000081">That progress is partly owing to the success of organisations such as the BBKA and its branches. The West Fife association in my constituency is a thriving organisation. I recently went to a meeting where there were about 40 beekeepers, half of whom were new. It was encouraging that, despite the news and the gloom about the future of bees, lots of people were coming forward. Perhaps their interest is partly because of new organic lifestyles, which is good, but I hope that it is also partly because we have great confidence in the future of bees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para29"><a name="09042944000082">I want to ensure that research funding recognises the special circumstances in Scotland. We heard how the special British weather has an effect on bees, but I am advised that the weather in Scotland is even more special, which influences the effectiveness of the available treatments. We do not know for sure whether there are special circumstances in Scotland, but we want to ensure that the matter is investigated. If they do exist, we hope that they are recognised in the research funding. I am glad that the Scottish Executive have given some money. I am sure that they are arguing their case to ensure that there is a special Scottish angle, but I wanted to reinforce the point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para30"><a name="09042944000083">Speedy access to new medicines has not been mentioned. I understand that there are some blockages. There are always complaints from patient organisations about speedy access to new medicines and it is the same in beekeeping. Has the Minister made progress in ensuring that any new medicines that come on to the market are made available as soon as possible in the UK?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para31"><a name="09042944000084">On the qualifications to treat, most vets, perhaps until recently, would have laughed at the thought of treating bees. They have lots of other animals to treat, such as cats, cows and dogs, and they would never have thought about treating bees. It is important to send vets the message that they have an important role in treating bees. There are not enough vets who can do the job. We need to ensure a sufficient number of qualified people. Perhaps we could have a separate qualification of bee expert that entitled people to treat bees. The fact that registered medicines are involved might be an issue, but I would like the matter to be explored, so that we can get lots of people out there to meet the challenge. It is a big challenge, and we need lots of experts to ensure that it is properly treated.</p>

now the main effort should be focused on dealing with the main problem. I do not think that a compulsory scheme would be advisable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="90429h0002.htm_para33"><a name="09042944000086">To summarise, there are four key points. The first is priority&#151;it is great that it has been recognised that bees are important. The second is the special circumstances in Scotland. The third is ensuring speedy access to new medicines, and the fourth is ensuring that there is a sufficient range and number of people who can treat bees in order to meet this great challenge.</p>

 I am grateful to be speaking under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) on securing this important debate. I thank the hon. Members for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie) for avoiding the temptation to drone on and for giving me the chance to speak on this important issue. I think that we are all united in wanting a return to boom and buzz. Surely my hon. Friend will agree that that pun is so bad that it should keep the British Beekeepers Association in funds for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para0"><a name="09042944000088">Even studying Virgil&#151;the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife gave a good Virgilian translation about the industry and work load of bees&#151;did not give me a love of bees. I did not learn to love the bee until I became the hon. Member for Wantage&#151;well, the Member for Wantage; I must not get above myself&#151;and discovered that Rowse Honey was located in Wallingford in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para1"><a name="09042944000089">All hon. Members will know about Rowse Honey, even if they do not realise it, because it produces a third of the honey found on supermarket shelves. It imports honey from all over the world and blends it. Rowse invented the plastic honey pot that can be squeezed. It now employs 170 people and is, incidentally, a fantastic company within the community, giving a great deal of money to local charity. I pay tribute to Richard Rowse, who recently left the company, and David Bondi, its new managing director. Rowse has put its money and profile where its honey jars are, as it were, by donating &#163;100,000 to the research of Professor Ratnieks, which the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) ably summarised. It has also run a campaign to save the honey bee by making it prominent on all Rowse honey jars.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para2"><a name="09042944000090">I need not detain this knowledgeable House full of apiarists with facts about the importance of honey bees. Suffice it to say that an estimated one third of the food that we eat depends on pollination. That includes a range of important fruits such as apples, pears, peaches, strawberries and blackberries and vegetables such as carrots, broccoli and onions. Some &#163;165 million of the food market&#151;I suspect that that is an underestimate&#151;consists of produce that depends on honey bees for pollination. Almonds have been mentioned. Eighty per cent. of our almonds come from the United States. Every year, bees are trucked from Florida to California to pollinate those almonds. Without bees, we would have no almonds. Bees also produce 1.4 million tonnes of honey, of which we in Britain consume 6,000 to 7,000 tonnes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para3"><a name="09042944000091">There has been a steep decline in beekeeping. If we were debating this subject in 1909 instead of 2009, we would be able to refer to 1 million hives in this country; if we were debating it in the 1950s, we would be able to refer to 400,000. Today we can refer to only 274,000. The decline is precipitate. In the winter of 2007-08, it is estimated that the collapse in hives was around 25 per cent. We would normally expect a 4 per cent. decline during the winter and a 10 per cent. decline during a very bad winter. I think that I am right in saying that  25 per cent. is unprecedented. In some areas of the United States, the collapse has been as much as 36 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para4"><a name="09042944000092">The decline in hives has led to a new crime of which hon. Members may be aware: bee rustling. A hive now costs about &#163;250, so it is more common than ever for hives to be stolen. In a recent case in Shropshire, 18 hives were stolen, to the value of &#163;5,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para5"><a name="09042944000093">We are discussing, of course, the phenomenon of colony collapse disorder. The hon. Member for Norwich, North mentioned the varroa mite, a well understood parasite that attaches itself to bees and infects them. He rightly referred to Professor Ratnieks&#146; research into breeding hygienic bees that clear up after themselves and remove dead bees from their hives, making it harder for the varroa mite to breed, but there is also a concern about the possible effect of pesticides on bees. One of the features of colony collapse disorder is that one does not come to the hive and find a lot of dead bees; one comes to the hive and finds no bees. They have not necessarily been killed by the varroa mite.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para6"><a name="09042944000094">There is a theory that pesticides destroy bees&#146; brains, making it harder for them to find their way home. It is interesting that urban bees are doing better than rural bees. Some people posit the theory that that is because there are fewer pesticides in an urban environment. There is also the stress of travel. It is not just the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife who finds it stressful to travel with bees&#151;bees themselves, as he mentioned, find travel stressful. Bees are moved around a great deal, particularly in the United States. There is also, of course, the phenomenon of climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para7"><a name="09042944000095">Research is essential. I welcome the Government&#146;s increase in funding. I note that when I posted my concerns about funding levels on my blog, it took the Government two days to increase funding. I am hoping that after this speech, funding will have doubled again by the end of the week; I know that cause and effect  are present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para8"><a name="09042944000096">As so many substantial points have been made throughout this debate, I want to make only one. It concerns the pace at which funding can be applied. I understand the need for peer review and the need to ensure that projects funded by the Government are properly assessed, but I refer once more to Professor Ratnieks, the man of the moment, our first professor of apiary. As I understand it, he needs about &#163;650,000. He is running four projects, collectively called the Sussex plan, that are designed to provide stop-gap measures for beekeepers, to find the reasons behind colony collapse disorder and perhaps even to find a cure. His fourth project has been planned out, but it desperately needs funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para9"><a name="09042944000097">The delay engendered by peer review means that the projects funded by Government money will not be under way until autumn 2011. I am happy for the Minister to correct me, but that is what I have been told. Given the urgency of the research needed, my plea to her&#151;the one point that I can add to the excellent points made by hon. Members throughout this debate&#151;is to ensure that the funding comes on stream as soon as possible, so that that urgent research can be undertaken as quickly as possible.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your able chairmanship, Mr. Benton. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) for his persistence on the issue and his incredibly well informed and fluent speech. Other Members&#146; contributions have been well informed as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para10"><a name="09042944000099">We have mentioned puns, jokes and so on. One problem that we have come up against in the campaign is that the issue is simply not taken seriously. It is important to say that we have much to celebrate in terms of the additional funding provided, but the campaign had to succeed against a sense that the issue was trivial. The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) poured scorn on my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) when he raised this issue. However, my hon. Friend was right on the bees and on the banks, although he was not taken seriously when he first spoke about the bees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para11"><a name="09042944000100">I remember meeting Lord Rooker a few years ago. I should say that I have a tremendous amount of time for Lord Rooker, but when I spoke to him and his civil servants about this issue, I got the sense that they were listening semi-sympathetically but actually thought it was all a bit silly really. So I am very pleased that we have got to this situation, and great credit must be paid to the Minister and others involved in her Department that the issue has now rightly been taken seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para12"><a name="09042944000101">It is important to state how vital a role the national association, the British Beekeepers Association, has played, but local organisations have also played a key role. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie) referred to his local beekeepers association. In my area, the Furness and District Beekeepers Association has been my main source of information. Without local beekeeping associations, many of us here would not have half of our information on this vital subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para13"><a name="09042944000102">None the less, the plight of the honey bee has been trivialised and overlooked, to the extent that vital action to protect British bee colonies has been delayed. Only time will tell whether the action that will be taken will be sufficient to prevent disaster. The threat to our honey bees comes from an alarming range and combination of sources. We have already heard about many of them, such as the parasitic varroa destructor mite, the aethina tumida larvae, which infests bee colonies and preys upon bee larvae, viral diseases and, of course, the devastating colony collapse disorder, which is frankly a mystery. CCD has not yet been traced in this country, as far as we can tell, but nevertheless it is absolutely terrifying, and it has had a devastating impact in the United States, of course.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="29 Apr 2009">

<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>29 Apr 2009 : Column 271WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para14"><a name="09042944000103">The result of those diseases has been the loss of virtually all Britain&#146;s wild honey bee population and about a third of the overall bee population. In certain areas, the loss has been particularly devastating. In London in the winter of 2007, two thirds of the city&#146;s bee colonies were wiped out, and the 2008 UK honey harvest was down by about 50 per cent. That is clear and tangible evidence of the consequence of the staggering drop in bee numbers. To refer to Lord Rooker again, in November 2007 he concluded that if things did not change, the British honey bee would be extinct within 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para15"><a name="09042944000104">Bees play a vital role in our ecology. Experts describe the impact of the loss of bee populations as the key trigger in what they call an &#147;extinction vortex&#148;, which would lead to the loss of plant life and consequently impact on other aspects of the food chain. The commercial value of the British bee population is estimated to be in the region of &#163;200 million a year, due to the role of bees in enabling the cross-pollination of crops. However, if we add the supermarket mark-up, the figure for the financial value of the bee industry is nearer &#163;1 billion; perhaps that is an issue for the supermarket regulator to deal with. We have heard from many sources today. Different sources give different figures, but it is estimated that about 35 per cent. of our diet is dependent on bees, because they are the principal pollinator of farms and gardens. All that evidence means that we must ensure that the investment that goes into saving our bees is commensurate with their enormous economic and ecological value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para16"><a name="09042944000105">There is nothing esoteric or quaint about this issue. The hard realities of lost bee populations and their essential value to food production and farm productivity are demonstrated by the increasing numbers of farmers who are importing bees from southern and eastern Europe, at considerable cost to themselves. However, that cost is nothing compared with the huge cost resulting from the loss of bees and their contribution to crop growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para17"><a name="09042944000106">Among the difficulties that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs faces in tackling this crisis is that its ability to respond depends on its ability to deliver information to beekeepers and to provide inspection services. However, it is estimated that about 20,000 beekeepers in Britain are not known to DEFRA. Given that four out of every five cases of bee disease are diagnosed by inspectors, that is a huge blind spot. I agree with the majority of contributors to the debate today who say that we do not need and must not have a compulsory register of beekeepers. However, we must acknowledge that blind spot, and we need to think of sensitive and effective ways to deliver information.</p>

<p><a name="st_24"><a name="09042944000107"><a name="90429h0003.htm_spnew2"><a name="09042944000474"><b>John Penrose:</b>
 I just want to point out, for the record, that there is a degree of uncertainty about the figures that the hon. Gentleman has just quoted. The BBKA certainly believes that the number of unregistered beekeepers is substantially smaller than that figure of 20,000, although everyone accepts that there is a reasonable number of unregistered beekeepers out there.</p>

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="09042944000108"><a name="90429h0003.htm_spnew3"><a name="09042944000475"><b>Tim Farron:</b>
 Indeed. We cannot know the details of an unknowable, and the hon. Gentleman is correct to make that point. That is one of the reasons why we need to be careful about over-emphasising that issue. Having  <br>

said that, the number of unregistered beekeepers is a blind spot and our ability to deliver information, including information about regulations and correct practices for example, and even treatments depends on our ability to know where the beekeepers are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para18"><a name="09042944000109">We also need to have more comprehensive ways of delivering information and of ensuring helpful and sympathetic inspection. However, there are indicators that that is not currently the case. For example, the recent report by the National Audit Office showed that many beekeepers had not been made aware of many of the regulations on importing honey bees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para19"><a name="09042944000110">There are too many unknowns, as many hon. Members have mentioned today. We talk about the grey squirrel effect, for example. To what extent are we losing bees due to native species being forced out by more aggressive foreign bees? There are other factors. For instance, there is the threat of climate change, including the effect of wet weather on mating patterns and on preventing bees from foraging for enough nectar and pollen to see them through the winter months. All those potential threats need to be understood, and they need to be understood quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para20"><a name="09042944000111">There are also many perceived hazards that may affect bee populations. In particular, we have heard about pesticides. However, it is important at this stage that we acknowledge that there is currently no evidence that indicates that pesticides are a factor in colony losses, and we should not allow such issues to divert us from taking urgent action on those factors that are known to cause colony loss. Examining the perceived hazards could be a serious distraction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para21"><a name="09042944000112">Until 2007, the Government dedicated only &#163;200,000 to research into bee health in England and the overwhelming majority of that money was spent on meeting statutory obligations rather than on focusing on the urgent problems faced by beekeepers, such as the varroa parasite. Once again, the NAO concluded that DEFRA&#146;s attempts to control varroa have not prevented it from becoming endemic. Only last month, a senior DEFRA civil servant appeared before the Public Accounts Committee and confirmed that bee health had not been a priority for the Department. However, that was an honest admission, and it is impressive that we are now moving forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para22"><a name="09042944000113">It is important to welcome the Government&#146;s recent announcement of significant funding for research. For some time now, many of us have been backing the BBKA&#146;s campaign for increased research funding, and so it is extremely encouraging that it has been granted. However, I want to emphasise a point that others have already made, which is the lack of clarity about where the &#163;10 million of research money will be targeted. After the fanfare that accompanied the announcement of that &#163;10 million, it is now clear that the research that it will fund will investigate the problems faced by all pollinators. We accept that approach, up to a point. However, I understand that there are 2,500 species of pollinating insects in this country, including about 250 species of bee, only one of which is the honey bee. Given that the honey bee is responsible for more than 50 per cent. of the pollination of wild plants, there is real concern about a lack of clarity regarding the research money and specifically about how much will be spent on researching honey bee health. So I just want to ask  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="29 Apr 2009">

the Minister to confirm today that the overwhelming majority of that funding will be directed at research into honey bees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para23"><a name="09042944000114">We need an immediate shot in the arm for bee health research, and we need to ensure that any treatments are delivered effectively. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife pointed out another issue that is holding up effective treatment, which is the fact that bees are classed as livestock. It is often the case that a vet is required to use any treatment. I want the Minister to confirm that she will lobby for a change in the EU regulations, under the veterinary medicines directorate, to allow not only vets but bee experts, including beekeepers, to decide on the use of treatments in order to ensure that we roll out those treatments effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para24"><a name="09042944000115">In conclusion, we must also look to the future. Repopulating mainland Britain with wild bees, as well as restoring the strength of farmed bee colonies, must be a medium-term aim. To that end, we should look to use disease-free communities, such as the Isle of Man, as nurseries, to allow healthy bee hives to be brought back to the mainland, so that we can ensure a growth in the populations of both wild and commercial bees.</p>
<a name="09042944000397">
<p>My final point is simple. This campaign has been going on for some time, and we came up against the issue of credibility, in that it was difficult to be taken seriously by the Government. For all those who have been involved in the campaign at every level, it is immensely encouraging to see that we have achieved such a lot. Consequently, although it is important that we ask the key questions, about how this research money will be delivered and targeted and about many other issues, it is important that we are not churlish and instead give credit to the Government for taking this issue seriously, albeit belatedly.</p>

 Like others, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) for securing the debate and for showing such a knowledgeable understanding of the problems facing beekeepers and honey bee populations in this country. I particularly welcome the fact that he is setting up an all-party group, which I will certainly follow closely. I hope that the group will track the welcome new funding and that it will be effective. I also pay tribute to the hon.

Our bee population is declining at such an alarming rate that the relevant graph shows that it could be effectively wiped out within 10 years. It has never been more urgent that we address the problems facing honey bees in an effective and timely manner.</p>

As has been pointed out, bees also face the effects of climate change, habitat loss, intensive farming and insecticides. It is worth contemplating the point made by the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew). Speaking as a farmer, I shudder when I think back to the sort of things we were persuaded to use by agronomists in the early 1990s and 1980s to cope with problems such as the orange blossom midge. The insecticide situation is much better now and farmers understand the need to be extremely cautious. In that respect, best practice and regulation have worked, but more needs to be done. I hope that some research will be done into whether systemic pesticides are part of the problem and whether other forms of pesticides, in relation to which the situation is so much better, are a diminishing problem. A great deal of work needs to be done on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para27"><a name="09042944000119">Like other hon. Members, I pay tribute to the British Beekeepers Association. It was a great pleasure for me to attend its spring convention at Stoneleigh recently and to see so many thousands of enthusiastic people, who were determined to tackle the problems faced by honey bee populations. It was a pleasure to meet Norman Carreck, who works with Professor Ratnieks in Brighton at Sussex university. I look forward to going down there to see first hand the wonderful work that they are doing. I also pay tribute to the west Berkshire branch of the BBKA. It is a wonderful local organisation and it has guided me in an important part of my brief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para28"><a name="09042944000120">The lobby that took place last year was one of the most effective lobbies of Parliament that I have seen in my short time here, and it was a great tribute to all those involved. I could be churlish and complain and whinge about the lack of funding in the past but, in the spirit of the debate, I pay tribute to those who have campaigned effectively and to those who have listened and enabled increased funding to be secured. It is important to consider the detail of where the funding could go. There are considerable concerns, and I hope that the Minister will tackle those in the time that she has.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para29"><a name="09042944000121">Let us consider the funding element. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has marketed new funding for research into bee health, but it is not clear how much will be spent specifically on research into honey bee health. Although up to &#163;10 million of extra funding has been pledged, that money will be spread around research into all pollinators, as we have heard. The figure that I have in my head&#151;although that figure has been slightly varied by today&#146;s contributions&#151;is that 80 per cent. of the pollination that we require to sustain our ecology and agricultural crops comes from the honey bee population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="90429h0003.htm_para30"><a name="09042944000122">Whatever the statistic is, honey bees are by far the most important pollinators, and they are the pollinators that we can most affect by good research. It is vital that the vast majority of the research is directed towards honey bees rather than other types of pollinators. Moths, butterflies, hoverflies and bumblebees are important, but they are a mere sideline when compared with the importance of the honey bee population. Money could effectively be wasted on albeit well intentioned research into pollinators that could turn out to be far less relevant to crop pollination. When the new funding for research projects is allocated, I hope that the Minister will reassure us that honey bees will be given priority.</p>

<a name="90429h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="09042944000398"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to achieve a sustainable and healthy population of honey bees for pollination and honey production in England and Wales via strengthened partnerships working between Government and other stakeholders.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para1"><a name="09042944000124">I wholeheartedly agree that that should be our aim, but, of course, actions speak louder than words. Despite the Government&#146;s claims that they aim to strengthen partnerships between themselves and other stakeholders, the &#147;Healthy Bees&#148; document, which was drastically reduced in size from 45 pages to just 12, was only released for the consideration of stakeholders on the Friday before its Monday launch. That is not a great start. I ask the Minister to take those points on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para2"><a name="09042944000125">The National Bee Unit will play a key role in the Government&#146;s &#147;Healthy Bees&#148; strategy and will receive a significant chunk of the new funding. The unit has been criticised for its failure to share information with stakeholders, and the National Audit Office report on &#147;The Health of Livestock and Honey Bees in England&#148; states that the NBU had</p>
<a name="90429h0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09042944000399"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;not given sufficient emphasis to sharing the findings of its research more widely&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para3"><a name="09042944000126">The report further recommends that the NBU</p>
<a name="90429h0004.htm_brev2"><a name="09042944000400"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;share information with the relevant associations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para4"><a name="09042944000127">A lack of consultation with such key people as our beekeepers at that level does not bode well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para5"><a name="09042944000128">As we have heard in the debate, a large proportion of the funding going to the NBU will be spent on BeeBase, which is a database of beekeepers in the UK. According to the NBU, that database is currently seriously undersubscribed. Knowing where our beekeepers and therefore our honey bee colonies are is, of course, important, particularly for the purposes of disease identification. However, ploughing money into a database seems a somewhat abstract way of tackling honey bee health, particularly when the BBKA already has an impressive database of members with whom they are in regular contact. It is important that the NBU takes steps to try to work with the BBKA and that it pools its resources. According to the BBKA, that has not been happening so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para6"><a name="09042944000129">If there are beekeepers who have not joined the BBKA as members, what would make them join a central database? It needs to be made clear how the NBU plan to incentivise BeeBase to encourage the remaining few beekeepers to join. I would like to tackle the point about compulsion. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare: compulsion would not be a good move forward. Surely, a far more effective method of making a real difference to honey bee health is to work in partnership with organisations such as the BBKA to reach more beekeepers, harness their knowledge and expertise, and provide better education and training at a local level. Although the Government and the NBU claim that that is their aim, we need to see more action to establish exactly how that will work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para7"><a name="09042944000130">What is next for our bees? Increased standards of bee husbandry are key to tackling the decline in the honey bee population. Research absolutely must be fed down to beekeepers quickly and efficiently for it to make a real difference to honey bee health. Through improving  <br>

access to education and training on issues such as hive health, feeding and management, we can ensure that bees are given the optimum nutrients and environment that they need to survive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para8"><a name="09042944000131">In the last few minutes of my speech, I shall make an important point about habitat loss. In my part of southern England, agriculture practices have changed in a way that means the Berkshire downs are almost entirely arable. When I was a child, there were almost entirely mixed farming enterprises, which meant that bee colonies did not have to travel as far to find pollen. Periods of pollination are extremely short, so that could well be contributing to the stress from which bee colonies  are suffering, and hon. Members have already talked  about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para9"><a name="09042944000132">We need to consider how we support and incentivise farmers in terms of biodiversity. The loss of set aside will have had a major effect. We should encourage farmers to plant crops such as phacelia&#151;I plant it at home&#151;which is a popular plant for bees and other pollinators. Those are the sort of things that can help to reduce stress, increase the amount of pollinators available and help bee colonies in a major way. We also want better summers&#151;I know that that is not in the gift of the Minister, but I am sure that she can have a word with someone about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para10"><a name="09042944000133">I finish by paying tribute to Martha Kearney, who produced a very good documentary on the subject for the BBC. She made one vital point, which is a good one on which to finish: honey bees are the environment&#146;s canary in the mine, and their decline should be regarded as a potential warning that massive change is taking place within our environment, change that will affect  us all.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, Mr. Benton. Every time I speak in Westminster Hall, I come with a well prepared, thoroughly thought through and balanced response, and on every occasion&#151;I do not know why I continue to be taken aback&#151;I have to depart from it because of the well argued and elegant contributions of other Members, such as those we have heard this morning on this important subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para11"><a name="09042944000135">I want to mention the contributions made by Members who have since left this Chamber: my hon. Friends the Members for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) and for Stroud (Mr. Drew). Although not all the Members who have taken part in the debate are beekeepers&#151;I certainly am not&#151;it seems that there are many more beekeepers in the House of Commons than I would have thought was likely. I hope that I am not breaking a confidence, but I know that the hon. Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich (Sir Michael Lord) used to be a beekeeper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para12"><a name="09042944000136">I congratulate the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) on securing the debate. I will not be able, in the short time I have to respond, to cover all the points raised, or to give the kind of detail I would like to share with Members on our thinking for the next steps of our programme to understand the issue, work out a plan for tackling problems in bee health and take it forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para13"><a name="09042944000137">I will respond quickly to some of the key points that have been made. To all those who have expressed concern about whether we should have a voluntary or compulsory registration scheme for beekeepers, I say that my instinct is always, wherever possible, to encourage co-operation through a voluntary method. If we look at the experience of other countries wrestling with the problem, we will see that there are mixed views on, and experience of, compulsory schemes. Although we may need to keep it under review, I prefer to proceed with a voluntary scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para14"><a name="09042944000138">The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare was worried about whether BeeBase will be a development or extension of Big Brother and how we will use the inspectors. I want to respond to the debate and to discuss the increased funding for the National Bee Unit. If he is successful in establishing an all-party group on bees, which I encourage him to do, I will be the first to invite it to visit the NBU at the Food and Environment Research Agency&#146;s base in York. I am sure that the unit would be delighted to be visited by interested MPs and that the House would benefit from Members having the opportunity to meet the unit&#146;s staff and our inspectors to understand more about their comprehensive programme of work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para15"><a name="09042944000139">I enjoyed the contribution of the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink). I did not agree with everything he said, but I was interested to hear some of the comments on how beekeeping used to be taught. Those are all issues we will want to consider carefully, but the increased funding for the NBU is only one part of our programme. I must pay tribute to my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Rooker for laying the foundations of the work, which I was then able to accelerate, in response to what was clearly developing into a pressing problem. We give him full credit and are grateful for that work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para16"><a name="09042944000140">The healthy bee plan has been published. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare quite rightly advised us not to use puns in this debate, and we debated vigorously and humorously what to call our healthy bee plan. The Co-operative beat us to the name, &#147;Plan Bee&#148;, so we decided to go for the much more prosaic and downbeat, &#147;Healthy Bees&#148;. None the less, it is a serious programme of work, and we are absolutely committed to seeing it taken forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para17"><a name="09042944000141">Another part of our plan relates to research. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) is a hard man to argue with on the matter, as he knows so much more than I do about it, and I agree in large part with what he said. The research programme will be robust and carefully evaluated. I wish to reassure the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey), whom I congratulate on his entertaining speech, that we certainly  <br>

hope to see the first project starting before the end of 2009. The call for proposals is already being made, and we are now in the spring, so I reassure him and encourage those who might be considering putting in bids for research that we are inviting people to make those now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para18"><a name="09042944000142">It is important that I join others in paying tribute to the British Beekeepers Association for its role in raising the profile of the issue. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that its research paper will be considered not only by me and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but by those who will determine the shape of the research as it proceeds, so it will inform decisions on the research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para19"><a name="09042944000143">I have been asked several detailed questions, but if I do not manage to answer them all, I will write as fully as possible to every Member who has participated in the debate. I have been asked how much will be spent on honey bees from the research programme. I want to share with Members the carefully crafted advice that I have received on that:</p>
<a name="90429h0004.htm_brev3"><a name="09042944000401"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I would expect the research allocation to be broadly proportionate to the importance of honey bees, relative to other pollinators.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para20"><a name="09042944000144">The fact that we refer to our plan as the honey bee plan indicates how important we accept honey bees to be. They are, as the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare rightly noted, the first pollinators out in spring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para21"><a name="09042944000145">In the short time I have left I wish to pay tribute to Martha Kearney. Watching her documentary was one of the few occasions recently when I have been able to say that the BBC did a really good job. It was an excellent programme. Those who missed it should watch it, because it was balanced and explained carefully the full range of challenges facing bees. [Hon. Members: &#147;The Bee Bee Cee.&#148;] I will not be drawn down that route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para22"><a name="09042944000146">Those responsible for the research funding will seek to ensure a balanced programme. The hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie) made a good speech in which he congratulated the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government for their contribution, and I agree with him on that. One of the reasons why we made the announcement on funding after the announcements on the healthy bees plan and on our commitment to the NBU, was that we were working hard to bring together all the partners. As I have said, I will write to Members in greater detail. I am grateful to those who have acknowledged the Government&#146;s commitment to the issue. We have a lot of work to do on it, but I can promise all those interested that the Government take the issue extraordinarily seriously. I think that any half-way educated person can appreciate the importance of bees to our environment, our food chain and, therefore, our country.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Benton, for calling me to introduce this important, timely debate on Anglo-Libyan relations. I have been chairman of the all-party group on Libya for the past two years and I feel that a country that is so close to us&#151;just three hours away by plane&#151;presents us with huge opportunities for trade and investment. I want Britain to benefit from trade with Libya, particularly as our relations with that country are improving rapidly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para23"><a name="09042944000148">In Tripoli, which I have visited, meeting people in the streets and so on, there are many products from Europe in the supermarkets and shops but few British goods on offer, which is a great shame. I want to do everything possible to encourage and promote British trade with Libya. I ask the Minister to say what her Department is doing to increase our share of exports to Libya.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para24"><a name="09042944000149">I took a delegation to Tripoli in 2007 to mark the 38th anniversary of Colonel Gaddafi&#146;s coming to power. It is good that we go there and talk about political matters, but politicians should also be focused on increasing trade as well. So many delegations that we send out to such countries talk pleasantries and discuss politics, but they do not really do anything to help directly British interests in these places. Although such high-level contacts take place, including between Heads of State and parliamentarians, there is not the opportunity to take our own businesses and introduce them as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para25"><a name="09042944000150">I approached the Inter-Parliamentary Union to fund a visit of mine to Riyadh, because I am also chairman of the all-party group on Saudi Arabia. The IPU said, &#147;No, we will not fund your visit if you take industrialists, because we are only interested in politicians going out to Saudi Arabia and interacting with politicians and talking about political issues.&#148; Frankly, when we are going into a recession and one of the ways that we are going to get out of it is through increased exports and getting foreign currency into our country, there should be an onus on parliamentarians to do everything that they can to help businesses as well. I urge the Minister to try to give some thought to how we can devise a formula or an exchange here in Parliament whereby parliamentarians can take out businesses to such countries, introduce them to high-level contacts and help them secure the business that is so vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para26"><a name="09042944000151">When I took a delegation out to Riyadh last year, we had three hours with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Many organisations that I know of would love to be able to have such high-level discussions. Interestingly, Arab leaders are highly critical of the lack of interaction between Britain and them in terms of commercial opportunities. They are always saying to me, &#147;We need you to do more to bring British companies out here so that we can do business with them.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para27"><a name="09042944000152">I will be leading a delegation to Tripoli on 1 September to mark the 40th anniversary of Colonel Gaddafi&#146;s coming to power, so I hope that the Minister may be able to do something in advance of that visit to help us to help British businesses to come out with us.</p>

that, in terms of normalisation&#151;it is important that Libya moves to normal diplomatic relations with other countries&#151;it is important to address the fact that Libya has yet to pay compensation to the victims of the terrorism that it funded over the years, in Northern Ireland and the UK? The need to resolve that issue in terms of achieving closure for the victims has cross-party support in the House and elsewhere.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Later in my speech I will come to my discussions with the Libyan ambassador, and discussions in Libya itself, about the vital need to close that tragic chapter in our history. We will not flinch from raising those important, controversial issues with Libya.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para28"><a name="09042944000155">I want people to know more about Libya, which is why I am now writing my first ever political biography on Colonel Gaddafi. I hope to have that book published for 1 September, to mark the 40th anniversary. I have to say that it is the most difficult project in which I have engaged in my life. I am not a natural author and I get a lot of writing block, as I think it is called. Nevertheless I am trying to write the book and, if I publish it, I will let the Minister have a signed copy.</p>

It is one of the best maintained war cemeteries that I have ever seen in my life. On going through the gates, one sees immaculately cut lawns and beautifully maintained headstones; the whole aura is extraordinary. I spent a morning walking up and down row upon row of headstones, many of which were erected for those who died in January 1943 when Tripoli was liberated. That brings home the extraordinary sacrifices that so many of our service personnel, including the desert rats, made in the second world war in North Africa to liberate Tripoli and the whole of Libya.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="90429h0004.htm_para31"><a name="09042944000158">The next time I visit, I hope to visit the British war cemetery in Tobruk, which is another important cemetery. I pay tribute to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission for the tremendous work that it does. I also pay tribute to one desert rat that I know of in my constituency, Mr. Ted Sharpe, a dear, close friend of mine who has been quite poorly recently. I have spent many hours listening to him about the suffering that he endured during the war in the process of liberating Libya.</p>

was cut away from her. Her family is still grieving, 25 years on. I have been to the spot where she was killed and seen the plaque; a beautiful cherry tree has been planted there by her family. It amazes me that, 25 years on, we are no closer to finding out who the killer of PC Yvonne Fletcher is. As I have said, many questions have been asked, and the Metropolitan police have paid four visits to Tripoli over a number of years. What is going on? How can this be? How can we be in this position  25 years on? We still do not have in custody the killer of PC Yvonne Fletcher. The Met says that it has interviewed the suspect in Tripoli and that the Libyans must know who was the culprit in this brutal killing. During my discussions yesterday, Mr. Jelban, the Libyan ambassador, said that Libya was working on the matter and that he was confident of achieving a resolution. How confident is the Minister, and what is her time scale for finally securing the capture of that criminal?</p>

 Does the hon.

Does the hon.

The confusion was such that we should have had a public inquiry, and I call on the Minister now, as I shall call on a Conservative Government if we have one after the next election, to hold a public inquiry if PC Yvonne Fletcher&#146;s killer is not found within the next few years. The matter cannot drag on any longer. Twenty-five years have passed, and PC Yvonne Fletcher&#146;s mother,  <br>

sister and other relatives are waiting. If my daughter had been killed, I would certainly not tolerate waiting 25 years to find out who her killer was. On this 25th anniversary of PC Yvonne Fletcher&#146;s death, I extend my condolences to her family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para1"><a name="09042944000166">Hon. Members have mentioned terrorist acts and the one at Lockerbie was a heinous crime. The man who was convicted of the bombing is in a Scottish prison, and is dying of cancer, as the Minister knows. An appeal has been started because <i>The Independent</i> claimed a few days ago that a witness has come forward to prove that Mr. al-Megrahi was wrongly convicted and should be let out on appeal. I am not suggesting this to the Minister, but PC Yvonne Fletcher&#146;s mother has stated publicly that she would like Mr. al-Megrahi to be sent back to Libya to eke out his dying days with his family, if that would help to secure her daughter&#146;s killer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para2"><a name="09042944000167">I have spoken extensively with Dr. Jim Swire, whose daughter died in the Lockerbie tragedy. He is the spokesman for the families of those who lost their loved ones there. He has met Colonel Gaddafi three times and has some interesting stories about his discussions, which he promises to tell me for my book. I asked him&#151;a man whose daughter was killed in the Lockerbie tragedy&#151;what he would say to the Minister if he were here today. If it had been my daughter, I would still be sour, furious, bitter and twisted, but some people are more forgiving and understanding and want to move on. I pay tribute to Dr. Swire&#146;s extraordinary attitude and the positive way in which he deals with the matter. He said&#151;this is touching&#151;that we must engage with the Libyans and bring them in from the cold, because only by doing that can we prevent countries such as Libya from falling into the trap of becoming pariah and terrorist states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para3"><a name="09042944000168">Dr. Swire applauded the Government&#146;s initiatives. He did not necessarily say anything good about the Labour Government, but he said that he was encouraged by their interaction with the Libyan authorities in trying to resolve some of the outstanding matters. He said that Libya has extraordinary oil wealth and many reserves, and Scotland, where he comes from, has wealth in engineering and the talent of its young people, and that there is a tremendous opportunity for a marriage between those aspects to strengthen the future relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para4"><a name="09042944000169">I will now do something that I have never done as an MP, which is pay tribute to Mr. Tony Blair, our former Prime Minister. He made many visits to Tripoli, and Mr. Jelban informed me that he is likely to visit Libya again shortly. He persevered in his discussions with Colonel Gaddafi and played an important role in convincing the Libyan regime not to pursue the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. People in Tripoli speak highly of Mr. Blair, and his engagement and perseverance in trying to tackle some of those issues have been fruitful. However, there are outstanding matters, including illegal immigration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para5"><a name="09042944000170">The Minister will know that Libya&#146;s 2,000 km coastline is extremely porous. Many illegal immigrants from Africa come to Libya and board boats to Lampedusa or Malta. We have seen on BBC the tragic cases of people dying in those boats before they reach the safety of Europe. I hope that the Minister will consider ways of helping the Italians and other EU countries that are trying to help the Libyan authorities with patrol vessels and investment in its ports, so that there is less illegal immigration from Libyan shores to Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para6"><a name="09042944000171">Finally, because I am so passionate about trade and investment, the Libyan ambassador informed me yesterday that his country will start up an investment authority in the United Kingdom. It has done that in many other European countries and has invested hundreds of millions of pounds in various projects throughout Europe, particularly in Italy. Mr. Raja Blayesh will set up that authority, and I hope that at the earliest opportunity the Minister will invite him to meet her to find out how she can help British companies to engage with Libya and to obtain some of that vital investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para7"><a name="09042944000172">Thank you, Mr. Benton, for allowing me to introduce the debate. Most important of all, I urge the Minister to remember that many of us in the Chamber wish to do everything possible to increase trade with Libya. I ask her to help us in whatever way she can to change the system or mechanisms so that we can take businesses on our missions&#151;on visits by all-party groups, IPU visits and all the other visits arranged for us. Of course we would have to declare that&#151;I would not dream of making any financial benefits out of it and I have no vested interests in any companies that operate in Libya. I just genuinely feel passionately about our balance of payments and I want us to export. I come from an exporting background, having spent most of my career before coming into Parliament exporting British goods around the world. I feel passionately about the need to export, which we need to do as a trading nation. That is my appeal to the Minister: please help MPs such as me to help British companies to export abroad.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) on securing the debate. I pay tribute to his very positive approach to developing relations between the UK and Libya, and thank him for the gracious manner in which he paid tribute to others, including our former Prime Minister, for the roles that they have played. I enjoyed his comments because I heard a serious promotion not only of his constituents&#146; interests, but of UK commercial interests. I am sure that the whole House will join me in wishing him well in his writing. We all look forward to his book and I would be very happy to receive a copy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para8"><a name="09042944000174">Let me start with a very serious matter&#151;the investigation of the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher. I understand the real concern that the hon. Gentleman has expressed to the House today, given that WPC Fletcher&#146;s parents are his constituents and that it is now 25 years since her tragic murder. I place on the record once again our deepest condolences&#151;mine and the Government&#146;s&#151;for the continued loss that the Fletcher family suffer. Establishing responsibility for WPC Fletcher&#146;s murder has been and remains a priority for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para9"><a name="09042944000175">Let me give some background, which ties in with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. The UK broke off diplomatic relations with Libya after WPC Fletcher was shot and killed in St. James&#146;s square. Our relationship was seriously marred still further by the seizure in 1987 of a shipment of arms and explosives from Libya destined for the IRA and by the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988. Diplomatic relations were resumed only in July 1999, after Libya had finally accepted responsibility  for the shooting of WPC Fletcher and promised to pay  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="29 Apr 2009">

<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>29 Apr 2009 : Column 284WH</b><br>
compensation. That was paid in 1999. In addition to accepting responsibility, the Libyan Government promised to co-operate with a Metropolitan police investigation into the shooting and to abide by the findings of that investigation. Since then, as we heard from the hon. Gentleman, the UK&#146;s relations with Libya have steadily improved. Libya&#146;s decision in 2003 to give up weapons of mass destruction was a further significant step. It allowed a substantial transformation of Libya&#146;s relations with the UK and the rest of the international community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para10"><a name="09042944000176">As we have heard, Libya is well placed today to play a prominent role in the promotion of peace and greater prosperity in Africa and to ensure that Africa more widely plays a more positive role in international multilateral politics at the UN and elsewhere. As part of that, a strong relationship between the UK and Libya is important. There are three main areas in which we seek to achieve that. The first relates to our efforts to combat international terrorism. I firmly believe that Libya&#146;s actions in the past few years show states that condone or actively engage in terrorist activities that there is an alternative path that will deliver more for their state than going down the terrorist route. Where previously Libya was part of the problem, it now helps us to find solutions. Secondly, Libya is crucial to our efforts to reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons. It provides the best example to the likes of North Korea and Iran that there is more to be gained from not having nuclear weapons than from having them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para11"><a name="09042944000177">Thirdly, Libya offers significant commercial opportunities for UK businesses. Trade between our two countries was worth more than &#163;1 billion last year and there is the potential for much more. The hon. Gentleman raised the very important matter of the promotion of trade links. We would be happy to work with him however we can. I can give him an assurance that UK Trade and Investment has a very active programme in Tripoli and the UK is a significant investor. Just two weeks ago, the UK and Libya signed an investment promotion agreement, and we also signed a double taxation agreement in November 2008. There are opportunities because Libya is moving, slowly and patchily, from centralised state control to engaging with globalisation. The private sector is growing cautiously, following many years of nationalisation and state control. We welcome the Libyan investment authority to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para12"><a name="09042944000178">On migration, we have very good co-operation with Libya. We work both directly and within the EU to strengthen Libya&#146;s ability to control its borders. We have an agreed plan with the Libyans to disrupt the flow of illegal migrants to the EU. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will continue to work closely together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para13"><a name="09042944000179">Let me return now to the investigation of WPC Fletcher&#146;s murder to give reassurance not just to the hon. Gentleman, but to his constituents. Representatives of the Metropolitan Police Service first visited Libya in April 2004. They made a further visit in September 2004 and have conducted investigations in the country in both 2006 and 2007. There was some early progress, but despite that, the investigation has stalled due to a lack of co-operation from the Libyan authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para14"><a name="09042944000180">I can only imagine the heartbreak, anger and distress that the Fletcher family must feel. To lose a daughter in such circumstances would be bad enough, but to live for   <br>

25 years without the closure that a successful investigation might bring can only add to their anguish. I therefore want to state the following points clearly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para15"><a name="09042944000181">The responsibility for the lack of progress rests squarely with the Libyan Government. The UK Government will continue to make every effort to convince the Libyan Government to do more. We have repeatedly raised the case during high-level bilateral visits and talks. Most recently, the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Bill Rammell), who is responsible for the middle east and north Africa, raised the Libyan failure to co-operate in the investigation of WPC Fletcher&#146;s murder when he visited Libya in February this year. He raised the issue again during a telephone conversation with the Libyan Minister for Europe just last month. That comes at the end of a long list of representations made, including by the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, when he met Colonel Gaddafi in May 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para16"><a name="09042944000182">In all our conversations with the Libyan Government, we make it clear that they have a commitment to co-operate fully with the Metropolitan Police Service&#146;s investigation. They must honour that commitment. The issue will not go away. The UK Government will continue to demand co-operation from the Libyan authorities and insist that the Metropolitan police be allowed to return to Libya to continue their investigation. We will not allow Libya to divert attention away from finding those who murdered Yvonne Fletcher, or to prevent us from continuing to try to bring them to justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para17"><a name="09042944000183">There are implications for the further development of our bilateral relationship in Libya&#146;s continuing failure to co-operate. We understand that, but we will continue our efforts, and I believe that the hon. Gentleman believes that it is right to do so. We will continue to engage with the Libyans, not just on this issue, but on the broader issues that he rightly raises for the attention of the House. We will continue to ensure that the right thing is done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para18"><a name="09042944000184">The hon. Gentleman referred to Mr. Megrahi.

 I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak about the need for recognition of those British citizens who became heroes of the holocaust. I want to put on the record my thanks&#151;and I am sure those of many people in the UK including hon. and right hon. Members of the House and Members of the other place&#151;for all the excellent work done by the Holocaust Educational Trust under the leadership of its chief executive, Karen Pollock. Without its support and guidance, I might not be holding this debate today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para20"><a name="09042944000189">With colleagues&#146; permission, I want to say a little about that fine organisation before I move on to the substance of the debate. The Holocaust Educational Trust was founded in 1988 by Lord Janner of Braunstone and the late Lord Merlyn-Rees. It was developed by MPs and peers as a result of significant renewed interest and the need for knowledge about the holocaust during the parliamentary proceedings of the War Crimes Act 1991. The trust aims to raise awareness and understanding about the holocaust and its relevance today in schools and with the wider public. It is vital that the holocaust has a permanent place in our nation&#146;s collective memory.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this fantastic debate on a crucial subject. Does he share my profound concern that e-mails, which are attached to horrific PowerPoint presentations, are circulating that suggest that the Government have banned the teaching of the holocaust in schools? Will he join me in urging anyone who receives such an e-mail to bin it straight away?</p>

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="09042944000191"><a name="90429h0005.htm_spnew4"><a name="09042944000488"><b>Mr. Brown:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right to make that point. There is no place for some of the things that we will look at in this afternoon&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para21"><a name="09042944000192">One of the Holocaust Educational Trust&#146;s first achievements was to ensure that the holocaust was included in the national curriculum in 1991. It successfully campaigned to have the assets of holocaust victims and survivors released and returned to their rightful owners. Having played a crucial role in the establishment and development of Holocaust memorial day in the UK, the HET continues to play a key role in the delivery of that day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para22"><a name="09042944000193">The trust carries out significant work in schools and higher education institutions, providing teacher training workshops and lectures as well as teaching aids and resource materials. Some of its activities include the outreach programme, which is a central part of the work that allows students and teachers the opportunity to hear first-hand survivor testimony.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para23"><a name="09042944000194">Think Equal is a programme that has been devised specifically for schools in areas of racial tension. It enables the trust&#146;s educators to work with staff in schools, deliver teacher training and devise workshops for students that focus on the dangers of racism and discrimination and the contemporary lessons to be drawn from the holocaust.</p>

that the BNP raises its head in our towns, villages and communities to spread insidious lies about the effects and realities of the holocaust?</p>

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="09042944000196"><a name="90429h0005.htm_spnew6"><a name="09042944000490"><b>Mr. Brown:</b>
 My hon. Friend raises an important point. There is no doubt that denial of what has happened is very dangerous. A number of weeks ago, the Holocaust Educational Trust held an event in this Palace to look at issues surrounding the current financial difficulties that we all face. Comparisons were made between the current time, and what happened in Europe&#151;Germany in particular&#151;in the late &#146;20s and early &#146;30s. It is important to recognise that history is here, and we should learn its lessons. The point made that evening was that what happened then will not necessarily happen again, but there are lessons to be learned and we must all be careful about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para24"><a name="09042944000197">The Think Equal programme is delivered in certain London boroughs, and it is anticipated that it will be taken into schools across the country. The Holocaust Educational Trust&#146;s Lessons from Auschwitz project for post-16 students and teachers is now in its 10th year. It has taken more than 5,000 students and teachers from across the UK to Auschwitz and Birkenau. Many MPs and other guests have also taken part in those visits, and all of us who have had the opportunity to engage in that project fully recognise its value and the contribution that it makes to the education of young people in our constituencies. In November 2005, many of us were delighted when the Treasury announced funding of &#163;1.5 million for the Lessons from Auschwitz project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para25"><a name="09042944000198">There are recollections and eyewitness accounts from people who remember the holocaust. The Holocaust Educational Trust has produced a BAFTA award-winning DVD-ROM in conjunction with the USC Shoah Foundation Institute. The groundbreaking, interactive teaching resource integrates testimony from 18 eyewitnesses of the holocaust, including Jewish, Roma, Sinti and Jehovah&#146;s Witness survivors, as well as that of political prisoners and testimony from survivors of the eugenics programme. Teacher training is delivered to trainee teachers at universities and institutions of higher education and to practising teachers as part of their continuing professional development. An annual teacher training course is also held at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, which is open to both trainee and practising teachers from across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para26"><a name="09042944000199">I will now talk about why we are here today. I applied for this debate at the beginning of last week, and yesterday the Prime Minister took the opportunity to visit Auschwitz. Indications appear to suggest that my right hon. Friend the Minister might have something positive to reveal to us today; we wait in anticipation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="90429h0005.htm_para27"><a name="09042944000200">We all recognise that the holocaust is one of the darkest episodes in human history, which saw the systematic persecution and murder of approximately 6 million Jews. Other victims included Roma and Sinti Gypsies, the disabled, gay people, trade unionists, the clergy and political opponents of the Nazi regime. Every year in this country we mark Holocaust memorial day, thanks in no small part to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore). At that time, we pause and remember the souls of those who lost their lives&#151;they are remembered with dignity and with a commitment to fight prejudice wherever it is found.</p>

All too often, what go untold are the extraordinary acts of bravery and selflessness of those who, at great risk to themselves, saved people from certain death. They are people such as June Ravenhall and Major Frank Foley, who were both mentioned in early-day motion 1175, which now has over 130 signatories. They are Ida and Louise Cook from Wandsworth, and Sofka Skipworth who assisted in smuggling the names of Jewish prisoners in a French internment camp to the British authorities and also helped to smuggle out a newborn Jewish baby in a Red Cross box.</p>

Jane&#146;s mother passed away when Jane was only five years old, and Jane grew up to be both determined and capable. For a number of years, she worked in a factory in Paisley. After attending a meeting in Glasgow about the Jewish Mission, she became intrigued about the work. In 1932, she got the call to work at a Church of Scotland mission to the Jews in Budapest.</p>

She was denounced to the Nazi authorities and, when the SS raided the place in early May, she was arrested and thrown in jail on charges of British espionage and helping Jews. Jane and some of the children were later deported to Auschwitz. Those of us who have visited Auschwitz-Birkenau can only imagine the hell on Earth. The secondary pupils who were with me on the visit left thinking deeply about what man has done to man.</p>

In a period of three months, it is recorded that some 1.3 million people were killed, including Jane Haining. She refused to reject her children. She died for her beliefs and was gassed along with a group of Hungarian women on 16 August 1944 at the age of 47. As she was a British  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para4"><a name="09042944000208">Jane Haining, like a number of other British heroes of the holocaust, was recognised in 1997. Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Memorial in Jerusalem, awarded Jane a medal and a place among &#147;the righteous among the nations&#148; for her selfless dedication to the children. She has been remembered in the stained glass windows of Queen&#146;s Park church in Glasgow. At the local church in Dunscore, a dedicated group of local people have erected a cairn and a plaque to her memory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para5"><a name="09042944000209">The time is now right officially to recognise such individuals, who risked everything, including their own lives, to assist others during those dark times. In recent years, the Government have shown support for civilians who have given a commitment during the war years by officially recognising them. The Bevin boys, the land army girls and lumber Jills are perfect examples of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para6"><a name="09042944000210">At the end of last week, it was reported that Prince Charles was proud of the role that his grandmother, Princess Alice of Greece, played during the second world war, when she hid Jews in the Royal palace in Athens. The indications are that Prince Charles will appear in the film, &#147;The Rescuers: Heroes of the Holocaust&#148;, which tells the stories of 12 individuals who helped to save the lives of tens of thousands of Jews. Individual recognition is needed for the British heroes of the holocaust.</p>

Other British heroes of the holocaust have been recognised in different ways within their communities. A collective contribution of such brave individuals merits a memorial. I recognise that it is not the Government&#146;s role to provide memorials&#151;even if it were, the job would not fall to the Cabinet Office and my right hon. Friend the Minister. I say to him that this matter of recognition of the British heroes of the holocaust will only be completed when our nation has a memorial. I plead with him to consider further co-operation and assistance with the Holocaust Educational Trust and others to ensure that in some shape and form and in some location a memorial is erected? I thank the Minister in advance for what I hope will be some good news for us today.</p>

 It is a great privilege to speak in this debate, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) on securing it.

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para9"><a name="09042944000214">We are here to talk about a number of extraordinary individuals and the effect that they have had on all of us today, and will have in future. We are right to look at those individuals in some detail. We have heard already about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituent. I want to say a word or two about the constituent through whom I have come to this issue. I am grateful in this, as in many other things, to the Holocaust Educational Trust, which has done a great deal to draw attention to these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para10"><a name="09042944000215">The trust drew my attention to June Ravenhall. The hon. Gentleman mentioned her and she also appears in the early-day motion. She originally came from Kenilworth and settled in Rugby, thereby neatly encapsulating both parts of my constituency. Her son, Ron, is a councillor in Rugby&#151;not, I fear to say, for the right party, but one cannot have everything.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para11"><a name="09042944000216">Ron has been enthusiastic and dedicated in drawing out the memories of his mother. He talks about her, as well he should, with considerable pride. June Ravenhall was a British woman who moved to Holland during the war and sheltered the young Jew, Louis Velleman, who was sought by the Gestapo. Moreover, he had tuberculosis, putting not only June but her three young children at considerable risk. June continued to shelter him even though she knew that any discovery, or knock on the door, would lead both to her death and considerable peril for her young children. She did all that alone because her husband was in a Nazi concentration camp. We can all agree that sustained and remarkable courage of that nature deserves recognition. I share the hope of the hon. Gentleman that that recognition will begin today with whatever the Minister is able to say that the Government can do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para12"><a name="09042944000217">Interestingly, when Ron Ravenhall wrote a book, which was partly about June&#146;s life, he described how Louis Velleman explained how he felt about what June Ravenhall had done for him. I shall quote from the book:</p>
<a name="90429h0006.htm_brev4"><a name="09042944000406"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Louis Velleman, the young Jew she saved, was asked by a Press reporter, some 44 years after the event, how brave he thought June was. Although a famous journalist himself, fluent in at least two languages, Louis could find no word to describe the extent of her sustained bravery. &#145;The English are not brave, - they are mad.&#146;, was his eventual reply.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para13"><a name="09042944000218">That may not have been exactly the right word to describe what June Ravenhall did, but we would all be mad were we not to take the opportunity presented to us by the lives and acts of such remarkable people to draw what lessons we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para14"><a name="09042944000219">The hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway referred to the lessons. Those people were ordinary people doing extraordinary things. I have little doubt that if any of them knew about this debate, they would be amazed and deeply humbled. In my view, that makes them more deserving of any honours we can give them. The lessons we can draw are clear: people may have an ordinary background and they may have unlikely qualifications for heroism, but it lies in the most unlikely places. There were many heroes in that period of our history, but not all wore a uniform. Those people did not wear a uniform and they demonstrated remarkable heroism. They tell us that it is possible, in the face of unimaginable evil, such as we saw in Europe in the 1940s, for relatively ordinary, unexpected heroes to arise and to do remarkable things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para15"><a name="09042944000220">As hon. Members have said, it is right that we recognise that the threat has not gone away. Nazism and anti-Semitism are not dead, nor is hatred of the kind we have been  <br>

talking about. Sometimes it sleeps, but we must always be prepared for it to reawaken, even within our own communities. June Ravenhall and others who have been mentioned show us that, even if people do not feel that they are cut out for heroism, they can show by their actions that they can stand up against almost impossible threats and demonstrate what individuals can do. That is a lesson that we could learn well in today&#146;s society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para16"><a name="09042944000221">We can say, &#147;We can do it too&#148; only if we know of the existence of those people and what they did. It is striking how little is known about them. Perhaps all hon. Members are struck by how little they knew about such people before they were drawn to their attention. It is important that our fellow countrymen and countrywomen know about them and what they did, so that they can believe that even in the face of overwhelming evil, they can play a part and stand up against it. That is why I am proud to support the suggestion of the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway. I am hopeful that the Minister will be able to tell us that it will be taken up, for the benefit of people today and people in future years.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) on securing this debate. I should like to talk about a man for whom I have a great deal of admiration. He has already been mentioned. His name is Frank Foley, but some refer to him as the &#147;British Schindler&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para17"><a name="09042944000223">Frank was remarkable. We in Stourbridge like to think of him as a son of Stourbridge&#151;he retired there&#151;but he was born in Somerset. He has been a source of great pride and inspiration. When I was a teacher, I used to talk about Frank Foley and his deeds. It is an inspiration when we hear about ordinary people doing extraordinary things, particularly to young people. I used to walk children down the street where he lived&#151;we do not even have a plaque there, but there is one in the local park&#151;and they saw that he lived in an ordinary house in an ordinary street in an ordinary town called Stourbridge. That is a powerful image for young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para18"><a name="09042944000224">Frank was born in Somerset in 1884. He was recruited as a spy, and following stints in France and Cologne, he was posted to Berlin, where he worked as a passport control officer. Of course, that was a cover for his main duties as head of the British Secret Intelligence Service station. During the &#146;20s and &#146;30s, he successfully recruited agents and acquired key details of German military research and development, but it is primarily through his work as a passport control officer that he earned the nickname of the &#147;British Schindler&#148;. He saved tens of thousands of lives by providing papers to allow Jewish people to escape from Nazi Germany. He would bend the rules when he was stamping passports and visas to allow Jews to escape legally to Britain and Palestine. However, he went further, even going into internment camps to get Jews out, sheltering people in his own home and helping them to get forged passports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para19"><a name="09042944000225">Frank also used his hiding place to brief foreign journalists. That was particularly important, because it meant that more information came out about the increasing persecution of Jews in the Third Reich. He worked very long hours&#151;from 7 o&#146;clock in the morning to 10 o&#146;clock  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="29 Apr 2009">

at night without a break on most days&#151;and personally handled as many applications as he could to keep the operation tight. He gave comfort and advice to those who were waiting for their applications to be processed. Even after the passport office closed in &#146;39, he continued to help Jews to escape. In the first week of the war, the US embassy was using youth certificates that he had signed to send hundreds of Jewish children to Scandinavia, or to Palestine via Italy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para20"><a name="09042944000226">Frank&#146;s actions were carried out at great personal danger. He had no diplomatic immunity and he could have been arrested at any time. He received no financial rewards for his actions. He risked his life every day simply because he believed it was the right and moral thing to do. After the war, he was involved in hunting ex-SS members and ran a network of double agents called the double cross system. At the 1961 trial of Nazi colonel Adolf Eichmann, who is sometimes referred to as the architect of the holocaust, Foley was described as the &#147;Scarlet Pimpernel&#148; for the way in which he risked his own life to save others&#151;he was very difficult to pin down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para21"><a name="09042944000227">In &#146;49, Frank retired to Stourbridge, where he remained until his death. His bravery has been recognised in various ways but, unfortunately, not until after his death. Furthermore, many of the thousands of Jews who were helped to safety by forged visas that he supplied do not know his name&#151;when they arrived in Palestine with visas that they knew they ought not to have, it is hardly surprising that they kept their heads down. It is only in recent years that the true extent of his bravery and the huge number of people that he rescued has begun to come to light.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para22"><a name="09042944000228">In October 1999, Frank was given the status of righteous among the nations. Closer to home, we in Stourbridge have recognised him with a remembrance plaque in Mary Stevens park. A statue of him has been erected in Highbridge, where he was born&#151;it was paid for by volunteer fundraisers&#151;and there is a plaque that pays tribute to him at the British embassy in Berlin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para23"><a name="09042944000229">I have started an annual Frank Foley lecture in my constituency with my colleague, the Minister for the West Midlands, which brings people together to remember Mr. Foley and to hear talks from experts. This year, we welcomed Michael Smith, who has written a book about him and who has carried out much of the original research into his life. We also heard from Ziggy Shipper, who is a holocaust survivor. He spoke movingly about his experience. The lecture is an important way to commemorate locally those who died in the holocaust and to let more people know about the stories of incredible people such as Frank Foley. The most gratifying thing was that many young people were there, some of whom had benefited from Government funding for the Holocaust Educational Trust&#146;s excellent programme of visits to Auschwitz. I, too, have been privileged to make that trip.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para24"><a name="09042944000230">This time last year, I tabled an early-day motion that called for the current statutes governing the honours system to be changed, to allow a posthumous knighthood to be awarded to Frank Foley and other rescuers of the holocaust. It received 111 signatures, which shows the strength of feeling on the issue and the cross-party support for such a move. The Cabinet Office has a list of  <br>

criteria for individuals to be considered for honours, particularly civilian honours. I think that Frank Foley fulfils many of them. He carried the respect of his peers, improved the lot of those less able to help themselves and displayed moral courage and vision in making and delivering tough choices time and again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para25"><a name="09042944000231">I appreciate that membership of the Order of Chivalry ceases on death, but it was impossible to recognise Frank Foley&#146;s acts while he was alive because he was bound by the Official Secrets Act, which prevented him from telling anyone about his work in Berlin and the tens of thousands of people he saved. To put it simply, very few people knew about his extraordinary bravery until it was too late to thank him. I ask the Minister to make a special exemption in this case and to recognise an incredible man who asked for no reward during his lifetime, but who none the less deserves the highest award that we can bestow on him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para26"><a name="09042944000232">One of the things that I find so amazing about Frank Foley&#146;s story is that after his time in Germany, where he accomplished extraordinary things and saved so many lives, he retired to live an ordinary life in an ordinary house in Stourbridge. It goes to show that extraordinary deeds can be accomplished by ordinary people, which is truly inspirational. It is a vital learning experience, particularly for youngsters. I urge the Minister to change the honours system, so that heroes such as Frank Foley can be given the recognition of an honour. It is the least that they deserve.</p>

 It is a privilege to follow the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho), whom I congratulate on her work to bring to the forefront of public consciousness the heroism, magnanimity and immense humanity of Frank Foley. I have had the pleasure of reading Michael Smith&#146;s book, which is, exactly as she has said, a revelation. Some hon. Members may be familiar with the wartime film &#147;Pimpernel Smith&#148;, starring the late Leslie Howard, who himself did not survive the war, as a quiet academic who secretly rescues people from the jaws of death. Frank Foley was Pimpernel Smith in reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para27"><a name="09042944000234">We have taken a very long time to recognise and acknowledge such heroes, who quietly went back into obscurity&#151;that is, those of them who lived not to tell the tale but at least to resume their lives. It is hard to know why we have taken so long to recognise our own heroes. One or two of them were known early on, but not always for what they did in terms of the holocaust. I have in mind Charles Coward, whose story was made into the famous and gripping film &#147;The Password is Courage&#148;, a prisoner-of-war drama about how that irrepressible young man caused mayhem to his German captors. However, the part for which we remember him today was considered too grim to be included in the film. When he was put to work at Monowitz, near the Auschwitz extermination centre, he worked surreptitiously to save Jews from the jaws of death and to convey explosives to those who eventually blew up the crematoriums. The story emerged earlier than most&#151;this was hinted at in earlier contributions&#151;because of the Nuremberg trials. Charlie Coward was mentioned at the trials for his heroism in exposing the dastardly extermination programme created by Hitlerism. As a result, a book was written that went into some depth  <br>

about what he did in Auschwitz, but, as I have said, that was considered too grim for the feature film to do more than talk about; sketches were included to give a rough idea of the conditions in which that hero operated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para28"><a name="09042944000235">It is always heart-warming for me to hear non-Jewish parliamentary colleagues&#151;I come from a Jewish background myself&#151;taking the trouble to initiate a debate of this sort. I sometimes hesitate to get involved, because I feel that in a sense, it means so much more when someone whose family was not affected by the events that we are discussing takes an interest in them. For many years, the Jewish community was perhaps reluctant to draw too much attention to what happened. Sometimes, I think, people felt ashamed that they had not resisted more. But it is pretty well impossible to resist when one is a civilian being rounded up by armed paramilitaries or men in military uniform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para29"><a name="09042944000236">The amazing thing is that there was so much resistance. Of the half-dozen principal extermination centres, there were revolts at three. I have mentioned that the crematoriums at Auschwitz were blown up, but the Sobibor camp and the Treblinka camp, where my family were exterminated, were destroyed completely in uprisings by the inmates. To do such a thing in such desperate conditions is a mark of heroism that also deserves more recognition than it has been given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para30"><a name="09042944000237">When I was a young man, I learned less about Charlie Coward&#151;the Nuremberg trials were before my time&#151;than about Raoul Wallenberg, who everyone taking part in this debate has heard of. Raoul Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat in Hungary who saved tens of thousands of Jews in precisely the same way as Frank Foley. He rescued people from the jaws of death, putting himself in mortal danger, and having come through it all against the Nazis, was arrested by the Russians, hauled off to the gulag and never seen again. At that time, I had no idea that any British person, other than on the smaller scale of Sergeant Coward, had done anything of the sort. I pay tribute to Michael Smith for his excellent book, which was instrumental in giving us the pride of knowing that we had our own Raoul Wallenberg in Frank Foley.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="90429h0006.htm_para31"><a name="09042944000238">I have also been privileged to read profiles of other heroes supplied by the Holocaust Educational Trust. I draw attention to one of the briefer passages in the little dossier sent by the trust. It refers to 10 British prisoners of war&#151;John Buckley, Alan Edwards, Willy Fisher, Bert Hambling, George Hammond, Bill Keeple, Roger Lechford, Tommy Noble, Bill Scruton and Stan Wells&#151;who discovered a young Jewish girl, a teenager called Sara Rigler, who had escaped from a death march outside Danzig. They smuggled her into their prisoner of war camp and hid her in a hayloft. As a result, she survived the war.</p>

You were prisoners of war.&#148; They said, &#147;We did it because we were British, and this was why we were fighting that war.&#148; I do not know about you, Mr. Benton, but whenever I think about such stories, my backbone straightens, my spirits lift and I feel that perhaps it is not such an evil world after all.

That is what those British heroes did, and that is why I am so happy that broad hints are being dropped in this debate that something will now be done for them.</p>

 It is an honour to follow the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis). Those of us who have listened to the last eight minutes of the debate will be glad that he chose to speak and did not decide that it would be inappropriate for him to do so, because it has been a privilege to listen to him. He was characteristically generous in commending all those who are not of his faith and ethnic background for speaking in such a debate and in saying that it is all the more important that we should speak because our families were not affected. I am not here because my family was affected, although my father did serve throughout the war in many of its theatres, and he later died far too young as a consequence. I am here because I have been affected by the events that we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para1"><a name="09042944000241">That brings me to my second point. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) for giving us the opportunity to do what we perhaps do not do often enough in these buildings, namely reaching across party lines to celebrate issues that are infused with fundamental goodness, rather than celebrating the divisions between us, which&#151;I say this with respect to all my colleagues&#151;we sometimes exaggerate to make points. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving us the opportunity to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para2"><a name="09042944000242">I am also grateful to the Holocaust Educational Trust and its leadership, to whom my hon. Friend has referred. In my first term as a Member of Parliament, they took me on a trip with some schoolchildren to see Auschwitz-Birkenau. It was obviously an important moment in the lives of those young people. I was three times the age of some of them, but I had never experienced such a moment, too. I will never forget walking back along the spur of the railway line towards the camp gates in the gloaming of the evening, as we say in Scotland. The atmosphere and the visibility were such that one could see the stone chimneys of the buildings, but nothing else, and one&#146;s sense was that the wooden parts of the buildings, which are long gone, were still there. I distinctly remember thinking just for a moment, as I walked back across the railway line and paced between the sleepers, that that must have been what it was really like when the camp was in full flow and doing all the horrible things that it did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para3"><a name="09042944000243">I also remember being intensely angry. I could not quite work out where my anger was directed, but I realised that it was the railway line, which was so perfect&#151;I realise that it had been preserved. It was a perfect piece of engineering and it seemed to be a manifestation of how a perfectly innocent thing&#151;the construction of a railway line&#151;could have been contorted in an evil way by people who did not do the things that those we are celebrating in this debate did. I cannot remember being so angry with an inanimate object in my life, but I was angry with that railway line. It was an extraordinary moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para4"><a name="09042944000244">I have never really forgotten that experience, and I welcome every opportunity not only to express those emotions, which one cannot always do in debates, but  <br>

to make a small contribution on this issue and to do what the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) and my hon. Friends the Members for Dumfries and Galloway and for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) suggested&#151;they set exactly the right tone for the debate&#151;when they said that we should remember the people we are talking about in any way that we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para5"><a name="09042944000245">We should remember those people for two simple reasons. First, we should celebrate people&#146;s goodness as much as we can, particularly when it is laced with the manifest courage that the people we are talking about showed in the face of the daunting and potential attacks on them. We should also take every opportunity to give expression to the phrase, &#147;This must never happen again.&#148; We should remind ourselves that the dangers that we are talking about can, from very innocuous beginnings, become manifest in the human spirit and in humanity&#146;s behaviour. That serves as a lesson to us all that human beings are capable of some awful things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para6"><a name="09042944000246">Unfortunately, however often we tell ourselves that such things must never happen again, there has never been a moment in my life when events like those that we are discussing, although not on the same scale, have not been happening somewhere in the world. That is a reminder that we should be vigilant in our own society and remember the consequences of our not addressing such behaviour in other societies. I thank those who have spoken for putting that very clearly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para7"><a name="09042944000247">I am not in a position to celebrate a constituent or someone who was born in my constituency and I have no family connections to such a person in my constituency. However, I was introduced to an extraordinary group of people when I was the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality&#151;a job that the Minister has also done. On 8 May 2005, the Highbridge war memorial trust and the Foley fair committee invited me to unveil the statue that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge has mentioned. The invitation came to me because Frank Foley was a passport control officer, and it was appropriate to invite the Minister responsible for immigration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para8"><a name="09042944000248">I was delighted to be invited, and I will never forget that extraordinary afternoon. There was a small group of people, some of whom were survivors and some of whom had no particular experience of the events that we are discussing. However, as a result of the telling and retelling of people&#146;s stories and the celebration of what Frank Foley did as a decent man, a spirit was generated among those people that might, if one could bottle it, ensure that, at some point in the future, we no longer need constantly to remind ourselves to be on our guard. It was an enormous privilege to be in the company of those people that afternoon, and I will never forget it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para9"><a name="09042944000249">I had intended to speak about Frank Foley in more detail, but it is entirely appropriate that somebody who can claim a constituency connection to him should have told us his story. We have heard what that extraordinary man did, although he was actually a bit of a shady character, which is just as well, because that was probably how he managed to do what he did while moving around the internment camps and elsewhere. He was a typical British shady character in that he looked like what he was&#151;a civil servant. However, he was a shady character, and thank God for that.</p>

He did everything at his own personal risk. He was in Germany for some years, but I cannot imagine how he managed to process the number of people that he did or to get them out of the country without it being obvious to others, including those who were watching him. He must have courted considerable personal danger.</p>

In a way, that is the true definition of heroism.</p>

We have rightly recognised those who made a contribution, such as the Bevin boys, the timber Jills and the land girls. I am not suggesting what should be done in this case, but we have been given an opportunity to say again that we value in a special way the extraordinary group of people who are the subject of the debate, because of what they say about the goodness that is in all of us. We thank them for what they did, not only for the sake of the people whom they rescued but for giving us an example, so that our generation may make at least some contribution to making the world a better place.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to make the first of the three concluding speeches to this important debate. Normally when I speak from this position in the Chamber, I am contributing to a discussion on the Budget or the economy. Those are necessarily partisan debates, and rightly so, because it is important that Parliament scrutinises those essential contemporary matters. However&#151;this point has been made by other hon. Members&#151;it is also extremely valuable to have opportunities to come together and celebrate achievements of our fellow countrymen and women through the years, and to talk about what binds us together and our common interests. This debate has been distinguished in that regard.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="29 Apr 2009">

and Loudoun has reminded us, atrocities are committed across the world every day, but the scale of the holocaust, and the degree to which it was regimented and organised, make it unique. Most people probably accept that the second world war was the biggest distinguishing event in the history of our country&#151;a moment when we reached a fork in the road and the future of our nation depended on the outcome. We are talking about a unique and central feature of what I argue was the most important act in the history of our country and continent, the second world war. There could not be a matter more worthy of our consideration, or people more worthy of our admiration, than those who are the subject of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para15"><a name="09042944000256">I pay tribute, as others have done, to the Holocaust Educational Trust for its tireless work in raising such matters and for making sure that Members of Parliament give them the consideration they surely deserve, as well as for, as its name suggests, educating Members of Parliament and the public in general about the holocaust, the scale of the tragedy and its lasting consequences. I, too, was given an opportunity by the group to visit Auschwitz, as the Prime Minister, I am pleased to say, did yesterday, and like other hon. Members I went with a group of teenagers from my constituency. It was something that I had always wanted to do, and it was an extremely moving and memorable day&#151;I found it so, and the young people I went with had the same thoughts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para16"><a name="09042944000257">I hope that hon. Members will briefly indulge me as I recall a few features of that day. One thing that struck me as particularly strange&#151;even eerie&#151;was that it was a lovely summer day when we visited Auschwitz. The photographs that one sees of it always show bleak midwinter in Poland. To visit a place where the air is heavy with history and to feel that sense of foreboding, but with the leaves rustling in the wind, the sun shining and the birds singing in the trees, is almost more discomfiting, I imagine, than going there in weather conditions that make it more obviously bleak. The contrast between the sense of freedom and gaiety of such weather and the deeds that took place in the camp made the experience all the more poignant and troubling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para17"><a name="09042944000258">I particularly remember two features. One is the railway track. It is a famous image and we are all familiar with it, but to see it with one&#146;s own eyes is memorable. Different people may have different memories, but the other one that particularly stands out in my mind is the huge bank of shoes behind a glass screen. There is something extremely human about shoes&#151;I do not know why that is more the case than with other items of clothing. The fact that each shoe or pair of shoes represented an individual with their own story, life, circumstances and family somehow brought things to life for me more than statistics would, even though the statistics are obviously revealing and deeply upsetting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para18"><a name="09042944000259">For all those reasons I am enthusiastic&#151;I know that hon. Members in all parties share that enthusiasm&#151;for some recognition of the bravery that was so evident from our fellow countrymen and women in those uniquely awful circumstances. Everyone has a proprietorial interest in Major Frank Foley, so perhaps as he was born in Somerset, and as I represent a Somerset constituency, I should touch on his achievements. It is worth noting that the only remaining survivor of first world war trench warfare was also born in Somerset, and lives   <br>

there. Perhaps we are unfairly rewarded with people who, to make a serious point, did not necessarily hold a status or rank that suggested that they would be at the front of the queue for honours, but who have come to symbolise particularly distinguished service to their country. Their ordinariness is, in a way, what makes them particularly notable people. That is probably true of Mr. Harry Patch, who lives in Somerset and who at 110 years old is one of a handful still surviving who served in the first world war&#151;I understand that he is the only one of them who fought in the trenches. That is true of Major Foley as well; his story has already been recounted by other hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para19"><a name="09042944000260">I understand that the Government are minded to bring about some recognition, and I admire them for their activism and imagination. The financial cost to us of recognising the contributions of the individuals in question is extremely modest, yet to do so is valuable, partly because it is greatly appreciated by the relatives and surviving associates of the individuals, although they are fairly few. More importantly, perhaps, is the symbolic value. There is, as hon. Members have said, no danger in such recognition; even 64 years since the end of the second world war, there is no downside to reminding us&#151;adults and perhaps even more importantly children who, as they grow up, are further and further removed from the conflict&#151;about two things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para20"><a name="09042944000261">The first reminder is of the capacity of mankind to be evil and the requirement on us all to be vigilant and to try to guard against that evil manifesting itself in appalling ways. That point has also been made with regard to contemporary politics, but it is obviously most relevant with regard to that historical event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para21"><a name="09042944000262">The second, symbolic reminder is the ability, as the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) put it, of ordinary people to do extraordinary things, possibly beyond what they regarded themselves as being capable of doing until they were confronted by that challenge, such that they rose to heights that they may not necessarily have ever expected to rise to. So the holocaust is a reminder to us of mankind&#146;s ability for greatness, as well as mankind&#146;s ability for evil, as I have previously said. Furthermore, these stories are an inspiring example, because they tell everybody that there is capacity within us all to be exceptional, to make history and to do good. It is valuable that we remind ourselves of our ability not only to live on a day-to-day basis and to progress through life, but to leave a mark that can inspire others, because of the sacrifice and risks that we took for a higher purpose than simply our own personal well-being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para22"><a name="09042944000263">For those reasons, a memorial, individual recognition or a combination of the two would be extremely welcome. So, I am delighted&#151;I speak, as every other hon. Member contributing to this debate will speak, in an entirely non-partisan and non-party political way&#151;that we have a senior Cabinet Minister here and that the Government themselves have seen the merit and wisdom in making progress. I greatly look forward to hearing further details from the Minister and also to hearing the contribution from the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd), to what has been an extremely high-quality, rewarding  and enlightening debate, both to participate in and to listen to.</p>

 I start by not only congratulating the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) but thanking him. That is because before this debate I did not know anything about the British heroes of the holocaust and I am embarrassed by that fact. If the Hebrew saying that was quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) is right and he who saves one life, saves the world entire, where does that place Frank Foley, who is reported to have saved 10,000 lives?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para23"><a name="09042944000265">These are extraordinary stories about really extraordinary people; these people are, if you like, giants of our time. I rather share the sentiment that was expressed by my hon. Friend: as I sit back after reading these stories, I feel very proud to be British. Therefore, I would like to thank the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway, quite genuinely, for his contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para24"><a name="09042944000266">I also congratulate the Holocaust Educational Trust. It does amazing work in my constituency each year, working with the two synagogues in Northwood and with local schools to bring together local children, often as many as 2,500 on a single day, to do something very important. That is not just about throwing a steady light on one of the darkest chapters in our history, although it has never been more important to keep doing that as the survivors of those events get older and die out. In addition, what always impresses me about that day is the ability of the Holocaust Educational Trust to connect that history with the world around those young people today. I find that enormously impressive. The trust also commu nicates a sense of opportunity for everyone&#151;each individual&#151;to make a difference. I do not think that there has ever been a more important time to inspire people with that thought, as we worry about civic engagement and the degree to which people are prepared to get involved these days. So I genuinely support the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust in that field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para25"><a name="09042944000267">That inspiring message&#151;the opportunity to make a difference&#151;underpins the importance of the stories that we have heard today, which are genuinely inspirational. Each contributor to the debate today has spoken powerfully about things that have touched them individually. Again, I rather share the sentiment expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East. The story that I liked most was about the group of 10 prisoners of war, Tommy Noble and his mates, who spent 10 weeks supporting that young girl. That is because acts of individual heroism are enormously impressive, but when there is a group of people prepared to take the same unflinching and enormous risk for that length of time, that is enormously impressive, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para26"><a name="09042944000268">I am probably not the only Member who, while reading these stories, was asking himself or herself, &#147;How would I have reacted in this situation?&#148; The answer is that we do not know, because very few of us have been tested to that limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para27"><a name="09042944000269">Therefore, this has been a journey that leads me to feel strongly that it has been wrong to leave recognition of British heroes of the holocaust until now to the Israeli authorities, including the Israeli Holocaust Memorial Authority, and that it is right now to recognise them through a national memorial of some form. I am delighted to place on record my party&#146;s support for the principle of a memorial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para28"><a name="09042944000270">Obviously, the nature of such a memorial needs to be thought through carefully. I think that most Members, particularly the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne), the former Secretary of State for Defence, will know that there are sensitivities in relation to using the existing traditional honours system to honour the dead, or to using the existing system of military awards to recognise acts of courage that took place so long ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para29"><a name="09042944000271">Therefore, a memorial is something that needs to be thought through carefully, I hope on a cross-party basis. However, if the Government are thinking of some form of individual award that sits outside the traditional award system, that is clearly an attractive idea as far as we are concerned and it would be of enormous value to the families of the individuals involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para30"><a name="09042944000272">I want to close by expressing a personal view. It is not the view of my party; in fact, I do not know whether it is the view of my party, but I am inspired to place it on record as a personal view. I would be disappointed if such an initiative, such an individual award, were introduced and that was the end of it, however valuable that initiative was to the families concerned. That is because I would hope that we could be inspired to do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para31"><a name="09042944000273">I am attracted to the idea of considering what the Government can do to facilitate a more physical memorial for all heroes, something that is tangible, that people can walk or drive past and that will trigger something in them, reminding them of what my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) put very well, which is the power of ordinary people to rise up and do remarkable things whatever the scale of the threat facing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="90429h0007.htm_para32"><a name="09042944000274">I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

Not only has he shown leadership on this subject, but he has shown leadership in a way that has brought it to national attention, including the attention of Ministers, the Government and this House. My hon. Friend has long taken a personal interest in this subject, and we have corresponded on the matter&#151;sometimes not to his satisfaction&#151;during the past weeks and months. He is the co-author of early-day motion 1175, and he has also worked enormously effectively with his local media. Better still, he has helped other hon. Members to work with their local media, so that some of these stories come to the attention of a much wider audience. I hope that he will persist with such work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para1"><a name="09042944000277">I pay my own tribute to the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust. The extraordinary work and research that it has done have represented the treasured and sometimes difficult memories of the families involved  <br>

with enormous dignity. The trust has represented, articulated and celebrated those memories with great effectiveness, and by alighting on the inspirational idea of heroes of the Holocaust, it has done an incredible job of telling people in modern Britain about the relevance of remembering such terrible experiences. The staff and trustees of the trust should be very proud of what they have achieved in Parliament this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para2"><a name="09042944000278">What more can I add to what has been said about the holocaust in the debate? Not very much. The population of Jews in pre-war Europe was 9 million and, during the war, 6 million were systematically murdered, along with many others. The Chief Rabbi once said that the deeper one looks into the holocaust, the more one runs the risk of entering a black hole of despair. Yet the holocaust still has much to teach us today in Britain about not just the depths of depravity to which man can sink, but the way in which society, politics, Governments and civil society can miss the warning signs of prejudice and racism. Unfortunately, those lessons are still enormously relevant to Britain today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para3"><a name="09042944000279">Yet when I think about my education, I simply do not believe that the holocaust was a focus and feature of it in the way that it could have been. I remember learning and reading about the holocaust in my brief history lessons, but it was not until I took myself off with a rucksack to the middle east at the age of 19 that my education about the holocaust really began. Like many hon. Members, I can still see the images of what I saw at Yad Vashem in my mind this afternoon, and I can still vividly&#151;all too vividly&#151;remember how I felt walking through that avenue, which celebrates the extraordinary courage of many people who did so much to help to rescue Jews during the holocaust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para4"><a name="09042944000280">That is why, during the past 10 or 11 years, it is right that the Government&#151;and we as a country&#151;have done more to remember the holocaust and to bring its relevance into the modern currency of politics and civil society. Hon. Members have mentioned that yesterday the Prime Minister was at Auschwitz where he said that the UK will permanently support the maintenance and retention of the memorial there. This year, the Government have granted more than &#163;750,000 to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, which organises a national Holocaust memorial day. The Government have made more than &#163;1.5 million available to the Holocaust Educational Trust to support its work in raising awareness among younger people of the true horrors of the holocaust. One of the most powerful features of this debate is the personal experiences of right hon. and hon. Members, who not only visited Auschwitz, but had the experience of sharing that education with younger constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para5"><a name="09042944000281">Why should we go a stage further and honour heroes of the holocaust? The case for that has not been put better than by the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway. Although the holocaust teaches us about the depths to which man can sink, it also contains some of the best stories of the human spirit. In the midst of such a great crime, a small number of very brave people chose not to stand by, but to act, despite the fact that the consequence for sheltering, aiding or helping Jews to escape was severe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para6"><a name="09042944000282">We have heard the extraordinary story of Jane Haining, who was a missionary working in an orphanage in Hungary and who refused to leave the little Jewish  <br>

children who were in her care. As a result, she was sent to Auschwitz, where she died. We have also heard about the example of June Ravenhall, who was an English woman living in the Netherlands. She hid a Jewish child for, I think, between two and a half and three years. In much of occupied Europe at that time, there was a short supply of food, fuel, and medicines, and the very act of taking somebody in and sheltering them was difficult not just because of the persecution taking place, but because of having to share scarce resources. June Ravenhall took additional risks because I understand that the Jewish child that she sheltered had tuberculosis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para7"><a name="09042944000283">We could also dwell on the other extraordinary stories that we have heard about from right hon. and hon. Members: for example, the stories of Frank Foley, Albert Bedane, Randolph Churchill, Ida and Louise Cook, Charles Coward, Sofka Skipworth and, of course, Princess Alice of Greece. One of the most extraordinary things about those who survived is that they often returned home to lives and communities from which they received no reward or recognition. Even though their stories are today such an extraordinary source of inspiration to us, many of those people did not consider that they had actually done anything out of the ordinary. Surely, such people should be considered one of the proudest aspects of Britain&#146;s war effort during the second world war, and that is why we should be honouring them today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para8"><a name="09042944000284">Another reason for doing so, which was alluded to by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd), is that honouring those people will help us to teach the lessons of the holocaust when, during the next 20 years, it goes from living history to just history. We need to find ways of helping teachers to communicate the sheer power of what those extraordinary people did. Talking about what they did will help teachers to communicate the wider argument and message that we can still distil and learn from the holocaust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para9"><a name="09042944000285">Let me turn directly to the subject of the early-day motion and the debate that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway has initiated this afternoon. We have been following this subject with great attention. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and I believe that it is right to recognise the contribution of holocaust heroes. We have had discussions across Government to examine a number of options, and we have concluded that there is a way forward, although I do not think that the precise way that my hon. Friend suggests in his early-day motion is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para10"><a name="09042944000286">Let me add two points of clarification to explain why. First, if we take the basic principle that an Order of Knighthood relates to a society of people with the sovereign at its head that is bound together by statutes that define people&#146;s rights and obligations as well as their relationship to the outside world, we can begin to see how my hon. Friend&#146;s suggestion is not precisely the way in which appropriate recognition should be delivered. A dead person can take no place as a member of such a society of the living, and membership of one of the Orders of Chivalry ceases on the death of the appointee. That policy and the associated procedures have been subject to scrutiny several times since what I have outlined was articulated in 1922.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para11"><a name="09042944000287">Secondly, it might be helpful if I correct a misapprehension that sometimes creeps into debates on the subject, although I am glad to say that we have not  <br>

heard it this afternoon. Sometimes the idea of honours and gallantry awards are conflated, but it is important to remember that, as the name implies, gallantry awards recognise individuals who have consciously put their lives at risk for the benefit of others, and that, under current procedures, awards are made within just five years of the event concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para12"><a name="09042944000288">Therefore, we need to find a different way to honour the people we have heard so much about this afternoon. I am pleased to announce that the Government agree that it is entirely appropriate that we should have a national recognition of the holocaust heroes. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and I can announce that the Government will create an award of recognition for the extraordinary acts of courage shown by a number of British citizens during the second world war in helping many Jews and other persecuted groups to escape from the evils of the holocaust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para13"><a name="09042944000289">I want to discuss the precise dimensions of that award further in meetings with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and other interested parties. I hope to meet the families of the heroes we have discussed, debated and heard so much about this afternoon. I hope that we can proceed in a cross-party way, so I would be grateful for the advice and counsel of Opposition Members and greatly privileged if my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway joined us in those discussions. We have some ideas about what would constitute a fitting award, but we want to hear the views of the families before developing proposals any further. I hope to have the first of those meetings in the next couple of weeks. I hope that all Members will agree that that will mark a clear recognition of those individuals&#146; bravery, courage and self-sacrifice, and celebrate the outstanding contributions that they made for humanity and the finest traditions of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para14"><a name="09042944000290">In conclusion, I believe that this has been an extraordinary and, in a way, unique debate. I have not been in this House for long, but in the four and a half years since becoming a Member I have not had the privilege of being involved or associated with so powerful a debate. We have taken a vital step forward in honouring the gifts, guts and sheer goodness of those men and women from whom we draw so much inspiration today.</p>

 I shall try again, Mr. Benton. I am grateful for this opportunity to express my concern about the rash of planning applications for tall buildings in my part of London. I am talking not about what we usually mean by tall buildings&#151;10, 15 or 20 storeys high&#151;but about buildings of 40, 50 or even 100 storeys. I am not talking either about central London, where there are already clusters of tall buildings such as those in the City, or about Docklands or Croydon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para18"><a name="09042944000296">There are applications in almost every shopping centre in my borough. Some people believe that we need not worry about such schemes, because the recession will put paid to them, but that may not be so. Developers have stopped work on some small and medium-sized schemes, but they seem to be forging ahead with big schemes that take three or four years to build, presumably on the basis that the recession will be over long before completion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para19"><a name="09042944000297">One developer in my part of London is planning to erect two towers, one of 32 storeys and the other of  42 storeys, on the former site of Young&#146;s brewery in Wandsworth, and another is planning to erect two towers, both of 42 storeys, next to Clapham Junction station. The tallest buildings in my area are 1960s tower blocks on estates, which many people believe were a mistake and should not be repeated, but the planned towers will be double their height and six or seven times the height of the department store in our shopping centre, and they will dwarf the adjoining terraces of two or three-storey Victorian houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para20"><a name="09042944000298">The new owners of Battersea power station went even further with a proposal for a 300 m glass tower, equivalent to 100 storeys, which would have been the tallest building in Europe. Fortunately, it fell foul of the long-standing rule that no building should be allowed to spoil the view of the Houses of Parliament from Westminster bridge. I am sure that the Minister knows that Wordsworth wrote:</p>
<a name="90429h0008.htm_brev0"><a name="09042944000407"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Earth has not anything to show more fair&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para21"><a name="09042944000299">than the view from Westminster bridge. We may have him to thank for the fact that the owners of Battersea power station were forced to rethink their scheme, reducing its height from 100 storeys to about 13. They say that they have been able to redesign it so that it will be no worse than the original plan; in my view, it will be a lot better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para22"><a name="09042944000300">Battersea power station is in the Vauxhall Nine Elms opportunity area, which already has a cluster of tall buildings and is arguably in central London. I am prepared to accept that different rules should apply in the City, Canary Wharf, perhaps in Blackfriars just across from the City where the Secretary of State has just approved a couple of tall buildings, and in Vauxhall,  <br>

but I do not accept that individual tall buildings should be pepper-potted around London next to Edwardian, Victorian and even Georgian streets and town centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para23"><a name="09042944000301">I realise that Ministers are more likely to be familiar with central London, but Wandsworth, where my constituency lies, is as far from the City of London as Stockton is from Hartlepool or, in the case of the Secretary of State, as far as Eccles is from central Manchester. No one could argue&#151;I am sure that Ministers could not do so&#151;that heights that are acceptable in the City should, by the same token, be acceptable in Wandsworth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para24"><a name="09042944000302">Wandsworth planning committee passed the Young&#146;s brewery scheme although 71 of the 90 public responses were opposed to it. I cannot think what possessed it to do so. English Heritage was against it, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment was against it, and both said that there should be a tall buildings strategy for the whole of Wandsworth, which there is not. All the local amenity societies were against it. The Wandsworth Society brought a deputation to the committee to argue against it. The society, which comprises sensitive, thoughtful and civic-minded people, believes that, at least in the Wandsworth context, any building over five or six storeys should be considered tall and that there should be a presumption against its construction. However, the seven Conservative members of the committee all supported the scheme and only my two Labour colleagues opposed it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para25"><a name="09042944000303">I wrote to the Minister to say that I thought that the approval was wrong and the application should be called in, on the ground of excessive height and on the ground that at the last moment Wandsworth agreed to reduce the proportion of affordable housing from 33 per cent. to only 11 per cent. I know that the Secretary of State uses only very rarely her powers to call in planning applications&#151;I believe that there were only 27 call-ins in the whole country last year. In London, where the Mayor now has powers to refuse, there is even more reason for her to use the powers only in exceptional cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para26"><a name="09042944000304">Fortunately, that was one of the rare cases in which the Minister agreed that the scheme needed another look, on quite a number of grounds, and there will now be a public inquiry, which I very much welcome. I know that the Minister is unable to comment on the scheme, because the final decision will rest with him or his Department, but I congratulate him on his perspicacity and judgment in making use of the powers on this occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para27"><a name="09042944000305">A huge campaign is under way to stop the towers at Clapham Junction. People feel that they would look completely out of place in a Victorian town centre, where all the buildings have between four and seven storeys. The Clapham Junction Action Group has been set up and is fighting a spirited campaign. The theme of the campaign is that we want to keep our town centre on a human scale. We have 614 objectors on the planning department website so far and we are aiming for 1,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para28"><a name="09042944000306">I accept that that is a local issue. My concern in this debate is with the wider issue of tall buildings and planning policy. Recent changes in planning policy, moving away from height and density guidelines and judging each planning application as a whole, have had unintended consequences with which we are only now getting to grips.</p>

<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>29 Apr 2009 : Column 308WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para29"><a name="09042944000307">First, if there are no height and density guidelines, how does a developer know how much to pay for a site? He does not even know how many flats he will be allowed to build. He has to second-guess the decision of the planning committee, which may be two years down the line. Minerva, the company that bought the Young&#146;s Brewery site, paid &#163;69 million. I have no argument with the company, which has devised a very sensitive scheme that retains the old brewery beam engine and coppers at one end of the site, but it says that that must be paid for and the price is a 42-storey block. To my mind, that is the wrong way to do it. The developer should be told how many flats he will be allowed to build. That will give him certainty. He already has enough uncertainty because of fluctuations in the price of property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para30"><a name="09042944000308">Secondly, developers should be told exactly where tall buildings will and will not be allowed. If the policy is to confine tower blocks to clusters, which I would support, they should be told exactly where they are. If the policy is to allow landmark buildings, they should be told where those landmarks can be. We must not leave every developer to argue that his building is a landmark, because believe you me, they all will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para31"><a name="09042944000309">Scrapping the height and density guidelines has been a disaster. It means that architects compete against one another to build the tallest towers, instead of complementing one another in the creation of an attractive townscape. It means that developers pay too much for sites and then &#147;have to&#148; build high to recover their outlay. The public feel that they are being blackmailed by developers, who will build something good only if we also allow them to build something monstrous behind it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para32"><a name="09042944000310">I want to strike a blow not just against towers in my constituency&#151;the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) has a similar problem across the river&#151;but against the whole idea that we can improve our cities by building high. Paris, Rome, Venice, Vienna, Prague and St. Petersburg&#151;there may be others&#151;all consign their tall buildings to defined areas. The result is cities that are elegant, atmospheric and economically successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para33"><a name="09042944000311">Much as I admired the former Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, for his policies on public transport&#151;he gave me four new bus routes in my constituency, which I cannot complain about&#151;and for his investment in neighbourhood policing, I did not always see eye to eye with him on planning matters. In his &#147;Interim strategic planning guidance&#148;, issued in 2001, he described how Paris banishes tall buildings to peripheral locations, such as La D&#233;fense, and he went on to say:</p>
<a name="90429h0008.htm_brev1"><a name="09042944000408"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;But these cities pay an economic price for their largely heritage-based policies. They can beat London in the &#145;city as a museum&#146; stakes, but are not in the same league in the...financial, insurance, trading, banking...and legal markets.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="90429h0008.htm_para34"><a name="09042944000312">I have to say that Boris is no better. In fact, in one respect, he is much worse because before his election he gave everyone to believe that he was against tall buildings, but what has he done since? He may have taken a few right decisions in central London, including on Battersea power station, which I have mentioned, but in places such as Wandsworth and Clapham Junction, he has betrayed the expectations of his voters by approving 42-storey blocks in totally inappropriate places. That is made worse by the fact that he has the power&#151;we gave it to him&#151;to direct refusal or to take an application over, but has never used it.</p>

There may be many other factors in what makes a successful city, but being beautiful is definitely a plus factor, not a minus factor. One of the beauties of London is that it is a largely horizontal city. Most people live in houses with gardens at the front and back, and they are happier to travel a few minutes further on the train than a bit further up in a lift.

I also look to them in the longer term and, indeed, in the London plan review, which I understand is now going on, to reconsider and perhaps recast the planning system, which is driving developers, architects and their retinues of public relations consultants&#151;every development now comes with a public relations consultant, who is assiduous in persuading people to put in positive comments&#151;to push for ever taller buildings in ever more inappropriate places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para4"><a name="09042944000320">I shall just say a few words, because we would obviously like to hear the Minister&#146;s response to the debate. Under current legislation and guidance, suitable locations for tall buildings include part of London&#146;s central activity zone. In fairness to what the hon. Gentleman was saying about London as a commercial centre, we have had the benefit of Canary Wharf emerging during the past two decades with some large buildings that, none the less, are in keeping with a financial district located away from the historical centre of our City. However, the whole of the City of London itself is within that central activity zone and its role as a business cluster means that parts of the City are considered suitable for tall buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para5"><a name="09042944000321">The City of London&#146;s own unitary development plan goes back seven years. It has a policy to permit high buildings where they would enhance the City skyline and not adversely affect to an unacceptable degree the character or amenities of the surroundings or the environment. In practice, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, that means that there is the greatest potential for new tall buildings where they consolidate an existing cluster&#151;in the context of the City, such places include Bishopsgate and the Leadenhall market area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para6"><a name="09042944000322">I very much endorse what the hon. Gentleman said, particularly if we compare the openness of Hyde park with Manhattan in New York City, where Central park is so enclosed by tall buildings on the east and upper west side. Although there are one or two large buildings near Hyde park&#151;the Hilton hotel on Park lane, for example&#151;I think that even many New Yorkers would agree that the ambience is much better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para7"><a name="09042944000323">The hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out that the new Mayor of London is committed to revising the London view management framework to strengthen view protection, although I share some of his concerns, particularly about a 42-storey building in an area such as Clapham Junction. Whether there will be a robust funding package to enable such a building to be built is perhaps another matter, but we hope that the Mayor of London, of whatever colour, will use his powers and work closely with the local boroughs to maintain some of the brilliance of London, without having a huge number of tall buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para8"><a name="09042944000324">It is perhaps ironic that the only hon. Member awaiting his turn to speak later is the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling). There is a large, downtown commercial district in the middle of Croydon. With the greatest respect for his constituency, I am sure that he will not mind if I re-tell a brief conversation that I had with the hon. Member for Battersea in a lift 48 hours ago, in which I agreed with him that we do not want too many Croydon clustered all over London. Perhaps that would also undermine to a large extent some of Croydon&#146;s unique outlook and commercial position outside the centre of our capital city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para9"><a name="09042944000325">I shall now bring my comments to a close because I appreciate that times moves on, and that we are interested to hear, from the perspective of sunny and low-rise Hartlepool, what the Minister has to say.</p>

presiding over us. I always enjoy debates when you are in the Chair. I remember, with affection, the Housing and Regeneration Bill a year or two ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para10"><a name="09042944000327">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) on securing this important debate on planning policy for tall buildings. The thing that strikes me not only in this debate, but elsewhere, is what a fantastic and assiduous campaigner he is on behalf of his constituents. He has reaped awards during his time in the House and, frankly, his constituents are lucky to have him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para11"><a name="09042944000328">I want to address the concerns raised by my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) on the framework for decision making about tall buildings, specifically with regard to local planning authorities in London. As the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster has said, Hartlepool is somewhat low rise in its buildings although, I hasten to add, not low rise in its ambitions. I wish to point out what guidance is available to help planners throughout the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea drew attention to several planning proposals for tall buildings in his constituency and elsewhere. I know that he understands the position, because he alluded in his contribution to the fact that the Secretary of State&#146;s formal role in the planning process means that I cannot possibly comment on specific proposals. However, I hope that my general remarks will be useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para12"><a name="09042944000329">There is a no legal definition of a tall building. That is not as stupid as it sounds, because a 10-storey building in a mainly two-storey neighbourhood, for example, would clearly be thought of as tall, but in the centre of a large city it may not be. Consideration of tall buildings needs to be made with reference to their location, but I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point that many recent proposals have been for very large structures, visible from neighbouring boroughs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para13"><a name="09042944000330">I assure my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman that the Government are very much aware of the risk that poorly sited towers can bring. Existing streets, public spaces and buildings provide an historical and cultural context, nurturing local pride, that important sense of place and, above all, a human scale&#151;the phrase I think that my hon. Friend used&#151;as the backdrop to our lives. Townscape can also help people feel a sense of ownership&#151;of somehow being at home in the places where they live, shop and work. That does not necessarily mean that we should not allow our cities to grow. We must acknowledge that economic prosperity is important. Cities can change, evolve and develop through new development, and, in the right place, that may include tall buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para14"><a name="09042944000331">Let me set out the planning framework within which an application for a tall building must be considered. First, at a strategic level, policy on tall buildings, as my hon. Friend has said, is the responsibility of the Mayor of London. The London plan identifies broad locations where tall buildings may be suitable, and it also includes policies on intensity of site use. Policy 3A.3 in the London plan, on &#147;Maximising the potential of sites&#148;, states:</p>
<a name="90429h0009.htm_brev3"><a name="09042944000412"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Mayor will, and boroughs should, ensure that development proposals&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para17"><a name="09042944000334">what is known as a density matrix table, which is also included in the London plan. The policy adds, quite firmly&#151;my hon. Friend has alluded to this&#151;that the Mayor has the power to</p>
<a name="90429h0009.htm_brev6"><a name="09042944000415"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;refuse permission for strategic referrals that, taking into account context and potential transport capacity, under-use the potential of the site.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para18"><a name="09042944000335">I now turn to the role of the local planning authority, which is very much in the driving seat in terms of the vision of and ambition for what an area will look like. Boroughs prepare site-specific policies in their development plan documents. It is not expected that rigid height limits for specific locations should be included in local development frameworks. Instead, core strategies should contain broader policy that sets guidance for development in an area. The London plan includes criteria and a set of considerations to help boroughs identify suitable sites for tall buildings and to assess the design and impact of such buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para19"><a name="09042944000336">There is no requirement for local policies slavishly to repeat regional ones, such as those in the local plan. Local distinctiveness and variation are to be prized and utilised. However, the borough&#146;s development plan must generally conform with the regional plan. Within the framework of criteria in the London plan, each local planning authority can define what a tall building is in that particular local context. For example, it may define suitable heights in relation to surrounding buildings and acceptable impacts on the skyline. However, I do not think that it would be appropriate to take a blanket approach across the whole borough and to seek to impose height restrictions that cannot be justified. Rather, it is right that a borough must set out, as part of its spatial strategy, appropriate locations for tall buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para20"><a name="09042944000337">To achieve that, the local planning authority must prepare a core strategy, which might incorporate a working definition of a tall building and indicate which locations could be appropriate in that particular area or what other factors would need to be taken into account, such as access to public transport. There may also be a requirement in terms of the benefits that a tall building should offer, whether regeneration, affordable housing&#151;a matter of some concern and passion to my hon. Friend&#151;or some other public good that could be solved by sound design, planning conditions or a section 106 agreement with the developer. If desired, detailed criteria for assessing the design and impact of tall buildings can be incorporated in a local authority&#146;s development management document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para21"><a name="09042944000338">Within that broad strategic confine, on every single individual planning application, the views of local people must be invited and given serious consideration. Every site is unique and the planning system requires each case to be assessed on its own merits and on how the particular application is consistent with the borough&#146;s core strategy and local development framework. Decision makers may wish to consider whether, in the circumstances of a particular application, it would be reasonable to require planning benefits from a development being proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para22"><a name="09042944000339">I have mentioned section 106. Perhaps a section 106 agreement with the developer, or conditions imposed on the permission, could require investment in public transport in the vicinity, or a stipulated proportion of affordable housing to be included in a residential development. Of course, the local planning authority has the power to refuse an application that does not come up to such expectations, provided that its views are robust and backed by evidence, as set out in its core strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para23"><a name="09042944000340">I have mentioned the local planning authority, which is in the driving seat when it comes to determining what an area should look like. I have also mentioned local government and the Mayor of London. Let me now turn to the central Government&#146;s role. I want to mention two specific areas where I think that the Government can be involved, namely call-in and providing advice and guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para24"><a name="09042944000341">In certain circumstances, the Secretary of State has the power to call in individual planning applications for tall buildings&#151;for her own decision to be made after a public local inquiry. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea has already mentioned called-in decisions made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and he knows&#151;I reiterate&#151;that I cannot possibly comment on those. But earlier this month, my Department issued a new circular that sets out the circumstances in which the Secretary of State should be consulted on whether to call in a planning application. It includes new criteria in respect of development that threatens a world heritage site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para25"><a name="09042944000342">Let me turn to the second point, which is guidance. I draw the attention of hon. Members present to several items of guidance that planners should pay heed to when they receive an application to build tall. The first is planning policy statement 1, on delivering sustainable development. The guidance is very firm that any proposal to construct a tall building should be evaluated in the light of the general design and planning principles set out in PPS1. Paragraph 34 of the statement makes it very clear that</p>
<a name="90429h0009.htm_brev7"><a name="09042944000416"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Design which is inappropriate in its context, or which fails to take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area and the way it functions, should not be accepted.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para26"><a name="09042944000343">That key test applies to all development proposals, including tall buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para27"><a name="09042944000344">The second item is &#147;Guidance on tall buildings&#148;. The Government strongly endorse the messages in the revised guidance, which the Commission for Architecture and   <br>

<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>29 Apr 2009 : Column 314WH</b><br>
the Built Environment and English Heritage issued together in 2007, called &#147;Guidance on tall buildings&#148;. The guidance should be given serious and careful attention by all those designing tall buildings and considering their location. It is a vital complement to national planning guidance, and is likely to be an important&#151;I stress the word important&#151;material consideration for local planning authorities or planning inspectors in cases that involve tall buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para28"><a name="09042944000345">My hon. Friend may wish to note that the Secretary of State has always referred to that guidance in determining recent called-in proposals for tall buildings.</p>

<p><a name="st_52"><a name="09042944000346"><a name="90429h0009.htm_spnew1"><a name="09042944000502"><b>Mr. Mark Field:</b>
 The Minister has touched on world heritage sites, which have great relevance here in central London, particularly in relation to the Tower of London, the Palace of Westminster and, maybe in future years, either the Battersea power station or the new US embassy, which will be in the constituency of the hon. Member for Battersea. UNESCO has expressed some grave concerns that the Government need to strengthen protection. Does the Minister agree that strengthened policy protection for our world heritage sites, particularly here in central London, could help constrain to the proliferation of tall buildings?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, who has raised a valid point. Time is against me, but I want to emphasise how much value I give to world heritage sites and protected views. I am aware that the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea does not have a protected view or a world heritage site yet, and it is crossed only by one protected view corridor, which is very important in considering tall buildings.</p>

 I seek an assurance from the Minister. I appreciate the importance of world heritage sites in planning. But there are many areas&#151;Clapham junction being a good example&#151;which have a Victorian town centre that is not historic, but nevertheless has a coherence and is loved by people who live in it. It would be just as badly affected by an inappropriate tower block as a world heritage site.

 Mr. Benton, this is my first time that I have served under your chairmanship, and a great pleasure it is, too. I thank the Speaker for selecting this subject for debate and the Minister, who has a busy diary, for spending time to come to answer to this Adjournment debate. I intend to draw attention to the need for a fairer share of London&#146;s policing resources to be allocated to the London borough command, ahead of the upcoming discussion on the resource allocation formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para30"><a name="09042944000353">It is of the gravest concern to me, and has been for quite a while, that young men have been killed through knife crime on our streets in Croydon. It is incumbent on me to speak up on that issue. I appreciate that these issues are devolved matters and that there is a great responsibility on the Greater London authority, the Mayor of London, the Metropolitan Police Authority, its finance committee and the chair of that committee, Councillor O&#146;Connell, to secure the appropriate resources in respect of the resource allocation formula, which can be difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para31"><a name="09042944000354">When I was a London assembly member, a great deal of progress was made via thorough consultation on the operation of the resource allocation formula, and it looked as though there would be an appropriate allocation. However, following the introduction of significant discretion for the commissioner, it is fair to say that the resource allocation formula could not come into effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para32"><a name="09042944000355">In a way, I am appealing to the Minister for advice as to how best Croydon&#146;s politicians can go about their business in terms of lobbying effectively on resource allocation. Perhaps politicians in the city of Westminster and the London borough of Wandsworth are more effective in terms of lobbying for resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para33"><a name="09042944000356">There is certainly no discrimination of any kind against Croydon&#151;not in any organised way. However, we see a trend in terms of the funding provided for the council through Government grants. A London government quite reasonably puts an emphasis on resourcing for east London in the context of the Olympics and social deprivation issues. It quite reasonably puts an emphasis on the requirements of central London through the discretionary business rate that will resource Crossrail. In Croydon, our hospital is going through a proposed downgrading, with the acute stroke provision being transferred elsewhere, so it is important for us to be able to lobby effectively for resources in Croydon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="90429h0009.htm_para34"><a name="09042944000357">It is important to recognise that, since 1997, and particularly since the introduction of the GLA, there has been a significant investment of resources in policing in London, with a transformation in the number of police officers in the Metropolitan Police Service and on our streets&#151;I am thinking of the organisation of policing and the operation of police community support officers. In Croydon, we are fortunate to operate under an acting borough commander, Adrian Roberts, who is committed to Croydon as part of his job. He operates in such a way as to make the best use of resources. We also benefit from the fact that the borough commander works well with Croydon council and the three safer transport scheme teams that are now in place. Croydon is one of the first boroughs to roll out diamond districts.</p>

Sometimes, it is important for me as a representative of Croydon to emphasise how much it has changed. I illustrate that change by mentioning the fact that we used to have two very safe Conservative seats in the north of the borough, where Jack Weatherill and the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) were Members. We now have a situation where the right hon. Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks) sits in the safest Labour seat in London. Although I am sure that a great deal of that is down to the excellence of the Member of Parliament for Croydon, North, it is also down, to a certain extent, to demographic change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para1"><a name="09042944000359">There is dynamic demographic change in Croydon and there are real issues as to whether the formulae, with regard both to policing and to Croydon council&#146;s financing, take full account of our actual population. Doctors&#146; registrations suggest that our population is 40,000 higher than that recognised within normal granting of moneys to Croydon. Therefore, real stress falls on public services and policing is no exception.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para2"><a name="09042944000360">There are also issues to do with the challenge that the police service faces in policing our borough. Peter Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said of Fairfield, the ward which contains Croydon town centre:</p>
<a name="90429h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="09042944000417"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If you look at the information, Fairfield sounds to me that it&#146;s not the sort of ward where officers should go out on their own. If I were a local police superintendent I would say that officers should go out in pairs.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para3"><a name="09042944000361">He added:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para4"><a name="09042944000362">Croydon, most definitely, has significant challenges. During this Parliament, there have been 10 knife killings in Croydon. I have certainly found it very sad to visit mothers of sons who have died. There was a great deal of publicity about the very sad case of Mr. Abbey, who was knifed to death at a bus stop on the way to Mayday university hospital to see his newborn child for the first time. There was also the very sad case of the son of a Kurdish family, who was murdered over a chocolate wrapper being thrown into a car. Those are all very sad and tragic cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para5"><a name="09042944000363">That there is a challenge for Croydon policing can be seen in the fact that, although crime is falling as a whole in the Metropolitan police area, in Croydon, crime has gone up. Overall, there were 18,000 fewer offences in London between 2007 and 2008. However, in Croydon there was a 7.4 per cent. increase in crimes committed, going up from 30,537 to 32,805. Burglary in particular in the last six months has had a sharp upturn, with more than 300 reported offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para6"><a name="09042944000364">Only in the last week, I have received correspondence from constituents. As an example of the types of stresses and strains that the police service has to deal with, one Croydon resident wrote to me saying:</p>

One of the difficulties&#151;it is not just about policing by the Metropolitan Police Service; it is also about proper care and attention by Croydon council&#151;is that over the years we have had far fewer park wardens. In fact, we only have 19 park wardens to police the 124 open spaces that we have. I am grateful to Aline Nassif of the <i>Croydon Advertise</i><i>r </i>for<i></i>revealing that through a freedom of information request with the <i>Croydon Advertiser</i> last week.</p>

It essentially took 24 hours. Jenny Winstanley says:</p>

It is encouraging that, when extra police resources are provided, real progress is made. I am grateful for the way in which resources have been found corporately for Croydon borough command over the past few months in Operation Safe for All. That operation has had a real effect on the amount of crime, with 101 fewer victims of knife crime, 15 fewer victims of youth violence, 28 fewer victims of gun crime and 271 fewer victims of robbery. That is an impressive story of the effectiveness and impact of the police service. However, we have problems in the town that are having a real effect on the economic performance of Croydon.</p>

A major retailer tells me that people in the A and B classes&#151;people with money&#151;are reluctant to shop at our main department stores. I have heard a report that, after incidents in the centre of Croydon, typically occurring around 3.30 pm or 4 pm, when regular fights between teenagers take place, there is a significant downturn in business.

have a mixture of police officers. More officers must be provided in the business improvement district to ensure that the whole of our town centre is within eyesight of officers of one sort or another. I am not saying that all those officers should necessarily be in a police-type uniform. The experience of business improvement districts, particularly in the United States, shows that a non-confrontational style of uniform is often positive in policing younger people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para19"><a name="09042944000378">When I talk at schools, or when students come here to look around the Houses of Parliament and I meet them afterwards, I notice that young people sometimes feel unhappy about the nature of policing. Policing has to be consensual&#151;there has to be support from young people&#151;but sometimes they feel victimised and sometimes a good combination of police officers and other types of policing would be more appropriate. I therefore hope that there will be an emphasis on the local authority rebalancing its priorities to secure the resources needed for that type of policing. Only then will people have confidence to return to Croydon town centre. If that happens, we will see a return on the investment on extra policing through an improvement in business for our local retailers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para20"><a name="09042944000379">Most important, I earnestly want to emphasise the importance of Croydon securing its fair share of resources. I will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s advice on the best way to lobby for that change.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) not only on securing the debate, but on the measured way in which he stated his case. I am happy to join him in recognising the excellent work the police do to tackle crime and protect our communities, including his own, often in challenging and difficult circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para21"><a name="09042944000381">It is only right that local decisions on police deployment are made locally by the commissioner and the borough commander. The Metropolitan police are relatively well resourced, with 31,109 officers in September 2008, which is 4,432 more than in March 1997. That is an increase of 16.6 per cent., which is significantly higher than the overall increase of 11.7 per cent. for England and Wales. The Metropolitan police are also supported by 4,200 police community support officers and 13,697 police staff, who of course play an important role, often releasing police officers for front-line service.</p>

I know that he sought assurances about the commitment to maximise the police presence on the streets of Croydon. He mentioned the beginning of Operation Safe for All last year in Croydon, where there has been sustained investment in resources in the form of corporate assets from across the Metropolitan Police Service. That has made a major contribution to reductions in knife crime, which I will return to shortly, and youth violence. As he knows, Croydon has also benefited from the addition of three safer transport teams to police the transport hubs. The improvement in resources, which he was gracious enough to recognise, is evident, and I understand from the commissioner that, as of 31 March 2009, the Croydon operational command  <br>

unit has 697 officers, which is 147&#151;28 per cent.&#151;more than in March 2001. There are also 176 police community support officers.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s speech, I was left with the impression that, although he was speaking in a debate in this place, his voice was reaching out to others beyond this Chamber. I understand why he might do that. He is a long-standing advocate for his constituents on policing matters and he has sought our advice on how he can further his campaign. I am sure that he acknowledges to some extent our limitations, particularly in operational matters. He is very good at mobilising his constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para24"><a name="09042944000384">We are, of course, removing all the top-down targets for the police service after a request from the service and as a result of a more mature attitude between central Government and police force areas. However, we will leave one target in place: the confidence target, by which the police service is measured by local residents after they engage with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para25"><a name="09042944000385">On resources and the outcome of applications for them, I am sure that police forces are keen to ensure that the necessary resources are in place and used&#151;and, more important, used on the priorities that local residents determine. There is a Metropolitan police allocation formula, which is kept under review by the Metropolitan Police Authority and the commissioner, but as the hon. Gentleman will have expected me to say, the actual resource allocation formula applied to Croydon and other London boroughs is a matter for the commissioner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para26"><a name="09042944000386">The Metropolitan police allocation formula is not dissimilar to the overall Home Office police funding formula, but it is subject to allocation depending on the circumstances pertaining to each borough in the Metropolitan police area. It is a matter not merely of counting up the number of officers and staff, important though that is, but of assessing how their time is being used. Good deployment means that officers and staff are in the right place at the right time to deliver help when the public most need it. Moreover, it means that they can deliver the less visible parts of policing that are vital for police protection. There is scope for the police service, including the Metropolitan police, critically to review both the mix and the roles of the work force. I am sure that the commissioner continues to review the work force mix, so that it is best configured to provide the highest quality of service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para27"><a name="09042944000387">I will return later to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points about the business community, which is of particular interest to me. First, let me say that in the current economic climate, there should be a relentless focus on value for money, because it is more important than ever to get good value for money from our public services. I am talking now about sustaining efficiency and productivity improvements that have already been delivered, and ensuring that resources are effectively targeted at improving front-line services and delivering the best possible service to the public. That means even greater scrutiny by the Metropolitan Police Authority in assessing performance and ensuring that the commissioner is making the best possible use of his most valuable resource which, at the end of the day, is his work force.</p>

is a permanent and very welcome improvement in the way in which policing is delivered locally, not least because it is designed to ensure that the service is citizen-focused. That means being more responsive and more locally accountable than it has been in the past, and that is a key way of ensuring that public confidence in the police improves. The policing pledge, which will be implemented in all forces in England and Wales, including the Metropolitan police, by the end of 2008 signals our commitment to make further progress in that regard. It requires local forces to arrange regular public meetings at least once a month to agree priorities and ensure that they are then addressed. I am talking about how resources are directed and about ensuring that the necessary resources are there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para29"><a name="09042944000389">The hon. Gentleman referred to crime statistics. I do not particularly want to get into a Dutch auction around statistics, but just in case anyone was left with the impression that crime has continued to rise in Croydon and is now rising irretrievably&#151; particularly against the backdrop of an economic downturn&#151;I will say that there is no inevitability about rising crime in an economic downturn, partly because of the changes that we have put in place. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is looking at more recent figures. None the less, my figures show that overall, crime in Croydon has continued to fall. In mentioning burglary, he rightly identified one of the indicators about which we are particularly concerned. When we look at recorded crime statistics in Croydon, we see a slight increase in domestic burglary. I say that because sometimes there is a difference between the British crime survey figures and recorded police crime. However, that is the only indicator that shows an increase from 2006-07 to 2007-08 . That is why the Home Secretary recently announced a burglary initiative.</p>

Gentleman mentioned. I chair meetings with retailers, and we have recently decided to increase the number of such meetings so that we can focus particularly on their priorities. I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about their concerns. One of the important things we have done is started to improve the links between local businesses and their local crime reduction partnerships. In many cases, businesses do not know what crime reduction partnerships do or how to get in contact with them. Although it is very important that the police service regularly communicates with the community and addresses its concerns, it must acknowledge that the business community is an important part of the wider community. Retailers, who might be most concerned about acquisitive crime such as shoplifting and theft, must be at the forefront of their work, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is a priority for us. We hope to say something shortly about what more we can do to help that sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="90429h0010.htm_para31"><a name="09042944000391">The hon. Gentleman mentioned knife crime, and I want to say something about that before I conclude my remarks. He will know that, for the past year, we have run the tackling knives action programme, Launched in June 2008, the programme involves tough enforcement action together with support for parents and enhanced partnership working with schools and hospitals. The Metropolitan police service is one of the 14 forces now taking part in the second stage of that programme.</p>

I hesitate, because I hate using such a word when young people are still using knives to stab each other, sometimes fatally. Therefore, saying that there has been &#147;success&#148; might give the wrong impression, but I think that progress is being made in Croydon, with a 17 per cent. reduction in the victims of knife crime in 2008-09. That does not mean that we are complacent in any way, shape or form, which is why the Government have recently announced that the programme will continue for a further year, with an extra &#163;5 million to tackle knife crime and increase targeted police action aimed at the minority of young people who commit serious violence.</p>

We are confident that many of the long-term measures in place, including safer neighbourhood teams, police community support officers and many of the other things that I have mentioned, will bear down on crime and on some of the problems that the hon.
