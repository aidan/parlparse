<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew0"><B> Mr. Peter Viggers  (Gosport):</B> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. As there has been some uncertainty, can you confirm that contributions to the debate should be made from a standing position and that the switches on the microphones are inoperative because the microphones are operated automatically, so we do not need to touch them?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew1"><B> Mr. Deputy Speaker </B> 
: I can confirm that and I hope that everything will work smoothly. Hon. Members should rise in their place, as usual, and they will be heard by all who need to hear them.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew2"><B> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West):</B> 
 It is a privilege to be making history by introducing the first debate in this new parallel Chamber. It is a pleasure to see that we have already established a new tradition of hon. Members sitting where they please and not in accordance with their political party.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para1">It is a particular pleasure to me, as a former member of the Modernisation Committee and a signatory to the report that recommended the parallel Chamber, to have been chosen to speak in the first debate. It is fitting that my constituency of Milton Keynes is to be associated for ever with innovation and modernisation.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para2">The subject of our debate is Palestinian refugees. The debate is timely because the issue is one of the most difficult to be resolved during the current final status negotiations in the middle east peace process. Both sides to the negotiations started from heavily entrenched positions. The Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, has said that there can be no return of the refugees, but neither President Arafat nor any other Palestinian leader would be allowed to sign away the Palestinian right to return, given that 70 per cent. of Palestinians are refugees.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para3">The refugee problem is not minor. Palestinians comprise the largest single group of refugees in the world, and one of the oldest. There are 3.6 million Palestinian refugees registered with the United Nations, a figure that has grown from 914,000 in 1950 when the United Nations Relief and Works Agency was established. That population is growing by 3 per cent. a year. Under UNRWA's operational definition,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Palestinian refugees are persons whose normal place of residence was Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who lost their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict, and who took refuge in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Jordanian-ruled West Bank or the Egyptian-administered Gaza Strip."
<P>
</UL></FONT>



<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 2WH</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
Contrary to the Israeli position, UNRWA also
<P>
<BR>
"covers the descendants of persons who became refugees in 1948."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h01_para4">In addition to registered refugees, an estimated 1 million other Palestinians are unregistered refugees. That includes the 850,000 who represent those displaced in 1967 and their descendants. The number has been augmented by the actions of the Israeli Government in confiscating the identity cards of Palestinian Jerusalemites, effectively deporting them. More than 2,000 Palestinians were deported in that way between 1996 and 1998 alone. In all, 70 per cent. of Palestinians remain in exile against their will.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para5">Most of the refugees are in the immediate area of Palestine. According to UNRWA, one third of registered Palestinian refugees--around 1.1 million--live in 59 recognised refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the west bank and Gaza. The majority of the remainder live in and around the cities of the area. For example, the majority of Palestinian refugees from west Jerusalem still live within 20 miles of their stolen property. That demonstrates the way in which the refugee problem is tied up with the question of Jerusalem and its borders.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para6">There are even refugees living inside Israel. They are internal refugees who fled from their villages and found themselves still within the boundaries of the Jewish state after the cessation of hostilities. Today, they make up a large proportion of the 120,000-strong population of the so-called unrecognised villages--unrecognised in that, although the villages are within Israel, most of them are denied access to municipal services, including running water, electricity, education and health services. It is important that the fate of the internal refugees is not ignored, and that their rights are recognised.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para7">What are the rights of the refugees? International law is clear. The refugees are entitled to return to their homes and entitled to compensation. UN resolution 194, which has been reaffirmed 110 times since 1948, and which even the United States supported in 1993, states clearly in relation to the Palestinians:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the General Assembly resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of, or damage to, property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the governments or authorities responsible."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h01_para8">Further legal support is given through article XIII of the universal declaration of human rights, through the convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, in which articles 2 and 5d guarantee the right of refugees to return, and through the international covenant on civil and political rights. The right of private ownership--most of the refugees owned land or other property--applies regardless of changes in sovereignty or nationality, and cannot be negotiated away by any government.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para9">Some have sought to suggest that the refugees have forgone their rights, alleging that they left voluntarily in 1948 at the behest of surrounding Arab countries. However, there is a considerable body of evidence, now backed up by Israeli historians such as Benny Morris, Illan Pappe and others, that shows that there was a concerted and deliberate effort to expel Palestinians. Massacres such as that at Deir Yassin are well <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 3WH</B></P>
documented. Of the 726,000 refugees in 1948, 52 per cent. had been expelled or fled before the Arab forces entered Palestine in May 1948, and 213 villages and towns including Jaffa, Tiberias, Safad, Beisan and Acre had been forcibly depopulated.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para10">Many of the areas attacked by Jewish forces before May 1948 were outside the area proposed under partition for the Jewish state. Why people fled is, in any case, irrelevant. As in Kosovo and Chechnya today, people flee any theatre of war. As far as international law is concerned, it matters not why a person has left. That person cannot be denied the right to return to his or her home. Legally, the Palestinians have a right of return that cannot be denied.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para11">However, anyone who has visited Palestinian refugee camps and spoken to refugees cannot be in any doubt about their strong and abiding desire to return. A couple of years ago, in a refugee camp in Gaza, I spoke to a woman who lived with her family of four other adults and six grandchildren in five rooms. She had come from Hebron in 1948, still regarded Hebron as her home and longed to return. In the camps, people retain their community links with refugees from the same village or town. Marriages are arranged within those extended village communities, re-creating within the camps a network of virtual Palestinian villages. Over and over again, people show the key to their house, or the title deeds to their property in Palestine. The children, although born in Syria or Jordan, describe in loving detail the topography of family homes that they have never seen--family homes now expropriated and lived in by others.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para12">The sense of injustice among refugees is fuelled by the appalling conditions in which many live. Most camps are desperately overcrowded, with extended families living in breeze-block dwellings that are far too small and often do not have proper sewerage or clean water. In Beach camp in the Gaza strip, more than 71,000 Palestinian refugees live in three quarters of a square kilometre. Children in the camps have nowhere to play but in the sand; by the age of four, 85 per cent. are infected with roundworm. In schools, double--or even treble--shifts for teachers and pupils are the norm. Unemployment is rife, and the refugees, unlike Gazan residents with Palestinian citizenship, cannot legally travel into Israel to seek employment.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para13">The refugees in Lebanon have suffered especially badly. Many were killed during the civil war in Lebanon, and others continue to live there under frequent Israeli bombardment. The refugees' presence in Lebanon is unwelcome to the Lebanese, who are concerned about the destabilising effect that they have had, and may continue to have, on the complex communal politics of Lebanon. In Syria, and especially in Jordan, the refugees' situation is better, but their desire to return home is still strong.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para14">The refugees' right to return is incontrovertible, and the rights of the 1967 refugees, at least, were recognised by Israel in the Oslo agreement. However, that raises the question whether it is feasible for them to return. Is there sufficient land? Currently, more than 80 per cent. of the Jewish population live in 15 per cent. of Israel. The remainder, including most of the extreme religious settler groups, live on relatively large areas of rural land <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 4WH</B></P>
and the population density is very low. Whereas Palestinian refugees in the Gaza strip live on land with a population of 4,000 people per square kilometre, their kibbutz neighbours across the fence enjoy density levels of three people per square kilometre--that is, more than 1,000 times fewer people per square kilometre.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para15">Israel is used to accommodating large numbers of immigrants. During the 1990s, the number of Jewish immigrants from Russia alone roughly equalled the total number of refugees in the Gaza strip and Lebanon. Since the beginning of the waves of immigration from the former Soviet Union in 1989, more than 770,000 immigrants have emigrated from there to Israel out of a total of more than 900,000 during that period. That process of immigration to Israel is continuing. Furthermore, the Israeli law of return allows for the immigration of non-Jews related by marriage or birth, including grandchildren. No one in Israel has suggested that there was not enough room to accommodate those people, yet it is now suggested that the land cannot accommodate returning Palestinians.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para16">If Israel attempts to deny the right of return of refugees from Jaffa, Nazareth or Galilee to their homes in Israel, it presumably expects them to go to the future Palestinian state. However, the current Palestinian-controlled areas are already densely populated. If a future Palestinian state is to become the home of the refugees, it should include at least the entire west bank and Gaza strip--that is, 23 per cent. of what was formerly mandate Palestine. The best offer so far, which came from the left of the governing Israeli Labour party, would mean that only 70 per cent. of the west bank was in Palestinian hands--that is, 16 per cent. of what was formerly Palestine.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para17">The issues of land, refugees, Jewish settlements and Jerusalem are being negotiated bilaterally between Israel and the Palestine National Authority. However, those negotiating partners are very unequal in terms of power, and the details of the final agreement should also concern us in the United Kingdom. Apart from the fact that we have historic links with Israel and Palestine, we will, as members of the European Union, be expected--with the United States of America--to fund whatever agreement is made. The EU is already the largest donor of development aid to the Palestinian authority. We have an interest in ensuring that any agreement is sustainable.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para18">If the refugee issue remains unresolved, it will become a time bomb. Millions of people, over 50 per cent. of whom are children, will lose all hope of ever being able to escape from the appalling conditions of the camps. That will surely be a fertile breeding ground for extremism, spawning even greater problems in the years to come. That cannot be in our interest, or in Israel's interest.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para19">The threat to Israel does not lie in a Palestinian right of return. The far greater threat lies in not allowing a right of return, and not acknowledging the injustice that befell the refugees. President Clinton said in July:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I would like it if the Palestinian people felt free and were more free to live wherever they like, wherever they want to live."

Without a right of return, that will not be realised.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h01_para20">I hope that the Minister will today reconfirm the British Government's view on the right of return and compensation of Palestinian refugees under <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 5WH</B></P>
international law, including UN General Assembly resolution 194. Compensation for damage or loss of property and for the anguish of the past 51 years must, in justice, be provided. If a refugee chooses not to return, compensation for land must also be included. Recognition of the refugees' rights must not be made contingent on the recognition of the rights of others. Just as the payment of compensation by Germany for the property of Jewish victims of the Nazis cannot and should not be made contingent on Israel's paying compensation to the Palestinians, the Palestinians' right to compensation cannot be made contingent on payments to Jews who fled from other Arab countries.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para21">Who should fund the compensation, and the resettlement costs of those refugees who choose to return? Clearly, Israel should contribute, as it has benefited, over the years, from the confiscated property and land. For example, the land that Israel confiscated and leased to kibbutzim--a quarter of the state of Israel, on which fewer than 3 per cent. of Israelis live--is about to be privatised. Its value is estimated at between $50 billion and $60 billion, which could fund some of the compensation.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para22">The international community also has a responsibility, and I should like to ask the Minister whether the Government are pressing that point in the European Union and with the United States of America. There is a real window of opportunity for peace in the middle east. People of good faith in the Israeli Government and the Palestine National Authority genuinely want a solution that recognises the rights of both peoples to security and prosperity.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para23">The refugees cannot be excluded or bought off by a lump sum of compensation to a Government. We have just fought a war to ensure that the Kosovan refugees could return to their homes, and the Palestinian refugees could reasonably ask why their right to return home appears to be less important. A cynic would say that the lack of mass television coverage of the Palestinian exodus in 1948 is the reason.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para24">I hope that the British Government will ensure that the injustice done to the Palestinians 51 years ago is finally recognised and made good, so that we can start the next millennium with a real and sustainable peace for Israelis and Palestinians. The land that they share is, after all, where the event that marked the start of the first millennium took place.

<a name="91130h01_spnew3"><B> Mr. Richard Burden  (Birmingham, Northfield):</B> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) not only on securing the first debate in this welcome modernisation initiative but on her ingenuity in linking her constituency with such innovation, which I am sure that her constituents will appreciate.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para25">The change of Government in Israel has been welcome. The peace process, which was stalled for so long under the previous Government of Israel, is on track once again. It has been relaunched on the principle that always underlay it--land for peace. Inevitably, when international attention is focused on that process, the most commonly discussed issues are the withdrawal from occupied land, security for Israel and the right of <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 6WH</B></P>
the Palestinian people to self-determination in their own land. All those factors are important; indeed, they are vital to the success of any peace process.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para26">However, the Oslo process and countless United Nations resolutions on events in the middle east focus on other issues that must also be addressed if we are to see lasting peace there. That is why I particularly welcome this debate. At the centre of those issues is the question of Palestinian refugees. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West has already talked about United Nations resolution 194, the right of Palestinians to return and their right to compensation. Since that resolution was made, a number of others have raised similar points.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para27">My hon. Friend rightly referred to the scale of the problem, which exists to this day. More than 1 million people still live in 59 camps scattered throughout the west bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. They are overcrowded, neglected and marginalised, and half the refugees are children, who are growing up with an uncertain future. Education and health services in the camps are poor. There is insufficient space for children to play, and many leave school early to find work to help support their families. In the Nahr El Bared camp, in Lebanon, more than 26,000 refugees live within 1.9 square kilometres. In the Balata refugee camp, on the west bank, there are just four UNRWA schools for 3,431 schoolchildren.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para28">A couple of weeks ago, I tabled a question to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development on water resources in the west bank and Gaza. Her answer was most revealing. She said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Most water is used for irrigation"

in that area. However,
<P>
<BR>
"A United Nations report from 1990 indicated that the total annual capita consumption for Palestinians in the West Bank was 139 cubic metres, compared to that for settlers of 1,143 cubic metres. Figures for Gaza were 172 cubic metres for Palestinians and 2,326 cubic metres for settlers. Annual per capita consumption in Israel was 411 cubic metres."--[<i>Official Report, </i>10 November 1999; Vol. 337, c. <i>554.</i>]

That graphically illustrates what life is like for all Palestinians on the west bank and Gaza, not just refugees, but it is clear that life is worse for those who live in the camps.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h01_para29">Last week, I was fortunate enough to host an exhibition, called Eye to Eye, which was sponsored by the Save the Children Fund, and which took place in the Upper Waiting Hall in this place. That exhibition enables Palestinian children to tell their own story by capturing on film everyday life in the camps. An interactive web site based on their images and stories provides a channel of communication between young Palestinians and children in other countries. During the coming months, the exhibition will tour the middle east and this country; I believe that it will visit Cairo next month, followed by various cities in the UK. I shall place on record the web site address, which is www.savethechildren.org.uk/eyetoeye/.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para30">Let us hope that the exhibition will allow more people to see the circumstances in which Palestinian refugees live, and thereby bring a sense of perspective. It is perhaps all too easy to see the middle east solely in geopolitical terms--as a region dominated by the question of what negotiations are under way and what <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 7WH</B></P>
agreements have been reached or are under discussion. In terms of finding a solution to the problem, that is right and understandable. Nevertheless, we should not lose sight of the fact that the heart of the problem affects real people with real lives here and now.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para31">I first became interested in the situation of the Palestinians in the 1970s. I was then at university and I used to talk to Palestinian students, many of whom came from refugee families. They would talk about what happened to their parents; the older ones would speak about what they could remember of Palestine before 1948. Palestinian students talk now not only of what happened to their parents, but of what happened to their grandparents--the situation has continued for that long. The same families have experienced displacement not just once, but several times.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para32">The principle of the right to return, which my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West mentioned, and the issue of compensation are important. It is also important that not only the international community but Israel comes to terms with what happened in 1948 and with the question of the Palestinian refugees. For Israel to do so would not be to deny the fact that many Israelis have suffered over the past 51 years or that Israeli families have lost loved ones. However, if Israel is to have a secure future, it must come to terms with its past--the bad bits as well as the good. Finding a solution to the plight of Palestinian refugees is an essential part of that process. The existence of Palestinian refugees, and the continuing denial of their rights, is an enduring embodiment of what has gone wrong. It behoves everyone in the international community to do what we can to put that situation right.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para33">Last week, there was a lobby of this place about the Palestinian refugees. I chaired one of the meetings connected with that lobby, at which there was much discussion about initiatives that could be taken. A woman stood up and said that talk was all very well--that there was much talk in the international community and in the House--but that she came from a refugee Palestinian family and that she wanted to know what was going to be done. No easy solution can be magicked out of the air or implemented tomorrow, but after 51 years of the problem we must take on board the fact that we are being asked bluntly what we will do.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para34">My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West made a valid point that, when looking at the rights of refugees and at respect for international law and for United Nations resolutions, the rights of Palestinian refugees should be no less precious to us than the rights of the East Timorese or of those from Kosovo. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reassure us that the Government stand by what has been stated before about the rights of Palestinian refugees to return and to receive compensation, and that Britain will play an active role in trying to achieve that.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para35">We can contribute to that process on our different levels. I hope that we are doing so by holding this debate and that the Eye to Eye exhibition, which was launched in this place last week and which will tour, will also contribute.
<P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 8WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91130h01_para36">I shall conclude with a quotation from Nadir, from the Nahr El Bared refugee camp in Lebanon, whose words should be heard by us all--they sum up the problem and explain why we must listen. She said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No one sees like our children's eyes can see--the life, school, streets--all of this our children show us through their photographs. Is there anyone in the world who understands what our children want to say?"

It is time for the world to understand what the Palestinian children are saying, to respond and to ensure that Palestinians have a right to return to their homelands.

 I, too, welcome the new Chamber. It is a grown-up place as, so far, the boys have demonstrated. I hope that it will continue to be so.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para37">I congratulate the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) on securing the debate. It coincides with the start of a momentous year for the middle east peace process, which, in the past 50 years, has raised hopes over and over again, only for those hopes to be dashed. It was estimated at the beginning of the process that there were 700,000 Palestinian refugees; the registered number now exceeds 3.6 million and there is a diaspora of 5 million Palestinians around the world. A huge number of people want a homeland in the same way as the Jews wanted, and were granted, a homeland in 1948. The creation of the state of Israel left a running sore of suffering and deprivation in the middle east which, of all people in the world, the Jews and the state of Israel must recognise.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para38">Palestinian refugees have a right to return to their homeland. As early as 1917, the Balfour declaration stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it being understood that nothing be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine".

Since then, countless resolutions and declarations from the League of Nations, the British Government and the United Nations have upheld the human right declared in 1949 that
<P>
<BR>
"everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own and to return to his country"--

everyone, it seems, except the Palestinians, who are denied that right. Israel must be reminded of its legal and unfulfilled obligations. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) rightly pointed out, it is in Israel's interests to do so.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h01_para39">Many of us were lobbied last week by supporters of Palestine who were anxious to remind us of the conditions that have been endured by Palestinians for 30 years since the six-day war. They suffer socially and economically, as the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West explained. Draconian Israeli security checks and the requirement for travel permits deny them access to employment, education and health care. We have heard about the terrible living conditions in which a quarter to a third of Palestinians receive no running water. It is interesting to note that 3 million people in Palestine consume a sixth of the total amount of water that is used by 6 million Israelis. That does not add up. The infrastructure has been sadly neglected by Israel.
<P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 9WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91130h01_para40">The United Nations Relief and Works Agency tries to provide basic health, education and social services to Palestinian refugees. The Department for International Development has just produced a pamphlet on the workings of UNRWA, which I have before me, and has pledged to improve the delivery and the amount of relief. However, despite the United Kingdom's &#163;7 million pledge to UNRWA in 1998, the agency remains severely underfunded. What plans do the Government have to improve matters? The international community must increase its contributions and UNRWA must be made more efficient.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para41">Economically, the dice is loaded against the Palestinians. For example, orange juice that is produced in the illegal settlements of Palestine is exported and labelled "Product of Israel", in violation of international agreements that aim to build up the Palestinian economy and encourage stability. Will the Minister ensure that that matter is raised at the World Trade Organisation negotiations in Seattle? In the eyes of the European Union, Israeli settlements in Palestine are illegal. Therefore, are not their products also illegal? Will the Minister remind Israel of the conditions that relate to the rules of origin for exports?
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para42">The refugees are the main subject of our debate, but we must remember the outstanding problems that face Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat in the coming months. The problem of the settlements has been discussed many times in the House. After the six-day war, UN Security Council resolution 242 called for the exchange of land for peace, and the Oslo accord is based on that concept. Of the 144 illegal Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, 42 are to be dismantled, which is good news. All the time, however, more tenders are being approved by the Israeli Government within the existing settlements--more under Mr. Barak than even Mr. Netanyahu approved. If Palestine is to be granted secure territory, are our Government content to see it dotted all over the Israeli-held settlements?
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para43">What is the Minister's view on Jerusalem? Some 200,000 Palestinians live in east Jerusalem; how can they accept that Israel should have sovereignty over the city? Does he accept that a Palestine mini-state, if created, will never be able to accommodate the number of refugees who are likely to want to return? Will he support the 1967 borders for Palestine? If not, will he tell us how the Government and the EU propose to help the refugees remaining outside Palestine, generations of whom have been born and brought up in the camps? Are they condemned for ever to live in a world of poverty and deprivation, surrounded by the ever-increasing affluence of the Israelis? Their rights must not be ignored.

community, of which we all approved. However, the United Kingdom has a duty to give the Palestinians their human rights, too. We must welcome the momentum given to the middle east peace process by President Clinton and Messrs Barak and Arafat--and, indeed, the recent meeting between my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell) and Mr. Arafat--but I urge the Government to play a more prominent role in the resolution of the refugee problem and not always to let the USA take the lead. I urge the Government, as the former mandatory power in Palestine, to put as much effort into this problem as they have put into the Northern Ireland peace process, and to give the Palestinian refugees their homeland.

<a name="91130h01_spnew6"><B> Mr. John Austin  </B> 
(Erith and Thamesmead): Before I commence, I draw attention to an entry in the Register of Members' Interests relating to a visit to Jordan earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para46">I first visited Palestine before the Oslo accord in 1993, together with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden). I found there a general despair that there could ever be peace, an acceptable solution for the refugees, or any agreement on Jerusalem. We visited the refugee camps in Gaza and the west bank.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para47">Before I went, my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) said that nothing could prepare me for that visit. He was absolutely right. I have seen refugee camps elsewhere in the world, but bad as they were, they always conveyed a sense of being temporary. Other refugee camps were poor and unhealthy; conditions were often squalid and there was malnutrition, suffering and misery, but they were essentially temporary. In Gaza, I was confronted with the fact that the camps had existed there for more than 40 years, as other hon. Members have said. They had an air of permanence, which led to the sense of despair and hopelessness.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para48">Suddenly, after we returned, there was Oslo--a ray of light. Arafat shook hands with Rabin, prisoners were to be released, there would be safe passage between the west bank and Gaza, and land for peace as outlined in the UN resolution was to become a reality. Of course, the return of refugees and the issue of Jerusalem were put on the back burner for the final status negotiations, but they were there. What was not accounted for was the election of Netanyahu, who began to renegotiate Oslo, reneging on what had been agreed by continuing the illegal settlement programme, ethnically cleansing Jerusalem and creating new facts on the ground. The final status talks, which should have commenced in April 1996 and conclude in April 1999, have only just begun. Three and a half years' delay--three and a half years of more settlements and new facts on the ground--have made any solution that is satisfactory to the Palestinians more difficult to achieve.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para49">The Palestinians' demands about refugees are simple and straightforward and are in accord with UN resolution 194, which involves the right either to return to the homes that they have lost or to receive compensation for that loss. The Israelis either regard refugees who are permanently settled outside Palestine as citizens where they are now refugees or hope that those refugees will be shipped out to countries that <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 11WH</B></P>
require an expanding labour force and encourage immigration. Even Iraq featured in speculation about a possible deal to bring Baghdad back into the international community. When the Minister replies, I hope that he will reassert the British Government's view of the right of Palestinians to return to their homeland.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para50">Perhaps the Israelis hope that, if they drag out the final status talks, there will be fewer refugees alive who remember 1948 and that the refugees' children will not have the same emotional ties to Palestine. If so, as other hon. Members said, the Israelis are sadly mistaken. They fail to understand the basic nature of Palestinian society and of Palestinian communities, which was eloquently described by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey).
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para51">It is not only the refugees and their children who must keep alive the memory of what happened 50 years ago. We must never forget. In the final years of this millennium, the Palestinians constitute the largest refugee population in the world. The Zionist plan Daled, which was the master plan for the conquest of Palestine, began the expulsion of the population from Palestine before the creation of the Israeli state, when the territory was still under the British mandate. In the massacres that followed, of which Deir Yassin is the most famous, thousands of Palestinian men, women and children were murdered, mosques were destroyed, homes and villages were burned, property was looted and women were raped. Those were war crimes. We should never forget that waging a war on a civilian population, expelling the inhabitants and looting and destroying property are all war crimes. There may be doubts about whether it is now possible to pursue those war criminals, but there should be no doubt about the right of those who were driven from their homes to return or to receive compensation. It may be relatively easy to calculate the material losses, but how does one put a cost on the loss of a homeland and 50 years of suffering and subjugation?
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para52">The Palestinian sense of family, community and village is enormously strong, and has continued throughout 50 years of exile. The grandchild of a 1948 refugee will still identify with his or her grandparents' village and be a part of that village's family and community. It is the Palestinian's moral right to return and, as other hon. Members said, they also have a legal right to do so. UN resolution 194 recognises the fact that none of the agreements that dispossessed them involved their participation or consent. That resolution has been reaffirmed by the UN practically every year since it was passed.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para53">We must not let the Israelis convince us that return is not feasible. The Israelis refer to abandoned villages, but those villages were not abandoned--their inhabitants were forced out. The villages remain in the memory of the refugees and are mentioned in thousands of well-documented title deeds, records and maps. Land that is now barren was once cultivated and could blossom again. Much of the Palestinian land remains empty and return would not result in the mass dislocation of Jewish immigrants, although some have alleged that it would. If, for example, the refugees in Lebanon were to return to their former home in Galilee, it would hardly affect the present Israelis--either Jews or Palestinians. <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 12WH</B></P>
The Palestinian refugees could return to their villages and fields, and peace would be restored to southern Lebanon and northern Israel.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para54">I first visited Gaza in 1993, and I visited it again in 1996 with my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain). At that time, we saw some benefits from Oslo. There was still no free movement of people or goods, and the Israelis controlled checkpoints and borders in the occupied territories and externally, but there were signs of regeneration, including the beginning of building. My hon. Friend will remember that the hotel in which we stayed was half built, and many of the storeys above our rooms were unfinished.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para55">I regret that we were unable to visit the camps during that visit because of the security situation following the Israeli assassination of Ayash, who was known as "The Engineer". I returned in 1998 and visited the camps to which hon. Members referred. The hotel in which the Minister and I had stayed had been finished, there were new homes and offices, and the airport had been built, but was not operating. When I visited the camps, nothing had changed since 1993. There was still degradation, water supplies were still toxic and children were still playing by open sewers. Refugees were packed in like sardines, as my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said, at 4,000 per square kilometre. They peered over the barbed wire to see their land to the east empty with between three and six people per square kilometre. Let no one say that there is no room for the Palestinian refugees to return.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para56">During the Minister's visit in 1996, the Palestinians outside the refugee camps were starved of water by the Israelis, denied access to markets, faced with prohibitive taxes and licence fees to move their goods, and prevented from moving them so that fruit and vegetables rotted on vehicles. He could see that, despite those adversities, the Palestinians of Gaza outside the refugee camps continued to produce high-quality agricultural products. If only they had equal access to water and freedom to transport their goods, the returning refugees could make the desert bloom again.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para57">Four generations of Palestinian refugees have been looked after by UNRWA. Its job has become increasingly difficult because of donor fatigue and its 59 refugee camps are still marked by overcrowded, squalid conditions that can only breed anger and resentment.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para58">In Gaza, life in the refugee camps has hardly improved since the Minister's visit in 1996. The deterioration in the Palestinian economy has struck particularly at refugees. The closures, which remain a massive burden on the Palestinian economy, are a major factor. Refugees were disproportionately dependent on work inside Israel, and unemployment has soared.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para59">In June this year, I visited the Beka'a camp in Jordan. The conditions there are relatively better for its 75,000 refugees than in the refugee camps of Lebanon and Gaza, but they are still pitiful. The conditions clearly moved the Prime Minister when he visited the camp. Unemployment was high and UNRWA officials were concerned about future funding levels because key services have been cut. Many Palestinians believe that UNRWA is being phased out as a prelude to ending the refugee issue while the refugees remain in exile.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para60">The Israeli position remains inflexible--no to return, no to Israel paying compensation, no to an historic apology. Israel expects the international community to <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 13WH</B></P>
pay for the settlement of refugees in Arab countries and that compensation should be dealt with as a lump sum to Governments, not to individual refugees to compensate them for their suffering and losses. It is vital that, in the months and years ahead, we ensure that UNRWA is fully maintained until a final solution of resettlement is achieved and a fund for compensation established.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para61">Israelis can never live in security and at peace with their neighbours or themselves while the dispossessed sit at their borders. A free and independent Palestine would be the best neighbour Israel could ever wish for. If real and lasting peace is to prevail in the middle east, the right of return must be guaranteed by the international community and must be implemented.

<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew9"><B> Dr. Brian Iddon  (Bolton, South-East):</B> 
 The United Nations recommended partition of Palestine on 29 November 1947 and the state of Israel was declared on 14 May 1948 on 11 per cent. of occupied Palestine land. However before signing the armistice agreement in 1949, 78 per cent. of Palestine had been occupied by the Israelis. During 1948, almost 1 million Palestinians were forced to flee from 531 well-documented localities in what the Palestinians now described as their Al Nakba. That large exodus of Palestinians can be associated with various Israeli military occupations. The words "cleansing" and "broom" were used in at least four reports by Israeli officials about those operations at that time. Some nasty things happened to the Palestinians, and they have been covered by other speakers.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para62">The estimated value of mobile and immobile property confiscated by the Israelis from the Palestinians at that time is &#163;743 million at 1948 prices. The Palestinians claim that the Israeli seizure of their land and property is probably the biggest planned and organised plunder in history, and it resulted in United Nations resolution 194 of 11 December 1948, which has been referred to often during the debate. Ironically, 50 years later, when Jews have received compensation from their German oppressors and are about to have some of their stolen wealth returned from Swiss banks, successive Israeli Prime Ministers have failed to accept this resolution. That was made obvious again last weekend, during an interview with Mr. Barak by Sir David Frost on "Breakfast with Frost".
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para63">The Israel Land Administration, among other organisations, has kept careful records of what was hitherto Palestinian land. Moreover, pre-1948 aerial maps exist that compare well with today's satellite mapping techniques. Not only are there questions of compensation, but, if the land-for-peace deal is to be meaningful, the Palestinians who previously lived on that land should be allowed to return. Mr. Barak ruled <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 14WH</B></P>
that out again on "Breakfast with Frost" last weekend. Even a phased partial return of refugees seems out of the question at the moment.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para64">While that view persists, can there ever be a lasting peace in the middle east? Let us hope that these are negotiating postures, rather than hard and fast views. It would be a nice gesture if the Israelis gave up one or more of their settlements on Palestinian land to allow at least some Palestinians to return to what was previously their land, perhaps in one of the less sensitive areas for Israeli security.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para65">More than 50 years after the Palestinian exodus, their numbers in exile have grown to more than 4 million. The figures vary according to which source one takes them from--those are Palestinian figures. The refugees are, as has been pointed out, scattered round the Arab world, but they are principally located in the Gaza strip, the west bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para66">There are 59 official camps administered by UNRWA around the Arab world, but two thirds of Palestinian refugees live outside them. Many refugees living in the camps, especially children, suffer from illnesses related to poor and damp accommodation, and from problems associated with their environment generally. Conditions in the camps on the west bank, the Gaza strip and Lebanon are among the worst, with open drainage channels for waste water, open sewage outlets and garbage dumps putting everyone's health at serious risk. I have seen the conditions at Jabalia camp on the Gaza strip. Its population density is among the highest in the world. Houses are primitive and overcrowded, separated by alleyways so narrow that it is impossible to transport large goods, including coffins, which have to be carried over the fragile corrugated roofs of people's homes.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para67">Eighty per cent. of the children have dental caries caused by poor diets, and the people of Jabalia have access to only one half of one hospital bed per thousand people. The World Health Organisation minimum requirement is two hospital beds per thousand people. The quality of life is also reflected in poor educational standards. Few classes contain fewer than 48 children, and schools regularly run a daily double shift system. UNRWA does its best in extremely difficult conditions. It receives its money from many nations, but is underfunded by an estimated &#163;20 million and has recently had to shed many staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew10"><B> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire):</B> 
 It is nice to be the first person to intervene on this special day. The hon. Gentleman mentioned a figure of about 4 million refugees, yet he is talking about a limited return to the lands that were occupied. How is that practical? Is it possible for 4 million people to return? Is that an estimate of the number of people who would want to do so? Four million sounds like a large number in relation to that area of land.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew11"><B> Dr. Iddon </B> 
: I shall answer that question during the remainder of my speech.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para68">In mid-1996, so as to focus its efforts, UNRWA moved its headquarters from Vienna to the Gaza strip. The United States of America and, I am pleased to say, the European Union, are two of its largest funding bodies. Only 150,000 rural Jews live on the land of the <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 15WH</B></P>
expelled Palestinians. Indeed, 78 per cent. of Jews live in 15 per cent. of Israel, mainly in urban environments. Ironically, as has already been pointed out, the Gaza refugees are fewer in number than Russian immigrants to Israel. Indeed, a quarter of Jewish Israelis have chosen voluntarily to live in Israel.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para69">The Palestinians claim that the Gaza refugees--1 million people crammed on to just 360 sq km of land--could return to almost unoccupied land, while most of the refugees in Lebanon could return to Arab territory in Galilee. It is obvious to any observer of the middle east peace process that there cannot be a permanent and stable peace until the question of the refugees has been resolved. They cannot be allowed for much longer to live in the conditions that currently prevail in the camps. The peace process appears to be making progress. Let us hope that that progress can be maintained until all the issues, including that of the Palestinian refugees, have been dealt with.

<a name="91130h01_spnew12"><B> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate)</B> 
: I congratulate you, Mr.Winterton, on your promotion to Deputy Speaker. At least someone has gained something from this Milton Keynes of debating chambers. I congratulate the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) on securing the first debate in this Room, but I regret that a subject of such enormous importance has been thus relegated. The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) described the proceedings so far as "grown up". They are so grown up that the atmosphere is already dead.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para70">I agree with the arguments that hon. Members have presented, although I regret that they tended to read them into the record. This subject should be debated in the main Chamber with a real sense of outrage about the scale of injustice that has been suffered by Palestinian refugees over the past 50 years. I shall not add to the cases that hon. Members brought up to demonstrate the scale of the continuing injustice of what is happening to Palestinian refugees because the record will show that they made their cases thoroughly.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para71">Her Majesty's Government look ridiculous when they wrap their foreign policy in a so-called ethical dimension--such as their use of an ethical justification to go to war over Kosovo--given the scale of the injustice to 4 million refugees that has gone on for more than 50 years. Where, we are entitled to ask, is the ethical consistency in that policy? I hope that the Minister will say that the Government intend to continue to put increasing pressure on the Government of Israel to start to deal with the people of Palestine with the same sense of justice that they demanded for themselves in the wake of the appalling atrocity that happened to the people of the Jewish nation during the second world war. A holocaust of equal proportions has happened to the people of Palestine, who have been evicted from their homes and suffered disruption to their lives, and it has gone on for far too long.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew13"><B> Dr. Tonge </B> 
: Were the hon. Gentleman's earlier remarks intended to suggest that this country should go to war with Israel?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew14"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
 I was not suggesting that, but the hon. Lady is right to draw attention to the fact that the Government's policy is inconsistent. When we went to war over Kosovo, the reasons for doing so were dressed up in the supposedly ethical dimension of being the right and proper thing to do. I do not think that war was the right course of action for us to take over Kosovo. If the Government choose to present their foreign policy in terms of ethics and morality, they will rightly be asked why they have taken one course of action over one set of injustices, while failing to act over another.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para72">I hope that the Government will stop trying to con us, in a sense, that we can deal in an ethically consistent way with an issue as difficult as this. The hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Mr. Austin) rightly referred to the unequal negotiations that the Palestinian people face. I hope that the Government will use their influence to ensure that the negotiations are a little more equable by supporting the interests of Palestinian refugees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew15"><B> Mr. Mohammad Sarwar  (Glasgow, Govan):</B> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) on securing this debate. The middle east peace process will shortly enter the crucial final status negotiations stage, in which the Palestinian refugee issue will be discussed for the first time. It is vital that that and the status of Jerusalem are addressed head on, rather than marginalised. Although it was not discussed during the interim stage of the process, it is essential to understand that the refugee issue is not insignificant but central to the middle east peace process.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para73">The Palestinians are the largest single group of refugees in the world. More than 3.5 million are registered with UNRWA, the agency that is charged with their welfare. In most cases, two or three generations of Palestinians have been forced to live in the squalor and grinding poverty of refugee camps. That must not be allowed to continue. Displacement from their original homes and the abject poverty of those camps has done more to fuel the Palestinians' struggle against Israel than anything else. Unless the Palestinian refugees who are exiled in camps in the occupied territories, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are allowed to return, we will not have a viable, final peace settlement. Any middle east peace process that does not take into consideration the interests of the vast majority of those refugees will not work.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para74">Denial of the right of return is a continuing breach of articles 2 and 5 of the European convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. The right of return for an estimated 3.5 million refugees is expressed in terms of their moral claim to return to homes from whch they have been displaced, and by reference to a number of United Nations resolutions. My hon. Friends have mentioned General Assembly resolution 194, which was passed in 1948 and states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date."

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h01_para75">I accept that it will be neither politically nor practically possible to return all refugees to their original homes. There is general recognition among Palestinians that a right of return will mean a right to return to Palestinian national soil, rather than to their 1948 homes. It is necessary to distinguish between the principle of the right of return to Palestine as the national homeland, and exercising that right by returning to the same home or piece of land that refugees owned before 1948. The impossibility of implementing any right of return to the refugees' original homes within Israel proper must not preclude the return of Palestinian refugees to a future Palestinian state in the west bank and Gaza. It must not be used to deflect political attention away from the future of Palestinian refugees. The right of return must be vigorously pursued in the final status talks, and supported by the British Government and the international community. That will need to be backed up by compensation to the Palestinian refugees under General Assembly resolution 194 for lost property. Reparations should be given, especially to those who will not be able to return, in recognition of the historical injustice that created the refugee problem in the first place.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para76">The Palestine National Authority and the Israeli Government will draw up a declaration of principle for the final status talks. It is essential that the declaration should make a specific commitment to the resolution of the refugees issue, as the original declaration of principle to the Oslo accord did. After the delays and stalemate of the Netanyahu Administration, the final status talks will provide an opportunity for resolution. However, the Israelis must not be allowed to disregard or overlook issues that they do not want to address, such as the Palestinian refugees. If the Israelis want a permanent peace, they must implement the United Nations resolution on the return of the Palestinian refugees. If the status of Jerusalem and the issue of the refugees are not decided, resentment and suspicion will build up among Palestinians, providing ammunition for those on both sides who want to wreck the agreement.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para77">It is in the interests of Palestinians and Israelis not to waste the opportunity for lasting peace provided by the final status talks. The British Government and European Community have an important role to play--that of the honest broker. They must bring their influence to bear on the Israeli Government to ensure a just resolution of the refugees issue in the final status talks.

 It is such a pleasure to refer to you as Mr. Deputy Speaker, Mr. Winterton. This is a historic debate, and I want to observe the usual courtesy of the House by congratulating the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) on securing a debate on a subject in which she has shown consistent interest since she was elected to Parliament. I must strike a note of dissent, however, as, like my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt), I would like to commiserate with her. The future of the Palestinian refugees warranted a debate in the main Chamber of the House. I am still not sure why I am sitting in an annexe, albeit one that is 900 years old, while visitors are being shown around the Floor of the main Chamber. It feels like not <P>

the modernisation but the Disneyfication of Parliament, while the serious business of the House becomes a sideshow. I stress that that is a personal view, and I hope that my worst fears are not realised.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para78">The issue that has been so admirably covered this morning is far from being a sideshow--

<a name="91130h01_spnew17"><B> Mr. Ivor Caplin  (Hove):</B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew18"><B> Mr. Deputy Speaker </B>

<a name="91130h01_spnew19"><B> Mrs. Gillan </B> 
: I must stress, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin), that I was expressing a personal view. I hope that my worst fears will not be realised.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para79">While I was preparing during the weekend for this debate, I decided to look at the photographs that I took when I visited the occupied territories and the Gaza strip in 1989. The delegation included Members of Parliament and members of the Bow group, who had been invited by the Palestinians so that the problems of the region could be explained to them. We toured the west bank and Gaza under United Nations protection, and we met families, teachers, doctors, local politicians, political activists and the then leading Palestinian advisers to Yasser Arafat. It was obvious that emotions ran exceedingly high. The language used often expressed profound hatred and bitterness, and at that time it was hard to envisage how a solution could ever be reached.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para80">However, a member of the Palestinian host team--a woman--made a profound impression on the delegation. Hanan Ashwari painted a picture of hope and reason that transmitted to me an optimism that I still feel today. I hope that all Members who participate in this debate share that optimism about the Palestinians' future. Hanan Ashwari is a university professor, a Christian Arab and a friend to both Palestinians and Israelis. She has walked a difficult road. When we met her, she focused less on the political and more on the human element in the peace process. Although that dimension is all too easily obscured by hatred and conflict, it is necessary if the Israelis and the Palestinians are to find a solution. Such considerations have brought us to the brink of a solution in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para81">I was reminded of the humanitarian element when I looked at my photographs of Hanan Ashwari detailing the problems of the Palestinians, of children chasing our bus and pretending to shoot guns at us and of a woman sitting in the ruins of her house, which had been bulldozed simply because her son was suspected of taking part in the intifada. I also remember the look of fear in an Israeli soldier's eye when he searched the belongings of Palestinian workers on a bus that was crossing into Israel. One of my most poignant memories <P>

from that visit was of a girls' school in the Gaza strip, where a notice on the wall exhorted the dispossessed pupils, who had little hope, to be a lamp in a chamber if they could not be a star in the sky. Other hon. Members have already discussed the children. It is the children with whom we should be most concerned--future generations of Palestinians must not be blighted by their history.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para82">In the decade or so since my visit in 1989, the peace process has moved forward. With a new Prime Minister in Israel, there is new urgency to that country's endeavours, but there are still many unresolved matters, primarily the refugees and their uncertain future. As other hon. Members have already said, the exact numbers of refugees and their location continue to be pressing issues. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency estimated that there are slightly more than 3.5 million refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and the west bank. The Israeli Government claim that those figures were exaggerated. However, on closer examination, it becomes clear that they do not include countries where UNRWA does not operate, such as Egypt and Iraq. Moreover, they do not refer to Palestinians who were outside Palestine in 1947-48, or people who were expelled by Israel after 1967 or displaced by the June 1967 war. Although the numbers matter, they matter less than the principles of settlement which form a major plank of the permanent status negotiations.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para83">The Palestinians have a justifiable desire to allow all refugees to return to their homes, but Israel rejects that principle on the ground that such a return would ensure conflict between Israel and the Palestinians for centuries to come. Although those positions appear irreconcilable, it is imperative that both sides continue to pursue a solution. After all, when the war ended, there was no mechanism for discussion, but some refugees were returned under the family reunification scheme. How much more could be achieved now that there are negotiations and a political will to find a lasting settlement. Peace in the middle east will not endure without resolving the problem of the Palestinian refugees.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para84">The Conservative party will support the Government whenever they use their influence to urge everyone in the region to participate in negotiations and abide by international agreements. We are prepared to back them while they follow the aim, as set out by their predecessor, of achieving a lasting peace that is accepted by all and founded on the principle of respect for international law. Peace should mean security for Israel and prosperity, justice and self-determination for the Palestinians.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para85">Britain's historic links give us a special interest in the peace process, and successive Governments have provided aid and support. Other hon. Members mentioned UNRWA. I hope that the Minister will reassure me on the continuation of aid and suport for the work of UNRWA. Although there is justifiable optimism that the refugee issue is now closer to resolution, the work of UNRWA needs to continue. It has successfully provided its services directly to refugees, including help with education, health care and social services. Indeed, it has supported Palestinian <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 20WH</B></P>
refugee families that are unable to meet their own basic needs and promoted self-reliance through community programmes. It is essential to the welfare of many.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para86">Recent financial difficulties have resulted in austerity measures and a reduction in the support that is provided to refugees. What assessment has the Minister made of those difficulties and what actions can the Government take to alleviate the problems? Although there is international agreement that the work of UNRWA must continue until the Palestinian entity can take over its role, recent developments have caused uncertainty. The Minister should explain what has happened and shed some light on what actions are open to the Government.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para87">A disturbing report in <i>The Times</i> today claims:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"At least eight leading figures, among them academics and heroes of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation, were being held in detention and under house arrest".

Although that is a recent development, I hope that the Minister, who no doubt has his finger on the pulse of the middle east peace process, is able to enlighten us on the reasons for those arrests.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para88">This is a short debate on an important international problem which both Opposition and Government Members want to see successfully resolved. Peace will bring humanitarian and financial dividends, and the peaceful option can provide greater prosperity and security for everyone in the region. We all share the sentiments that were expressed by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West. While I was researching this issue, I came across the Arabic proverb,

 My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) expressed delight that hon. Members were sitting where they pleased, but I hope that no one will read too much into the fact that Liberal Democrat Members are cosying up to the Government on the Front Bench. I noted that the hon. Members for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) and for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) displayed some signs of rigor mortis at the modernisation process on which Parliament has decided, but I am sure that they will soon come back to life.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para89">I am advised that its semi-circular lay-out makes this the first non-confrontational Chamber that Westminster has experienced in 800 years of political sparring. I know that everyone will expect straight answers to questions, even if they are posed from a semi-circular position.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para90">I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West for the opportunity to debate the issue of the Palestinian refugees. She, along with many of my hon. Friends and other hon. Members, spoke in moving detail about the refugees' plight, and her speech was based on and shaped by personal <P>

knowledge, as were the speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden), for Erith and Thamesmead (Mr. Austin), for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) and for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sarwar).
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para91">My hon. Friends have rightly reminded us that the refugee issue is one of the most important and difficult obstacles in the permanent status negotiations that are now under way between the Israelis and Palestinians to secure a lasting settlement in the middle east peace process. I am grateful for the fact that hon. Members displayed a unanimity rarely seen in the House. There was a consensus between the Opposition and Government Front-Bench spokesmen--as shown by the speeches of the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham and the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge)--that the issue of the Palestinians must be addressed as part of the peace process.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para92">As we have heard, the problem is enormous. There are 3.5 million Palestinian refugees registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the west bank and Gaza strip. Others are dispersed throughout the world. Some lost their homes in 1948 and have been in refugee camps ever since, some lost their homes in 1967 and others were born in the refugee camps. They are victims of an appalling historic injustice. No lasting peace settlement is possible without addressing their plight, however difficult that will be politically, logistically and financially.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para93">As we have been told, the condition of the refugees has been a matter of international concern for more than 50 years, during which Britain and the United Nations have provided practical support. Most of our support is channelled through UNWRA, which provides accommodation for more than 1 million refugees and practical support for many others. It provides education, health care and relief aid that is a lifeline for many in the camps.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para94">In addition to accommodation, UNWRA provides education to 460,000 schoolchildren, primary health care to more than 1 million refugees and emergency relief for 200,000 of the poorest refugees. The member states of the European Union together form the largest donor to UNWRA, Britain being one of the largest individual donors. The hon. Member for Richmond Park asked us to do more, and we are. In 1997, our bilateral contribution, excluding contributions through the European Union, was &#163;6 million. This year we are contributing &#163;9 million in bilateral aid, which is &#163;3 million more than the previous Government's total.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para95">In his visit to the region at the end of October, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary gave expression to our support and concern for the Palestinian refugees when he visited Deir al-Balah refugee camp. I know that he was shocked at the conditions there, which hon. Members described. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield gave a graphic account of the conditions that he had seen, and I acknowledge his long involvement in and commitment to the issue, which dates back to the 1970s.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para96">It is intolerable that no end is in sight to the refugees' plight. We must all contribute to such a resolution as part of the middle east peace process. We are committed to doing all that we can to achieve a successful outcome <P>

to that process. We are in regular touch with all the parties, providing support for them in their efforts to find a just, lasting and comprehensive peace. President Arafat was in London for meetings on 9 November; I was present at some of those meetings. Israeli Prime Minister Barak and Egyptian Foreign Minister Moussa were here last week. We are also in regular contact with the Syrians and the Lebanese. Negotiations between the parties occur against a background of international standards. The international standard for refugees is United Nations General Assembly resolution 194, which dates from 1948, and for which Britain voted. That resolution states that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so. . . and compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return".

Resolution 194 has been the basis of the United Kingdom's position since 1948. We have repeatedly made that clear, and I am happy to do so again, especially in response to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead, whose personal commitment, as I saw at first hand when, as he described, I visited the middle east in January 1996, is widely recognised and admired.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h01_para97">A peace deal, including agreements on how to implement resolution 194, would give Palestinian refugees a real opportunity for a stable and prosperous future. Today, partly because of the visionary leadership shown by Prime Minister Barak and the Israeli Government, the prospects for such a deal look better than they have for a long time--perhaps better than ever. There is an historic window that all the parties at the negotiations must keep open, through which they must all climb together.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para98">The interests of the refugees and their right to live with justice and in freedom must not be forgotten. It is for the Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate a way forward--nobody outside that process should pre-empt their decisions. However, the immediate parties to the peace process negotiations cannot alone find the huge resources needed for them to begin to solve the refugee problem.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h01_spnew20"><B> Mr. Blunt </B>

<P>
<P>

: We do not agree with the settlement process long adopted by Israel. Although Prime Minister Barak has taken important steps forward on the settlement issue, he has a long way to go.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para99">My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West asked a specific question. Those involved should know that Britain acknowledges that the European Union and the United States especially have a responsibility to contribute to a solution of the refugee issue, as does Israel. Indeed, it is more than a responsiblity--a moral and political duty is on us all. Countries elsewhere in the middle east, including the Gulf states, can also play an important role. The Palestinian refugees are some of the most serious casualties of a post-second world war history largely shaped by--and, in many respects, won by--the west. It is time for the world to redeem the debt owed to the <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 23WH</B></P>
Palestinians and, by so doing, to create a lasting peace by which the security of all in the middle east, especially Israel's, is guaranteed.
<P>

<a name="91130h01_para100">I shall respond to the final point made by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham about reports this morning that Palestinians are being placed under house arrest, and to the dinosaur-like point of the hon. Member for Reigate. Human rights are indivisible across the globe. The Palestinians must respect the human rights of those living within Palestine, just as the Israelis should recognise the human rights of refugees and others living within Israel and the territories that it currently controls. The matter of refugees is ultimately one of human rights. The Government are determined to help to address that matter, however difficult--in terms of logistics, finance, resources and, of course politics--that task will be.

<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew0"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold):</B> 
 I am grateful to you, Mr. Chairman, and to Madam Speaker for affording me the opportunity to initiate the second of the Adjournment debates in this alternative Chamber. I am also grateful to the Under-Secretary for being present and agreeing to reply. I am glad to welcome my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray), whose constituency adjoins mine and who therefore has part responsibility for this problem.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para0">Mr. Chairman, one of the main reasons--

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spmin0"><B>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Mr. Nicholas Winterton): </B> 
 Order. "Mr. Deputy Speaker" is the order of address to the Chair in this parallel Chamber in Westminster Hall.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew1"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker--no discourtesy was meant. The newness of this procedure is the reason for that slip of the tongue.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para1">One of the main reasons for requesting the debate is to establish which Department will take a lead role in this matter; that, at least, is now clarified. In order to set the problem in context, I should point out that RAF Fairford is one of the main strategic NATO bases in this country. It has one of the longest runways, which straddles the Wiltshire-Gloucestershire border, and is one of the few bases in this country where the massive American C117 Galaxy transport planes can land.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para2">I am sure that you will be interested to know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that RAF Fairford was used during the invasion of Libya and in the Gulf and Kosovo conflicts as the launch base for American B52 bombers. Furthermore, it has also become the home of the three-day international air tattoo. The result of all that activity is that the main runway needs to be completely refurbished at a cost of more than &#163;60 million. Most important, it is estimated that that will involve some 60,000 heavy goods vehicle movements. It is that aspect which causes my constituents concern.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para3">I should say straight away that my constituents welcome the base and all the associated business that it brings. I understand, therefore, that Cotswold district council, which will take the lead in this matter, is not likely to object to the planning application for the project. Nevertheless, it is also concerned about the 60,000 heavy goods vehicle movements, which will come from either the A417 at Fairford or the A419 from Latton via the C124. The latter is a minor public road which is in places single track. There are two single-track bridges on it which form an S-bend. Until recently, they had no traffic control at all, but I am glad to say that they now at least have some traffic lights.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para4">It has been agreed that approximately &#163;1 million will be generated by the lorry movements levy as a result of the 60,000 movements. However, that is sufficient to carry out only comparatively minor road works such as strengthening traffic lights signing. That is inadequate. Clearly, my constituents' lives are going to be put at risk by huge, heavily loaded juggernauts going up and down single-track roads with deep drainage ditches on either side. Imagine what will happen when a cyclist meets one of those lorries on a dark and icy winter's night, and indeed, when the lorry tries to pull up in time to avoid the cyclist.
<P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 25WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91130h02_para5">In addition to that huge civil engineering product, tens of thousands of car and lorry movements are generated over the three days of the international air tattoo, which will become an annual event once the runways are refurbished.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew2"><B> Mr. James Gray  (North Wiltshire):</B> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that, although most of the traffic problems that he described will affect his constituency, during the air tattoo and also because of the refurbishing of the airstrip there will be a significant increase in traffic through Ashton Keynes and other villages in my constituency?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew3"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The problem is complicated because it involves several Westminster constituencies and several local authorities. Indeed, the mere fact that the base is bisected by the Gloucestershire-Wiltshire border makes it doubly complicated.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para6">It cannot make any sense for a major NATO base to be served by such a minor, public, single-track road. One can imagine all sorts of reasons for vehicles having to move rapidly in and out of the base--for example, with casualties, ordnance, fuel and other stores required by such a large base. They could be transported in and out by air, but that may not always be possible due to weather and other circumstances. It may not be cost-effective to move heavy goods in and out of the base by air. The most cost-effective way is by road.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para7">It is not my function today to provide specific, costed proposals to solve the problem. That is for experts from the Gloucestershire and Wiltshire highways authorities and other planning authorities such as Cotswold district council, North Wiltshire district council and Thamesdown borough council--now the unitary authority of Swindon--which also have responsibility in the matter. Those authorities are all working with the Highways Agency and the Government office for the south west to provide a satisfactory solution for a safe access road to the base.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para8">The Minister may say that it is for the highways authorities of the two county councils to put in a bid for the road scheme to be considered, but that would be an inadequate reply. The situation is unique. Due to its huge refurbishment, the base has a new lease of life and, judging from the number of confidential letters that I receive from the Ministry of Defence about one huge NATO exercise after another, it is clear that it will be used more and more. Its servicing and the enormous increase in local traffic compared with when the base was originally used, and even in recent years, mean that current road access is totally inadequate.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para9">My constituents believe that, as the Americans are paying a large proportion of the cost of the refurbishment through their NATO contributions, they should make the major contribution to the local road system, which they use. I emphasise again that my constituents are pleased to see the Americans and welcome them. Many friendships have been made between Americans and local people and my constituents enjoy the benefits of the spin-off from the base, but they fear the danger posed by the road.
<P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 26WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91130h02_para10">If the Government are not prepared to approach NATO or the Americans, a Government Department must provide the funds. I am delighted to see the Under-Secretary here today because my constituents believe that the MOD should provide the funds in this unique situation. If the MOD cannot, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions must. Either it must fund a Highways Agency project to build a proper access road or, as the final alternative, it must fund a joint county council bid for the county highways authority to build the road. That is the least attractive method of funding the road, because it would have to compete with all the other badly needed road schemes in both counties and that would be unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para11">I am grateful to the Minister for coming to listen to the problem this morning. I have no idea what his response will be, but I hope that it will be sympathetic because the current position is unsatisfactory not only for the base but, above all, for the quality of life of my constituents and those in the adjoining constituencies of my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire and the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), who join me today in pressing the Government to find a solution.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para12">I hope that it will not take a fatality or other serious accident to persuade the Government to sit up and take notice of the problem. There is a straightforward and constructive way forward. It is a relatively simple road to build and will not require a huge amount of money. It needs to be a fairly straight, two-way road. It does not need to be an A or B road. An example has already been set in the western part of the water park by the western spine road--a straightforward road which was built from gravel money. If we could have a similar road in the eastern part, the problem would be solved. I look forward to the Minister's response.


<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spmin1"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence   (Mr. Peter Kilfoyle </B> 
): It is not the first time that I have laboured under your adjudication, Mr. Deputy Speaker, although it is the first time in this Room, and it is a novel experience.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para13">I congratulate the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) on securing this Adjournment debate in this new setting. Clearly, road access to RAF Fairford has generated considerable public interest and is a matter of great importance to his constituents. He is evidently concerned about the project on two counts. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) has expressed similar concerns. The first count is the construction activity over the next two years--the project is scheduled to finish in about November 2001--and the second is the impact on the C124 road.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para14">It may be helpful if I briefly put the project into its historical context. After the second world war, the United States corps of engineers extended RAF Fairford to its present size between 1949 and 1956. It was designed for the aircraft of the time, notably types B47 and KC97--the type of aircraft that you and I, Mr. Deputy Speaker, assembled in the form of Airfix models when we were boys. Since that time, no major surfacing work has been carried out, apart from a contract in 1977 to overlay the main runway and taxiways with asphalt. Over most of the airfield, the concrete and asphalt surfacing is very old and has deteriorated to the point at <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 27WH</B></P>
which major reconstruction is needed to maintain the integrity of the runway and provide a safe operating base for visiting aircraft.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para15">It is, therefore, necessary to undertake a major reconstruction project to bring the airfield infrastructure back to a safe and satisfactory standard. At the same time, the runway and pavements will be redesigned to cater for the size and weight of modern military aircraft. The overall estimated cost of the project is slightly more than &#163;60 million, to which the hon. Member for Cotswold referred. It is about &#163;65 million, and construction is programmed over 21 months from spring 2000. The contract will also encourage the contractor to re-use excavated material and local resources whenever possible, to minimise the transporting of material to and from the site.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para16">Nevertheless, it is recognised that the construction work will generate a considerable amount of lorry traffic in and out of RAF Fairford. The current estimate is that 120,000 lorry movements could be required. Therefore, a decision was made in June 1998 to have early consultations with the planning and highway authorities. Extensive consultation and discussion was undertaken with the highway authorities of the two county councils concerned, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, and with representatives of the local councils, the results of which determined that access to the base for construction traffic will be from the A419 via a minor road, the C124.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para17">The highway authorities have stipulated that the installation of traffic lights, road strengthening and a degree of repair work should be undertaken to ensure the continued safety of the road, as part of the enabling works before any base construction work begins. All this additional work is to be carried out by my Department at a cost of about &#163;640,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew4"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
 I am sorry to interrupt the Minister in what is proving to be an extremely constructive and useful reply. My constituents are worried about whether one-way traffic from the A419 at Latton--rather than access to the base from the A417 at Fairford--will be rigorously enforced by the MOD, or whatever body is to be in charge of this huge contract. In that case, at least there would be traffic into the base from only one way, rather than two ways.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew5"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but I am not in a position to speak for the agencies that are charged with the enforcement of traffic law and regulation. Those are matters beyond my competence, and certainly beyond my wit.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para18">I emphasise that the work on this construction project is absolutely necessary to ensure that the essential facilities at Fairford, which have deteriorated over the past 20 years or so, are brought up to the standard that is needed to guarantee its continued use as an essential operating base in times of crisis. That role was aptly demonstrated and reinforced during our recent operations in Iraq and Kosovo. I point out to the hon. Member for Cotswold, in the kindest possible way, that it was not an invasion of Libya but a bombing expedition that was mounted from Fairford, which is <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 28WH</B></P>
not quite the same thing. I should point out to him that Fairford is not an operational base except in times of crisis. The base's normal staffing comprises about 400 souls. A comparison with RAF Lyneham, which has about 5,000 people, puts Fairford's level of use into perspective. However, it remains an essential staging post.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para19">The hon. Member for Cotswold mentioned the number of letters that he receives from the MOD about exercises constantly taking place. I take that as a backhanded compliment, in that we keep local Members well informed about our intentions. In reality, however, NATO exercises involving Fairford take place only once a year. It is not regularly used in the way in which they, perhaps inadvertently, suggested.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew6"><B> Mr. Gray </B> 
: The Minister is right to say that RAF Lyneham, which is in my constitutency, has 5,000 service personnel--plus a further 5,000 spouses, which takes the total number of people to 10,000. However, Lyneham, the town that is associated with the base, is well served by major roads. The problem with Fairford is that, by contrast, a tiny single-track road with a small bridge will take the hundreds of thousands of lorries that the Minister described. Is &#163;640,000 rather a modest sum for the repair of a road that will be under such immense pressure?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew7"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle </B> 
: That sum has been computed as being appropriate to the demands that will be made of the road. I remind the hon. Gentleman that extensive consultation with both of the relevant district and county councils has taken place. It was in that spirit of partnership that the proposal was agreed.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para20">I am aware that for many years, the district and parish councils have been trying to get the C124 upgraded. I do not dispute the fact that that is a long-standing local bone of contention that existed before we made our proposals on undertaking these works. However, although the road has been designated as the eastern spine road for the future of gravel extraction in the area and the development of the Cotswold water park, I understand that the highway authorities have given it no priority for upgrading. The locus for comments on upgrading belongs with those authorities rather than the MOD. We are talking about a completely ad hoc use of the road for specific periods and the amount of money that has been agreed will allow for the remediation of that road. The upgrading will include not only the installation of traffic lights but kerbing, channelling and other necessary improvements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew8"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: I am not sure that the Minister is entirely correct. I know that high-level meetings have taken place between his Department, the Government office for the south west and the Highways Agency to try to solve the problem. Would he and his senior officials be prepared to meet a delegation from the relevant councils, perhaps attended by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire and me?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew9"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle </B> 
: We could have pre-empted this debate if such a meeting--which has, I believe, been arranged--had already taken place. I am always glad to meet relevant local authorities where the matter is of local interest. However, local councils and some residents, at <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 29WH</B></P>
least, will perhaps have regarded news of the proposed refurbishment of the Fairford base as a blessing in disguise. Although the subject of today's debate is the disruption and inconvenience caused by the construction traffic, which is recognised by all parties, there is an opportunity to upgrade the C124, and largely at someone else's expense.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para21">I should make it absolutely plain that this is not a decision for the Ministry of Defence. The role of RAF Fairford is unchanged and the project will not generate an increase in traffic in the long term. As such, the MOD sees no requirement permanently to upgrade the road, and will take only such measures as are required by the highways authorities of Wiltshire and Gloucestershire county councils. Therefore, works are limited to those measures that are designed to meet the temporary increase in construction traffic.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para22">I should also disabuse the hon. Member for Cotswold of the notion that we have in some way established that we are the lead Department for road upgrading in the area; we are not. That remains wholly within the remit of the highways agencies. Our concern is ensuring that, during the Fairford refurbishment programme, all appropriate steps are taken to ensure the road's integrity and safety, and its refurbishment to the required standard.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para23">I welcome the opportunity to make it clear that, as a responsible Department, the MOD has acted within the letter and spirit of the relevant planning laws, and has also taken fully into account the various local issues that have arisen. I can assure the hon. Members for North Wiltshire and for Cotswold that it will continue to do so. I should also place on record the MOD's gratitude for the constructive co-operation shown by local council authorities in helping to resolve planning issues at RAF Fairford and permitting a major NATO project to proceed on schedule. However, the MOD is not a regeneration agency and cannot carry out public road improvements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew10"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: The Minister has been very generous in giving way. He seems to be saying that the MOD wants to have its cake and eat it. It wants to upgrade the base, but that will disrupt local people who, at the moment, are showing considerable good will. If the MOD is not prepared to fulfil its responsibilities by ensuring my constituents' safety, some of that good will might rapidly ebb away.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew11"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle </B> 
: It is difficult to substantiate that charge; indeed, I would argue the reverse. In fact, the MOD has shown a willingness to consult and negotiate with all those involved--county and district councils--that is above and beyond the call of duty. We have not merely met but exceeded our obligations to upgrade the road. The hon. Member for Cotswold shakes his head, but he cannot expect me to accept on the MOD's behalf the responsibilities of other Government agencies in this regard. As I have said, we are doing all that we can to restore the true integrity of the Fairford base and to cater as far as is possible for the difficulties that will arise in respect of the C124.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew12"><B> Mr. Gray </B> 
: We have a little time in hand, so perhaps the Minister will not mind giving way for a second time. The point that he makes--that maintenance of RAF <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 30WH</B></P>
Fairford is a matter for the MOD, but maintenance of the road is a matter for the local highway authority--is probably a good one, and may well be correct in terms of the machinery of government. However, does he accept that the standard spending assessment and the revenue support grant settlements for Wiltshire have been reduced substantially in recent years, and are ill-equipped to provide the extra money for upgrading the road to which he refers? Will he write to the Deputy Prime Minister to encourage him to increase the revenue support grant for Wiltshire to take account of the extra cost that we have discussed?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew13"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle </B> 
: I am tempted to write to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister about many matters, but the SSA for Wiltshire is not among them--although I might be tempted to write to him about the SSA for my local authority.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para24">I told the hon. Member for Cotswold that we had gone beyond the call of duty. One of our more innovative steps involved the levy that he mentioned. Placing a &#163;5 levy on every movement will inhibit the excessive use by vehicles of that road. When the contract goes out to tender, it will be difficult for anyone to meet the tender criteria and submit a successful bid unless they maximise the use of vehicles and minimise the number of lorry runs along the road. We are trying to be as innovative as possible and minimise disruption on the road.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew14"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: To be honest, the levy is peanuts. It would fund slapping a bit of tarmac in some potholes, but that would come out when the first heavy goods vehicle went over it. More money is needed to build a proper road that provides access to and from the base.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h02_spnew15"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle </B> 
: I can only ask the hon. Gentleman to re-examine our proposal, which involves widening stretches of the road, kerbing and channelling, installing traffic lights and upgrading the road. Yes, potholes will be filled in, but every constituency in the land has potholes that need to be filled in. We are trying to do the best that we can to minimise disruption.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para25">Before I gave way for the umpteenth time, I was saying--I do not mean this to be harsh--that self-evidently the MOD is not a regeneration agency. We cannot carry out public road improvements other than those that arise as a consequence of our obligations to meet operational objectives within the established planning processes. I am sure that no hon. Member who has spoken would argue that we have not made sure that the district and county authorities were fully cognisant of all of our intentions and moves. Moreover, we have taken those authorities on board with us.
<P>

<a name="91130h02_para26">With the exception of the construction, access and traffic management that is associated with the Fairford project, the status of the C124 is properly the responsibility of other Departments and of the Highways Agency. I am not trying to divorce my Department from its responsibilities--quite the reverse. We have taken on board responsibilities that technically and legally we could have argued were not ours. However, we did not argue that because of the spirit of <P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h03_spnew0"><B> Ms Claire Ward  (Watford):</B> 
 I am pleased to be one of the first Members to initiate a debate in this Chamber. I must admit to having some reservations about the idea, but I trust that it will give Back Benchers an ample opportunity to raise issues of concern to them and their constitutents and to get a thorough reply from the Government. I hope that I shall succeed in that today.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para0">I want to set in context the reasons for my concern about the increased use by children of tobacco products, and about their increased availability. We all know about the undeniable link between smoking and cancer, but far fewer people are aware of the link between chewing tobacco products and the incidence of oral cancer. I recently met surgeons who specialise in the maxillo-facial work that is associated with the damage that cancer does to the mouth and face. Frankly, I was appalled and sickened by the devastation that cancer can cause to the mouth and face. The surgeons showed me slides of their many patients who suffer from this debilitating illness. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of that meeting was my introduction to a new product that is being cynically marketed to children, especially within the ethnic minority community.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para1">The Minister will be aware that it is an accepted culture within some sections of the Asian community, mainly among Indians and Bangladeshis, to chew tobacco or paan. Such products often take the form of betel nut leaf parcels, containing tobacco, betel nut, lime and other ingredients, and are considered beneficial to digestion and overall health. Bidis, which are unfiltered cigarettes, are also on the market. In addition to the paan products--the leaf-based parcels--a new generation of tobacco products has begun to enter the market. Gutkha is a sweetened tobacco which is packaged in brightly coloured foil parcels--sometimes with children's faces on them--and is marketed in newsagents throughout ethnically diverse communities for as little as 20p.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para2">Although chewing paan is a traditional habit brought from south Asia, it was hoped that the habit would fade rather than passed on to the next generation. That fear has provoked the Indian tobacco manufacturers to seek new ways of gaining a market. Their cynical marketing tactics are designed to attract a new generation, who may be more likely to chew products flavoured with chocolate or sweeteners, as the leaf parcels are a more acquired taste.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para3">Gutkha is not illegal. Hon. Members may remember the introduction, in 1989, of Skoal Bandits, which were pouches of tobacco that resembled tea bags and were designed to be sucked. They brought concern and action from the Government of the day. The then Secretary of State for Health, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), said in a written answer that he was acting to prevent children and young people from taking up such a dangerous habit. He stated that there was evidence that the habit could result in mouth cancer, which is particularly difficult to treat. As a result, the Tobacco for Oral Use (Safety) Regulations 1992 were introduced. They banned the supply of
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any oral product made wholly or partly of tobacco which is intended for oral use unless it is intended to be smoked or chewed".
<P>
</UL></FONT>



<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 33WH</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
I am pleased that that legislation was passed. Unfortunately, by specifically excluding other products that are chewed or smoked, it left no room to apply the regulations to gutkha or any similar product that is chewed rather than sucked. I hope that the Minister will agree that it is strange to distinguish between products that are put into the mouth on the basis of whether they are chewed or sucked.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h03_para4">Although such products are still legal, it is an offence to supply them to minors under the Children and Young Persons (Protection from Tobacco) Act 1991. Just as it is illegal to sell cigarettes to under-16s, it is illegal to supply gutkha. According to reports and media investigations, however, young children from across the cultures are now buying these products. They are a cheap, easy and tastier alternative to cigarettes, but they are equally harmful, if not more so. Research from India gives an insight into the problems that such products can cause to children's health. Children as young as 12 have already been diagnosed with pre-cancerous mouth lesions due to gutkha use. Every year, thousands of British children visit the Indian sub-continent and pick up the habit, which they can continue when they return home because access to gutkha remains so easy. Many of the packages have no description of their contents, although other harmful substances, such as lead and silver, have been found to be present.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para5">The incidence of oral cancer is especially high in India, and has been linked to the use of chewing tobacco. India is the third largest manufacturer of tobacco, behind China and the USA, and produces almost 8 per cent. of the world's tobacco, 75 per cent. of which is used for internal consumption. Pakistan is the 10th leading producer, and Bangladesh is the 17th. Furthermore, children are involved in the production of such tobacco products in harsh labour conditions in India and other parts of south Asia.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para6">We also know that chewing tobacco products is a popular habit in the United Kingdom. A survey of Bangladeshi women in West Yorkshire found that 95 per cent. chewed paan. A study by the university of Birmingham school of dentistry reported that 92 per cent. of males and 96 per cent. of females interviewed chewed paan on a daily basis, and that 39 per cent. and 82 per cent. respectively included tobacco within their paan.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para7">We need only look at the incidence of oral cancer to realise the health implications of using tobacco products, whether they be chewed, sucked or smoked. Oral cancer in the UK accounts for 1.6 per cent. of cancer cases and 1.2 per cent. of all deaths. More than 2,000 cases are diagnosed in England and Wales each year and more than 60 per cent. of patients die as a result of oral lesions. The figures are higher than those for cancer of the cervix or skin cancer, yet, because both those cancers feature more prominently in the debate on cancer, people are more aware of them than they are of the causes of oral cancer. In addition to the huge personal and social costs of oral cancer, the cost to the national health service is estimated to be &#163;50,000 a case. If we are to avoid a massive national bill and thousands more deaths each year, the Government must get a grip of the issue.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para8">It would be strange to have a debate on the subject of children and tobacco products and not deal with the problems of under-age smoking, which is more common <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 34WH</B></P>
than tobacco-chewing among the young. The effects of smoking on health are well versed. They account for more than 120,000 deaths each year and cause a range of respiratory and heart problems. However, despite the obvious health risks, a significant number of under-16s smoke, and 450 children are believed to start smoking every day. Surveys in 1997 classed 11 per cent. of 11 to 15-year-olds as regular smokers. They also found that more girls smoked than boys. Various reasons were given for that, including the perception of smoking as a cool activity and the desire to copy celebrities and pop stars. In addition, many young girls believe that smoking will help them to control their weight. But the factor that most influences a child's decision to smoke is whether either, or both, of his or her parents, or an older sibling, smokes. Children with two smoking parents are three times more likely to be regular smokers than children who live in households where neither parent smokes. A child whose older sibling smokes is five times more likely to be a regular smoker than a child who does not have an older sibling who smokes.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para9">There is no doubt that the younger a person starts to smoke, the more difficult it is to quit and the more detrimental smoking is on health. Some 82 per cent. of adult smokers start smoking as teenagers. Smokers who start smoking at the age of 15 are three times more likely to die from lung cancer than those who start in their mid-20s. Despite legislation that bans the under-16s from purchasing cigarettes, surveys show that smoking remains an activity for a significant number of children in this country. But few of us need statistics to confirm what we know from observations. How many times have we seen children walking around our towns smoking? Children who hardly look old enough to be out on their own are indulging in an activity that threatens their health.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para10">I am concerned about how children get hold of cigarettes and chewing tobacco. In 1992, the previous Government set a target to reduce smoking among 11 to 15-year-olds from 8 per cent. in 1988 to less than 6 per cent. in 1994. Last year, the Government set a new target to reduce smoking among children from 13 per cent. in 1996 to 9 per cent. or less in 2010. Those figures are still too high. The Government must take a much tougher line on the supply of tobacco products to children.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para11">Far too many newsagents, garage forecourt shops and other retailers are willing to sell cigarettes to children without checking how old those children are. Of course, children often look much older than they are these days--we all know that, and even I find it difficult to distinguish between a 13-year-old girl and a 16-year-old girl. Make-up, clothes and sheer confidence allow children to masquerade as adults. People might suggest that it is also difficult to know how to spot an MP these days. Whatever they wear and however they look, under-16s should not have access to tobacco products. Retailers should be required to ask for identification for all sales to young people who look as though they might be under 16.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para12">Trading standards officers have an important duty to perform--they must be more proactive in seeking out retailers who continue to flout the law and put our children's health at risk. Not only must there be more spot-checks on retailers, but the penalties on those found supplying to under-16s must be stricter. Trading standards officers should be more involved. I was <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 35WH</B></P>
concerned to learn from a written answer given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry a couple of weeks ago that levels of funding given to trading standards officers varied. That must have an impact on the work that they are able to do within their community.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para13">It is not good enough for retailers to claim that they believe a young person to be 16--they must demand identification and refuse to sell cigarettes and other tobacco products on a failure to produce identification. I trust that the Government will review seriously the penalties in place--only the most severe sanctions will bring to the attention of retailers the seriousness of the issue.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para14">We know that not all under-16s who smoke buy their cigarettes personally--many get friends, relatives or even strangers to purchase them. That activity, too, must be a target for the Government. Better education on the health risks and on the law regarding under-age smoking is essential if we are to convince people that they must do everything in their power to prevent children from smoking, and if we are to deny the tobacco manufacturers a new generation of smokers.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para15">When I recently visited a school as part of the UNICEF "Put it to your MP day", I was concerned to hear from one of my constituents that children under 16 believe that it is easy to obtain cigarettes. They have merely to stand outside a newsagent and ask an adult or an older friend who is going in to buy cigarettes for them. It must surely be for us to raise awareness of such issues among the public to ensure that we all take responsibility for not assisting in supplying cigarettes to young people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h03_spnew1"><B> Sir Peter Emery  (East Devon):</B> 
 Will the hon. Lady also urge the Government, as some of us have for many years, to be more stringent on advertising and to make the warning on the back of cigarette packs similar to that used in Australia, which takes up half of the pack and warns of the dangers of cigarette smoking? Too many of our young people are still being encouraged to smoke. As chairman of the National Asthma Campaign, I am most concerned that you should not allow people to be influenced by advertising. Many youngsters follow motor racing and see tobacco advertising. We should be cutting down on all such advertising, and not excluding anybody.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h03_spmin0"><B>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Mr. Nicholas Winterton) </B> 
: Order. Before the hon. Lady replies to that intervention, I should point out that it is appropriate for all speakers to address the Chair, even though that might be difficult given the lay-out of sittings in Westminster Hall.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h03_spnew2"><B> Ms Ward </B> 
: The right hon. Member for East Devon (Sir P. Emery) made important and correct points. I agree that we must look carefully at the issue of advertising and that we should prevent children from seeing advertising as they go into shops. The Government have carefully considered the issues of advertising and tobacco sponsorship and I have no doubt that pressure will remain on them on that issue. The Government must generate a high-profile campaign aimed at educating children and young people about the damage <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 36WH</B></P>
to their health that is caused by smoking. By engaging the support of non-smoking pop stars, celebrities and sporting heroes, they may be able to generate a new message that it is uncool to smoke and that it is certainly not an activity that deserves any respect in the playground or classroom.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para16">So far, I have talked about the children who actively engage in smoking or chewing tobacco products, whether or not they are aware of the damage to their health. The debate, however, encompasses another section of that generation--those who suffer from tobacco products through second-hand smoke. All too often, we see children, and sometimes even babies, being smoked over by their parents and relatives. In the home and in public, children--through no choice of their own--are forced to endure others' smoke. Not only can that encourage them to take up the habit, but passive smoking can increase the chances of asthma and lung cancer in children.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para17">Children are subjected to passive smoking in restaurants and other public places, yet there are no laws in place to prevent that. Perhaps if the Government introduced a measure banning children from sitting in any designated smoking area, we would, in some small but significant way, be able to protect them. Parents would not be able to take their children into smoking carriages on trains or sit them in smoking areas of restaurants or other public places. Such a measure would mean that the Government had to require all public facilities, including restaurants and bars, to have designated no-smoking areas, but I, for one, would welcome that.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para18">The Government have a responsibility to prevent children from having access to tobacco products. They must do all that they can to educate children and their parents about the dangers of smoking or chewing tobacco. No one expects that to be an easy task and everyone recognises the influence of the tobacco industry worldwide. Nevertheless, the future health of our nation depends on a robust and determined effort by the Government to prevent under-age access and reduce the number of adult smokers and chewers in years to come.

<a name="91130h03_spmin1"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health   (Ms Gisela Stuart) </B> 
: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Ms Ward) on securing the debate and providing me with my first opportunity to speak in this newly formed Chamber. Although I agree with you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that speaking through the Chair may not come as naturally to hon. Members because of the Room's configuration, it is a great pleasure, when replying to an Adjournment debate initiated by a Labour Member, to be able to look at her, rather than having to address an empty space and trying to look backwards. Both Chamber shapes have their advantages; no doubt in due course we will make up our minds about which we prefer.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para19">Children's access to tobacco is an important subject and I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Watford secured time to discuss it. If we do not address the problem when they are young, we as a nation will count the cost in disease and in lives. We do not know enough about the precise health risk posed by oral tobacco, particularly among some of our ethnic <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 37WH</B></P>
minority communities, but this much we do know: oral tobacco is a potentially lethal product. I shall focus on the Government's commitment to addressing the particular problems associated with it. I stress that we are concerned about getting the message across to both children and adults that oral tobacco products are dangerous in whatever form they are taken. I shall go on to describe the Government's wider tobacco control campaign.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para20">We need to take a three-pronged approach. First, we must find out the scale of the problem. Secondly, we should consider the law and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Watford said so poignantly, better enforcement of existing law. Thirdly, we must examine education and how we can get our health messages over more effectively to this audience.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para21">On the scale of the problem, although we have some information on tobacco chewing habits, it is by no means comprehensive and we are looking at ways of improving our knowledge. I have asked my officials to consider what more we can do. I want to know how prevalent oral tobacco use is among children and adults. Beyond survey evidence, I am also anxious to hear from experts. My hon. Friend recently wrote to the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), offering her an opportunity to meet surgeons who deal with the effects of oral tobacco every day. We are grateful to her for that and my hon. Friend would like that meeting to take place before Christmas.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para22">We need to enforce the powers that are available. I remind hon. Members that legislation to prevent the sale of tobacco products to children has been on the statute book since 1908. The Children and Young Persons (Protection from Tobacco) Act 1991 strengthened the law and made it an offence to sell any tobacco product to children. The definition of tobacco product included any product containing tobacco intended for oral or nasal use. I was struck by what my hon. Friend the Member for Watford said about whether a product could be chewed or used in another way, and I was reminded of the sophistry that one may smoke but not inhale. We must look at the product rather than make distinctions between uses that would be difficult to regulate.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para23">Local authorities are required to review their enforcement of the law annually. The law also requires tobacco retailers to display a warning notice at the point of sale which states that it is illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone under the age of 16. As a mother of a 13-year-old and a 16-year-old, I appreciate how difficult it is to judge the ages of children just by looking at them.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para24">Under the Tobacco Products Labelling (Safety) Amendment Regulations 1993, all tobacco products are required to carry a health warning. There is, however, little evidence that that requirement is being observed by manufacturers and retailers of gutkha-style products. I assure the right hon. Member for East Devon (Sir P. Emery) that the draft directive on tobacco labelling will require the health warnings on packets of tobacco products to be bigger.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h03_spnew3"><B> Sir Peter Emery </B> 
: When will that come about?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h03_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
: The precise date has not been determined, but I shall write to the right hon. Gentleman with precise details. I am sure that he is aware that matters European can take longer to implement.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para25">There is little evidence that labelling requirements for gutkha-style products are being observed by manufacturers. The legal position is not clear. No child should be sold a tobacco product, whether it be cigarettes, gutkha or other forms of oral tobacco. Any tobacco product should carry a health warning, but the key to the problem is enforcement of the law, which is not always straightforward--for example, not all gutkha contains tobacco--hence the lack of prosecution. However, I am not here to make excuses; we must do better.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para26">We are tackling the problem in several ways. First, I have asked my officials to consider whether, in principle, more could be done through legislation to remove items from the reach of children. Secondly, my officials have been working with the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body on Trading Standards--LACOTS--for several months. They are developing an enforcement protocol to assess current compliance with the law; to provide education and help for retailers to aid compliance; to produce details of enforcement action taken so that it can act as a deterrent; to consider test purchases and support for proof-of-age cards; and to monitor the results of enforcement action. We expect the protocol to be published shortly. I accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Watford said about funding, but there is the issue of what priorities local authorities give to different aspects of trading standards enforcement. I hope that the meetings between officials and representatives of local authorities will encourage local authorities to return that to the top of their agenda. We are committed to running several training days next year for local trading standards officers on tobacco-related enforcement issues. Those training days will include the issues surrounding gutkha.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para27">The Government have worked constructively with industry to find a solution to the problem of sales of adult products to children. An industry-led voluntary proof-of-age card is now available to help consumers and retailers to establish young people's age when they try to buy age-restricted products. Citizencard, which was launched nationally last February and covers ages 12 to 18 plus, is run by industry groups and has ministerial endorsement.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para28">My officials have already alerted LACOTS to the situation concerning gutkha. They will discuss with them this week what more can be done and where resources can best be targeted to make an impact. For example, we shall consider how to encourage the prosecution of importers who fail to abide by existing labelling regulations. Those regulations make it clear that no person shall supply, offer to supply or possess for supply any tobacco product that does not confirm with labelling requirements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h03_spnew5"><B> Ms Ward </B> 
: Does the Minister agree that products with children's faces on the packet cannot be considered to be normal adult consumable products and must be targeted at children? Such products must surely be in line for a ban.
<P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 39WH</B></P>


<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h03_spnew6"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
: The whole labelling issue and how products are made attractive to children will be considered as a package, but a starting point is to deal with products that do not even carry the necessary warning.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para29">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in his pre-Budget statement the Government's commitment to take further action to tackle smuggling--for example, investment in new technology such as X-ray scanners and vigorous use of confiscating powers.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para30">The third part of our action plan is education. There is considerable evidence that the people using these products are unaware of the health risks. We must get the message across that all tobacco products are harmful, however they are packaged. A three-year, &#163;50 million tobacco education campaign will be launched on 13 December. The campaign materials will be translated into 11 languages. As time moves on, we shall incorporate a number of more targeted campaigns, including programmes aimed at ethnic minority populations.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para31">There is much to be done. Few people are unaware that cigarette smoking is dangerous, although there is still much ignorance about how great the risks are. Unfortunately, knowledge about the health risks of oral tobacco is not so high. Some excellent services exist--for example, Quit's Asian Quitline--but not enough of them. We must make it clear to both adults and children that taking oral tobacco is a big risk to health. The terrible effects of facial cancers are frightening enough, but we must make it clear that the danger does not end there. Nicotine addiction from chewing tobacco can lead to cigarette smoking with its huge risk of cancer, heart disease and other deadly health problems. We hope that children will take our health messages home and thereby help us to reach their parents and grandparents.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para32">Smoking kills. That is a simple and important message. I do not want the problem and the Government's reaction to it to be seen in isolation. I have referred to the tobacco education campaign, which aims to persuade smokers to quit and non-smokers not to start--especially the young and above all young women. Another matter of great concern is the high number of pregnant women who continue to smoke.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para33">We shall develop programmes aimed at youngsters. We know that such campaigns have an impact on the wider adult population. We are determined, despite recent challenges, to ban tobacco advertising and we know that the cigarettes most often smoked by children are those that are most heavily advertised.
<P>

<a name="91130h03_para34">I am grateful for the success of the hon. Member for Watford in securing this Adjournment debate and hope that she is satisfied with some of our responses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h04_spnew0"><B> Mr. A. J. Beith  (Berwick-upon-Tweed):</B> 
 It is a privilege to be able to round off the first day's proceedings in this very pleasantly appointed new Chamber. Moreover, it is a considerable advantage to Members to have a desk on which to distribute their papers in a case as complicated as this.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para0">Had my constituent been Mr. T. Blair, he might have had less difficulty in resolving a case that has now lasted for nearly six years. In 26 years as a Member of this House, I have never seen a worse case of bureaucratic lassitude, incompetence, delay and serial buck-passing than this one. Its victim, Mr. William Blair, is a caring and patient man, who is amazingly calm and rational in the face of treatment that would try the patience of a saint. We have become good friends, as he has become a regular visitor to my constituency surgery over the years, during which we have tried to resolve it. I am grateful to yet another Minister for entering into the fray and trying to assist in dealing with a matter for which the Government have some responsibility, as they are seeking to sort out the mess left by pension mis-selling.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para1">Mr. Blair was a miner in the Northumberland coalfield and a member of the mineworkers pension scheme. In the 1980s, the then Government loosened restrictions on company pension regimes and more than 5 million personal pensions were aggressively sold. Some advisers went round miners, nurses and other groups, trying to persuade them to take out personal pensions. I detect the flavour of that in a letter from the advisers in this case, Ridley Devine and company, of Ponteland, who wrote to Mr. Blair in 1989, to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"With no further increases and a fairly modest growth of 13 per cent., you would have &#163;12,800 tax-free cash and a pension of around &#163;100 a week."
 
If the Economic Secretary could guarantee 13 per cent. growth on equity investments and pensions, she would be very pleased. The letter ends:
<P>
<BR>
"I would also like to take this opportunity to wish you a very merry Christmas and a happy new year."

Mr. Blair faced many years of anxiety following that letter and that advice. The only question that the advisers asked him was whether he could afford the premiums, which is in breach of all the guidance about how pensions should be sold.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h04_para2">Like many other miners in Northumberland, Mr. Blair had to leave the industry and he began working for Northumberland county council. He then transferred his Scottish Life pension to the Northumberland county council local government superannuation scheme. However, he discovered that, had he kept his miners pension and transferred it directly instead of transferring a personal pension, he would have been credited with more years of service than under the new pension, and been much better off in retirement.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para3">Following that discovery, he approached me in February 1994. I offered to take up the matter with the regulatory authority, but he then appeared to make some progress, and the county council advised him to contact the mineworkers pension scheme. In December 1994, the pension provider, Scottish Life, confirmed that <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 41WH</B></P>
Mr. Blair had bought a pension from it, but insisted that Bain Hogg, the company that had taken over Ridley Devine, was responsible for review under the Personal Investment Authority rules. The PIA confirmed that to me. I wrote to the director of Bain Hogg, who passed the file on to the company's compliance officer. Bain Hogg then became Hogg Robinson Financial Services, regulated by the PIA.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para4">In February 1995, I wrote to Hogg Robinson's compliance officer, whose reply anticipated a final response in two weeks. In March 1995, Hogg Robinson wrote to Mr. Blair requesting further details. In May 1995, it interviewed him, and had at least, by then, worked out that he was four years and one month short of pension entitlement. It wrote to the local authority superannuation scheme for an assessment of the benefits that he would have received. That takes us to May 1995, when Philip Smith, a director of Hogg Robinson, wrote to me:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I wish to confirm that the case is proceeding quite quickly."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h04_para5">In May 1995, Hogg Robinson offered to pay to Northumberland county council the amount that Mr. Blair had lost by not staying in the mineworkers pension scheme. However, Northumberland county council then put a spanner in the works by saying that it could not accept payments to boost pension entitlements and that Mr. Blair had therefore to transfer back into the mineworkers pension scheme. So after a year and a half, yet another impasse was reached. Hogg Robinson approached the mineworkers pension scheme and passed the case on to its northern executive director, and contact continued.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para6">In August 1996, Hogg Robinson requested Mr. Blair's reinstatement into the mineworkers pension scheme, with an additional payment to be offered for stress and distress. A dispute arose between Mr. Blair and Hogg Robinson as to the amount to which he was entitled. Mr. Blair thought that &#163;1,000 would be reasonable compensation and that that was the PIA-recommended figure. Now only &#163;250 stood between Mr. Blair and a resolution of the matter.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para7">Then a bombshell fell. Hogg Robinson's company secretary insisted that the company had no liability to reinstate Mr. Blair into the pension scheme because it had taken over not the share capital or liabilities of Ridley Devine, the original advisers, but merely its portfolio, and was therefore wholly unconnected with the people who gave the original advice. The papers then had to be passed to the PIA, with apologies for the appalling state of the file.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para8">I then wrote to Colette Bowe--a name that you may remember, Mr. Deputy Speaker--who was at that time the chief executive of the PIA. She replied that she hoped that the PIA would be able to achieve a speedy resolution.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para9">In March 1997, I again wrote to the Insurance Brokers Registration Council, the body that was now entrusted with the case and was reviewing the pension transfer. In April 1997, it completed its preliminary inquiries.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para10">In June 1997, I wrote to the PIA to complain that it had still not resolved the case, suggesting that its handling of the case illustrated
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the hopeless ineffectiveness of the system of redress over which the PIA presides".
<P>
</UL></FONT>



<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 42WH</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
It was at about that time that <i>The Observer </i>had reported that the PIA pensions unit had so far compensated only one victim of pension mis-selling. When Colette Bowe replied to my letter, she said that my comments were "misconceived and unfair".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h04_para11">At that point, I wrote to the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Mrs. Liddell), who was then Economic Secretary of the Treasury, asking for her help in looking into the case. In September 1997, she replied that swift action was necessary in such cases and that she had met senior representatives of the life insurance companies and other bodies to insist that it be taken. Also in September 1997, the IBRC appointed independent accountants to review the file.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para12">In December 1997, there was a new development. With the case still unresolved, Mr. Blair faced redundancy from his job. I wrote to the IBRC. The respondent replied that the IBRC was awaiting a report from its actuary, and that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I anticipate that this may be forthcoming shortly."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h04_para13">By March 1998, I had heard nothing since that response from the IBRC in December 1997. Its independent reviewers of the case had provided estimates for benefits on the basis of redundancy, but as Mr. Blair had not been made redundant at that point they had to go back to the beginning again to work out a fresh entitlement.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para14">In July 1998, the Government announced that they intended to abolish the IBRC, which gave the IBRC a wonderful excuse to pass the papers on to somebody else. At that point, I recruited the help of the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), who was a council member of the IBRC. I am grateful for the time and attention that he gave to the matter. At about the same time, I requested a meeting with the new Economic Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt). Following that meeting, she wrote to the chairman of the Financial Services Authority about the case.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para15">In the meantime, I again wrote to the IBRC, which, although it was about to be abolished, was still in existence. In March 1999, it confirmed that it had passed the file on to the FSA. Enter Mr. Howard Davies--another name that you will remember, Mr. Deputy Speaker. When I raised the matter with him, he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Unit hopes that they will be able to conclude this assessment within one month."

However, he also said that it would have to be dealt with by the IBRC--which was of course in the process of being abolished. The FSA and the IBRC would have to discuss arrangements for meeting the costs of compensation claims from investors who did business with firms that the IBRC used to regulate.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h04_para16">The FSA then assured me that the assessment would be completed by mid-May 1999 at the latest. Of course, by that time I had heard nothing further about the assessment or anything else. I wrote again to Mr. Howard Davies, who assured me that the assessment had been completed, but that the FSA was awaiting the outcome of talks between the IBRC and the investors compensation scheme about how such claims would be dealt with. In July this year, the hon. Member for Ryedale, who has been involved in negotiations to establish such a scheme, informed me that the IBRC, the ICS and the FSA had agreed in principle a <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 43WH</B></P>
compensation scheme for investors such as Mr. Blair. The PIA is passing its pension files to the ICS. The hon. Gentleman made inquiries about the location of Mr. Blair's files.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para17">By September, the ICS received the file, and it sent another set of forms to Mr. Blair to fill in--it appeared that he had to start from the beginning again. It told Mr. Blair that it would carry out a full investigation, which would be a
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"detailed and lengthy process which may take some time".

Its representative even said:
<P>
<BR>
"Unfortunately, I am unable to give any specific time frame as to when we will be in a position to review your claim."

Mr. Blair has waited for nearly six years and his case has gone through a series of bodies, but the body that is responsible for such matters cannot even give a time scale within which it will deal with the case. That ICS letter made me realise that I had to raise the case in the House or in Westminster Hall and take it further. Since then, Mr. Blair has had to agree to retire in January on grounds of ill-health. The case has acquired much greater urgency because his pension will form the basis of his retirement income.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h04_para18">Yesterday--surprise, surprise--the ICS phoned Mr. Blair to say that his case would probably be resolved on the basis of a gratuity because there were technical reasons why he could not be returned to the mineworkers pension scheme. In view of the history of the case, neither Mr. Blair nor I place any confidence whatever in such telephone assurances, although I notice that the file has been dug out and that someone might be working on it. However, no assurances are on paper, and I fear that even the offer of a gratuity will be snatched away.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para19">If the gratuity is given to Mr. Blair, various questions need to be answered. Will it be index-linked? His original mineworkers pension would have been index-linked, if he had kept it. Will the gratuity include compensation for all the distress and anxiety that Mr. Blair has been caused for many years? We should remember that compensation of &#163;750 was on the table in 1996, and that he has suffered three and a half years of further distress since then.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para20">Howard Davies sent me a letter in April 1999 in which he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any compensation paid to Mr. Blair will take account of all the delays he has experienced."

I sincerely hope that someone somewhere will assure us that the ICS will be bound by Mr. Davies' assurance that compensation will be forthcoming.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h04_para21">I appreciate that the Minister bears no personal responsibility for this appalling state of affairs. However, she is responsible for regulation in such areas and for ensuring that the system works effectively. Clearly, the system worked hopelessly and was lamentably ineffective in this case. What has she been told will happen next in Mr. Blair's case? I am sure that she sought information on it--no doubt that is why he got a telephone call yesterday. Will she keep an eye on the case until it is resolved? Although she is not responsible for individual cases, this case is a vivid example of the way in which the system can go wrong. <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 44WH</B></P>
She should follow it through and ensure that the wrongdoing is put right. Has the case taught her any lessons about the system's effectiveness? I should be grateful for any assistance that she can give me and the long-suffering Mr. Blair.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h04_spmin0"><B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury   (Miss Melanie Johnson </B> 
): I congratulate the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) on securing the debate and on fighting so hard for his constituent. Before I respond to his speech, it might be helpful if I remind hon. Members about the progress that we have made in tackling the pensions mis-selling scandal that we inherited when we took office. To some degree, that sets the scene for Mr. Blair's case, to which I shall return later.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para22">The situation in spring 1997 was that firms had not given the review that was launched in 1994 anything like the necessary priority. The target was to compensate all priority cases--those who had retired or were close to retiring--by December 1996. However, by March 1997, only 15 per cent. of cases identified for review had been resolved, and only 2 per cent. had been compensated.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para23">The Government wasted no time in getting to grips with the overall problem. In May 1997, the then Economic Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Mrs. Liddell), met senior executives from the 24 firms that were responsible for about three quarters of all cases to secure their personal commitment to giving the review a higher priority within their organisations. I am pleased to say that phase 1 of the pensions mis-selling review, which covers priority cases, is now almost complete. So far, more than 400,000 people who were mis-sold a pension have been offered, or have accepted, redress worth &#163;2.7 billion. Firms now recognise that it is in their interests to complete any outstanding phase 1 reviews as soon as possible. The Government and regulator reinforce that message in their dealings. We have made it clear that firms also need to make speedy progress with phase 2. We will not tolerate the delays associated with the early days of the priority review; with the lessons to be learned from phase 1, there will be fewer excuses.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para24">The Government have no plans to publish information on firms' progress on phase 2, as we did in respect of phase 1, but the industry is aware that we reserve the right to do so if necessary. We continue to support the regulator's action to ensure that all victims of personal pensions mis-selling receive appropriate redress.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para25">The Financial Services and Markets Bill, on which I have just participated in Standing Committee deliberations, will deliver a regulatory regime that will make it more difficult for firms to mis-sell financial products. The Financial Services Authority's programme of raising consumer awareness will include the publishing of comparative information on financial products--the so-called league tables--and help consumers to make better informed choices. These measures are designed to ensure that scandals such as the mis-selling of personal pensions are not repeated. That is the most important lesson that we can draw.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para26">Having listened to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, I understand the frustration that <P>




<B>30 Nov 1999 : Column 44WH</B></P>
he feels on Mr. Blair's behalf. Mr. Blair first took up the issue in 1994, and it is regrettable that he has yet to hear the outcome of his case, particularly given that it seemed close to being settled on two previous occasions. The Government are aware of the time that has been taken to clear up some cases. That delay is a result of the complexity of the process and the number of organisations involved. On the regulatory side alone, the organisations include the FSA, the Insurance Brokers Registration Council and its grant scheme, the Personal Investment Authority and the investors compensation scheme. Those are all dedicated organisations that have done good work to help and protect savers, but it is clear that people such as Mr. Blair have suffered unacceptably. First and foremost, he suffered because of the initial mis-selling of the pension. That was bad enough. He then suffered because of the time taken to resolve uncertainties about compensation. Would he receive redress? How much would it be? When would an offer be made?
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para27">Resolving complex cases such as Mr. Blair's was bound to take time, because the extent of the loss suffered needs to be quantified and an entitlement to redress established. However, such work cannot be done in a hurry without, for example, information from existing and past schemes. Of course, as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed clearly stated, the process has not been helped by the number of organisations involved and the manner in which they exchanged information.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para28">Moreover, in this case, the pension was mis-sold by a small firm that went out of business several years ago. That necessitated some one-off detective work to establish what had become of the firm. Dependent on the outcome of that work is the vital question of whether Mr. Blair is entitled to redress from the investors compensation scheme.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para29">That is the system that we inherited, and which continues to apply. To simplify the arrangements, the Financial Services and Markets Bill will establish a single financial services and markets compensation scheme, which will pay compensation to consumers who suffer financial loss when an authorised firm cannot meet its liabilities. That will make compensation easier and simpler to obtain in such cases.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para30">All that is of little comfort to Mr. Blair. His case reached the existing investors compensation scheme in late August this year, and action can take up to six months. The Financial Services Authority's pensions unit sought to keep Mr. Blair informed about what has been happening this year. The ICS 1999 report acknowledged that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Without establishing the insolvency of the firm, we are unable to take the claims further. This was, at times, a lengthy and cumbersome process".

The case is being dealt with by the ICS and is at a final stage. It has sought to keep Mr. Blair fully informed on what is happening, and has been in touch with him in the past few days.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91130h04_para31">I am pleased to be able to tell the right hon. Gentleman news of the results of the investors compensation scheme review today. The ICS is satisfied that Mr. Blair is entitled to receive redress. The amount of that redress, and the manner in which it is to be paid, remains to be finalised in detail. The purpose of that redress is to put him, as far as possible, in the position in which he would have been had the mis-selling not taken place. That is his right. ICS staff have spoken to Mr. Blair and discussed what form the redress might take. Usually, reinstatement or augmentation of the existing pension arrangement would be sought, although that might not be possible in Mr. Blair's case, for the reasons given by the right hon. Gentleman. That will be disappointing, but it is because of the policies adopted by his other pension schemes. Instead, the ICS will probably buy an annuity to compensate Mr. Blair for any future losses.
 
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para32">Mr. Blair was pleased to know that his claim was finally progressing. The ICS knows that I will continue to take a close interest in his case, and I also give that assurance to the right hon. Gentleman. Mr. Blair has had to wait far too long, and I am glad that the ICS has been in touch with him to provide good news.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h04_spnew1"><B> Mr. Beith </B> 
: Can the Minister confirm, or at least show an interest in, the compensation aspect, to which I referred earlier? Taking account of indexation means that putting Mr. Blair in the position in which he would have been is difficult enough. However, it is also important that the assurances given by Howard Davies and others in relation to compensation for all the delay and distress that have occurred are kept to by the ICS, which is not the body that originally gave them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130h04_spnew2"><B> Miss Johnson </B> 
: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I shall write to him in greater detail on the compensation issue, although I assure him that I continue to take an active interest in it.
<P>

<a name="91130h04_para33">It is a tribute to the right hon. Gentleman that he has fought so hard and long for his constitutent. Some hon. Members have not been in Parliament long enough to have fought for such a length of time, but certain cases have to be fought persistently. Any Member of Parliament who sustains a battle on behalf of a constituent for such a long period should be congratulated. In securing this debate, the right hon. Gentleman has achieved some progress. I hope that the case can soon be brought to a conclusion that is satisfactory to him and to Mr. Blair.
