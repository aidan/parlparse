Moffat (East Lothian) (Lab):</b> I am pleased to welcome so
many interested colleagues to the debate. The fact that it is taking
place on the eve of the World cup is pure coincidence. For the record I
shall support any British team in the championship. [Hon
Members: &#147;Shame!&#148;] It is a no-win situation,
but I shall genuinely support England. The timing of the debate is
fortuitous, given that there would be no major world-class events such
as the World cup if communities throughout the world did not nurture,
encourage, coach and promote football in schools and communities, from
the minute that a child can kick a ball. The future of all sport lies
at the grass roots. Years ago, our greatest players played football
morning, noon and night; they lived, breathed and ate the game. To play
for their school team was every player&#146;s dream; those who were
good enough or were spotted by a scout could rise up the ranks, but
often just getting a game was all
important.</p><p><a name="06060647000011">I
am secretary of the all-party group on Scottish football. When Walter
Smith came to speak to us recently, he said that the problem facing us
nowadays in encouraging youngsters to play the game and gain the
attendant health benefits comes from Nintendo, PlayStation, computers
and new technology, in which children seem much more interested,
whereas previously, whenever it was light, they had the ball at their
feet and were out playing. We need to encourage youngsters to play
healthy sports.</p><p><a name="06060647000012">There
lies my concern. There are 164 junior football clubs registered in
Scotland, but most are or will shortly be facing a financial crisis,
which could lead to the clubs folding. That has arisen as a consequence
of a tax burden being placed on the clubs by the Inland
Revenue&#151;one that they have never before had to deal with. From
the mid-1960s until the 2003-04 season there was an exemption for such
clubs, thanks largely to Tam Dalyell, who fought for
it.</p><p><a name="06060647000013"><b><a name="06060647000570">Mr.
Jim Devine (Livingston) (Lab):</b> Tam Dalyell, as my hon.
Friend knows, was one of my predecessors. When, in about 1966, he
introduced that change, there were junior clubs in Bathgate, Broxburn,
Fauldhouse, Pumpherston, West Calder, Blackburn, Winchburgh, Armadale,
Linlithgow and Stoneyburn, and it is to his credit that in this very
season Bathgate Thistle Juniors got to the Scottish junior cup final,
and Broxburn won the east of Scotland league. It was Tam&#146;s
initiative that kept those clubs going very
successfully.</p><p><a name="06060647000014"><b><a name="06060647000571">Anne
Moffat:</b> That was a very helpful contribution. Tam Dalyell
was a leading light in the protection of junior football. I hope that
we can follow his good work and get concessions from the Paymaster
General.

Sheridan (Paisley and Renfrewshire, North) (Lab):</b> I
congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Before
she moves on from talking about Scotland&#146;s national coach,
Walter Smith, I remind her that at that same meeting he made it clear
that although professional football in Scotland should be allowed to
stand on its own two feet, the junior and amateur games need help from
Government sources. He suggested that investment was needed in the
lower-level football leagues, if we were to have a successful national
side, as England
has.</p><p><a name="06060647000016"><b><a name="06060647000573">Anne
Moffat:</b> That is a key point. This debate is about the fact
that resources are being taken from clubs, when what is needed is far
more investment. I agree with my hon. Friend and Walter
Smith.</p><p><a name="06060647000017">The Inland
Revenue operated a concession that allowed junior football clubs to
submit retrospectively informal returns detailing payments to players
and coaching staff, giving their national insurance numbers. Clubs
understood that any tax due to the Inland Revenue was then the
responsibility of the players themselves. However, from the 2003-04
season, junior football clubs have had dealings with the Inland Revenue
over the introduction of direct taxation for all payments to players
and coaching staff. The Inland Revenue has determined that junior clubs
are employers and, as such, are responsible for operating a
pay-as-you-earn scheme. That is the crux of the matter. No one disputes
that players should pay tax on what they earn, but we should not make
clubs enforce the pay-as-you-earn
scheme.</p><p><a name="06060647000018">Since that
time, to make matters even worse, the Inland Revenue has written to
some junior clubs in Scotland seeking back-dated revenue, in some cases
up to several thousand pounds. With the best will in the world, I would
have to say that the measures have tackitty bits written all over them.
The junior football clubs rely heavily on local fundraising initiatives
such as running totes or selling scratchcards simply to stay afloat.
Unlike senior football clubs, the small junior clubs do not generate
significant income from home games&#151;for example, in my
constituency, Musselburgh Athletic averages about 80 spectators to a
home game. None the less, that is a big part of the community. Everyone
loves the team. It is no great shakes&#151;it is not your Ibrox, your
Hamden or even your Parkhead&#151;but it is an important part of the
community. When 80 people go to watch a game and there are 22 players
at the park, those people are not doing some of the other things that
youngsters do. They are not engaging in antisocial behaviour or hanging
around on street corners. It is clubs like those that are being hit for
money and, without wishing to sound melodramatic, that will put them
under a serious
threat.</p><p><a name="06060647000019">At a recent
meeting in my constituency, which has four registered junior
teams&#151; Dunbar United, Tranent Juniors, Musselburgh Athletic,
which I have mentioned, and Haddington Athletic&#151;people were up
in arms about what they saw as the decimation of junior football clubs
by the heavy-boot tactics of the Inland Revenue. To illustrate how
ludicrous the situation is, Tranent Juniors is struggling even to find
pitches to play on. It is trying to find out whether it can use school
pitches, even though it is a successful junior football team, which
could be the future of Scottish 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 3WH</b><br>football&#151;and we certainly need a future for
Scottish football. Representatives of teams in my constituency, as well
as neighbouring Midlothian&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for
Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton), who could not be here today, would want to
express the same concerns as I have&#151;fear that the demands being
made on their clubs will cause them to fold.</p><p><a name="06060647000020">The clubs are
run by local individuals who volunteer to give up their time and effort
to provide a valuable resource to their communities. My fear is that
many of those unpaid volunteers, who are now expected to sort out their
players&#146; tax affairs and become financial experts and
form-filling anoraks with a nearly degree-level understanding of PAYE,
will walk away. Who could blame them? They are ordinary folk, some of
whom are retired, who give of themselves, not for thanks and accolades,
but certainly not for worry and the sleepless nights that the new
burdens will place on
them.</p><p><a name="06060647000021"><b><a name="06060647000574">Mr.
Devine:</b> I met representatives of Pumpherston junior
football club, which is run much as my hon. Friend has described. The
club secretary made exactly that point: if he must now administer the
taxation system he will walk away. If that happens, the club will
fold.</p><p><a name="06060647000022"><b><a name="06060647000575">Anne
Moffat:</b> That is another helpful intervention. My hon.
Friend is correct. I do not exaggerate when I say that in my meeting
with representatives of some of the small junior clubs I heard scary
stories such as they, as trustees of the clubs, being liable if the
money could not be paid. Their wives&#151;it is normally men who do
the volunteer jobs in question&#151;ask, &#147;What is going to
happen? They are not going to come and take things from our house. Are
we going to be liable?&#148; I hope to goodness that the position is
not so serious, but those are the rumblings of concern that are being
heard. Why should such people burden themselves in that way when all
that they are doing is voluntary work to keep football going in their
communities, out of a love for the
game?</p><p><a name="06060647000023">Clubs are even
being penalised for incorrectly or incompletely filling out returns.
How many of us have had people come to our surgeries complaining about
not being able to fill in forms? How many of us have had problems doing
so? It is not the easiest thing in the world. Those people are
volunteers and are not trained in administering such schemes. Yet their
clubs are penalised if they do it incompletely or
incorrectly.</p><p><a name="06060647000024">Everyone
understands that people who earn enough should pay tax, and I do not
dispute that, as I said earlier. However, I do dispute that we should
be trying to class as employers non-profit-making clubs and those who
represent them&#151;the officials, committee members or whatever we
might call them. As recently as last week, the Scottish Junior Football
Association expressed concerns and said that it could determine from
its annual returns that it was losing a significant number of
treasurers and secretaries from its clubs. Another of its concerns is
that clubs will be expected, as employers, to pay players the national
minimum wage. If clubs are forced down that route, they will incur wage
bills averaging &#163;1,000 a week as a result of players training
two nights a week and playing one game on a Saturday. That is what will
happen if we go down that ridiculous route.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 4WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000025">As we all
know, players in junior clubs are not in it to earn money. That might
be true at some of the big clubs, of which there are a few in Scotland,
where the bigger, better players get more money. In the main, however,
we are talking about people who earn only the amount that it costs them
to get to the ground. In my constituency, for example, Dunbar United
pays travelling expenses of &#163;3 per session and a win bonus of
&#163;6 per game. That is the level that we are talking
about&#151;it is hardly the thousands of pounds paid out by the big
teams such as Chelsea and Rangers. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i>
I nearly said, &#147;and Celtic.&#148; Like the volunteers who run
the clubs, the players give up time with their families to train a few
nights a week and they give up their Saturday afternoons. They play for
the love of the game and because they enjoy the opportunity to stay fit
and active. All that they expect, unless they can command the big
bucks, is that they should not be out of pocket as a result of
travelling to and from training and games.</p><p><a name="06060647000026">If clubs are liable for PAYE
and national insurance contributions and are potentially required to
pay the national minimum wage, many of them will close. The clubs
provide a valued community resource and generate pride in the
communities that they represent. At a time when we are encouraging
healthy lifestyles and tackling antisocial behaviour, and when this
country will host the Olympic games and Glasgow will, I hope, host the
Commonwealth games, it is ludicrous that we should be trying to cripple
the very heart of our football potential.</p><p><a name="06060647000027">I have had
messages of support from the Professional Footballers Association,
which is as appalled as I am about the threat to our junior football
teams. I have been contacted by Tony Higgins, Jackie McNamara and
Fraser Wishart, as well by Tom Johnston from the Scottish Junior
Football
Association.</p><p><a name="06060647000028"><b><a name="06060647000576">Dr.
Ian Gibson (Norwich, North) (Lab):</b> Has my hon. Friend
investigated the equivalents in England? I have always wondered how
academies in some of the clubs fiddle things, because they give
payments to some of the parents of the young people who play for them,
but are not subjected to the same tax vigilance as clubs in Scotland.
Is there an equivalent to junior football in
England?</p><p><a name="06060647000029"><b><a name="06060647000577">The

contribution. Of course I agree that we should clamp down where we can
determine that there is fiddling, that backhanders are being given and
that players are being paid over-the-top sums. These scams go on in all
walks of life&#151;they certainly go on in junior football and, as my
hon. Friend said, in England&#151;and we should clamp down on them
because they do not help the future of Scottish junior football clubs.
However, we should not launch a carpet attack on all
clubs.</p><p><a name="06060647000032"><b><a name="06060647000580">Dawn

says:</p><a name="06060647000525"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;&#145;Junior
football&#146; in Scotland does not refer to youth matches. There are
no age restrictions in junior football and the term probably originated
as a reference to the grade of the clubs, rather than the
players.&#148;</p></ul><a name="06060647000526"><ul><p class="tabletext">The top clubs
were called &#147;senior&#148;, so the next grade down was called
&#147;junior&#148;, and the article goes on to explain that clubs

article on the website, but representatives from the association say
that we are talking about
amateurs.</p><p><a name="06060647000039"><b><a name="06060647000587">Jim
Sheridan:</b> There seems to be some confusion. Junior
football in Scotland is not senior football. Senior football is
professional and people get paid, but many of the players in junior
football &#151;I would say more than 50 per cent. of them&#151;do
not get paid at all. However, it is not the payment that is causing the
problem; it is the tax burden and the administration
involved.</p><p><a name="06060647000040"><b><a name="06060647000588">Anne
Moffat:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that, because I want to
return to a point that I have perhaps not made as effectively as I
should have. If players earn enough, they should pay tax&#151;nobody
is arguing about that. However, we do not want to charge
volunteers&#151;ordinary members of the community who enjoy the game
and run the clubs&#151;with the onerous tax of implementing a
pay-as-you-earn-scheme when they do not have the expertise to do that.
If enough money is being earned, people should be hit, and rightly so,
but there is a vast difference between junior football in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland and in Scotland. In Scotland, it is
non-profit-making and amateur.</p><p><a name="06060647000041"><b><a name="06060647000589">Jim
Sheridan:</b> When the Paymaster General winds up, perhaps it
would be helpful if she explained clearly how the system works in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. How is it administered? Who pays
for it? Who is responsible for it? What are the penalties&#151;excuse
the pun&#151;if a club does not carry out its
responsibilities?</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 6WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000042"><b><a name="06060647000590">Anne

Where will this process end? Will the same measures be introduced in

decide to invade this world in the near future, they will wonder where
we all are. Most of us will be sitting watching television, and a lucky
few will be over in Germany, being looked after by McDonald&#146;s,
although I will not be one of them, thank God. Things have not always
been this way, and mass coverage on television and the influence of big
money and Russian billionaires have obviously raised the profile of
football.</p><p><a name="06060647000046">The other
day, I was thinking about what things were like when I was younger. The
last time the World cup was held in Germany was during England&#146;s
sabbatical from the competition, and the British Isles representative
was the country of my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian and most
of the hon. Members here today. There were some real stars in that
squad, such as Jim Stewart, Donald Ford and Tommy Allan. Who can forget
them? Who can remember them? Of course, there was also Kenny Dalglish,
Danny McGrain and Jim Holton&#151;six foot two, eyes of blue. There
was Billy Bremner, the man we all love to hate, and Jimmy Johnstone,
the man we all love to love. Sadly, as well as being great footballers,
the last three have one thing common&#151;they are no longer with us,
which is sad for us.</p><p><a name="06060647000047">In 1974, I was not the man you

weight&#151;and I was playing local football, as were hundreds of
thousands of other people, just as they are now. Then, as now, the
world of football seen on our screens is not the real world of
football. Then, that was merely pub and club football and some school
football. Today&#146;s world is different and the situation is

because that is the culture in Scotland, and where I come from: that is
how we attracted people. Football in the British isles is suffering
today because of the demise of that and because big money is bringing

<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 7WH</b><br>players from abroad and not encouraging junior footballers to come
through. That is a big mistake for us all.</p><p><a name="06060647000052">In my part of the world, we
have junior football&#151;it is junior in the sense of age
groups&#151;and it is booming. In Blaydon, we have a football team
that attracts 270 players&#151;boys and girls. People there are even
in the process of setting up a disabled team, which is something that
we would never even have thought about 30 years ago. The team operates
out of a portakabin, and while the children are training and playing
football, their grandmothers take it over and it becomes a social
centre for them. People who do not know each other and would never have
met but for their children&#146;s interest in football get together.
It is part of the community, and that is what it is all about. It
becomes a social event.</p><p><a name="06060647000053">We have campaigns going from
that football club. We are running a big campaign to try to get the
Health Department to pay for people who need to wear glasses when they
take part in sport. We should surely encourage that. A local amateur
football team in our area, Whickham FC, recently won the Durham senior
challenge cup&#151;their first win for 25 years, since they won the
FA vase. They were the first second division team to win the cup, and
they beat first division opponents to do it. They are an integral part
of the community, and good news for the
community.</p><p><a name="06060647000054">Another
team, Birtley Town juniors, have just been awarded a charter standard
by the FA and quite a lot of money from both the FA and the local
council, because they want the team to develop and go forward. They
realise the integral part that football plays in our communities, much
more than in the past when we had a more cohesive society. That is
particularly true in the area where I come from, where there were
miners&#146; welfares and people grew up, played, lived and worked
together. A lot of that has been changed, but the football clubs have
been maintained and are a key part of our society. We should do
everything possible to keep them going. The development in football in
the past few years is good news for the whole community.</p><p><a name="06060647000055">We have to ask where the
joined-up thinking is in the proposal, given that we want to encourage
people to engage in sport. We know that 30 years ago people went to
play football and then got drunk. That was part and parcel of the
situation: it was a man&#146;s thing. Football is no longer like
that: it is a community event that involves people in a very different
way.</p><p><a name="06060647000056">My hon. Friend
the Member for East Lothian said that if children are involved in sport
they probably will not be involved in antisocial behaviour, or if they
are, it will be for a much more limited time. That is a crucial part of
why the police in our area are involved in encouraging sport. Something
else that happens now, which would never have happened when I was a
young man, is that boys and girls play football together. We now have
people from different racial groups coming together, and there is
interaction with people with disabilities. We talk and talk in this
House about encouraging people to involve themselves in diversity. This
is real diversity: it is real people getting together, doing real
things together and realising that they are living on the same
planet.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 8WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000057">When I played
football, the engagement that we had with the local council was to ask
how much rent we had to pay for a football field, and that was the end
of it. Now there is real involvement with the development of community
leisure facilities, environmental discussions and development as a
whole. There is a plan to take over school fields in the area where I
live, which has been strongly resisted by local people because it is
all about building houses. The school fields should be maintained, used
and developed for sporting facilities. The football clubs are right in
there arguing that case and using links with organisations such as
Sport England to ensure that their voices are listened to. To promote
interest in sport, we should be talking about tax breaks, not tax
burdens. We should be looking for incentives, not disincentives, and we
should be finding support, not putting obstacles in the way. I
understand the reality that PAYE must be paid, but I urge it on the

clubs, it can only be for the good of the
community.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000552">9.54

Jim McGovern (Dundee, West) (Lab):</b> I fear that with such a
specific topic up for debate today, you may hear the same speech, or
variations on it, several times, Mr. Chope. I apologise in advance if
that is the case.</p><p><a name="06060647000059">I
start by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian
(Anne Moffat) on securing this debate. I know that she takes an active
local interest in this issue. She should be praised for the hard work
she has done locally, and the fine way in which she laid out the
arguments to start the debate.</p><p><a name="06060647000060">As a
comparatively newly elected MP, I imagine that I come fairly late to
the issue. My colleagues from around Scotland, notably my hon. Friend
the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe), who unfortunately is not
here today, have been campaigning on this issue since the Revenue
announced its intention to change the rules for Scottish junior
football about four years ago.</p><p><a name="06060647000061">Despite this being a relatively
long-standing issue, the debate is especially important and comes at an
appropriate time. Junior football clubs across Scotland have just hung
up their boots for the summer. The close season provides the
opportunity for many of the unpaid volunteers who do such good work in
those clubs to find the time and expertise to operate a PAYE system
while trying to find ways to keep their clubs running with the extra
burden that has been placed on them. The debate comes only a couple of
months after tranche 2 of the Revenue&#146;s programme to get PAYE
established throughout Scottish junior Football.</p><p><a name="06060647000062">My
constituency has five junior football clubs, all of which are part of a
proud tradition within Dundee. Despite being the new kids on the block,
Downfield FC are celebrating their centenary this year. Dundee Violet
were formed in 1883, and are therefore the oldest club, closely
followed by what must be the most successful club in the region Lochee
United, who managed to win 17 honours between 1977 and 1987. That feat
has not been repeated in recent years, but it will not be easily
forgotten. Indeed, last year Lochee managed to resurrect some of that
fighting spirit and reached the final of the Scottish cup. My favourite
team in Dundee, West&#151;Lochee Harp&#151;were formed in 1904, and
Dundee North End make up Dundee, West&#146;s complement.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 9WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000063">In Perthshire, there are teams
such as Jeanfield Swifts, Bankfoot, Kinnoull. Up in Angus, there are
clubs such as Forfar Albion, Forfar West End, Brechin Vics, Arbroath
Vics. Coming back down into Dundee, East, Carnoustie have been one of
the most successful clubs in recent years, and were Scottish cup
finalists a couple of years ago. Coming back into Dundee, there are
Broughty Athletic and East Craigie. Unfortunately, my favourite team
from Dundee, East&#151;St. Joseph&#146;s&#151;went defunct a few
years ago because of financial considerations. Moving across the Tay
bridge into Fife and the constituency of the leader of the Liberal
Democrats, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir
Menzies Campbell), teams include Tayport, who are probably the most
successful team in Scotland in recent years at junior level. I think
they have won the Scottish cup three times in the past five seasons.
Moving through Fife into the Chancellor&#146;s constituency, there
are clubs such as Lochgelly Albert, Lochore Welfare and Kelty
Hearts.</p><p><a name="06060647000064">Throughout
the Tayside and Fife area, junior football clubs are at the heart of
every
community.</p><p><a name="06060647000065"><b><a name="06060647000597">Mr.
Devine:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The Chancellor
was heavily involved in saving the Raith Rovers senior team, which he
strongly supports, organising financial assistance and suchlike. It
would be a bit silly and contradictory for him to save the senior team
but let the junior teams go
under.</p><p><a name="06060647000066"><b><a name="06060647000598">Mr.
McGovern:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. He
makes a valid point. It would indeed be sad if the junior teams in the
Chancellor&#146;s constituency were to go to the wall because of tax
considerations.</p><p><a name="06060647000067">I
could go on with my geographical tour of Scotland, but suffice it to
say that across the Forth bridge there are more junior clubs in the
constituencies of my right hon. and hon. Friends the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry, the Deputy Leader of the House, the Home
Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and for Transport, and
the Secretary of State for Defence. Junior football clubs are at the
heart of the community throughout Scotland, and play a vital part in
those communities.</p><p><a name="06060647000068">The
clubs in Dundee, West boast crowds of somewhere between 50 and 100 for
their home games, but beyond that they play a vital role in the
communities in which they are based. Many of those clubs run youth
teams. In Dundee, I can certainly attest to the contribution that they
make to the fabric of the communities in which they are based. They
have been there for over 100 years, and have overcome many adversities,
but the new tax regime slowly being implemented seems to be posing one
of the biggest threats yet. It would be a real shame if that threat
finally became insurmountable for some of them.</p><p><a name="06060647000069">There are many competing views
as to why the Revenue started its actions back in 2002. Some believe
that a hotshot taxman was reading the newspapers and noticed big
sponsorships that had been achieved by a couple of teams, and figured
that they deserved attention. Other people suspect that the Revenue was
getting upset about the failure of some clubs to send in their informal
tax returns and that it was therefore about time to revisit the whole
system.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 10WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000070"><b><a name="06060647000599">Dr.
Gibson:</b> My hon. Friend touches on an interesting
correlation between the success of Scots politicians in the English
Parliament in reaching high places and the preponderance of junior
clubs in their areas. Does he think that if the junior clubs were to
disappear there would be fewer Scots in high places in the English
Government?</p><p><a name="06060647000071"><b><a name="06060647000600">Mr.
McGovern:</b> I could not possibly comment on that. This is
the British Parliament and every MP is allowed to vote on every issue
regardless of their constituency.</p><p><a name="06060647000072">As I suggested, this issue
stems from the decision of one player on a fairly large retainer from a
bigger club who claimed that he did not have to sort out his tax
receipts as his club should do it for him. Whatever the reason, it
seems that big assumptions have been made on the experience of a very
limited set of teams, which has led to a regrettable
situation.</p><p><a name="06060647000073">The new
PAYE system, which many clubs are expected to introduce, replaces the
informal returns system negotiated for junior football in the 1960s by
Tam Dalyell, the former Member of Parliament for Linlithgow. That
system allowed clubs simply to submit an informal return to the Inland
Revenue each year, on which would be a full list of all the moneys that
had been paid to players over the past year, allowing the Revenue to
ensure that the players&#146; tax returns were correct and thus
ensure that it collected all the tax that was due to it. It should be
emphasised that the aim of the informal agreement was not for the clubs
to avoid tax altogether, but to ease the burden on the junior football
clubs and to place it on the individual players and the Revenue. I like
to think that that was partially in recognition of the unique role that
junior football plays in Scotland and the desire in the 1960s to help
maintain it.</p><p><a name="06060647000074">Phase one
of the PAYE introduction tended to affect clubs that had social clubs
attached to them and were more or less of a size that they could handle
a PAYE system without its destroying the club. After all, some of the
social clubs already employed staff and therefore applied PAYE to them.
It caused some problems, although not as many as have been caused by
the second tranche of the reforms.</p><p><a name="06060647000075">I want to discuss three key
areas. First, I should like to emphasise my belief that junior football
clubs are not &#147;employers&#148; as any reasonable person would
understand the term, and should not be treated as such. Secondly, where
the tax regulations have been introduced, it has been done in a manner
that has promoted rather than reduced confusion, and they have often
been perceived as incredibly unfair. Thirdly, I should like to address
the effect that the new tax regime is having on the volunteers, who are
crucial to the running of the clubs.</p>

<p><a name="06060647000076">The first problem is simply the
mistaken belief that the clubs are employers. Under the strict letter
of the law&#151;I am talking about the Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1988&#151;it is entirely possible that junior football clubs that
pay their staff &#147;emoluments&#148;, which to most of us means
bonuses, should operate a PAYE system in the payment of them. I can
therefore see why, under the strict letter of the law, the Revenue has
decided to take the position it is taking. However, it has 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 11WH</b><br>a long history of working out special exemptions for
certain areas in order to make an inflexible tax system just a little
more flexible&#151;in fact, that is exactly how the original
arrangement came about. These exemptions and arrangements are designed
to promote fairness in the tax system and to ensure that the burden of
taxation and PAYE does not fall disproportionately on some
people.</p><p><a name="06060647000077">The clubs do
not operate as normal employers would and therefore should not be
treated as employers by the tax system. I cannot think of another
&#147;employer&#148; in which the entire board running the
company&#151;if we are to call clubs that now&#151;get paid nothing
at all and give up all their time for free. That does not sound like an
employer to me. In fact, the more we examine the clubs and how they
operate, the more they sound like exactly what they are: a collection
of people who care about their local community and their local football
team enough to give up many hours to support the clubs and their
community. We are talking about a bunch of dedicated people who do not
gain financially from their enterprise and who are not necessarily cut
out to be finance directors or managing directors.</p><p><a name="06060647000078">Recently, I
received an email from a secretary at one of the junior football clubs
in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr.
Hamilton)&#151;unfortunately, he cannot be here today&#151;who
summed things up well. He said:</p><a name="06060647000527"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Most of the guys who
involve themselves in junior football clubs do it for the love of their
local team. They are not rocket scientists but what they lack in brains
they more than make up for with enthusiasm and the ability to gather
funds locally.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000079">In addition to that, we need to
be honest when we consider the sort of wages that are paid to the
players at junior football clubs. I spoke to different clubs, and I was
constantly struck by the low level of the payments that were causing
all this trouble. Admittedly some players were given signing-on fees
ranging from &#163;250 to &#163;1,000, but that aside, the
so-called &#147;wages&#148; were small sums such as &#163;5 or
&#163;10 for training sessions and away games. Again, it does not
sound as if we are talking about the sort of employer that the Revenue
would usually go after; in fact, it does not sound to me like an
employer at all.</p><p><a name="06060647000080"><b><a name="06060647000601">Mr.
Devine:</b> As my hon. Friend will know from his background as
a trade union official, employers will sometimes be involved in cases
where people are made compulsorily redundant or are unfairly dismissed.
Has he known of a case of a junior football player going to a tribunal
for unfair dismissal?</p><p><a name="06060647000081"><b><a name="06060647000602">Mr.
McGovern:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I
am unaware of any player going to a tribunal but I am sure that a few
would regard themselves as being unfairly dismissed; in football terms,
that is called a &#147;free transfer&#148;. [Hon.
Members: &#147;On your bike&#148;] Yes.</p><p><a name="06060647000082">The decision to classify the
teams as employers has other knock-on effects that are proving even
more worrying for the game: For example, some clubs are being told that
as they are now classified as employers they might have to start paying
the minimum wage to their players. That, of course, stretches the law
to whole new limits of absurdity. For example, I spoke to one 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 12WH</b><br>club that was drawn in a Scottish junior cup game at
the other end of the country. Such a journey could be from Ayrshire to
Inverness and might take nearly five hours by bus. Another four hours
at the stadium for the match and another five hours getting back home
might be involved. If the club paid every player the minimum wage, the
players would need to be paid more than &#163;75, as opposed to the
&#163;5 or &#163;10 that most players get for an away
game.</p><p><a name="06060647000083">If that were to
happen, in the words of Tom Johnston, Secretary of the Scottish Junior
Football Association:</p><a name="06060647000528"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We might as well shut
up shop tomorrow, junior football would be
finished.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000084">I know that
that is not the Government&#146;s aim and I hope that they will be
able to use good judgment to prevent such unintended
consequences.</p><p><a name="06060647000085"><b><a name="06060647000603">Jim
Sheridan:</b> My hon. Friend talks about the cost and the tax.
Does that also include the potential cost of national
insurance?</p><p><a name="06060647000086"><b><a name="06060647000604">Mr.
McGovern:</b> I understand that it would: it would include the
national minimum wage, PAYE and national insurance contributions. I
think that that is why Tom Johnston says that it would drive an awful
lot of clubs to the wall. I do not believe that the clubs are
&#147;employers&#148; in the common-sense definition of the word
and therefore I simply do not believe that they should be treated as
such.</p><p><a name="06060647000087">The
second issue that I want to raise is the implementation of the new
rules. I did some calling round and sent out speculative emails to
clubs about the problems that they had been facing in dealing with the
new tax rules. The clubs had been given a vast array of
recommendations, many of which did not correspond with what had been
told to other clubs or even to other players at the same club. Some
clubs had been told that they could provide each individual player with
a &#163;500 tax allowance, because the players provided their own
boots and shin pads and washed their own shirts at home. However, even
within one of the clubs where that happened some players had their
application for that dispensation rejected by the Revenue, which left
the club and the players rather
confused.</p><p><a name="06060647000088"><b><a name="06060647000605">Anne
Moffat:</b> Would my hon. Friend be surprised to hear
something from the meeting that I had between Midlothian and East
Lothian clubs: when they were looking for these tax exemptions, the
issue of shin pads came up and the tax inspector said that they could
not possibly have an allowance reduction on shin pads because they
could be used for a purpose other than shoving them down a
player&#146;s socks?</p><p><a name="06060647000089"><b><a name="06060647000606">Mr.
McGovern:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention,
which shows why the players and the clubs are confused. I am certainly
confused and intrigued about what other purpose a shin guard might
have; perhaps someone would enlighten me later.</p><p><a name="06060647000090">Some clubs had been told that
they could allow a tax-free expense allowance of &#163;5 for each
training session and &#163;5 more for away games. Others were told
that that was totally inadmissible and that the only allowance they
were allowed was 40p per mile for travelling to away games, while
others still were told 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 13WH</b><br>that they could also give a tax allowance of 40p per mile for travelling
to training, although I think that decision was subsequently
overruled.</p><p><a name="06060647000091">If we are
to have new rules for the clubs and expect unpaid volunteers with no
tax experience to implement them, surely there should have been rules
put in place and laid down in an easy-to-use document that all clubs
could follow. That has singularly failed to happen. On top of that, the
exceptions that are being allowed are not being laid down equally
between all clubs, which leads to even more confusion and also some
hard feeling between the clubs. That is surely not meant to
happen.</p><p><a name="06060647000092">Another area
of concern is the way the tax man has dealt with these cases. Instead
of starting the new regime from scratch at the beginning of April this
year for example, in some cases the Revenue is making clubs pay tax in
retrospect for the past two years. There are examples of clubs having
to pay bills of more than &#163;7,000 that they never had any idea
they would have to pay. For the smaller clubs, that will make a massive
difference, yet despite that, the protests seem to be met with a large
amount of indifference by the Revenue.</p><p><a name="06060647000093">The third area is the effect on
the junior football clubs. Figures from the SJFA show that the average
turnover of volunteers is usually about 3 per cent. a year. This year,
the rate has been 15 per cent. The figure tallies with the anecdotal
evidence I have received from the various clubs I have spoken to. It
may not be simply because of the tax regime and the new demands placed
on the members of the club committees. There might be other reasons,
but I think that we are sensible enough to know that the new tax regime
has had a major effect.</p><p><a name="06060647000094"><b><a name="06060647000607">Dr.
Gibson:</b> I recall that in my days playing junior football
we had to hitchhike to the Kello Rovers matches in Ayrshire and
Dumfriesshire. What happens about insurance for injuries that may occur
during those games? Is there a Government edict on players covering
their own insurance or do clubs have to take it out for them? Players
may also have other jobs.</p><p><a name="06060647000095"><b><a name="06060647000608">Mr.
McGovern:</b> I cannot give a definitive answer and I am not
sure whether there is legislation to cover that. My understanding is
that clubs take out insurance for every player so that they are
compensated for loss of earnings from their full-time job if they are
badly injured. As my hon. Friend said, the players are usually amateurs
and have other
occupations.</p><p><a name="06060647000096"><b><a name="06060647000609">Jim
Sheridan:</b> I believe that clubs take out insurance for
players if they can afford to do so, but most of them cannot afford it,
so their players live in danger of their main livelihood being
affected.</p><p><a name="06060647000097"><b><a name="06060647000610">Mr.
McGovern:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s intervention drives home
the financial constraints facing these clubs. The new tax burden is
just one more exacerbating
factor.</p><p><a name="06060647000098">The volunteers
and committee men&#151;they are overwhelmingly men&#151;are the
lifeblood of the game and without them the clubs would simply cease to
exist and the vital link that they provide for the community would
go&#151;and all for the sake of easing the bureaucracy for the Inland
Revenue.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 14WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000099">I am sure
that there must be a way through the problem, albeit that it might take
a little imagination from the Inland Revenue. Perhaps the Revenue could
design a system so that any club with player expenses below a certain
level could be allowed to use the old system and those with expenses
above that level could be put on PAYE. That would provide clarity and
allow the Revenue to get those clubs that they are obviously trying to
target to sort out their own taxes. If the limit was set high enough it
would provide protection for junior football and a long-term solution
to stop what the Revenue obviously sees as junior clubs shirking their
responsibilities. There would almost certainly be problems with that
approach, but I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister and her
many officials could be able to put their minds together and come up
with something
suitable.</p><p><a name="06060647000100">In
1997, our newly elected Labour Government published a pre-Budget report
that emphasised the need for a tax system that is not only fair to
current and future generations, but is seen to be fair. I am sure that
we all stand by that. It is obvious from the evidence that treating
junior football clubs as employers is technically legal, but will never
be seen to be fair. It is not fair to the communities in which the
clubs operate, it is not fair to the people who give their time free of
charge to provide a service to the community and it is not fair to the
many people who enjoy junior football in Scotland. I urge the Minister
to reflect on that when she
responds.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000553">10.13

up.</p><p><a name="06060647000104">My
local club, Renfrew Juniors, has had a very successful season and just
missed promotion. Like many other junior clubs, it is under pressure
from housing developers who want to build houses on its football pitch
and take facilities away from the local
community.</p><p><a name="06060647000105">I
want to paint a picture of the weekly life of committee members of a
junior football club. They are usually men, while the women usually
have to wash the football strips, socks and so on, and make the tea and
sandwiches. Unfortunate as that may be, it is the reality of
life.</p><p><a name="06060647000106">The
week begins with assessment of the injuries from the previous weekend
and dealing with the insurance company, if the club can afford
insurance and someone has been seriously injured. Committee members are
involved not just in the summer months of July and August, but in
November, December and January when they have to cut the grass, ensure
that the park is suitable for play and repair pitch marks and so on for
the weekend. They must contact sponsors to try to obtain money to keep
the ground in a suitable condition for play. They must also go to the
park on Saturday 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 15WH</b><br>mornings to ensure that the game can go ahead. All
those activities are part of a committee member&#146;s life. It may
be ridiculous, but are we going down the road of taxing washing
machines that are used to wash football
strips?</p><p><a name="06060647000107">Renfrew Junior
football club&#146;s stadium is made available to other clubs in the
community, particularly during the week, and people with particular
skills, such as plumbers and joiners, are often excused from training
in return for repairing the roof or fixing the pipes. I urge the
Minister to consider our comments
seriously.</p><p><a name="06060647000108"><b><a name="06060647000612">Mr.
Devine:</b> My hon. Friend touched on a committee
member&#146;s week and referred to finances. People go around pubs
and clubs collecting totes on Friday nights and making draws on
Sundays. They are involved all week. At a recent surgery in Fauldhouse,
a local committee member told me that I had to spend &#163;50 to
sponsor the ball if I did not want the risk of him going around the
community saying that the local MP was miserable. Fundraising is
important and happens almost
daily.</p><p><a name="06060647000109"><b><a name="06060647000613">Jim
Sheridan:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that valuable
contribution. Life as a committee member means raising money,
contacting sponsors, getting programmes printed, and making sure that
players can get to games on time and that transport is available.
Volunteers&#146; personal finances are involved because they make
telephone calls to arrange referees, contact players and so on. Those
imponderables are not taken into account and committee members often
have huge telephone bills because their clubs cannot afford to repay
them. That happens for the reasons that have been
explained.</p><p><a name="06060647000110">The
Minister kindly offered to have a meeting with interested parties later
this month. If we cannot reach a satisfactory conclusion today, I would
welcome the opportunity to meet her with other interested parties to
see whether we can reach some commonality and solve the
problem.</p><p><a name="06060647000111">I
emphasise that we are not looking for something that does not operate
elsewhere in the United Kingdom. If players are earning money above the
threshold they should pay tax and if junior football clubs are making
profits they should pay tax. The problem is that junior clubs do not
have fancy accountants and expensive lawyers. They depend on
people&#146;s own experience, and therein lies the problem. The
administration cost of the scheme will be a burden on the clubs. That
is the crux of the problem, and it could force clubs to go to the
wall.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000554">10.19

Members.</p><p><a name="06060647000113">I
congratulate the hon. Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat) on securing
the debate. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr.
McGovern) on tabling early-day motion 2178, which highlights the
concern that local clubs could go out of business because of the new
guidelines, which put too much of a burden on volunteers who cannot
cope with an extra work load.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 16WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000114">I am sure that I am not alone is
being able to cite several examples of local clubs, whether football
clubs, social clubs or cricket clubs, that are run by small groups of
volunteers who give hours of their time just to keep the club afloat.
Those people cannot now be expected to look after players&#146; tax
affairs as
well.</p><p><a name="06060647000115">There
is a real danger that people will end their involvement with local
clubs, forcing many to close, simply because when one or two walk away,
there is no one left who is prepared to run them. The more serious
problem with the changes is the Government&#146;s decision to chase
the tax back to 2003. I understand that, as a result, some clubs face
bills of thousands of pounds in back
taxes.</p><p><a name="06060647000116">Two people run
a club that I know about. One of them runs the bar, does the
maintenance work, fills in the grant applications, acts as security
when local yobs who are hanging about cause damage, cuts the grass and
even referees the matches. In his spare time, he has a full-time job,
too. I am sure that, given the prospect of having to fill in forms
about his players&#146; tax affairs, he is likely to think that it is
time to call it a day. The club is run on a shoestring and it simply
cannot afford to pay an accountant to sort out its taxes. I also
suspect that if the club were faced with a demand for back taxes
covering the past three years, it would probably be unable to
pay.</p><p><a name="06060647000117">The hon. Member
for East Lothian made a number of valid points, especially in relation
to the benefits that such junior clubs bring to young people by keeping
them off the streets, giving them something good to do, making a
difference to their lives and keeping them fit and healthy. She also
made a valid point about the payments that are made to such players. I
shall be interested to hear from the Minister the effect that the rule
changes might have on the money that must be paid to players. Will they
eventually have to be paid the minimum wage? No doubt that would mean a
massive increase in costs to
clubs.</p><p><a name="06060647000118">The hon. Member
for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) produced the morning&#146;s best soundbite
when he said that we should have tax breaks, not tax burdens. That is a
valid point.</p><p><a name="06060647000119"><b><a name="06060647000615">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> There is a tax break, and it was introduced
three years
ago.</p><p><a name="06060647000120"><b><a name="06060647000616">Mr.
Leech:</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification, but I
still think it is a good soundbite.</p><p><a name="06060647000121">The hon. Member for Dundee,
West conducted us on an excellent geographical tour of practically
every constituency in Scotland, except those in the highlands and
islands and that of Orkney and Shetland. I hope for his sake that he
did not miss out any clubs, because that could be damaging for him
locally.</p><p><a name="06060647000122">We need a
common-sense approach. It is crazy that Revenue and Customs is expected
to chase tax payments, in some cases on as little as &#163;10 wages.
Surely taxpayers&#146; money would be better spent ensuring that top
earners, including a number of premiership footballers, pay the right
amount of tax. If the Government are determined to continue with their
policy, it would make far more sense for them to consider the turnover
of sports clubs and set a limit over which clubs would be expected to
sort out their 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 17WH</b><br>players&#146; tax affairs. A club&#146;s turnover provides an
indication of its size and scale, and therefore whether it can afford
to employ an accountant, or whether it must use somebody who is capable
of undertaking that work from within the club.</p><p><a name="06060647000123">I also seek the
Minister&#146;s clarification on the cost of recovering such a
relatively small amount of money. Has there been an assessment of what
tax revenue the changes will raise? Will the amount raised cover the
cost of chasing it? Will she also provide some information about the
relative success of the pilot scheme that I have read about? What
effect has it had on the viability of the clubs involved? Have any gone
out of business, or are any under threat of going out of business in
the near future.</p><p><a name="06060647000124">The
Government should also consider the viability of backdating the change
to 2003. Local clubs are struggling to pay the bills that they expect
to receive, never mind those that are suddenly dumped on them. If the
Government are not prepared to review their decision, clubs should be
given more opportunity to phase in the changes. They should not be
chased for back payments.</p><p><a name="06060647000125">It is clear from the concerns
that local clubs have raised that the changes will have a serious
impact on the viability of a number of them. Any additional revenue
could be cancelled out by lost revenue as other clubs go out of
business. The Government need to rethink their strategy, and I look
forward to hearing what the Minister has to
say.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000555">10.25

Paul Goodman (Wycombe) (Con):</b> Mr. Chope, it is a pleasure
to see you in the Chair. I shall also be brief, because much of the
ground has already been covered. I shall begin by congratulating the
hon. Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat) on securing the debate. She
has been involved with early day motion 2178, as has her hon. Friend
the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern).</p><p><a name="06060647000127">I am far from an expert on the
world of junior football clubs in Scotland, and I suspect that the
opportunities for me to enlarge my knowledge will be limited, but from
what the hon. Lady and hon. Gentlemen said, one point came over loud
and clear to me and, I am sure, to the House: the great social and
cultural importance to the whole community of the clubs whose financial
livelihoods seem to her and her colleagues to be under threat from the
change that has been made. Football is not just a common language. The
hon. Lady mentioned the World cup, and I was very amused by the banter
between some Government Back Benchers who seem more inclined to support
Rangers, and others who might be more inclined to support Celtic. Even
though my knowledge of football in Scotland is limited, it is extensive
enough to clock that. More seriously, football is not just a common
language, but a neutral space&#151;an odd way of putting it, but
accurate&#151;in which, as the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)
said, people from different backgrounds and cultures who might not mix
in other circumstances can come together. That is why, as he said, the
police are so often interested in building up community football, and
why a threat to the financial future of such clubs is so
serious.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 18WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000128">If I understand the situation
correctly, players in junior clubs were minding their own tax affairs
and the clubs were muddling along happily, building up a community,
building up football and playing a role in their communities&#151;and
then the change occurred. Like other hon. Members, I am not clear on
why the Inland Revenue made the change, whether a local department made
it, or the degree to which the decision had national backing. I would
be grateful to the Paymaster General if she cleared that up; I am sure
that she will.</p><p><a name="06060647000129">The
change will have a knock-on effect, because clubs will, in effect,
become employers. Government Back Benchers brought up many examples of
what that might mean in practice. I think that it was the hon. Member
for East Lothian who said that clubs might have to pay the minimum
wage. It is the first time that I have ever heard a Labour Back Bencher
express any reservations about paying the minimum wage, but in those
circumstances I can understand why she is concerned. Other examples
followed, including whether shin pads will be taxed. One enters such
territory if one changes the nature of taxation.</p><p><a name="06060647000130">As Labour Members said&#151;I
did not get the details, but I understand the general
picture&#151;the people who make such clubs work are not
professionals but essentially amateurs. They love what they do, and
they support the club because it is a community endeavour. Now, they
will have to deal with extremely complicated tax arrangements that will
stretch their expertise. That will clearly be a problem for the
clubs.</p><p><a name="06060647000131">As well as
asking the Paymaster General to give us a few more details of how the
change arose, I should like her to comment on the element of
retrospection and back payment, which, on the face of it, seems a bit
questionable. I would also be grateful if she explained the wider
implications&#151;if there are any&#151;of the change for other
clubs and societies, including those involved in sport. She may have to
finish off this point at the meeting that she will attend with her
colleagues, but what can she do to find a way forward that will allow
the clubs a bit of space, so that they can find a balance that allows
them to pay the tax that they should pay without imperilling their
financial future? We look forward to hearing what the right hon. Lady
has to
say.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000556">10.30

the debate. A lot of important issues have been raised and I welcome
the opportunity to discuss them.</p><p><a name="06060647000133">Reinforced by
other speakers, my hon. Friend spoke about nurturing talent and helping
young people, although I think that we are all clear that
&#147;junior clubs&#148; refers to the leagues in which they are
involved, not to the age of the players. I absolutely agree with her on
the importance in local communities of clubs, whether football clubs or
any other kind. I understand only too clearly from my own constituency
experience how important those amateur arrangements are, so I have been
genuinely perplexed&#151;both by correspondence that I have received
and, at times, by the debate today&#151;about the precise nature of
the problem that is that is being identified. However, I shall try to
deal with the points made.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 19WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000134">At
the outset, I want to make it clear that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs is not proposing any change to the long-standing informal
arrangements operated by smaller community clubs. I am not sure that I
can put it any more clearly than that. I was asked what goes on in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We are seeking the same treatment
in Scotland as in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Whether I happen
to represent an English constituency is irrelevant; I know that my hon.
Friend the Member for East Lothian and other hon. Friends feel as
strongly as I do that what is important is nurturing talent anywhere in
the United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06060647000135">When football
clubs of whatever status in England, Wales and Northern Ireland make
payments that represent profit to players over 16, they are obliged to
operate pay-as-you-earn. As is the case for any employer, when HMRC
discovers that a club should be operating PAYE, it requires it to do
so. That is what we are discussing today. We are talking about a
minority of clubs where quite significant sums of money can be
involved.</p><p><a name="06060647000136"><b><a name="06060647000619">Jim
Sheridan:</b> Will my right hon. Friend give
way?</p><p><a name="06060647000137"><b><a name="06060647000620">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I shall just finish my point. Such clubs will
be asked to operate PAYE.</p><p><a name="06060647000138">I was about to come to the
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire,
North (Jim Sheridan). He said quite clearly that hon. Members
contributing to the debate were not asking for anything different from
what operates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The hon. Member
for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech) talked about using the
common-sense approach. I agree with him and I hope to explain to him
what I understand that approach to be. We could then pursue that
question if it is not settled here
today.</p><p><a name="06060647000139"><b><a name="06060647000621">Jim
Sheridan:</b> Will the Paymaster General define in
layman&#146;s terms what she means by profit? Is &#163;1, or
&#163;1,000, or &#163;50
profit?</p><p><a name="06060647000140"><b><a name="06060647000622">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> That is at the heart of some of the questions
asked. Frankly, the point made by the hon. Member for Manchester,
Withington, about pursuing a club for &#163;10 is just daft&#151;it
would not happen&#151;so let us try to lay out clearly what is going
on.</p><p><a name="06060647000141"><b><a name="06060647000623">Mr.
McGovern:</b> My right hon. Friend refers to clubs as
employers who have responsibility for PAYE. Can she define who in the
clubs would be responsible for administering PAYE? Would it be the
unpaid community
volunteers?</p><p><a name="06060647000142"><b><a name="06060647000624">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I will come to that, but let us just keep the
matter in perspective. As I understand it, there are 164 of the clubs
in question. Forty-five of them are larger&#151;I shall come later to
how they got to be larger and to the sort of sums that we are talking
about. They have been asked&#151;and they have agreed&#151;to
operate PAYE from 2005-06. That is the position with regard to the
clubs. As all my hon. Friends have acknowledged, tax and national
insurance law requires employers to operate PAYE and class 1 national
insurance. Those requirements apply to all employers, no matter how 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 20WH</b><br>large or small, whether they are running a business,
a club, a voluntary organisation, or even just employing a nanny in
their own home.</p><p><a name="06060647000143">In the case
of the Scottish junior football clubs, a special arrangement, to which
my hon. Friends have referred, involving an informal return was
introduced. That arrangement will not be disturbed; it is not as if it
is being taken away from all 164 clubs. That arrangement was introduced
because, at the time, except in exceptional cases, clubs paid only
small amounts to cover expenses that would not have been taxable. So
although technically the clubs were employers and should properly have
come within the scope of the PAYE rules, the informal return, which
still exists for the vast majority of clubs, was a pragmatic
simplification that saved both the club and the Revenue from having to
operate the system
fully.</p><p><a name="06060647000144">Those
arrangements simply required the club to provide a list of players and
details of payments made to each of them, and if the payment included
any profit element&#151;I shall come to the expenses issue
later&#151;that was included in the tax code relating to the
players&#146; main employment. That informal arrangement lasted a
long time. It was reviewed for two reasons&#151;this will answer the
point made by the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman). The first
reason was that the financial circumstances, in terms of the amounts
being paid, had changed for some clubs. They were no longer paying only
non-taxable reimbursements of expenses&#151;for example, those
relating to kit. By the way, kit does include shin pads; I have no idea
where the ridiculous suggestion that shin pads could be used for
something else came from. I heard clearly what was said about that, so
I am saying clearly now that it is an expense. Many clubs are paying
substantially greater sums in real terms than they were in the 1960s,
and there can now be a real profit element involved. That causes issues
at the boundary as they move away from the amateur reimbursement of
expenses.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0120.htm"/>


<p><a name="06060647000145">The second
reason for reviewing the arrangement was that under the old
system&#151;I suppose the question is why it has taken so long to get
to this point, but never mind&#151;the informal arrangement meant
that things would be picked up through the tax system with the
employer, but the introduction of self-assessment in 1997 cut across
that, because it was no longer possible to identify third-party
information. It therefore became difficult to determine a
person&#146;s tax liability. I can see you smiling Mr. Chope. You are
no doubt very familiar with this problem from your constituency
experience. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Did someone ask me to
give
way?</p><p><a name="06060647000146"><b><a name="06060647000625">Jim
Sheridan:</b> I was making reference to my right hon.
Friend&#146;s comments about you smiling, Mr. Chope. You are familiar
with all these tax complexities. Unfortunately, that is not true of
most of the people who will be burdened by the
administration.</p><p><a name="06060647000147">On a separate
point, my right hon. Friend said earlier that out of 164 clubs, 45 fall
into the category of making a profit. Will she make available a list of
the 45 so that we can make an assessment of
it?</p><p><a name="06060647000148"><b><a name="06060647000626">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I will certainly try to do that. I was smiling
at Mr. Chope because I was thinking of his Public Accounts Committee
experience. As a Minister, I am used to the probing questions that it
rightly asks.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 21WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000149">Regarding
the list of clubs, I have asked for that information. I would prefer to
have it myself, but it is covered by taxpayer confidentiality. If we
can find some way of getting those clubs to agree to the disclosure of
their names by HMRC, I will be more than happy to pass it on.</p><p><a name="06060647000150">There is no
question of backdating the system to 2004. The clubs have agreed to
operate the system&#151;I shall give some examples of the things that
cause difficulty&#151;and as far as we are concerned, the remainder
of the 164 clubs are covered by the informal arrangements. Of that
remainder, 11 have not submitted an informal return for a number of
years&#151;that is where the point about 2004 comes in&#151;or
their returns do not make sense. A further discussion will take place
with those clubs, which I hope will resolve the
matter.</p><p><a name="06060647000151">Let us
consider the sort of things we are talking about. Some clubs have been
asked and have agreed to operate PAYE under exactly the same
arrangements for clubs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It may
be that they have received substantial sponsorship. It varies from the
fixed amount, but it could be anything from &#163;3,000 to
&#163;200 for advertising at the ground. These amounts, together with
gate receipts&#151;which can be up to &#163;1,000 per game for some
clubs&#151;and other forms of supported income, help to finance
payments to players and coaches. We are trying to ensure that the
informal arrangement works in the way agreed and that the rules are
applied.</p><p><a name="06060647000152">There is no
intention to add burdens to what we all agree are perfectly reasonable
arrangements. The review referred to commonly made payments, such as
signing fees for players that can vary from &#163;150 to
&#163;2,000 per player, averaging at &#163;800. Those are not
insubstantial amounts. One club paid a player &#163;100 per week.
During the review, when the treasurer of one club was asked what
happened to the balance of &#163;400 in gate receipts in a particular
week after all other disbursements&#151;payments, expenses, running
costs and so on&#151;had been made, he said that the club simply paid
it to the players by dividing it equally. That falls outside the
informal arrangement, which is what the HMRC is trying to deal
with.</p><p><a name="06060647000153">I absolutely
agree with all the pleas that my hon. Friend are making. Where the
informal arrangements are working, that is fine: the majority are, and
should be, left undisturbed by the recent changes. We should find ways
of ensuring a sensible outcome for clubs that have moved beyond the
circumstances with which the informal arrangements were designed to
deal. Such clubs have agreed to operate
PAYE.</p><p><a name="06060647000154"><b><a name="06060647000627">Mr.
Devine:</b> My right hon. Friend seems to be contradicting
herself. Perhaps she can help me because at the beginning of her
contribution she said that there has been no change, but she then said
that she wants to bring Scotland into line with England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Can clubs still operate the informal arrangement? Can
I go back to the junior football clubs in my constituency and say,
&#147;The Minister is telling me very clearly that nothing has
changed and you can continue to operate the informal arrangement. You
can tell the tax department where to get
off&#148;?</p><p><a name="06060647000155"><b><a name="06060647000628">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Yes, as long as that club is not paying a
profit element, which was never part of the informal arrangement. As
long as clubs are not doing 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 22WH</b><br>that, they still fall squarely within the informal arrangement. It is a
question of the profit element and the payments over and above the
norm. I am not referring to reimbursement of expenses or other such
matters, but the sharing of the profit element from the club. My point
about England, Wales and Northern Ireland is that that is how the rules
operate in those
countries.</p><p><a name="06060647000156"><b><a name="06060647000629">Dr.
Gibson:</b> My right hon. Friend made the point clearly and
effectively about the distribution of profit among the players. Has she
any evidence of how often players do not get paid because the club is
in some dire trouble? Players may have to take a cut in wages, or
receive no wages at all. I bet that that happens quite
frequently.</p><p><a name="06060647000157"><b><a name="06060647000630">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I do not have the evidence to hand, but in
circumstances where clubs are squarely within the arrangements for
amateur clubs&#151;this is also the case in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland&#151;there is no PAYE requirement. We are talking
about the sharing of payments over and above a certain point and how
that should be declared. I want to make it absolutely clear to my hon.
Friends that we have not suddenly decided that all 164 amateur clubs,
the value of which has been clearly outlined today, have to apply PAYE
rules. They are not being asked to do that; that is not
happening.</p><p><a name="06060647000158"><b><a name="06060647000631">Mr.
McGovern:</b> My right hon. Friend mentions 45 clubs that have
agreed to operate PAYE. Would she explain what prompted that? Did those
clubs simply come forward and volunteer to adopt PAYE or were they
chased up by the Inland Revenue? How did the change happen?</p><p><a name="06060647000159">My right hon. Friend
may be coming on to answer the question I asked earlier, but if a club
is regarded as an employer, who is responsible for returning the PAYE
forms?</p><p><a name="06060647000160"><b><a name="06060647000632">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I shall double check how the change came to
pass. I hope that I am giving my hon. Friend the correct information,
but I believe that in some areas the informal returns, which are
considered periodically on a compliance basis, raised questions about
whether clubs had moved beyond the exact requirement in the informal
arrangements. That goes on all the time in the tax system and makes
sure that the system operates as it should. I am taking part in the
Committee on the Finance Bill, which attempts to do that every
year.</p><p><a name="06060647000161">It is my
understanding that the treasurer and secretary are responsible for the
informal return. It would depend on the structure of the club, I
suppose, but I presume that they would be required to do it. My problem
in answering my hon. Friend&#146;s question is that I do not know in
how many different ways I can say that the vast majority of such clubs
will still fall within the informal return arrangements and that that
is where they will stay.</p><p><a name="06060647000162">There has
been considerable discussion with the Scottish Junior Football
Association since 2002 about the problems and the need to clarify the
arrangements. The new provision was not simply dreamed up. Questions
arose about what was happening in some clubs, which were 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 23WH</b><br>then raised with the clubs. Discussions took place and 45 clubs have
agreed to operate PAYE if it is necessary for the payments that are to
do with making a payment&#151;a wage, or a share of the
profits&#151;other than the reimbursement of
expenses.</p><p><a name="06060647000163"><b><a name="06060647000633">Anne
Moffat:</b> My experience is that the clubs in my constituency
have had PAYE imposed on them by the Inland Revenue, not that they have
happily agreed to do it. Would my right hon. Friend look favourably on
the clubs that are saying that that is the
case?</p><p><a name="06060647000164"><b><a name="06060647000634">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I would certainly look favourably on clubs that
take the view that they have been unreasonably asked to operate PAYE,
but if they are making payments that are, in effect, a wage or a share
of profits and that take them beyond the informal relationship, they
have put themselves under the law that every employer in this country
has to apply if they make payments in a particular way. I cannot say on
the Floor of the House that we will let some employers not operate the
system. That would be a disaster in the exploitation of
people.</p><p><a name="06060647000165">We have
entirely reasonably said that we need an informal arrangement when
clubs are amateur and are not making such payments. They should not
have any contact with the tax authorities, but should simply complete a

General might be right that one person might get &#163;100, but if we
are saying that at least 45 clubs must now accept that they are
employers what will that mean for them? Will everyone who plays for
them attract the minimum wage? Will they attract national insurance

employer status in one season. It could go on a cup run, get a lot of
money in and pay some of that money out, but if in the next season it
was knocked out in the first round of the cup, it would be back to the

hope that it will be conducted in a spirit of inquiry and
thoughtfulness. I am a member of the Education and Skills Committee and
I am constantly struck by the degree of cross-party consensus and
co-operation that I find there. I hope that our debate will be
conducted in a similar
spirit.</p><p><a name="06060647000189">I
do not wish to score party political points. Indeed, I see opposite me
some of the Labour Members with whom I voted on the Education and
Inspections Bill. We joined together in the Lobby to get that Bill
through the
House.</p><p><a name="06060647000190"><b><a name="06060647000652">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> The hon.
Gentleman did not vote with me. The only other person on the Government
Benches who voted with him is the Minister, and I would expect
that.</p><p><a name="06060647000191"><b><a name="06060647000653">Mr.
Carswell:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for pointing
that out; it is indeed the case. I hope that the Minister and other
Members will join together if not in the Lobby, then in this Chamber
today, to find some consensus on how to improve
education.</p><p><a name="06060647000192">It
needs to be said at the outset that not all schools with independence
are good and that not all schools that conform to the micro-detail of
Government diktat are necessarily bad. Far from it. We need to be
careful not to assume that independent automatically necessarily means
better.</p><p><a name="06060647000193">I acknowledge
the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr.
Leigh), whose most excellent pamphlet on setting our schools free
largely inspired the debate.</p><p><a name="06060647000194">In office,
political parties are inclined to argue that things are generally
better than they are; in opposition, they are sometimes tempted to
argue that things are worse than they sometimes are. My criticisms of
the education system are not directed at any one Government. I want to
make a broader point about failures in our education system that I
believe are a product of a centralist system that has been in place for
20 or 30 years, if not longer.</p><p><a name="06060647000195">The following facts prove that
there is a problem in our education system. A quarter of 11-year-olds
cannot read or write sufficiently well to allow them to tackle the
secondary school curriculum. One in five school leavers are
functionally illiterate and innumerate. The state has supposedly been
looking after them and educating them for nine years, but it has failed
in its most basic
task.</p><p><a name="06060647000196">Many school
leavers arrive at university without the basic literary skills that
they need for their coursework. That failure has been masked by
extraordinary grade inflation. For example, between 1992 and 2002, when
Governments of both parties were in office, the proportion of A grades
awarded at A-level rose from 13 per cent. to nearly double that
figure.</p><p><a name="06060647000197">Those are the
facts. However, we can debate the reason for that failure. I contend
that the education system is failing because of over-centralisation and
the 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 27WH</b><br>quango state that administers our education system. That system is run
at the behest of remote quangos and remote elites&#151;schools
adjudicators, curriculum and qualifications authorities and
unaccountable bureaucrats in the local education authorities. Remote
elites make decisions; local pupils, schools and parents take the rap.
That is how our education system is run&#151;almost regardless of
which Minister holds
office.</p><p><a name="06060647000198">The quango
state has run education not only badly in terms of output, but
incredibly inefficiently. It has been estimated that about 45 per cent.
of education spend does not go to the schools, but is sucked up by the
education quango establishment. Those quangos&#151;for instance, the
Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, with its plush offices in
London&#151;always seem to have enough money for such things.
Regardless of the fact that there might not be enough teachers in the
classroom, local education authorities never seem to run out of
bureaucrats.</p><p><a name="06060647000199">The
quango state absorbs an extraordinarily large amount of money that
ought to be going to schools. The national curriculum is devised by
distant experts. Targets and guidelines are set and imposed on schools.
That process began in the early 1990s, if not before, but in recent
years it has turned into an avalanche. Centralism is the problem. If we
are honest, we will admit that Governments of all parties since the
1970s have thought that they could run education better from the
centre.</p><p><a name="06060647000200">Some
on my side of the House might be tempted to mention grant-maintained
schools. They might have been decentralising, but whatever freedoms the
schools gained from their LEAs were offset by greater scrutiny and
accountability through the national curriculum and targets set by
central Government. Grant-maintained schools show how not to set
schools free, as the mechanisms for further central control remained in
place.</p><p><a name="06060647000201">Instead, we
need a bold new approach to decentralisation to devolve not so much
just to town halls, but directly to parents, pupils and the schools
themselves. We need to take power and responsibility away from the
quango state and devolve it downwards directly to the
users.</p><p><a name="06060647000202"><b><a name="06060647000654">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> I congratulate my hon.
Friend on securing this important debate; I know how passionately he
feels about the subject. Each year, we all have constituents who are
heartbroken to find that their child or children cannot go to the
school they wish to go to because the local education authority has not
provided enough places in that school. Does he agree that, in a radical
overhaul of our school system, we must ensure that good schools can
expand?</p><p><a name="06060647000203"><b><a name="06060647000655">Mr.
Carswell:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I and many
other Members have been approached an extraordinary number of times by
parents who cannot understand why they are not allowed to exercise
effective choice because of arbitrary boundaries and catchment areas.
The system is wrong, and it needs to be
changed.</p><p><a name="06060647000204">We need to
set schools free, and we could begin by allowing schools to control
their own admissions 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 28WH</b><br>policies. We should allow schools to have charitable status&#151;what
we might call trust status&#151;and the freedom to set their own
budgets. I shall say in a moment how we need to reform funding of the
education system.</p><p><a name="06060647000205"><b><a name="06060647000656">David
Taylor:</b> A moment ago, the hon. Gentleman suggested that a
characteristic of an ideal system would be parents being able to get
their children into the school of their choice, but he went on to speak
of schools having their own admission criteria. Would not that mean
schools selecting children rather than the other way
round?</p><p><a name="06060647000206"><b><a name="06060647000657">Mr.
Carswell:</b> I believe that if we gave schools the ability to
manage their own admissions, in a few instances safeguards would need
to be built in. For example, in a remote rural village where there was
no effective choice, safeguards might be needed to ensure that no child
was left out of the system and that no child was left behind. However,
the number of cases in which such safeguards would have to apply would
be few and far between. In most cases&#151;indeed,
overwhelmingly&#151;if schools were allowed to set their own
admissions criteria, few children would be excluded. There would always
be a school for them. A school different from the one they attend at
the moment might have to be chosen, but there would be effective
choice.</p><p><a name="06060647000207">Constituencies
such as mine have a number of secondary schools, and if we were to
scrap the arbitrary catchment areas, we would allow people a choice
that they are currently denied.</p><p><a name="06060647000208"><b><a name="06060647000658">Mr.
Jeremy Browne (Taunton) (LD):</b> I am a governor of a
secondary school in Taunton. We recently had to appoint a new head
teacher, and I was amazed by how little discretion the governors had in
deciding the salary. Drawing on the point that the hon. Gentleman was
making about allowing head teachers and governing bodies more budgetary
discretion, should they have more freedom to, for example, pay or
reward a distinguished teacher of French who has made the school
admired throughout the area? A straitjacket seems to have been imposed
on head teachers, which makes it difficult for them to reward
excellence&#151;and, for that matter, to allow greater advances in
other parts of the
school.</p><p><a name="06060647000209"><b><a name="06060647000659">Mr.
Carswell:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#151;given his comments, I
am tempted to call him my hon. Friend&#151;is absolutely right. He
has given a good example of why greater flexibility and freedom for
schools to set their own budgets, hire staff and set the terms and
conditions for doing so could benefit individual
schools.</p><p><a name="06060647000210">The idea that
we should determine such things centrally is wrong. As part of the
package of independence, we should give schools the ability to hire
staff&#151;and, indeed, to fire them. With one or two safeguards, as
teased out by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David
Taylor), schools could manage their own budgets, determine their own
admissions criteria, and set the terms and conditions for hiring their
staff.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 29WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000211">Schools would also have the
freedom to set their own curricula. On balance, we have come to the
point of needing to advocate the abolition of the national curriculum.
Some will be surprised to hear that, but my view is that the national
curriculum&#151;the nationalisation of the curriculum&#151;has not
imposed the greater rigour and higher standards that it was supposed to
impose. In fact, in many instances it has done the opposite of what its
architects initially intended. If schools were allowed to set their own
curricula, those of us on the centre right would be reassured that we
were likely to get a more &#147;small c&#148; conservative
curriculum. There would be diversity and choice; people could shop
around for a school with a curriculum that they wished
for.</p><p><a name="06060647000212"><b><a name="06060647000660">Mr.
Nick Gibb (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con):</b> What
would happen if all the schools in a certain county or area decided not
to adopt the kind of curriculum that parents want, and their head
teachers decided to adopt a very progressive and dumbed down
curriculum? What would happen to parents and children in such areas,
which would offer no effective choice of a high-quality
school?</p><p><a name="06060647000213"><b><a name="06060647000661">Mr.
Carswell:</b> I cannot think of a single county in the country
in which that would be the case if there were effective school
independence and parental choice. However, I can think of a number of
counties in which an extremely progressive curriculum is imposed with
almost zero parental choice and almost zero freedom for schools to do
differently. Under my scheme, we would get choice and a conservative
outcome in terms of the content of the curriculum. Under the current
system, there is a very non-conservative curriculum, and there is very
little that parents can do about
that.</p><p><a name="06060647000214">I am not here to
argue for a return to grant-maintained schools. There were errors to do
with the centralised system of funding in the grant-maintained system.
Nor am I here to defend the local education authorities; under my
scheme, I would be happy to see certain aspects of the LEAs wither
away.</p><p><a name="06060647000215">Instead of
centralising how local government manages its education budgets, we
should try another, non-centralising way&#151;a third way, if you
like&#151;of devolving control over school budgets. We could give
every parent in the country the legal right to request and receive, in
non-cash form, their share of their child&#146;s local authority
budget allocation. That share could be weighted by age, geography or
indicators of social deprivation to ensure greater equity&#151;I
admit that.</p><p><a name="06060647000216">Allowing
parents the legal right to request and receive their child&#146;s
share of the local authority budget could be done simply and would
ensure that there was effective choice, which is lacking under the
current system. It could be done through a relatively simple,
straightforward two-line Bill in Parliament and judicial fiat. The
courts could ensure that it took effect.</p><p><a name="06060647000217">What I suggest is not the same
as some hideously complicated, centrally run, top-down national voucher
scheme. Imagine the potential for IT failure under such a scheme; one
has only to consider the history of some of the big Government IT
projects to see what might happen. Nor do we need a new funding quango.
That would enable future Governments of left or right to 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 30WH</b><br>attach conditions to schools or parents for receipt of the funding. A
simple legal right for parents to request and receive their share of
local authority funding would solve the
problem.</p><p><a name="06060647000218">In looking
back at the history of the national curriculum and of a centralised
system of funding for grant-maintained schools, we see clearly a lesson
that we on the centre right need to learn: rigour and higher standards
cannot be imposed top-down, but will come about through being driven
from the bottom up. To ensure that that happens, we need not only to
set schools free and give them greater independence, but to give
parents effective
choice.</p><p><a name="06060647000219"><b><a name="06060647000662">The
Minister for Schools (Jim Knight):</b> I am intrigued by the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. Will he outline the difference
between what he advocates and the pupil&#146;s passport, which was
his party&#146;s policy when he was elected at the general
election?</p><p><a name="06060647000220"><b><a name="06060647000663">Mr.
Carswell:</b> The pupil&#146;s passport is quite a
centralising, complicated, formulaic measure. I must be frank: I never
entirely understood its mechanisms, and I am not a big advocate of the
big Government IT projects that such a scheme would necessarily entail.
Given the history of the passport scheme at the Home Office, I do not
think that a scheme with similar IT complications is called for in
education.</p><p><a name="06060647000221"><b><a name="06060647000664">David
Taylor:</b> The hon. Gentleman has a well deserved reputation
for being refreshingly open and frank. Will he comment on a policy that
his party has promoted for much of the time since 1997? His party has
not yet put the policy of having a grammar school in every town into
the grave with a stake through its heart. Does he think that that
policy would be popular with people and
parents?</p><p><a name="06060647000222"><b><a name="06060647000665">Mr.
Carswell:</b> I began this debate by saying that I would try
to bring a thoughtful spirit of inquiry to the Chamber, and I hope that
we shall retain
that.</p><p><a name="06060647000223">When people talk
about grammar schools, emotions quite often take over and the debate
starts to generate more heat than light. I am not opposed to the
extension of grammar schools, of which there are about 167 in the
country, but I am much more interested in having a debate about
education that would improve the quality of life of all our children in
all schools in the country. We need a debate far wider than an
exclusive discussion of grammar schools. By all means, we can debate
those schools, but I deliberately phrased the title of the debate so
that it focused on the interests of the many, not the
few.</p><p><a name="06060647000224">It is important
that any policy should be assessed according to the impact that it
might have on the most vulnerable. I feel that strongly, given my
experience with children with special educational needs in my
constituency. If we are to give schools greater independence and
parents effective power, we need to ask ourselves about the impact that
that might have on the more vulnerable in our education
system.</p><p><a name="06060647000225">For me, the
key critical test, first and foremost, is whether such children would
be better off. We could come up with a system that ensured that. Too
often, the statementing process to which those with special 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 31WH</b><br>educational needs are subjected has put vulnerable individuals at the
mercy of education experts. Such children have been more dependent on
remote experts and, on occasion, have suffered as a
result.</p><p><a name="06060647000226">The
immoral policy of enforced inclusion and the immoral closure of
specialist schools, such as the Leas school in Clacton in my
constituency, which help those with special educational needs, are
further manifestations of what happens when schools, parents and pupils
surrender their independence to experts happy to dictate what they
believe is right for other people&#146;s children.</p><p><a name="06060647000227">By reforming the statementing
process, we could ensure that greater independence meant that children
with special educational needs were better off. Such children&#146;s
statements should not only be specific in spelling out what is
necessary to help them, but include a form of financial entitlement
that indicates the LEA money to which the child is entitled to have
their needs met. If we introduced such a system and made schools more
independent, we could show that, demonstrably, the more vulnerable
children in our education system benefited the
most.</p><p><a name="06060647000228">I shall wrap up
my remarks and open the Floor to debate by drawing a few conclusions.
There will be those who are opposed to ideas about parent power and
setting schools free. Those who oppose greater independence for parents
and schools are, in essence, stuck in a regressive 1950s mindset. It is
progressive to give parents greater choice and to set schools free. The
days of deference to remote experts are rightly over. We who argue for
school independence and parental choice are the real progressives now.
We need a system of education that offers genuine pluralism that cannot
be dictated from the centre, and with pluralism and choice will come
genuine innovation.</p><p><a name="06060647000229">To
conclude, the only people in this room who are experts on what is right
for children are those of us who are parents and who have the expertise
to decide what is right for our child. The days of national politicians

Edward Leigh (Gainsborough) (Con):</b> I am delighted to
follow my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell), who has
made an excellent and thoughtful speech. He is right to use the
mechanism of this alternative Chamber to have an alternative kind of
debate in which we are less concerned with day-to-day politics and more
concerned about developing long-term policy and, indeed, philosophy. I
hesitate to use the word &#147;philosophy&#148; in the House of
Commons, as I do not want to be accused of being an intellectual, which
would be political
death.</p><p><a name="06060647000231">My hon. Friend
made an important contribution in the way that he introduced this
debate. He was kind enough to mention a pamphlet that I recently
penned, but I claim no particular credit for any ideas in it, as it
contains nothing new. There is little that is new in the debate on
education. Many of these ideas have been around for many years, but I
believe that there is a new determination to question all existing
orthodoxies and to be prepared to consider what happens in other parts
of the world and, indeed, Europe.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 32WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000232">There is extraordinary diversity
in educational provision in other parts of Europe. There is not a view
in other European countries that there must be only one educational
model. For instance, Sweden, which has a tradition of many years of
social democratic government&#151;centre-left government with short
periods of centre-right government&#151;has introduced a radical
universal voucher scheme, which imposes controls on admissions. The
scheme has resulted in an explosion of new, privately run schools that
appear to be popular and to cater for a
need.</p><p><a name="06060647000233">In Holland,
which does not have a reputation for being a particularly conservative
country, there has long been a tradition of the state, in effect,
funding private schools. In France, the salaries of teachers in private
schools are paid by the state. There is not a view in other European
countries that there must be a great divide between the public and
private sectors.</p><p><a name="06060647000234">In
that context, I welcome the speech which I understand the leader of my
party gave today in which he praised people who work in the public
sector. It has always been the view of the Conservative party that we
must mix and match. One cannot say as a general proposition that the
public sector or the private sector is always best. We are prepared to
advocate a public-private partnership, which exists in other countries
but not in this one. In this country, where the fees of most private
schools are way beyond what most ordinary people can afford, only 7 per
cent. of children go to private schools. How can most of the people who
work in the public sector, for instance, possibly afford boarding
school fees of up to &#163;18,000 a year, or private school fees of
perhaps &#163;9,000 or &#163;10,000 a year, out of taxed income?
The situation is different in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and
Holland, where there is extraordinary
diversity.</p><p><a name="06060647000235">However,
let us not discuss private schools only. Other European countries are
moving away from central direction of state education, so let us
discuss that for a moment. Speaking as a parent, I know a great deal
about French education. I sent all my children to the French
lyc&#233;e in London for a time. My mother and father were brought up
in France. That country&#146;s education system has a reputation for
being centrally driven. There is a joke that the Minister of Education
in Paris knows that at 10.30 on a Wednesday morning, every child in
France is opening the same geography textbook, but that simply is not
true anymore. For many years, France has been moving away from a
centrally driven education
system.</p><p><a name="06060647000236">Incidentally,
it is also instructive that most middle-class parents in France are
happy to use state education, wherever they live. It is of an excellent
standard, and we must ask why that is the case. I have alluded to the
private schools in France and the fact that salaries in those schools
are paid by the state. People use such schools for a particular
purpose, but most people are happy with state education, which,
increasingly, is not centrally
driven.</p><p><a name="06060647000237">A point that
must be considered in this debate is whether this country has taken a
wrong turning since the 1960s. Did my party, when it was in power, make
a fundamental error? There were two things that we could have
done.</p><p><a name="06060647000238"><b><a name="06060647000667">David

<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 33WH</b><br>whose genesis was in the time of the Conservative Government, is too

abandoned?</p><p><a name="06060647000239"><b><a name="06060647000668">Mr.
Leigh:</b> I do indeed agree with my hon. Friend. Funnily
enough, yesterday I spoke at length to Chris Woodhead, the former chief
inspector of schools, about this debate. He reminded me that the
national curriculum was introduced for perfectly good reasons. We were
concerned that kids in many parts of the country did not seem to be
achieving the basic standards in education that we expected, and it was
an honest attempt to raise standards
nationally.</p><p><a name="06060647000240">The
national curriculum had a reasonably loose structure when it was
introduced, but it has become altogether too bureaucratic and
prescriptive. I agree with my hon. Friend that we could progressively
move to a system in which individual state schools are independent.
That is the vision that the Prime Minister set out in his White Paper,
which I fully support, and I believe that in his heart of hearts, he
would agree with much if not all of what my hon. Friend
said.</p><p><a name="06060647000241"><b><a name="06060647000669">Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am pleased that my hon. Friend made that
intervention. As part of this think-piece debate, it is important that
we explore such nuances and how our party would approach the problem of
improving educational standards. My hon. Friend, who is totally
committed to education, believes and has great trust that a future
Conservative Government could return the national curriculum to
something like what it was before. He is worried about the state of the
educational establishment, particularly teacher training colleges, and
believes that once he becomes a Minister&#151;we all sincerely hope
that he does become an Education Minister&#151;he can impose his
will.</p><p><a name="06060647000243">It is important
that my hon. Friend and I should conduct this friendly debate in public
as well as in private, as it informs how we will develop policy during
the next three years while we are in opposition. With respect to him,
one cannot impose one&#146;s view from the centre. Incidentally, that
is the view of Chris Woodhead and other people I know who work in the
state sector. If there are 20,000 schools in this country, that is
impossible. Whatever one says and does, whatever one&#146;s
commitment and however long one is allowed to be a Minister&#151;and
Ministers&#146; powers are somewhat limited&#151;if schools do not
agree, they will simply not go along, and my hon. Friend knows
that.</p><p><a name="06060647000244">When I have

what we know best; we&#146;re professionals.&#148; Whatever my hon.
Friend&#146;s good intentions, even if he tried to return the
national curriculum to a pure state of more traditional conservative
teaching&#151;if it were possible to devise such a thing&#151;if

wanted to ignore it, they would.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 34WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000245"><b><a name="06060647000671">Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman can clarify
something because I, too, am confused by the position advanced by the
Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). As I understand it, he said that giving
schools and head teachers greater autonomy would lead to a more uniform
curriculum. He expressed the concern that there would be a whole county
in which every school offered the same package of education. That has
not been my experience of head teachers being given greater discretion
over setting classes. Why would the official spokesman for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party be concerned about that
possibility?</p><p><a name="06060647000246"><b><a name="06060647000672">Mr.
Leigh:</b> I do not think that that would happen. If the model
that my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich discussed were accepted, and
head teachers had genuinely independent powers over their curriculum,
is it really believable that every school in an entire county or large
town would follow the same progressive model? In fact, under that
model, other schools would develop and parents would vote with their
feet. Do we have no self-confidence? As Conservatives, we believe in a
traditional form of teaching. We believe that that works and that many
modern teaching fashions have corrupted education. Do we really have so
little confidence in professionals, teachers and parents that we
believe that if they were given complete freedom, all of them in an
entire county would move to an extreme form of progressive
education?</p><p><a name="06060647000247">If that
happened, however, it would of course happen under my hon.
Friend&#146;s model presumably only because that was what teachers,
head teachers and parents wanted. If they want it, let them have
it&#151;but I do not think that it would
happen.</p><p><a name="06060647000248"><b><a name="06060647000673">Mr.

for Taunton (Mr. Browne), my comments related to what would happen if
we abolished the national curriculum, which I am totally against. To
take up my hon. Friend&#146;s point about whether Ministers can
determine matters, I am not saying that central Government can or
indeed should prescribe everything that happens in schools; what I am
saying is that Ministers can determine the content of national
curriculum documents that emanate from the Department for Education and
Skills.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0122.htm"/>


<p><a name="06060647000249">My
understanding, from what I have experienced in my current role and as
an MP for nine years, is that too often Ministers from both parties
have not been engaged in the detailed minutiae of what emanates from
the Department. We live in a democracy, where accountability rests
here, so it is important that Ministers should have detailed knowledge
of the issues and be engaged in them. An incoming Conservative
Government would take that view. I am afraid that there are too many
documents currently emanating from the Department that do not reflect
the wishes of Ministers, the public or the party in
power.</p><p><a name="06060647000250"><b><a name="06060647000674">Mr.
Leigh:</b> I wish my hon. Friend well. He is right: Ministers
can take charge and issue whichever documents they want. Whether those
documents will be obeyed in all or most schools, I do not know. That
would rather depend on whether they went with the flow of what teachers
wanted. If such documents went with the flow, they would be obeyed; if
not, they would not.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 35WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000251"><b><a name="06060647000675">Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am sorry to intervene again, for the final time,
but the point is that a lot of these documents are influential on
teachers. Most teachers with whom I come into contact are
conscientious, and will lean on documents that emanate from the DFES.
The problem, particularly with phonics and the teaching of reading, has
been that teachers have leant on the framework document but it has been
wrong. The searchlights model is the wrong method for teaching children
to read, yet many conscientious teachers, doing their best, have relied
on it to the detriment of many children&#146;s reading skills. My
point is not that we should be more prescriptive or take more powers
but that where we have influence we should use it the right way, based
on evidence of the pedagogical methods and curriculum that works and
that parents
want.</p><p><a name="06060647000252"><b><a name="06060647000676">Mr.
Leigh:</b> I agree completely. Great&#151;let us try that,
but we have to be realistic about our abilities, especially when we are
dealing with the educational establishment that we have.</p><p><a name="06060647000253">The opinion of one professor of
education writing recently, which Chris Woodhead mentioned in a speech,
is that</p><a name="06060647000529"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
great challenge for education in the 21st century is...the
discovery of a holistic, problematised
pedagogy&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000254">Does that mean
anything to you, Mr. Chope? It means nothing to me. Then there is the
commissioner for London schools&#151;an official person,
presumably&#151;who said
recently:</p><a name="06060647000530"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In
the light of research into the brain and theories of learning,
teachers&#146; questioning techniques will have moved (by 2050)
beyond traditional
methods.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000255">That is what we
are dealing with, and what my hon. Friend will be dealing with as a
Minister.</p><p><a name="06060647000256">We will go on
debating the issue, but let us not get any more bogged down. I must not
speak for too long, because others might want to get in. However, my
hon. Friend has raised an interesting debate that need not necessarily
be the preserve of members of the Conservative party. I have great
hopes for the hon. Member for Taunton, whose early intervention
convinced me that there are people in the Liberal party who also
believe in localism and local determination&#151;I hope that there
are such people in the Labour party, too.</p><p><a name="06060647000257">Such people
might follow us in supporting the concept of schools being given
increasing powers over their budgets if, for instance, there was a
shortage of maths or language teachers. Indeed, there is a great crisis
in languages in state schools, as well as in mathematics and science
teaching, and it is independent schools that are saving sciences and
languages in universities. That is something that the Government should
be worried about. I hope that all hon. Members here would agree that
schools should be given more independence over their budgets, if that
is what they wish.</p><p><a name="06060647000258">The great divide is of course
over selection. My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich was again right
to say that we should not get bogged down in the debate about grammar
schools. That debate has gone&#151;it is finished, it is in the past.
A Conservative Government would not need to say that we will introduce
a grammar school in every town. That was one line in the 1997
manifesto. It is not going to return and the debate 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 36WH</b><br>is in the past. All we need to do is give head teachers and their
governing bodies increasing powers over
admissions.</p><p><a name="06060647000259">It was
said earlier that the only result of doing that would be that schools
would choose pupils, and that pupils and parents would not be able to
choose schools. It is claimed that if we give head teachers greater
power over admissions, large numbers of schools will suddenly become
ultra-selective and turn people away, and there will be no decent
schools for kids. Indeed, I am not sure that my children could have got
into grammar schools, although I am not for or against those
schools&#151;that is irrelevant.</p><p><a name="06060647000260">For the sake
of argument, does the Minister or anybody else think that if we gave
head teachers increasing independence, there would be a revolution in
our schools? Teachers are actually quite conservative in how they run
their schools. Those running a pure comprehensive school are allowed to
test anyway, to create a pure comprehensive system, in which there are
three bands, of the most able, the middle and the less able. If
comprehensive schools were given the freedom to select who they wanted,
some might become more academic, some might remain comprehensive and
some might admit more pupils of less academic ability. We do not
know.</p><p><a name="06060647000261">There are
schools in the independent sector that cater for all abilities. There
are Winchesters and the Etons, which are highly academic and highly
selective, but there are also many independent schools that cater for
middle and lower ability ranges. I therefore urge hon. Members to
forget the party political polemic about grammar schools and to think
about giving more freedom and responsibility to head teachers to run
their own schools in their own way. Let us imagine that we did that and
allowed schools to run their own budgets&#151;we allowed, in effect,
all schools to become grant maintained. The problem with the creation
of grant-maintained schools was that only some schools became grant
maintained, so there was a dispute about whether those schools were
receiving preferential capital funding. Let us imagine that all schools
had the freedoms of grant-maintained schools in respect of hiring and
firing, selecting and deselecting, their budgets and paying French
teachers and others. I do not believe that there would be a revolution
in those schools, but I do believe that there would be a revolution in
terms of choice and freedom, and that that would be extraordinarily
beneficial to our
system.</p><p><a name="06060647000262"><b><a name="06060647000677">Kerry
McCarthy (Bristol, East) (Lab):</b> Is the hon. Gentleman
really saying that if there was a free-for-all on admissions, some
schools would voluntarily select pupils who were less academically able
and who came from more challenging backgrounds, such as children with
special educational needs and looked-after children? Is he really
saying that he believes such pupils would be catered for without some
protection from an admissions code and without the local authority
having a role to play in
admissions?</p><p><a name="06060647000263"><b><a name="06060647000678">Mr.
Leigh:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich and I, and
all others who advance the point of view that we have expressed, accept
that there have to be special measures under the statementing
procedure. We are critical of the present statementing procedure. I 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 37WH</b><br>have my own experience of it. We believe that it is overly bureaucratic
and could be simplified and that a financial value should be attached
to the statement. However, we all accept that there will always be
under any system a financial subsidy&#151;whether or not it is called
a statement and whether it is run centrally or by local
authorities&#151;to assist children with special educational needs.
Yes, I take that completely on board, but I believe that if we moved to
a system in which head teachers were free to set their own admissions
criteria, we would have a vast range of schools catering for different
abilities, and most schools, as happens in the private sector, would
cater for all abilities. I know that Labour Members cannot
philosophically accept that&#151;it is anathema to them&#151;but I
urge them to have more confidence in head teachers and not to believe
that all head teachers would simply go ruthlessly for the brightest 10
per cent. of children. There simply are not enough of those children to
go round.</p><p><a name="06060647000264">My hon.
Friend and I are talking about the money following the pupil. We are
arguing that instead of the money being siphoned off by central and
local government, it should, through a small funding council, go direct
to schools. That would allow each child to have, under the present
set-up, &#163;6,000 or even more, and there would be a school for
everyone.</p><p><a name="06060647000265"><b><a name="06060647000679">Mr.
Carswell:</b> If we gave schools greater choice, certain
schools that are currently barred from taking on children with special
educational needs would do so. Market Field school, just outside my
constituency, is trying to expand, but is in effect prevented from
doing so by educational experts. If we adopted the scheme that my hon.
Friend and I are advocating, a school such as Market Field would expand
and welcome children with special educational needs&#151;children
that other mainstream schools may find it more difficult to cater for.
More children would have their needs catered for than under the current
system.</p><p><a name="06060647000266"><b><a name="06060647000680">Mr.
Leigh:</b> I am sure that the hon. Member for Bristol, East
(Kerry McCarthy) accepts that a lot of disguised selection goes on at
the moment. All those of us who deal with the education system know
that. For instance, I know comprehensives in London that will do
anything they can to avoid taking in children with statements. A lot of
cheating goes on in relation to SATs&#151;standard assessment
tests&#151;league tables and all the rest of it. It would be wrong to
think that at the moment we have a comprehensive system that is as pure
as the driven snow and works. Well, let us deal with whether it does
work. That is the crucial question. Are we providing the education
system that we should be, given all the investment that has been put
in? I give credit to the Government because they have increased
investment in education, but are they satisfied that every extra pound
of taxpayers&#146; money that they are spending is producing
results?</p><p><a name="06060647000267">Is the
Minister satisfied with the level of education available to our
children? Is he worried about the National Audit Office report showing
that 1 million of our children are in failing or coasting schools? If
he is satisfied with the present system, why is he supporting the
Education and Inspections Bill? Why is there so much controversy over
these issues in his own party? 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 38WH</b><br>Why does he believe that there must be more diversity? He will probably
say that the debate just shows that he is right. There are people to
the left and to the right of him, the cannons are thundering and he is
going down the third way, the middle route&#151;all the stuff we hear
from new Labour Ministers&#151;but they, who are now in charge, must
be very worried about
that.</p><p><a name="06060647000268">My
final point relates to the most controversial part of what my hon.
Friend the Member for Harwich said and what some of us in my party are
trying to convince those on our Front Bench of, in the truly democratic
and open party that we have. We strongly believe, as my hon. Friend
said, that parents should have a right to opt out of the state system
if they want to and that they should be allowed to take the cost of
state education, which they have contributed to all their lives as
taxpayers, out of the state system and into the private system. That is
happening increasingly around the world and is very popular,
particularly with marginalised people. Black people in ghetto areas in
large United States cities like the voucher: it allows them to escape
from the ghetto. It could be called a voucher or an education credit. I
find one particular description rather attractive and I believe that
the idea could be made quite popular. I am talking about a parent
saying, &#147;I have a right to this money. This is my right for my
child. I can take this &#163;6,000 where I want. I can leave it in
existing state schools or take it to new
schools.&#148;</p><p><a name="06060647000269">That
would be good for the private sector, which is too cosy at the moment.
Independent schools might not email one another any more because they
are worried about being reported to the Office of Fair Trading, but we
all know that it is an extraordinary coincidence that they all seem to
charge the same fees. However, many other people are entering the
independent sector, and surely it is a new Labour idea to encourage
choice, diversity and new entrants into the private sector, because new
Labour is not against the private sector, is
it?</p><p><a name="06060647000270"><b><a name="06060647000681">Jim
Knight:</b> As ever, I listen carefully to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s fascinating ideas. I am just intrigued as to whether
he has costed this proposal, given that at the moment people who send
their children to private schools receive no state funding. What is the
dead-weight cost of his
proposal?</p><p><a name="06060647000271"><b><a name="06060647000682">Mr.

have thought about the issue a lot. I have been arguing for this
proposal for many years, and my colleagues on various Treasury teams
have said, &#147;Oh, it&#146;s a wonderful idea, Edward, but of
course we can&#146;t do a dead-weight cost.&#148; My idea is that
we would do it incrementally. If there was an incoming Conservative
Government, we would say that we would provide a voucher, a credit, a
right to opt out in the first year of the new Act operating. The first
year to which it would apply would be year R, the next year would be
year R plus year 1 and the next year would be year R plus year 1 plus
year 2. The scheme would roll out over 14 years. Therefore, I am not
arguing for myself, because by the time that happened, all my children
would have left school. I fear that you, Mr. Chope, would be in the
same sad position. We would not benefit from the
proposal.</p><p><a name="06060647000272"><b><a name="06060647000683">Mr.

comment on a few of the issues raised. I was somewhat surprised at how
little reference there was to the debate that we have been having over
the past few months on the Education and Inspections Bill, which I
believe strikes the right balance between moving away from a very
centralised, local education authority-controlled education system
towards more independence for schools. However, some ideas flagged up
today by Conservative Members go too far down that
route.</p><p><a name="06060647000276">On admissions,
when I intervened earlier the focus of the debate was very much on
pupils with special educational needs, to whom it was said a price tag
is attached which acts as an incentive to take in such children. I was
looking at the matter in a broader context, in relation to pupils who
might be termed less desirable from the point of view of a head teacher
who wants the school to do well in the league tables. In my
constituency, for example, there are pupils from refugee backgrounds
who have English as their second language, and whose parents, often,
are illiterate, so that they do not receive support at home. What would
happen to them?</p><p><a name="06060647000277">I
welcome the move to give more power to head teachers and parents. I
think that, often, those at the chalk face in the teaching profession
know what is best for children. Parents, too, obviously know what is
best for them, but that does not necessarily apply across the board. A
great many parents, because of their educational background or social
circumstances, do not have all that great a role in their
children&#146;s education at present. I welcome the moves in the
Education and Inspections Bill to give the local authority the role of
parents&#146; champion and of supporting parents in exercising a
greater say in their children&#146;s education. However, there will
always be some children whose parents are not the best people to make
those choices for them. There must be a mechanism to enable other
people to supervise the child&#146;s education and make the right
choices.</p><p><a name="06060647000278">The
hon. Member for Harwich frequently used the term &#147;expert&#148;
pejoratively, which is quite demeaning to people who work in the
education profession. I recently met, in my constituency, a group of
educationists who work with children who have special educational
needs, 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 40WH</b><br>and they are devoted to making sure that children in the city of Bristol
get the best education. To dismiss their contribution and the expertise
that they have built up by working with children, parents and teachers
over the years is going too far. The hon. Gentleman also talked about
local education authorities all in the same breath, as though all were
equally bad. There are local education authorities that do an
incredibly good job of ensuring that schools perform well and give
pupils the best deal.</p><p><a name="06060647000279">That leads me to my main
points. I am in the unfortunate position, I suppose, of representing
the place that has the worst-performing local education authority in
the country as far as state secondary schools are concerned. It is now
adrift at the bottom of the league tables by about 5 per cent. As the
Secretary of State would tell hon. Members, even Hull is performing
better than Bristol these days. We accept that we have a serious
problem. It is not a recent development. Over many years the local
authority has failed to tackle the problem of underperformance in
Bristol&#146;s state schools. We have schools where not even one in
five pupils achieve five good GCSEs. In two schools serving my
constituency, with a very diverse intake of pupils, not one
African-Caribbean child achieved five good GCSEs last year.</p><p><a name="06060647000280">People admit that the state
school system in Bristol is failing pupils. As a result there has been
a mass exodus from Bristol schools, either into the private sector or
out to schools in Gloucestershire and Somerset. It is estimated that
about 50 per cent. of parents choose to abandon Bristol&#146;s state
secondary schools as a result of that poor performance. I accept that
the local authority has not got to grips with that, and although there
has been some incremental improvement and the school results were up
last year by a tiny percentage, unless there is change on a radical
scale we shall fail another generation of children.</p><p><a name="06060647000281">That is why I welcome some of
the proposals in the Education and Inspections Bill to give schools
more independence. I have in my constituency a school that is a shining
example of what happens when schools are given more independence. It is
one of the first city academies. Before what was called the St. George
school became an academy it was one of the most unpopular with parents
and one of the most under-subscribed schools in Bristol. Parents went
to great lengths to avoid sending their children there. It serves a
deprived area and parents in the locality do not have high incomes, but
they would still scrape together the money to send their children to
private schools or bus them out of the county, because they did not
want to send their kids to St. George. The pupils were disaffected and
the exam results were dismal.</p><p><a name="06060647000282">When St. George became a city
academy and got the independence&#151;and, admittedly, the capital
injection that went with that&#151;things turned around dramatically.
In the past year, 51 per cent. of pupils gained five or more good
GCSEs. That was a 19 per cent. increase on the previous year. There are
some schools where not even 19 per cent. get five GCSEs in the first
place; it is a fantastic increase. The academy is now the most improved
school in Bristol and one of the best performing academies in the
country.</p><p><a name="06060647000283">That success
is all the more remarkable in the light of the intake of pupils at the
academy, 35 per cent. of whom have free school meals. That compares to
a 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 41WH</b><br>national average of about 10.5 per cent. and a Bristol-wide average of
less than 10 per cent.&#151;about 9.3 per cent. Sixty per cent. of
the pupils in the academy come from visible ethnic minorities and 31
languages are spoken there. Many pupils come from refugee families and
live under the constant threat of deportation or have endured traumatic
situations to get to the school. Often they start at the school with a
limited grasp of English, but leave with a very good education. They
have a real pride in their school.</p><p><a name="06060647000284">I do not say that all that has
been achieved at the academy is due to independence, but whenever I
have visited the school it has been clear that the head teacher can
mould what happens there to the needs of the people who attend it. For
example, he is working with the Institute for Fiscal Studies on
piloting a financial capability study, which teaches children the basic
facts about handling money&#151;finance&#151;and how to run their
finances in future life. From speaking to IFS representatives I know
that those children go home and teach their parents how to do the same.
The school is in an area with a significant financial exclusion
problem, but it is also in a city that is fast becoming one of the
biggest financial services centres in the country, and the curriculum
is being tailored both to deal with problems that pupils and their
families might experience in the wider world, and to give them a leg up
into the job market. They will get a diploma, on completing the course,
equivalent to a
GCSE.</p><p><a name="06060647000285"><b><a name="06060647000686">Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am enjoying the hon. Lady&#146;s speech
enormously. She is making a principled and honest speech about the
schools in her area and it is very interesting. I want to ask the
Minister, through her, about the new qualification, which has been
recognised by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. It may not
be called either a GCSE or an A-level, because of the proprietary
control of those names exercised by the three examining bodies. Will
the Minister address that point? Why can the new qualification not be
called a GCSE or A-level? That is what it really
is.</p><p><a name="06060647000286"><b><a name="06060647000687">Kerry
McCarthy:</b> I agree about that. I believe the qualification
has been accredited with exactly the same value as an A-level for
university admissions, but there is always a danger that it will be
seen as a lesser qualification, because it does not carry that
tag.</p><p><a name="06060647000287">Something
else that the academy&#146;s head teacher has done is to offer pupils
payments according to their exam results. Staff discuss with pupils,
before they sit their exams, the grades that they hope for. A system is
operating in which, if they exceed expectations, they get an extra
&#163;10 or so. Pupils tend, at the end of the year, to walk away
with &#163;300 or &#163;400. That is something that middle-class
parents do all the time. They promise their kids that if they do well
in their exams they can have driving lessons, a computer or a holiday.
The head teacher can do something similar through managing the school
budget. I spoke to a group of pupils who had just finished their GCSEs
last year, and although it was not the only incentive for them to work,
as they were a quite motivated bunch of children anyway, knowing that
they would finish their GCSEs with money in their pocket was an
incentive too.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 42WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000288"><b><a name="06060647000688">Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> I am uneasy about that concept. What makes
people uncomfortable about the new variant of Labour is that, instead
of education being seen as a process of enriching oneself, widening
horizons, becoming broad-minded and gaining experiences and
opportunities that one would not otherwise gain, everything is brought
down to the lowest common denominator, which is a monetary award for
passing exams. Surely education is more varied, interesting and diverse
than that.</p><p><a name="06060647000289"><b><a name="06060647000689">Kerry
McCarthy:</b> I accept that point to a degree, but we are
talking about pupils from families with little spare household income.
As I said, middle-class parents do that sort of thing all the time by
way of reward, and the pupils whom I spoke to were motivated by their
enjoyment of the lessons at the school, by having had good careers
guidance, and by being motivated to do further study or go to
university. That was their prime motivation, but some value was also
attached to their getting the qualification. As I said, many parents
recognise that that is sometimes an incentive when pupils have to slave
over their books long into the night.</p><p><a name="06060647000290">The involvement of sponsors and
the wider community will be crucial to academies and the trust schools
proposed under the Education and Inspections Bill. Those factors was
perhaps lacking in the vision outlined by the hon. Members for Harwich
and for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). This is not only about parents and
teachers making decisions, but about the wider community being very
much involved in how its schools are run. The academy in my
constituency is sponsored by the university of the West of England,
Bristol Rovers football club and the chamber of commerce. We have a
real problem with the school staying-on rates in Bristol&#151;indeed,
we are way below the average, and Britain, as we know, performs very
badly&#151;so it is important that we involve potential employers and
sponsors.</p><p><a name="06060647000291">I end with a
plea to the Minister. In my discussions with Ministers at the
Department for Education and Skills and the Treasury, there has been a
real issue about the VAT status of academies and other schools, and I
suspect that the same applies to foundation schools. Schools want to
open their facilities to the community, but if they do so for more than
10 per cent. of their opening hours there is a possibility that they
will be penalised and have to pay back the VAT exemption on the capital
investment that they made. The Minister is probably well aware of the
issue, and I simply urge him to bear it in mind when he
responds.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000560">12.2

Mulholland (Leeds, North-West) (LD):</b> I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Pope. It might surprise some hon. Members to hear that I was
the keynote speaker at the Independent Schools Bursars Association
conference about three weeks ago. It was an enjoyable event, and I was
pleased to receive the invitation. I met a lot of independent
schools&#146; bursars and got an invitation to visit Eton, which I
might take up once I have visited all the schools in my
constituency.</p><p><a name="06060647000293">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) on
securing the debate, which is very timely, given the stage that we have
reached in the 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 43WH</b><br>education debate nationally. In the spirit of our proceedings, let me
start by agreeing with him on various points. The Liberal Democrats
certainly agree that there are problems and that far too many schools
are failing or coasting. We wholeheartedly agree that we need to
encourage innovation and local leadership, free from central Government
diktat, which still casts a shadow over the education
system.</p><p><a name="06060647000294">We also agree
that we have an over-prescriptive centralised national curriculum, with
far too much nationally imposed testing. Furthermore, I agree with the
hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) that the dogmatic obsession
with the question whether public or private is best is damaging, and
there is clearly a role for the public, private and voluntary sectors
in our public services.</p><p><a name="06060647000295">I would
probably also agree with the hon. Member for Harwich and the
Conservative party that the trust schools proposed in the Education and
Inspections Bill will not deliver the vision that he outlined. Indeed,
they have become something of a fudge&#151;they are neither one thing
nor the other. So, despite the Conservative party&#146;s support for
the Bill, I am sure he would acknowledge that it will not implement
what he
advocates.</p><p><a name="06060647000296">That
Bill is certainly a long way from the original vision outlined by the
Prime Minister, who said that he wanted all schools to become trust
schools. I fundamentally disagree with that approach, which is a
strange and over-prescriptive way of running our education system. It
reminds me of Henry Ford, because it is a bit like saying, &#147;You
can choose any school you want as long as it&#146;s a trust
school.&#148; That is not parental choice, which is the one thing we
all agree that we want, although we have different ways of achieving
it.</p><p><a name="06060647000297">I shall follow the
development of Conservative party education policy with interest,
because having supported the Bill, Conservative Members are likely to
be quite critical of trust schools when they do little to improve
standards over the coming years. However, we shall wait and
see.</p><p><a name="06060647000298">As regards the
Liberal Democrat vision, we agree with more freedom, localism and
choice&#151;those the buzz words that we all use, although we have
different ways of implementing our policies. However, the one freedom
that schools need above all is the one that the Bill does not give
them&#151;the freedom to teach what they want. We made that clear
throughout proceedings on the Bill, although we shall not, of course,
go through those debates again.</p><p><a name="06060647000299">The one freedom that the Bill
gives schools with which we disagree is the freedom to pick pupils. A
Headspace survey of head teachers showed that 38 per cent. admitted
breaking their own admissions code. I accept that my party has a
different vision of education, but our concern is that giving schools
more independence will allow them to pick their own
pupils.</p><p><a name="06060647000300">My party does
not agree with that approach, although other hon. Members might, and
that is a perfectly reasonable perspective. However, the evidence is
that such things are happening, and they will become more likely to
happen the more we go down the route of having independent schools.
That will be to the detriment of the pupils whom our education system
currently fails most.</p>

hon. Friends and I are also concerned about accountability, which is
another reason why we do not want to go down the route of introducing
further independence for schools. The hon. Member for Gainsborough
mentioned localism, and it is extraordinary that, in trust schools and
particularly academies, private companies will now have power over
elected parent governors, never mind head teachers and elected local
education authorities. That is a strange vision of localism and
accountability.</p><p><a name="06060647000302">There
is a danger in saying that independence is the solution to the problems
in our schools, in the same way that we said that comprehensive
education was the one-size-fits-all solution. We have had a healthy
debate, and it has been interesting and valuable to take part because
none of those who have contributed have fallen into the trap of talking
about party political positions, but we must be aware of the danger of
saying that independence in itself, or a comprehensive education in
itself, is the key to unlocking the door and will give us wonderful
schools everywhere.</p><p><a name="06060647000303">Let me also sound a brief note
of caution. I understand the vision outlined by the hon. Member for
Harwich, but we must listen to schools. Throughout proceedings on the
Education and Inspections Bill, there was lots of talk about how we
must empower schools, but are we listening to schools in the first
place? In January, a Guardian/ICM poll of 805 head teachers and
assistant head teachers showed that only 29 per cent. backed plans to
free schools from direct local education authority control, but I
suspect that such things are not taken into account in those debates or
when we discuss measures such as those in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06060647000304">Indeed, in
<i>The Independent</i> in April, Mick Brookes, the general secretary of
the National Association of Head Teachers, said that trust schools
are</p><a name="06060647000305"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;all smoke and
mirrors. We already have freedom as heads. You don&#146;t have to buy
into local authority services if you don&#146;t want
to.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000306">Again, are we
falling into the trap of political dogma?</p><p><a name="06060647000307">To conclude, there is little
concrete evidence that self-governing independent status for state
schools drives up standards, and driving up standards is the one thing
to which we are all absolutely committed. The Minister could mention
other examples, but in the case of academies, there is extra funding
and various other things. As we know, academies have a mixed record, so
independence in itself does not deliver&#151; <i>[Interruption.]</i>

consensual note, we all agree that what drives up standards and
improves schools is good local leadership, good management and, of
course, good teaching. There has been too much focus on structures
instead of standards, and on political dogma. One thing that I learned
from my interesting chats with the Independent Schools Bursars
Association is that we can learn from real, independent schools in the
state sector. That is what we should concentrate on, rather than status
and structures. We can learn about flexible learning, having a broader
curriculum to suit individual pupils and&#151;my big
bugbear&#151;smaller class sizes, which my wife, who is a primary
school teacher, tells me would make the biggest difference to
children&#146;s education overall.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 45WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000311">This

contributed to it. Now that the dust has settled and we have debated
the Education and Inspections Bill, whatever the type or name of
school, let us focus most on standards, particularly those in schools
in which children are being failed, who most need the intervention of
the education system. I am certain we can agree that we should
concentrate on
that.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000561">12.11

standards, which we should now focus on in our
debates.</p><p><a name="06060647000313">I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) on
securing the debate. He made an interesting and thoughtful speech, but
we have come to expect that during his first year as a Member of the
House.</p><p><a name="06060647000314">The
desire to increase independence for state schools is shared in all
parts of the House, or at least on the Government and official
Opposition Benches. That commitment was demonstrated by the
overwhelming support that the Education and Inspections Bill received
on Second and Third Reading. We supported the Bill because it makes it
easier for schools to adopt foundation status and become trust schools.
That reflects the increasing body of evidence, which my hon. Friend the
Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) mentioned, from Sweden and the
United States, and indeed from this country&#146;s grant-maintained
schools programme, that increasing diversity, independence and choice
has powerful effects in raising school standards.</p><p><a name="06060647000315">The Prime Minister is committed
to independence. He recently said:</p><a name="06060647000531"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The logic of changing
to the specialist schools, of starting City Academies, of giving
greater freedom to schools in who they hire, what they pay, how they
run their school day, is very clear. It is to escape the straitjacket
of the traditional comprehensive school and embrace the idea of
genuinely independent non-fee paying state
schools.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000316">A key
part of the Prime Minister&#146;s solution to this problem lies in
granting schools additional freedoms. In October, he
said:</p><a name="06060647000532"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;By the
end of this third term, I want every school that wants to be to be able
to be an independent, non fee-paying state school with the freedom to
innovate and develop in the way it wants and the way the parents at the
school
want&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000317">That
commitment to giving greater autonomy was a dominant feature of the
recent education White Paper, in which the Prime Minister
said:</p><a name="06060647000533"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our
reforms must build on the freedoms that schools have increasingly
received, but extend
them&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000318">rapidly.</p><p><a name="06060647000319">Independence
and innovation can play a vital role in raising the quality of
education. That is why, in 2004-05, only 38 per cent. of pupils at
community schools achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C,
including English and maths, but in city technology colleges, which
have independence, 66 per cent. of pupils achieved five or more good
GCSEs, including English and maths. A quarter of pupils at community
schools leave with no GCSEs at all, but in the CTC sector that figure
is only 3.6 per cent.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 46WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000320">Thomas Telford school, which I
mentioned on many occasions during our debates on the Education and
Inspections Bill, has a national ability range or intake, and 11 per
cent. of pupils take free school meals, but 100 per cent. of pupils
achieved not five or more, but 12 or more, good GCSEs or
equivalent.</p><p><a name="06060647000321">Of
course, the results for academies seem slightly less promising,
although, in an excellent speech, the hon. Member for Bristol, East
(Kerry McCarthy) pointed out that her academy is achieving results of
about 51 per cent. of pupils getting five or more GCSEs,
which is a 19 per cent. increase on last year. Those are promising
results. It would be interesting to visit that school at some
point.</p><p><a name="06060647000322">Many
academies still achieve quite poor results, but if we compare them to
those of their predecessor schools, there are still clear signs of
improvement. Results show that by 2005 the proportion of students
gaining five or more good GCSEs had risen from 21 per cent. in the
predecessor schools to 36.4 per cent. in the academies. There is an
interesting comment in the PricewaterhouseCoopers
report:</p><a name="06060647000534"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A very
clear and significant finding from the early research is that there
does seem to be a significant difference in the learning culture in new
Academies, compared to their predecessors. For example, 8 out of 10
pupils in the survey said that &#145;the teachers at this Academy
really believe that all pupils can achieve&#146;, and similar numbers
of staff surveyed said &#145;staff at this Academy believe that all
pupils can achieve regardless of their social
background&#146;.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000323">Some
academies have failed principally because they appointed the wrong head
teachers to run them. At Unity City academy in Middlesbrough, only 12
of the 200 pupils taking GCSEs achieved grade C in maths and English
compared with 17 pupils at the two predecessor schools. An article in
<i>The Sunday Times</i> in March said:</p><a name="06060647000535"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When Unity opened in
2002 the new head...promised a revolution in learning that would
&#145;discard the Victorian-style chalk and talk&#146; and put in
place &#145;learning sessions&#146; taken by &#145;learning
facilitators&#146;.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000324">That
reflects many of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for
Gainsborough made about some of the vogue methods of teaching that take
place in some schools. The article
continued:</p><a name="06060647000536"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Old-style
history and science were to be replaced by &#145;concepts&#146;
taught as topics, and teachers were told to adjust their styles to
cater for whether children were &#145;kinesthetic, visual or
auditory&#146;
learners.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000325">Since then,
the Unity academy has been identified as a failing school by Ofsted,
with debts of &#163;1.5 million. Of course, the head teacher was got
rid of, and the school is showing signs of improvement. In that case
and in other examples, the governing bodies and proprietors of schools
took decisive and swift action, replacing the heads and ensuring that
standards were
safeguarded.</p><p><a name="06060647000326">I want to
raise two quick points with the Minister, the first of which concerns
the importance of provisions on freedoms, which are already on the
statute book. The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West made the point that
a lot of the freedoms for the new trust schools are illusory and that

chapter 1 of part 1 of the Education Act 2002. Only a tiny number of
schools have taken advantage of that freedom because of the tortuous
route to acquiring it. In fact, only 178 out of 26,000 have made use of
it.</p><p><a name="06060647000328">It is also
disappointing that the Government have not yet implemented chapter 2 of
part 1 of the 2002 Act on earned autonomy. That was a major element of
the previous education White Paper, which
said:</p><a name="06060647000538"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Where

her words, those provisions have not yet been implemented. The
Department for Education and Skills website said that a consultation
document on earned autonomy was due to be published on 30 September
2002, but that that did not take place due to &#147;operational
pressures&#148;. The issue has become a saga that has run for over
four years.</p><p><a name="06060647000333">I recently
asked the previous Minister, the right hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui
Smith), what was happening with the new provisions and when they were
going to be brought into force, to which she
replied:</p><p><a name="06060647000334">&#147;We
are keeping the provisions of Chapter 2 of the Education Act 2002,
conferring exemptions related to school performance, under
review.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28 March 2006; Vol.
444, c.
889W.]</p><p><a name="06060647000335">As
the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West said, giving schools more
autonomy and freedom over their day-to-day running is not the whole
story when it comes to raising standards. Issues such as the
curriculum, discipline in schools and ending mixed ability teaching in
comprehensives are all hugely important. However, when the right head
teacher is appointed, autonomy has a major effect in raising
standards.</p><p><a name="06060647000336">Conservative
Members hope that many schools will use the provisions in the latest
education Bill to become trust schools in the years ahead. If the
Government are committed to autonomy, it would be helpful if they
implemented the earned autonomy provisions in the 2002 Act and made it
easier for schools to use the other elements of freedom that are
contained in
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000562">12.20

Minister for Schools (Jim Knight):</b> I thank the hon. Member
for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) for securing the debate and congratulate him
on doing so. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) described it
as a think-piece debate, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. At times, it
felt like listening to a Conservative party policy forum, but the
contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry
McCarthy) provided excellent balance to that. There were also
significant and interesting contributions from Liberal Democrats
Members.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 48WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000338">Both the hon. Member for Harwich
and I recognise that increasing independence for state schools is
essential if we are to deliver the best education possible for all our
children and young people. However, like my hon. Friend the Member for
Bristol, East, I caution that he advocates a much more extreme version
from his avowed position of the centre right. I do not feel able to
support it, certainly not in its entirety.</p><p><a name="06060647000339">As my hon.
Friend said, the recent Education and Inspections Bill has enshrined
the principle of greater independence for state
schools&#151;Parliament willing&#151;in law. That has not just come
out of the blue. It is the natural next step in the journey that this
Government have taken to raise standards since 1997. It is worth
reflecting for a moment on that journey to see how far we have
come.</p><p><a name="06060647000340">We have invested
record sums in education because it is such a key priority. By 2008,
spending per pupil will be twice what it was in 1997. Capital spending
has risen sevenfold, so that by 2020 all secondary schools, and half of
all primary schools, will be refurbished or rebuilt and will be
fantastic places to teach and
learn.</p><p><a name="06060647000341">We are backing
up that investment with reform. We have freed up teachers to teach, and
delivered on our promise to achieve the smaller class sizes that the
hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)
mentioned.</p><p><a name="06060647000342">We
are continuing to address behavioural and disciplinary problems, which
have caused disruption and mayhem in our most difficult classrooms. The
&#147;Every Child Matters&#148; programme is tackling problems
outside the classroom that impact on children&#146;s ability to
flourish and progress, helping to ensure that they are ready and able
to learn once they are at school.</p><p><a name="06060647000343">Far from there being a quango
state, which the hon. Member for Harwich alleged, since we introduced
the fair funding framework in 1999 the percentage of funding delegated
to schools has increased from 79 to 87 per cent. We are making good
movement in the right direction on delegating funding directly to
schools, and that approach is paying
off.</p><p><a name="06060647000344">Last year, there
were record results across the board at 11, 14, 16 and 18. In 1997,
just 65 per cent. of 11-year-olds reached the basic standards in
English, whereas today the figure is 79 per cent. That means 84,000
more children every year going on to secondary school ready and able to
learn. Speeches that, admittedly, tried not to be too partisan still
started from the premise that everything in our schools is a disaster
and is failing. I do not accept
that.</p><p><a name="06060647000345">The improvements
that I mentioned are dramatic, but, importantly, we are well aware that
we have not delivered for everyone: only 30 per cent. of children
receiving free school meals get five good GCSEs and, as we have heard,
one in 10 of those children do not achieve any qualifications at
all.</p><p><a name="06060647000346">I must tell the
hon. Member for Gainsborough that we believe that it is unacceptable
for 1 million children to be in failing or coasting schools, although I
would advise caution over the use of that statistic, given that about
60,000 pupils in secondary schools and 30,000 in primary schools are in
failing schools. Hearing that statistic, it would be easy to think that
1 million are in failing schools whereas the real figure is fewer than
100,000, which is roughly what it was in 1997.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 49WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000347">Every child
really does matter, and we believe that every child should have the
opportunity to fulfil their potential through the best education
possible. That is why I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member
for Bristol, East and why I share her concern for her constituents,
some of whom are being failed by the education they are receiving. That
is also why the Education and Inspections Bill sets out a number of
ways in which we will achieve that goal of fulfilling potential.
Greater independence for schools is an important part of that package,
because greater independence for state schools is not only the next
logical step. We already know that it
works.</p><p><a name="06060647000348">Independent
schools have a number of distinctive features that help to deliver an
education that meets the needs of their pupils. The best independent
schools are highly accountable to parents and responsive to their
wishes, and they develop innovative teaching practices and a positive
ethos. They are supported by active and effective governors, and we
know that in many cases they deliver excellent results. Equally, we
reject the worst of independent schools&#151;fee paying. We abolished
the assisted places scheme in 1997 and are proud that we did so.
Obviously, we also reject selection, which is a feature of many private
independent schools.</p><p><a name="06060647000349">Schools that have greater
independence within the maintained sector are achieving great results.
We heard about the excellent progress being made at the city academy in
Bristol, and I am pleased that the Liberal Democrats there are actively
supporting the creation of new academies. I hope they are also keen to
pilot some of the first trust
schools.</p><p><a name="06060647000350">On
average, academies have improved their collective GCSE results by five
percentage points per year since the first schools opened, and that
success can be directly attributed to their greater independence. That
freedom and independence allow academies to develop the innovative
approaches to the curriculum, teaching and performance management that
deliver the results. Academies are challenging the culture of
underachievement in our most deprived areas and they are
succeeding.</p><p><a name="06060647000351">Specialist
schools also have increased freedoms and are demonstrating that greater
freedom works. They are doing so on a much grander scale. Some 80 per
cent. of all schools have achieved specialist status. In specialist
schools, almost 60 per cent. of children achieve the diploma standard
that we discussed in the 14 to 19 White Paper&#151;five good GSCE
passes&#151;compared with less than 50 per cent. in non-specialist
schools.</p><p><a name="06060647000352">High-performing
specialist schools are taking on a vital role in driving improvement
across the system. Some are taking on a second specialism, some are
focusing on underperforming pupils and some are taking on training
school status, but all are working in partnership with other schools to
raise achievement among local young people in their
communities.</p><p><a name="06060647000353">Alongside
greater independence, such partnership working will also be central to
the delivery of our 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 50WH</b><br>reform. That independence for schools does not mean that they will all
do their own thing in isolation. We do not see any conflict between
seeking greater dynamism in the system and collaboration. We want a
system of strong self-confident schools with a distinctive ethos
working in partnership to respond to parental demand and to meet the
needs of every child.</p><p><a name="06060647000354">Schools benefit a great deal
from collaboration with each other. Our objective is to ensure much
wider collaboration, embracing all local partners. Academies and
specialist schools are proving every day that schools that think beyond
the education sector and draw on the energy and expertise of local
community groups, local businesses and, of course, local parents can be
the most
successful.</p><p><a name="06060647000355">The
development of trust schools is the next major step in ensuring greater
independence for state schools in the maintained sector. It is the next
step in this evolution, not the revolution feared by the hon. Member
for Gainsborough. Acquiring a trust will give schools many of the
freedoms already enjoyed by foundation schools, and they will be really
important in ensuring a dynamic and exciting maintained sector for this
country. They will mean greater diversity across the whole system,
which, in turn, will mean a genuine choice between high-quality schools
that offer different opportunities and specialisms where pupils can
develop their own individual talents. The involvement of a trust from
the private, voluntary or public sector can improve the ethos and
governance of a
school.</p><p><a name="06060647000356">However,
there is a distinction between freeing-up schools and ensuring that
they have greater independence within the maintained sector, and more
independent schools. Working within the maintained sector, we can
ensure fair access and opportunity for all; it is independence within
important boundaries. I shall not rehearse yet again the debates
relating to the Education and Inspections Bill because there is not
enough time to do so in order to convince hon. Members of the merits of
trust schools.</p><p><a name="06060647000357">The Bill puts
parents in the driving seat. Trust schools will have to comply with
admissions legislation and act in accordance with the new school code,
just like other schools. They will be part of the local authority
family. I am looking forward to that legislation becoming law. It will
then be my job to make progress by implementing it. I will also think
about implementing those other things mentioned by the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr.
Gibb).</p><p><a name="06060647000358">I again thank
the hon. Member for Harwich for raising the issue. We both agree that
we must get away from the one-size-fits-all approach that too often
does not fit anyone at all. Through the Bill and our wider programme
for change, we want to achieve greater independence for state
schools&#151;not dogmatically for the sake of doing so, but because
it can deliver real improvements in standards, building on what works
in academies and specialist
schools.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 51WH</b><br>

(Iran)</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000563">12.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06060647000359"><b><a name="06060647000695">Mrs.
Louise Ellman (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/Co-op):</b> The
world&#146;s attention is focused on Iran&#146;s nuclear ambitions
and the danger that that undoubtedly poses for the region. However,
there is a long-running cause of concern that should not be allowed to
escape the spotlight: Iran&#146;s abysmal record on human rights.
Iran&#146;s abuse of human rights has been condemned by the United
Nations, the European Union, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
International. In this short debate, I shall focus on limited areas of
persecution, but it is important to appreciate the context in which the
abuses that I shall detail take
place.</p><p><a name="06060647000360">The
systematic suppression of dissent in Iran permeates the whole of
Iranian society. The abuses are not random. They are organised by the
Government or by what Iranians call parallel institutions, such as the
intelligence service and paramilitary groups. President
Ahmadinejad&#146;s Cabinet is dominated by former members of the
intelligence and security services, some of whom are allegedly
implicated in serious violations, including the assassination of
dissident intellectuals.</p><p><a name="06060647000361">Human Rights
Watch and Amnesty International have condemned the deterioration of
freedom of expression and the routine use of arbitrary arrest, torture
and solitary confinement. Tehran&#146;s public prosecutor, Saeed
Mortzavi, has been implicated in major violations, including the
unresolved death in custody of the Iranian-Canadian photo-journalist
Zahra Kazemi in June 2003, yet no proper investigation has taken
place.</p><p><a name="06060647000362">Executions,
including those of juveniles, continue after highly questionable
judicial processes. Amnesty International reports that in the past year
at least 94 people have been executed, including at least eight who
were under
18.</p><p><a name="06060647000363">At
the end of May 2006, 500 armed riot police stormed into Tehran
university campus following a student protest after a purge of the
university&#146;s academic faculty. Live bullets were fired, people
were injured and arrests were made. At the end of May, no further
information was available about the fate of the arrested
students.</p><p><a name="06060647000364">A
systematic purge of the media in 2000 closed newspapers and imprisoned
journalists. In 2005, the Iranian Government turned their attention to
targeting websites and internet journalists. Those who were arrested
were sent to secret detention centres. In February 2005, a court in the
province of Gilan sentenced Arash Sigarchi to 14 years imprisonment for
online writing.</p><p><a name="06060647000365">Those attacks
on the media send out a clear message. The result is that where the
media is not shut down, there is self-censorship. Both Human Rights
Watch and Amnesty International report that independent harassment of
human rights organisations and lawyers continues. Prominent activists
such as the Nobel peace prize winner, Shirin Ebadi, was held in jail in
January 2005 and released only after an international outcry. Akbar
Ganj, the investigative journalist who exposed the role of high-ranking
officials in the murder of writers and intellectuals in 1998, remains
in prison. Political executions take place, and in May concern was
expressed about the imminent execution of Valiolla Feyz Mahdavi, a
28-year-old member of Iran&#146;s main opposition party.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 52WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000366">That
systematic oppression has had profound consequences. It has resulted in
what Human Rights Watch calls</p><a name="06060647000541"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an atmosphere of impunity in
which oppression thrives&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000367">It means that people are silenced because
they fear speaking out and there are fewer voices to speak out about
what is wrong, so abuses are not fully documented. It is against that
background that I draw attention to particular concern about two
minority communities in Iran.</p><p><a name="06060647000368">The Iranian Baha&#146;i
community numbers 300,000, but Baha&#146;is also live in other
countries and, indeed, there are some in my constituency. The
Baha&#146;is in Iran have long been
persecuted.</p><p><a name="06060647000369"><b><a name="06060647000696">Lembit

Lady for letting me intervene as chair of the all-party Friends of the
Baha&#146;i group. Does she agree that the difficulty is that the
Baha&#146;i community, whose religion is passive and seeks no ill
will toward others, has been persistently persecuted? That persecution
has become serious in Iran. Does she agree that the best thing the
Iranian Government could do is to enter some sort of dialogue to try to
understand why those of us who have supported the Baha&#146;i
community feel that this is an unnecessary attack on Baha&#146;is,
who present no threat of instability whatever to the Iranian state?
Does she agree that the Iranians should enter some sort of dialogue to
try to ease the difficulties that the Baha&#146;is in Iran are
experiencing at
present?</p><p><a name="06060647000371"><b><a name="06060647000697">Mrs.
Ellman:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the
Baha&#146;is are peaceful and do not pose a threat. Their persecution
is intolerable and I shall outline some of the detailed concerns about
their treatment. That concern is so great that the United Nations has
appointed a special rapporteur to investigate their
situation.</p><p><a name="06060647000372">The Iranian
regime wants to weaken the Baha&#146;i leadership by attacking people
in leading positions and preventing Baha&#146;is from entering higher
education. During the 1980s, 200 Baha&#146;is were killed or
executed. International monitoring had some impact on inhibiting that,
but arbitrary arrests continue, and since the beginning of 2005 125
Baha&#146;is have been arrested. As recently as May this year, 15
Baha&#146;is, mainly young people, were arrested in the city of
Shiraz while participating in a community project. Three remain in
custody but no charges have been made. Those arrests coincided with six
raids on Baha&#146;i homes in which papers and computers were
taken.</p><p><a name="06060647000373">Recently,
there have been more sinister developments. The UN special rapporteur
on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir, issued a highly
significant report on the condition of Baha&#146;is in Iran earlier
this year. She concluded that she was &#147;highly concerned&#148;
about the persecution of Iranian Baha&#146;is and condemned the
letter sent on 25 October 2005 by the chairman of the command
headquarters of the armed forces in Iran to Government agencies, which
stated that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has instructed
command headquarters to</p><a name="06060647000542"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;identify those of the Bhai faith
and monitor their activities.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 53WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000374">She judged that that was</p><a name="06060647000543"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;impermissible and unacceptable
interference with the rights of members of religious
minorities&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000375">and expressed
fears that the information would be used for the persecution of the
Baha&#146;is in violation of international
standards.</p><p><a name="06060647000376">Against
that background, Bani Dugal, principal representative of the
Baha&#146;i international community to the UN, spoke of the
unrelenting persecution of the Baha&#146;is. Concern has since
intensified with the publication of a series of defamatory articles in
Tehran&#146;s <i>Kayhan</i> newspaper, including one in February
stating that Baha&#146;is gather on Muslim holy days</p><a name="06060647000544"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to consume alcohol, dance, and
sacrifice a Muslim
child.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000377">Those
outrageous allegations, which have created an atmosphere of fear and
hostility, were published in Iran&#146;s national newspaper. There is
no evidence whatever for the allegations. They are venomous and
reminiscent of anti-Jewish blood libels that also circulate in Iran.
Indeed, the 20,000-strong Iranian Jewish community, which has
diminished from 85,000 in 1979, feels increasingly
anxious.</p><p><a name="06060647000378">President
Ahmadinejad&#146;s recent provocative holocaust denial, combined with
his call for Israel to be
</p><a name="06060647000545"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;wiped off the face of
the map&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000379">is, sadly, not a
new phenomenon in Iran, but its intensity and central place in the
international furore about Iran&#146;s nuclear ambitions have raised
acute concern about the situation of Iranian Jews&#151;one of the
oldest Jewish communities&#151;and created an atmosphere of fear.
President Ahmadinejad stated just a few months ago:</p><a name="06060647000546"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;They have created a
myth today that they call the massacre of Jews and they consider it a
principle above God, religion and the prophets&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000380">I have viewed
a highly disturbing programme that was broadcast on Channel 2 of
Iranian television on 5 January. It hosted a discussion in
which political analyst Dr. Majid Goudarzi
stated&#151;unchallenged&#151;that following Jesus&#146; birth,
the Jews of Yemen prepared a pit of fire for Christians who refused to
renounce the religion of Jesus. Dr. Goudarzi stated that
&#147;burning believers&#148; then became ingrained in Jewish
consciousness so that the Jews later blamed the Germans for atrocities
that they themselves had started. For good measure, Dr. Goudarzi also
proclaimed that the Jews created the &#147;protocols of the elders of
Zion&#148; to enable them to become the</p><a name="06060647000547"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;board of directors of the
world&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000381">It is truly shocking
that that statement, aired as fact, was broadcast on national
television in the 21st century. National television, a public resource,
stated it not even as a matter of debate&#151;although that would not
have been acceptable either&#151;but as a matter of fact. It is
little wonder that Haroon Yeshaya, the former chairman of the Jewish
community in Tehran, sent a public letter to President Ahmadinejad
stating that his current stance of holocaust denial had
created:</p><a name="06060647000548"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;astonishment
among the people of the world and spread fear and anxiety among the
small Jewish community of Iran.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000382">I have
mentioned detailed problems concerning Jews and Baha&#146;is, but
they are just two of Iran&#146;s minority communities. Other groups
such as Arabs, Kurds and Christians suffer from tremendous
discrimination. The whipping-up of hostility towards them and other
minorities 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 54WH</b><br>can only damage Iran&#146;s reputation. Sadly, the
extent of Iran&#146;s human rights abuse is immense, and in the short
time available today, I have been able to describe only a small number
of concerns.</p><p><a name="06060647000383">At the
beginning of my contribution, I referred to the systematic suppression
of dissent and the absence of a free media in Iran. That means that it
is especially important that voices outside Iran speak up for those who
face oppression. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit
&#214;pik) spoke about the peaceful nature of the Baha&#146;is. The
Iranians think that they can persecute groups because they believe that
there is nobody there to speak up for them. I hope that through the
expressions made in this Chamber today, and the work undertaken by the
all-party Friends of the Baha&#146;i group and other groups, the
Iranians will be proved wrong in their assessment.</p><p><a name="06060647000384">Because of
the suppression of freedom of speech, and the atmosphere of
intimidation in Iran, it is particularly important that voices outside
Iran speak up and speak up loudly. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
International are to be congratulated on exposing Iran&#146;s
failings on human rights. The work of the UN special rapporteurs has
been invaluable in identifying abuses, although requests for visits by
UN special rapporteurs on torture and extra-judicial executions have so
far gone unanswered. Sadly, although the exposure has made the world
more aware of what is happening in Iran, it has not changed
Iran&#146;s fundamental approach.</p><p><a name="06060647000385">The world is right to be
worried by Iran&#146;s nuclear ambitions, but the aggression
displayed by its President is not necessarily backed by its population.
Dissent in Iran is suppressed and minorities face discrimination. It is
essential that the spotlight focuses on human rights abuses within
Iran&#146;s oppressive regime, and I call on the United Nations and
the European Union to step up their
activities.</p><p><a name="06060647000386"><b><a name="06060647000698">Andrew

Pope, for that helpful suggestion.</p><p><a name="06060647000389">I begin by
congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs.
Ellman) on securing a debate on a subject that is of real concern to
the United Kingdom Government and, indeed, to this House.</p><p><a name="06060647000390">Efforts to
improve respect for human rights have long been a central element of
the United Kingdom&#146;s and, indeed, the European Union&#146;s
approach to Iran. The current situation in Iran seems to be
deteriorating and lacking in transparency&#151;from the situation of
religious minorities to the conduct of trials and sentencing. The
situation is well reported by non-governmental organisations such as
Amnesty International, and in its latest report Amnesty highlighted the
growing difficulties faced by ethnic and religious minorities,
harassment of human rights defenders, the erosion of free expression
and the serious concerns about Iran&#146;s use of the death
penalty.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 55WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000391">We have
frequently set out those concerns bilaterally and through the relevant
international human rights mechanisms. As my hon. Friend mentioned,
that includes our concern about the position that the Iranian
Government have taken towards Israel. President Ahmadinejad call for
Israel to be wiped from the map and his attempts to cast doubt on the
holocaust are outrageous and unacceptable.</p><p><a name="06060647000392">We have long-standing concerns
about political freedoms in Iran. An unelected committee, the Guardian
Council, comprised of jurists and clerics, was able to prevent all
women and many reformists from standing in last year&#146;s
presidential elections. Many reformist candidates, including a third of
the sitting Members of Parliament, were similarly excluded from
standing in the parliamentary elections in 2004.</p><p><a name="06060647000393">We are also very concerned
about Iran&#146;s treatment of women. Although the situation for
women is in some respects better than in certain other countries in the
region&#151;women can, for instance, vote and drive, and they make up
more than half of the university population&#151;they nevertheless
face significant discrimination. For instance, the evidence of a woman
continues to be worth less than that of a man in court, and women do
not enjoy equal rights in cases involving divorce, inheritance or the
custody of children.</p><p><a name="06060647000394"><b><a name="06060647000701">Andrew
Mackinlay:</b> The Minister has referred to the serious
deficiencies&#151;to say the least&#151;in the legitimacy of the
parliamentary process in Iran. This Parliament should beat its breast
and apologise. As you know, Mr. Pope, I personally opposed
elsewhere the receiving here of a delegation from the Majlis. I thought
that it was a mistake, although I understand the compelling case for
Committees such as the Foreign Affairs Committee to become engaged. My
judgment might be wrong on that issue, but where this Parliament has
got it wrong is in respect of the Inter-Parliamentary Union having
Majlis delegations.</p><p><a name="06060647000395">I put it to
the Minister that the British Government and this Parliament would not
countenance comparable relationships with the Parliament of Belarus.
For all their warts and deficiencies, the Lukashenko Government and
that Parliament are innocent compared with the abuse of human rights
and the denial of true franchise seen in Tehran. We have double
standards. I wonder whether the Minister will comment on
that.</p><p><a name="06060647000396"><b><a name="06060647000702">Mr.
Hoon:</b> I am aware of the delegation, which is led by an
experienced Member of Parliament who is a former Foreign Office
Minister. I anticipate that he and other members of the delegation will
be well aware of the issues that my hon. Friend has quite properly
raised. However, I think it is for the judgment of individual Members
of Parliament and members of delegations whether such visits go ahead.
By visiting, it is possible to identify some of the very concerns that
my hon. Friend is anxious about.</p><p><a name="06060647000397"><b><a name="06060647000703">Andrew

Hoon:</b> Repeatedly.</p><p><a name="06060647000403">I was dealing with the question
of political freedoms, and I turn now to freedom of expression. As
anyone who reads Iranian newspapers will be aware, they certainly
engage in colourful and sometimes vigorous debate, but it appears that
the confines of such debate are closely circumscribed. In the course of
the past five years, the regime has quietly extended its control over
the Iranian people&#146;s ability to express their views. Dozens of
newspapers have been closed and journalists have been arrested. The
journalist Arzhang Davoudi received a 15-year sentence simply for
producing a documentary about another journalist who died in custody in
suspicious
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06060647000404">The
Iranian Government&#146;s clampdown on the internet has largely
passed unnoticed but is also of concern. Many websites that were
accessible in Tehran two years ago are now censored, including the
BBC&#146;s Persian news website. The Iranian Government recently
announced plans to establish a national internet. That would further
restrict communication between Iran and the outside world. It would
also facilitate control by the authorities. It appears that the Iranian
Government do not believe that the Iranian people should be able freely
to choose what they read.</p><p><a name="06060647000405">The situation of Iran&#146;s
trade unions is also of concern. Strikes are not permitted, and in
January hundreds of Tehran bus drivers were arrested for taking part in
a series of strikes. The wives of some protestors were also arrested
and several houses were searched. The head of the bus drivers&#146;
syndicate remains in custody, some four months after the
strikes.</p><p><a name="06060647000406">Hon. Members
voiced concern about the situation faced by Iran&#146;s religious
minorities, and I am grateful to them for their continuing efforts in
ensuring that Parliament is kept abreast of developments. Reports that
Iran&#146;s supreme leader has instructed the army to identify
Baha&#146;is and monitor their activities are especially worrying.
Hundreds of Baha&#146;is have had their property confiscated, faced
intimidation or been denied access to education. Mehran Kowsar is one
of many members of the Baha&#146;i faith to have been arrested for
his religious beliefs; he has been in prison for well over a year. It
is clear from that case that elements of the Iranian judicial system
are in need of urgent
reform.</p><p><a name="06060647000407"><b><a name="06060647000709">Chris
Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab):</b> I apologise for not having heard
the whole debate, but I did watch the speech made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) on television.</p><p><a name="06060647000408">So far, the one group that has
not been mentioned is lesbians and gays. Many gay men have been
executed in the past year. Indeed, execution comes not just through the
courts but through officially or unofficially sanctioned death squads
roaming villages, trying to find young gay men and executing them. That
is outrageous and extraordinary. Has the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office had an opportunity to raise that specific issue with
Tehran?</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 57WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000409"><b><a name="06060647000710">Mr.
Hoon:</b> Certainly there is concern about the
situation faced by homosexuals and we are monitoring the situation
carefully. We are not aware of any individuals being executed in Iran
over the past two years solely on the grounds of homosexuality, but
clearly there are other ways in which homosexuals are seriously
affected by how the law operates
there.</p><p><a name="06060647000410"><b><a name="06060647000711">Chris
Bryant:</b> I would be very worried if the FCO genuinely
believed that no one had been executed solely because of their
sexuality. Trumped-up charges are brought before courts regularly, and
it is the work of many organisations in this country to reveal the true
outrages going on in Iran. The FCO should look into the issue much more
carefully.</p><p><a name="06060647000411"><b><a name="06060647000712">Mr.
Hoon:</b> I chose my words carefully, and I do not see any
need to resile from them. Charges are brought for other matters, but I
accept the force of what my hon. Friend was suggesting and the issue is
of concern to
us.</p><p><a name="06060647000412">Referring
to the Iranian judicial system, we have concerns about court hearings
not always being held in public and about the principle of due process
not always being respected. Cruel punishments such as flogging, stoning
and amputation remain on the statute book. In a prominent recent case,
the Iranian authorities executed two youths&#151;one aged 17 and the
other 20&#151;on 13 May this year. They were hanged in Lorestan
province barely a month after their alleged crime. The case raises
important questions. How could a fair trial be completed in such a
short time? Were the two able to exhaust every avenue of appeal open to
them? Why does Iran continue to execute under-18s, in violation of
international law?</p><p><a name="06060647000413">The UK
Government and the European Union have, naturally, posed those
questions to the Iranian Government, but the case highlights important
inconsistencies between Iran&#146;s stated policy of ending such
executions and its actions. The international community clearly has a
duty to respond to such developments, which undermine basic principles
of human rights, and we are committed to addressing that
issue.</p><p><a name="06060647000414"><b><a name="06060647000713">Andrew
Mackinlay:</b> I hope that the Minister will not think me
impertinent, but before he concludes I would like him to tell us
precisely what Her Majesty&#146;s Government have done about such
issues. Anyone who looks at the record tomorrow will see that, in the
past few minutes, the Minister has acknowledged that we are aware of
the problems. I want to know&#151;as does the House&#151;what he
and his colleagues in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office do in the
face of those repeated human rights abuses, of which they are
aware.</p><p><a name="06060647000415"><b><a name="06060647000714">Mr.
Hoon:</b> I am, as always, grateful to my hon. Friend for his
intervention. I was just about to set out what we have done.</p><p><a name="06060647000416">Under the British presidency of
the European Union, we raised our human rights concerns with the
Iranian Government on no fewer than 16 occasions. We led the European
Union in issuing five statements, covering many of the issues that we
have discussed today. We were pleased that all EU member states
supported a UN General Assembly resolution that 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 58WH</b><br>highlighted Iran&#146;s human rights record last December. We have
continued to be active in supporting EU action since then. We said at
the start of our presidency that human rights would be a priority in
our relations with Iran, and it remains a central part of our policy
approach. Progress in our relations with Iran is dependent on action by
the Iranian Government to address our human rights
concerns.</p><p><a name="06060647000417"><b><a name="06060647000715">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> Is the Minister, like me, an optimist about
human nature, and if so, does he agree that however difficult it has
been so far to secure a change through dialogue with Iran, there is
mileage in hoping that, through dialogue and by presenting the benefits
of constructive action by the Iranian Government, we could make
progress? I would be less optimistic if I had not seen some signs of
response from the Iranian Administration in the past, especially when
they knew that the public abroad were watching. Does the Minister think
that dialogue might be worth while, and if so, can we discuss, outside
today&#146;s debate, the options for holding such dialogue with
regard to the
Baha&#146;i?</p><p><a name="06060647000418"><b><a name="06060647000716">Mr.
Hoon:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He sets out the
position sensibly and in a way that allows for progress. By
highlighting the problems, we draw attention to how the Iranian
Government should improve their record on human rights, but we must
also acknowledge that the picture is not uniformly bad. There are areas
where progress can be made&#151;and indeed the benefit of this debate
is that it allows us all to set out our concerns&#151;but we
acknowledge that in some areas there has been progress, although
clearly far more work needs to be
done.</p><p><a name="06060647000419">In the recent
past, under the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, Iran seemed to be
taking significant steps forward. I regret that that progress has
slowed in recent years. Indeed, as we have discussed, in many areas
Iran is, sadly, moving backwards. However, we should not devalue the
efforts of those in Iran who are working for reforms. Their task is
being made increasingly
difficult.</p><p><a name="06060647000420"><b><a name="06060647000717">Ian
Stewart (Eccles) (Lab):</b> My right hon. Friend the Minister
heard the chairman of the all-party friends of the Baha&#146;i group
request a further meeting with him. As vice-chair of the group, I also
make that request, but I know that my right hon. Friend may have to
speak on behalf of another
Minister.</p><p><a name="06060647000421"><b><a name="06060647000718">Mr.
Hoon:</b> Well, I am always delighted to offer meetings on
behalf of other Ministers, but I will ensure that my hon.
Friend&#146;s comments, and those of the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), are drawn to my
colleague&#146;s attentions. I am sure that they will be shown the
normal courtesy extended to Members of Parliament.</p><p><a name="06060647000422">It is important to recognise
that real change can only come from within Iran. Obviously, we will
continue to do everything that we can to support those working to
achieve that change. This debate has been important. I thank my hon.
Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside again for securing and
initiating a debate on a subject that the Government take extremely
seriously.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 59WH</b><br>

Road</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000565">12.58
pm</h5><p><a name="06060647000423"><b><a name="06060647000719">Mark
Hunter (Cheadle) (LD):</b> I am grateful for this opportunity
to raise one of the most important issues facing my constituency. It
also affects the wider south Manchester and Cheshire
sub-region.</p><p><a name="06060647000424">Following
the Government&#146;s roads review in 1998, long-held plans for three
new road schemes in the south-east Manchester area were reconsidered as
part of the Government&#146;s multi-modal study for the north-west
region. The three schemes are: the completion of the Manchester airport
link road, west; a new Poynton bypass; and an A6 Hazel Grove bypass.
The three roads are all interlinked and together make up what is
commonly referred to as the south-east Manchester multi-modal study
area&#151;SEMMMS&#151;or the A555 relief road. It is not a catchy
name, I admit, but its importance to our area is immense. The plans for
those roads, in various different forms, have been on the cards for
decades. Indeed, the route of the relief road in my constituency has
enjoyed protected planning status for around 60 years, and large
numbers of houses and businesses in the locality have been shaped
around those plans.</p><p><a name="06060647000425">I
hope that hon. Members appreciate the patience displayed by local
people in my constituency and those neighbouring it. A succession of
MPs, including my predecessor Patsy Calton and my hon. Friend the
Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)&#151;who I am sure will give
his views this afternoon on the importance of the scheme to his
constituency&#151;have fought doggedly to keep the relief road high
on the agenda and to deliver a transport network that is fit to meet
the needs of our
communities.</p><p><a name="06060647000426">Since the
completion of the SEMMMS strategy five years ago, Stockport council and
the neighbouring authorities in Manchester and Cheshire have invested
considerable resources, time, effort and expertise into developing the
road scheme. That represents one of those rare tripartite alliances at
political level, but it has involved considerable co-operation on a
professional basis, too. I would like to take the opportunity to pay
tribute to the work done by staff in the local authorities who have
been involved in developing the scheme.</p><p><a name="06060647000427">In addition, the Government
have provided substantial funding for aspects of the SEMMMS strategy
and other local transport schemes in order to support the wider aims of
the project. The public transport and regeneration improvements are
welcome and are testament to the multi-modal nature of the project.
There are, however, two gaping holes in the SEMMMS strategy that will
ultimately determine the success of the policy, and with it traffic
conditions in the community for a generation or more to come. The first
is the extension of the Metrolink tram network, about which many of us
have strong feelings, but which I shall leave for a different debate.
The second is the relief road.</p><p><a name="06060647000428">As we debate the issue this
afternoon, Stockport council has been in the process of re-submitting
further technical and financial details to the Department for
Transport, as requested, in advance of what we understand will be a
final decision this autumn. We have reached an absolutely critical
stage of the process, 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 60WH</b><br>and as decision day looms I am grateful for the opportunity to put the
case in favour of the road to the Minister. I hope that she will be
able to take on board the views expressed this afternoon.</p><p><a name="06060647000429">The case in
favour of the relief road is substantial to say the least. For example,
consultation with residents and other stakeholders on the SEMMMS
strategy, and more recently on the relief road itself, has been
thorough and its results extremely positive. Environmental studies have
been carried out in a meticulous fashion. The key local authorities
involved have co-operated with the Department for Transport&#146;s
funding criteria and an expression of interest for a private finance
initiative bid was submitted to that end. On the finer details of the
road itself&#151;traffic analysis, the organisation of junctions, use
of land and consideration for other road users, such as cyclists, those
using public transport and pedestrians&#151;no stone has been left
unturned in developing the best possible solution. It is my firm belief
that this work makes a compelling and outstanding case for the
construction of the relief road. It will provide value for money and
undoubtedly enhance the quality of life for many thousands of residents
and millions of commuters.</p><p><a name="06060647000430">In the meantime, the relief
road scheme has received the backing of local, sub-regional and
regional partners, all of whom recognise its importance. The Greater
Manchester chamber of commerce supports the plans; Manchester
airport&#151;a key economic driver for our region&#151;is in
favour; the regional assembly emphasises the strategic importance of
the road not just to south Manchester but to the north-west as a whole;
and most importantly, local people, who know the roads best, are
overwhelmingly in favour of the scheme. During the last major public
consultation, approval rates were around the 90 per cent.
mark.</p><p><a name="06060647000431">I have repeated
on many occasions during this long process that a policy of building
our way out of the trouble when it comes to traffic congestion is not
the solution by itself. That is precisely why this scheme has been
designed not to attract extra traffic but to deal with existing levels
more sensibly and efficiently. It is also why it is an integral part of
a wider package of public transport improvements, including Metrolink,
which I mentioned earlier. The simple fact is that the south-east
Manchester area has a road network that never has been, and never will
be, able to cope with its volumes and patterns of traffic. Previous
Governments have ignored and compounded the situation, but Ministers
have now been presented with an ideal opportunity to correct and
improve matters.</p><p><a name="06060647000432">If further
evidence of the unsuitability of the current network is required, one
has only to look at the existing A555 airport link road. In short, the
A555 currently represents a colossal waste of public money insofar as
the central section of the scheme was built first, but its beginning
and end were never built. It is no wonder that it has been christened
by local residents as the &#147;road to nowhere&#148;. It stands as
a monument to bungled, short-term transport planning and its legacy has
been to funnel congestion through Heald Green, Bramhall, Woodford and
Poynton&#151;to name just a few of the districts affected. With that
congestion has come damage to the quality of life for people living in
those areas. Residents in the Cheadle constituency put up considerable
opposition to that &#147;road to nowhere&#148; at the public
inquiry 15 years ago, and they were right to do so. I believe that they
are 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 61WH</b><br>right now in their support for the relief road and
the need for its urgent
completion.</p><p><a name="06060647000433">The
benefits of the scheme as proposed go much further. There are many
roads in the Cheadle constituency that simply were not designed to
carry the weight of traffic that currently passes over them, which has
such a negative impact on the quality of life locally. They include, to
name just a few: Finney lane and Wilmslow road in Heald Green;
Jackson&#146;s lane, Bramhall lane south and Woodford road in
Bramhall; and the A34 at Gatley. I have not even mentioned the knock-on
effects felt in other communities such as Cheadle and Cheadle Hulme, or
at locations such as the A6 between Stockport and Hazel
Grove&#151;one of the busiest bus corridors in Europe and a transport
route that all too often resembles one enormous, polluting car
park.</p><p><a name="06060647000434"><b><a name="06060647000720">Andrew
Stunell (Hazel Grove) (LD):</b> My hon. Friend has made a
powerful case, and I hope that the Minister has listened carefully. He
has just drawn attention to the A6 in my constituency, and the part of
the A555 known as the Hazel Grove bypass will complete the road network
in my area. It is a key part of the Government&#146;s strategy. It is
cost-effective, essential and has broad local support. It is part of a
package; my hon. Friend mentioned the tram and rail links. Does he
agree that we need the Minister to give the go-ahead to the public
inquiry, so that we can roll the scheme forward for the benefit of his
constituents and mine, and the whole community of south-east
Manchester?</p><p><a name="06060647000435"><b><a name="06060647000721">Mark
Hunter:</b> My hon. Friend makes his point in his usual
exemplary way. I agree that we are looking for the Minister to indicate
that the Government will give the green light to the public inquiry and
allow the urgent completion of the road scheme that is so badly needed.
</p><p><a name="06060647000436">Of course, the
south-east Manchester region is not alone in facing severe traffic
congestion; I am fully prepared to acknowledge that. We are not alone
in lobbying for major improvements, as I am sure the Minister will
testify, but the plan is unique in that it is a long-term, sustainable
scheme. It is my firm belief&#151;shared by many others&#151;that
it deserves the approval of the Department for Transport. To the best
of my knowledge, no other scheme has been in the planning for so long
while having so much support from so many different sections of the
community.</p><p><a name="06060647000437">A
vast array of information has been made available to the Department for
Transport about this scheme&#151;much more than we could possibly do
justice to in the short time we have this afternoon&#151;concerning
traffic flows, junction design, environmental factors, public transport
integration, consultation, cost-benefit analysis and much more. On
every count, the SEMMMS A555 relief road comes out
positively.</p><p><a name="06060647000438">Ministers
have made themselves available to speak to me and other Members over
the years about the importance of the scheme, and I thank them for
that. Without wishing to tempt fate, I have always found their attitude
to the scheme to be positive and their responses to be constructive, if
slightly more non-committal than I would have liked. However, as I have
already said, I simply do not believe that any other transport project
has jumped through as many governmental hoops, has overcome as many
obstacles and has the backing of such a wide group of interested
parties as this relief road.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 62WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000439">It is not a
cheap project and as we continue to await the Government&#146;s
response costs will inevitably creep upwards, but its benefits to our
region mean that it is worth fighting for. The Minister and the
Government have been presented with a chance to deliver a visionary,
ambitious and truly integrated transport strategy for our region. I
implore the Government to seize this unique opportunity and approve the
road. My constituents and many others are depending on
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000566">1.10

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Gillian
Merron):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark
Hunter) on securing the debate. I have carefully listened to the points
that he has made so clearly.</p><p><a name="06060647000441">I feel that it would be helpful
if I structured my response. First, I will set out the background as I
see it; secondly, I will review the progress so far; thirdly, I will
review the current state of play; and last but by no means least I will
outline the issues before us, many of which I realise the hon.
Gentleman appreciates.</p><p><a name="06060647000442">To set out the background, the
south-east Manchester multi-modal study&#151;SEMMMS&#151;was one of
22 multi-modal studies set up following the 1998 review of the roads
programme to consider the case for major schemes on key sections of the
road network. An important feature of the studies was that they looked
in detail at the contribution that public transport improvements could
make to resolving the identified problems on the road network,
reflecting the principles set out in the 1998 integrated transport
White Paper.</p><p><a name="06060647000443">Three
linked road schemes were originally planned as trunk road
improvements&#151;the A6 Stockport north-south bypass, the A555
Manchester airport link road west and the A555-A523 Poynton
bypass&#151;and were all remitted to the SEMMMS. After examining a
range of options, the study concluded that those road schemes should be
taken forward on a smaller scale than the original trunk road proposals
to cater more for the needs of local traffic than for longer distance
strategic traffic.</p><p><a name="06060647000444">The study
recommended that the road improvements should be implemented alongside
a package of other improvements including quality bus corridors, light
and heavy rail improvements, measures to encourage cycling and walking,
and initiatives to encourage more sustainable patterns of travel, all
of which I am sure would be welcomed by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constituents. The study also recognised that although some of those
measures could be implemented quite quickly, the larger investment
proposals would require further detailed development and appraisal
before they could be considered for entry into the Government&#146;s
approved programme of transport improvements. In particular, that
applied to the major road scheme proposals.</p><p><a name="06060647000445">March 2002 brought our response
to the study&#146;s recommendations, which invited the three local
authorities to continue the development of the road schemes and to
bring forward detailed proposals for further consideration under the
local transport plan funding arrangements. An issue raised generally by
multi-modal studies was that many of them proposed ambitious programmes
of investment that, in aggregate, would not have been realistically
affordable.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 63WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000446">It is worth
pointing out that partly because of that experience we have now
introduced a much more transparent system for seeking regional views on
the transport investment priorities within indicative regional funding
allocations. Regional and local bodies have a much clearer picture of
the resources that are likely to be available to their region over the
next 10 years. We have given them the opportunity to advise the
Government on how they think those resources should be allocated to
best serve the region&#146;s needs and objectives. The advice was
received from the regions earlier in the year and we plan to respond to
it shortly.</p><p><a name="06060647000447"><b><a name="06060647000723">Andrew
Stunell:</b> Can the Minister confirm that the region offered
strong support for the scheme and that the funding package is
there?</p><p><a name="06060647000448"><b><a name="06060647000724">Gillian
Merron:</b> I will be addressing that point, so the hon.
Gentleman will have to be a little patient.</p><p><a name="06060647000449">I want to
move on to reviewing the progress that we have made so far in
implementing the SEMMMS recommendations. Good progress has undoubtedly
been made and many of the shorter-term measures are in place. Up to
2006-07 we have allocated &#163;55 million for small-scale integrated
transport works and &#163;23 million to the SEMMMS quality bus
corridor scheme, which is now well advanced. I am glad to say that that
funding is bringing real benefits to south-east Manchester through
improved bus reliability and patronage, the regeneration of local and
district centres, improved pedestrianisation and cycling facilities,
road safety improvements and initiatives to reduce the number of cars
on the road. I want to put on record my congratulations to the
authorities concerned on the progress that they have made with the
measures. I look forward to seeing that continue.</p><p><a name="06060647000450">I turn now to
reviewing the current state of play. Alongside all the work that I have
described, the three local authorities, led by Stockport, have made
significant progress in developing and appraising the major road
improvements recommended by SEMMMS: the north-south bypass of
Stockport, the completion of the link road into Manchester airport and
the Poynton bypass. The authorities&#146; detailed appraisal of the
proposals and bid for funding was submitted to the Department in July
2004. A number of issues on the transport modelling, scheme appraisal
and funding arrangements were followed up over the following
year.</p><p><a name="06060647000451">In the light
of that further work, the Department is satisfied that the transport
modelling and appraisal of the scheme is now sufficiently well
developed for the purposes of a decision on the entry of the scheme
into our approved programme of transport investments. We also recognise
that the scheme appraisal produced by the authorities demonstrates that
the SEMMMS road proposals would bring significant benefits to the
south-east Manchester area, including bringing traffic relief to a
number of local centres and the improvement of access to Manchester
airport and other employment centres. They would provide a high-quality
route for freight traffic from south-east Manchester to access the
trunk road network and help to facilitate complementary measures to
encourage walking, cycling and bus usage.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 64WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000452">However, we have to remember
that alongside those benefits there would also be some negative
impacts, particularly on the environment. In particular, the
north-south bypass of Stockport would run through the Goyt valley,
adversely impacting on the landscape and biodiversity of the
area.</p><p><a name="06060647000453">I recognise
that it is now some time since the Department concluded its work on the
appraisal of the scheme, and the hon. Member for Cheadle asks why that
is so. It would be helpful to outline the challenges that need to be
addressed before a decision can be reached. First, I would like to
consider the cost of the SEMMMS road scheme. A key factor that has to
be very carefully considered is that the SEMMMS road proposals are
extremely expensive. Although it is true that the proposed scheme is on
a smaller scale than the previous trunk road proposals, the
authorities&#146; latest estimate of the cost of delivering the
complete SEMMMS road scheme is around &#163;550 million. That assumes
that construction will start before the end of the decade and that
construction inflation will run at 2.5 per cent. over the period. That
cost estimate is significantly higher than that produced for the
multi-modal study.</p><p><a name="06060647000454">Moreover, evidence has emerged
across both the trunk road and the local roads programmes in recent
months that suggests that construction inflation has risen
significantly more quickly than 2.5 per cent. per annum, partly due to
increasing oil and commodity prices. In view of that evidence,
departmental officials recently asked Stockport to review the current
cost estimate, looking in particular at the potential pressure on
construction costs. We are awaiting Stockport&#146;s response on
that. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that no
Government could enter into such a large investment decision without
considering carefully the scheme&#146;s affordability and
deliverability, and the implications for other
priorities.</p><p><a name="06060647000455"><b><a name="06060647000725">Mark
Hunter:</b> I am grateful for the generally positive and
supportive things that the Minister has said about the relief road
scheme, but does she not accept that it is somewhat frustrating for
those who have long campaigned for the relief road to be completed to
hear the Government talking about cost escalation, especially given
that the delay caused by successive Governments has led to much of the
increase in costs over that period? I acknowledged earlier that a
substantial price tag was attached, but none the less local residents
feel strongly that the Government ought to be prepared to meet their
part of the
bargain.</p><p><a name="06060647000456"><b><a name="06060647000726">Gillian
Merron:</b> I appreciate the frustration expressed by the hon.
Gentleman on behalf of his constituents. He rightly acknowledged,
however, that previous Governments have failed to respond as he would
have liked. I stress the need to take all factors properly into account
before taking a decision.</p><p><a name="06060647000457">That leads me
to the second point: funding and procurement. As is normal with all
large transport schemes, we invited the three authorities to explore
the possibility of private finance as a means of delivering and funding
the SEMMMS road scheme. One of the principal advantages of private
finance is that, for such large schemes, it can offer valuable
efficiencies in the procurement and subsequent management of the assets
over the life of the concession, which is normally 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 65WH</b><br>25 years. However, PFI is approved only when it represents better value
for money than the alternative of conventional funding.</p><p><a name="06060647000458">The hon.
Gentleman will be aware that the Government provide financial support
for local authority PFI schemes through the system of PFI credits. The
amount of the PFI credit broadly represents the amount of capital
investment that the Government are supporting financially. The
authorities&#146; latest estimate of the PFI credit funding
requirement for the SEMMMS road scheme is about &#163;860 million,
which covers both construction and future capital maintenance. As I
have already noted, we have asked the authorities to update their cost
estimate, which makes it possible that the estimated PFI credit
requirement will increase further.</p><p><a name="06060647000459">Even at
&#163;860 million, that is a very large amount of funding. For
example, it is more than the Department&#146;s total PFI budget for
the current year for local authority transport PFI schemes in the whole
of England. We must therefore consider the affordability of SEMMMS
alongside our other priorities for PFI funding&#151;including, for
example, our programmes for street lighting and road maintenance, as
well as other major investment schemes. We are still considering the
provision of PFI funding for the scheme, which raises some complex
issues, but it has to be recognised that delivering SEMMMS as a
conventionally funded scheme would raise even more difficult questions
on affordability.</p><p><a name="06060647000460">As I
mentioned earlier, we provided each region last year with indicative
funding allocations for major transport schemes over the next decade.
In the north west, the funding allocation starts at &#163;115 million
in 2006-07, rising to &#163;135 million in 2014-15. The north-west
has an ambitious programme of transport improvements and, even without
SEMMMS, it has faced some difficult choices in deciding which schemes
to prioritise. It is clear that SEMMMS, at its current estimated cost
of some &#163;550 million, would take up several years of the
region&#146;s allocation if the scheme were to be funded 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 66WH</b><br>conventionally. It seems doubtful that the region would be prepared to
prioritise funding for the SEMMMS scheme by sacrificing a major part of
its other scheme priorities.</p><p><a name="06060647000461"><b><a name="06060647000727">Andrew
Stunell:</b> I am sure that the Minister will have papers
showing that the public sector contribution to the scheme is &#163;32
million. We are talking about a PFI scheme, which is outside those
limits&#151;and that was the point of the refinancing package
supplied by the three authorities.</p><p><a name="06060647000462"><b><a name="06060647000728">Gillian
Merron:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman, but that is all that
we are considering in reaching a decision. I must tell both hon.
Gentlemen that we need to consider how such an ambitious scheme can be
funded other than conventionally. It is only right and proper to put
those issues before the House.</p><p><a name="06060647000463">All of that
raises significant issues about the provision of funding for the SEMMMS
road proposals. We recognise the good work that Stockport and the other
authorities have carried out to develop and appraise the SEMMMS road
proposals, and we understand their desire, as well as that of the hon.
Gentlemen, for a decision to be made as soon as possible.</p><p><a name="06060647000464">We also recognise the
importance of the scheme and the benefits that it would bring to the
south-east area of Manchester. However, it would represent an enormous
investment by Government. We need to consider the risks associated with
the scheme as well as our other funding priorities. I cannot today give
a definitive date for reaching a decision. I can say only that we aim
to work through the issues and to reach a decision as speedily as
possible. I anticipate that that will be before the end of the
year.</p><p><a name="06060647000465">Once again, I
congratulate the hon. Member for Cheadle on securing this debate, which
has given me the opportunity to set out the position and associated
issues in respect of such an important
matter.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 67WH</b><br>

Ian Liddell-Grainger (Bridgwater) (Con):</b> I am grateful to
have the chance, yet again, to raise in this place what I believe is a
vital and important matter. I am pleased to see the Minister in his
place. He has returned from visiting our oldest veteran, who I believe
is 110 years old. It was a great ministerial duty&#151;and, I am
sure, one of importance to the nation&#151;to visit one of our oldest
and most important citizens.</p><p><a name="06060647000468">Defence is a genuine interest
of mine. I used to be an adviser at the Army Land Command headquarters.
I maintain the rank of Major, and I am still on the reserve list of the
Territorial Army. Most important of all, I represent a constituency
with a proud history of providing our Army, Navy and Air Force with the
real means to do the job&#151;in other words, to put forward the
Government&#146;s will anywhere in the world. In Bridgwater, we make
bombs. We have done so efficiently, economically and successfully for
more than 50 years&#151;since 1939 in fact. Some of my constituents
are the best legal bomb-makers in the business. They are true
specialists and dedicated to their work. Unfortunately, next year there
may be no work for them to do. Next year, the people who now own what
we call the Royal Ordnance just outside Puriton intend to close it.
Why? They reckon that they can buy what we need elsewhere in the world
but a whole lot cheaper&#151;and unfortunately they have convinced
the Government&#151;but they are absolutely wrong, and history proves
them to be wrong.</p><p><a name="06060647000469">It
is rather pithy that the debate should be on the anniversary of D-day.
It was today, 62 years ago&#151;unfortunately, the Minister and I
were not there. Thank God for the Americans; we launched a joint
operation from these islands to bring a final end to the bloodshed that
we know as the second world war. Brave allied soldiers&#151;British,
American, Canadian, Australian and other allied forces&#151;landed on
the beaches of Normandy. It was the severest test of manpower and
equipment. The symbolism of a successful invasion disguised the
carnage; we have only to ask those soldiers who survived. Putting it in
today&#146;s crude terms, there were far too many Private Ryans, far
too many weapon systems that did not share the same ammunition, far too
many home-grown disasters on that day. D-day was a victory, but it was
also something of a miracle.</p><p><a name="06060647000470">Military success relies on
courage, training and scrupulous attention to detail. That detail
includes knowing exactly what your weapons are capable of
doing&#151;what they will do when the trigger is pulled. We can be
completely sure only if we know exactly where the kit was made and by
whom. When Hannibal set off across the Alps, he had not bought his
elephants on eBay; he knew exactly where they came from and what they
were capable of. Those elephants were tried, tested and reliable. In
Queen Victoria&#146;s time, the dear old British Admiralty, which we
all love, would insist that every issue and item of munitions on board
all our fighting ships was made here, at home&#151;hence the Royal
Ordnance factories, which have existed since the days of Henry
VIII.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 68WH</b><br><p><a name="06060647000471">Even the
glasses for the telescopes had to come from a specific British
manufacturer with a reputation for excellence&#151;no ifs or buts.
That was not blind patriotism or protectionism, but simple common
sense. I wish our neighbours and allies no disrespect whatever; I have
trained and worked with most of them. However, British standards in
military matters have rightly always been of the very highest; every
other nation works hard to match them. There is a huge risk in buying
bits and pieces&#151;especially those deliberately designed to go
bang&#151;on the open arms market.</p><p><a name="06060647000472">I am afraid
that under many Governments, Britain has acted stupidly in the past.
Not long ago, the British Army took delivery from India of an enormous
consignment of 9 mm ammunition. I have a horrible suspicion that it was
bought as a special offer&#151;probably two for the price of one. The
ammunition jammed and misfired with such frightening regularity that it
was taken out to sea and quietly dumped. Meanwhile, British officers
and soldiers who attempted to fire certain 7.62 mm shells made in
Portugal still refer to them as &#147;Lisbon crackers&#148;.
Unfortunately, once again, the Ministry of Defence had to cut its
losses; it fed the useless Portuguese munitions to the fish. Buying
those munitions was neither sensible nor economic.</p><p><a name="06060647000473">We still have problems with
shells. These days we get them from France, where &#147;quality
control&#148; is a phrase for which there does not seem to be a
direct translation. Even suppliers in Germany are suspect on quality. I
hope that the Minister is taking note of what I say; I am delighted
that he is here, although I accept that responsibility for defence
procurement lies with another Minister. As the Minister can well
imagine, much of the information comes from the experts who make the
bombs in Bridgwater. Those people, who make up an old work force, have
spent their lifetimes in the industry. They believe strongly in their
country and in what they do, and still see themselves as employees of
the Royal Ordnance
factories.</p><p><a name="06060647000474">I shall
provide an example of some slightly heavier artillery. The old Royal
Ordnance factories won a contract to manufacture the RO18, a weapon
still in service today. However, the MOD first insisted on buying a
Belgian version, which went on test in Canada and proved so inaccurate
that the safe area for our troops had to be increased tenfold. The
Secretary of State at the time&#151;not the present one&#151;said
that he knew all about it. He explained that the fault was common, but
refused to stop the MOD buying cheap Belgian products. That was not
acceptable. The only line of defence against the shoddy workmanship was
the expertise of Royal Ordnance staff, who were then responsible for
checking every item of stock that came in. One report eerily catalogued
the landing of a consignment from a European arms factory:</p><a name="06060647000549"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When the first batch
arrived the base plates simply fell off. We had to teach them how to
weld them on!&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060647000475">That
ought to be the scary stuff of history. Unfortunately, however, I know
that it still happens. The more we buy abroad in the mistaken belief
that cheapest is best, the more we risk embarrassment, accident and,
ultimately, potential military disaster.</p><p><a name="06060647000476">When loading big munitions, we
need propellant, which we used to make here. However, now we buy it
from Switzerland&#151;a little nation more famous for its cuckoo
clocks and chocolate. Swiss propellant still 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 69WH</b><br>gives problems. We still import erratic naval shells from Australia. TNT
from eastern Europe is of &#147;very dubious quality indeed&#148;.
Those words are not mine, but from the report of someone who deals with
TNT and works inside this close-knit and very loyal British industry.
Why are we forced to import TNT, of all things, from eastern Europe?
The British company that makes it over here reckons that it can make
far more money by not making it here at all.</p><p><a name="06060647000477">The
parliamentary advisers to BAE Systems should start taking note at this
point. British Aerospace was proud enough to use the national name when
it bought Royal Ordnance plc in 1986, not under this Government.
However, then came the rebrand&#151;everything in this country has to
be rebranded. Out went the words &#147;British Aerospace&#148;; in
came the abbreviation &#147;BAE&#148;. The company is now so busy
getting rid of other essential British assets that I rather wonder why
its title still includes the B for British at all. I do not believe
that it is a British company any more. We should say goodbye to Airbus
and to the Bridgwater bomb factory, too&#151;it is all becoming a bit
of a tragedy.</p><p><a name="06060647000478">Some
130 BAE Systems workers agree with me, as do, I like to think, many
Members of this House. My illustrious predecessor, the former Secretary
of State, Lord King, agrees with me. Shutting the BAE plant would be
much more than a local blow; it would be a national disgrace. It could
put at risk the very defence of the realm, about which every Member,
regardless of who they are, should care.</p><p><a name="06060647000479">We started
making armaments in Bridgwater during the last war; it was a question
of necessity. Germany was stretching our military capabilities to the
limits. It was in my local Royal Ordnance factory that the famous
bouncing bombs designed to destroy the Ruhr dams were loaded. Their
inventor, Sir Barnes Wallis, is probably rotating in his grave at the
news that we now know.</p><p><a name="06060647000480">The bombs aimed at Saddam
Hussein&#146;s bunkers were also made at Bridgwater; the final
charges for our ultimate weapons are still made in the area. Next year,
however, the essential ingredients will be shipped in from France,
provided that the French are not on strike. Relying on foreign
suppliers for anything as essential as military munitions is mad. No
Government should treat defence as they do commerce, and no Government
should ever be held hostage by any company, British or otherwise. Who
will pack our bombs in future? Who will load our bullets? It will not
be done at Glascoed.</p><p><a name="06060647000481">I
hope that my questions are sensible, but so far I have not been given a
real answer from any Minister in this place or the Lords. I have
corresponded with Ministers and taken part in rather too many detailed
face-to-face sessions. I am always told, not only by Ministers, but
BAE, &#147;There is nothing to worry about; BAE Systems is confident
that there is no risk to supply.&#148; I am sorry, but I do not
believe that. I can understand why BAE Systems cannot be bothered with
a little bomb-making factory that ticks over nicely but will never make
a real bomb in the financial sense.</p><p><a name="06060647000482">I am told that a consignment of
explosives was recently shipped from France to Somerset so that the
experts at Puriton could have a look at it. The product was
passable&#151;just about. However, security at the French depot at
which it was collected was lamentable. The gates were wide open; the
staff had gone to lunch. 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 70WH</b><br>The lorry driver went in, picked the stuff up himself and delivered it
back here. That cannot be right in any country. It certainly would not
happen here&#151;I know that it would not&#151;and it should not be
allowed to happen in places on which we depend in other countries.
Making weapons is far too important to leave to the sloppy or
cut-throat practices of the marketplace. I am convinced that the risks
of buying abroad outweigh the advantages. To adapt the words used by a
recent Defence Secretary when giving evidence to a Select Committee,
buying abroad is not &#147;fit for
purpose.&#148;</p><p><a name="06060647000483">Of
course closing our arms factory would be a bitter blow to Bridgwater,
but it would also be a dangerous step for national security. I ask the
Minister to use his muscle and to intervene before it is too
late.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060647000568">1.39

of munitions and for providing me with the opportunity to speak in my
first ever Adjournment debate as a
Minister.</p><p><a name="06060647000485">The
hon. Gentleman brings his considerable defence experience to the
debate, and he is a powerful advocate for his constituents. I suspect
that I shall be able to reassure him on the points he raised about
security of supply, although I shall not be as reassuring on the

vital strategic issues, and I recognise the disappointment being felt
by the loyal, committed and experienced work force in Bridgwater.
Although general munitions are important for the future of defence,
this is a commercial decision for the company. However, I understand
what the work force must be feeling. As a former trade union
representative, I hope that I can be sensitive to
that.</p><p><a name="06060647000487">Turning more
specifically to weapons and ammunition, the hon. Gentleman will be
aware that the UK defence market is the most open in the world. We
procure a range of weapon systems from overseas that provides us with
an effective military capability and value for money to the British
taxpayer. It includes munitions&#151;I shall refer to some of his
specific points on munitions later&#151;but also complex weapons and
other equipment. It would be wrong to deny ourselves the opportunity to
draw from a wider market if it made sense to do
so.</p><p><a name="06060647000488">The focus of the
debate is the use of foreign-procured munitions, which is an emotive
issue on both sides of the House, but one which I assure the hon.
Gentleman has been thoroughly investigated and tested by Members of the
House in Adjournment debates in this Chamber and on the Floor of the
House. Such investigation helped to underpin much of the munitions
chapter of the defence industrial strategy, which provided clarity in
the thinking of the Ministry of Defence on the supply of general
munitions.</p><p><a name="06060647000489">The
strategy explicitly recognised the military importance of munitions and
the critical capabilities that we want to retain and develop in the UK
industrial base, such as the ability to design munitions, support 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 71WH</b><br>them through life and test them safely. In that regard, we have a stated
policy to convert our explosives to insensitive
munitions.</p><p><a name="06060647000490">On the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about TNT, of course it was important to our
general munitions policy in the past, but demand for it will decrease
as we start switching to insensitive munitions with a polymer-bonded
explosive that do not rely on TNT as the explosive
fill.</p><p><a name="06060647000491"><b><a name="06060647000731">Mr.
Liddell-Grainger:</b> Is the Minister aware that the Americans
tried to make that explosive and blew up the plant? He may not be aware
of that, as he is filling in. BAE Systems people have gone out to
Holston to help sort out the
mess.</p><p><a name="06060647000492"><b><a name="06060647000732">Mr.
Watson:</b> I am not aware of that situation. Obviously, my
officials will find out about it, and I will write to the hon.
Gentleman if I cannot get an answer in the next 20
minutes.</p><p><a name="06060647000493">The
re-engineering of the explosives manufacturing process was always going
to be necessary, regardless of any company rationalisation plans. In
simple terms, it was already undergoing considerable change as new
technologies were adopted and new forms of chemical bonding
developed.</p><p><a name="06060647000494">As the hon.
Gentleman is aware, BAE Systems provides the armed forces with the
majority of their general munitions mat&#233;riel. In October, we
reaffirmed our long-term commitment to BAE Systems and its supply of
munitions in the form of signed partnering principles, which ensure
security of supply of munitions and build on the framework partnering
agreement that we signed with the company in 1999. Those principles
encourage improved performance, value for money and modernisation of
the company&#146;s systems. Without that, there is unlikely to be a
substantial future for munitions production in the
UK.</p><p><a name="06060647000495">Any site
rationalisation activity is a commercial decision for the company. I
strongly understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about security of
supply, but we have been given assurances that the required capability
will be delivered at value for money. It may be that today we will have
to disagree on our interpretation of those
assurances.</p><p><a name="06060647000496">BAE
Systems has announced the closure of two of its munitions sites:
Chorley and, as the hon. Gentleman knows, Bridgwater. I understand his
continuing concern about the Bridgwater site. If it were in my
constituency, I would also be advocating my constituents&#146; case.
However, the decision remains a commercial matter for the company. I am
aware that it is providing a comprehensive redundancy package that is
well above the statutory minimum. In addition, there will be
opportunities for relocation within the company. Nevertheless, as I
said earlier, I recognise that this is a difficult time and that an
older work force might choose not to take that
option.</p><p><a name="06060647000497">BAES Land
Systems intends to outsource the supply of several explosive products,
but some elements of the explosives manufacturing process at Bridgwater
will be transferred to Glascoed. As such, a programme of significant
investment has commenced to underpin a 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 72WH</b><br>secure and affordable source of supply and to ensure that essential
munitions capabilities continue to be supplied from a UK base. To
secure greater value for money, BAE Systems may source base materials
for those munitions
overseas.</p><p><a name="06060647000498">The company
has assured us that, in assessing potential overseas sources of supply,
security of supply considerations are a key factor in deciding which
companies can provide such mat&#233;riel. I have asked my officials
at the MOD to keep me informed about this, and of course I will write
to the hon. Gentleman if there are any
changes.</p><p><a name="06060647000499">For a variety
of other munitions, the MOD and BAE Systems have a significant
stockpile of mat&#233;riel to ensure access to munitions when the
armed forces need them. The hon. Gentleman will be reassured by the
fact that we have undertaken rigorous assessments of our future
arrangements with BAES Land Systems in respect of the supply of
munitions and are confident that the right decisions are being made on
security of supply and value for
money.</p><p><a name="06060647000500"><b><a name="06060647000733">Mr.
Liddell-Grainger:</b> The Minister is making a powerful point,
but I beg to disagree with him. May I give him one example? During the
first Gulf war, my predecessor, Lord King, asked the Belgians for 7.62
mm ammunition for general purpose machine guns. The Belgians refused to
give it to us because they did not agree with our involvement in that
war. I hope the Minister agrees that we cannot ignore the point that we
have no say at all if a country
disagrees.</p><p><a name="06060647000501"><b><a name="06060647000734">Mr.
Watson:</b> The countries that are hoping to supply us will
have given guarantees that they will retain a security of supply.
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be comforted on that point when I
discuss Eurenco and future reassurances that we hope to make in that
area.</p><p><a name="06060647000502">The company has
indicated that it is likely to source raw materials from the Holston
plant in the United States, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. It is
one of two potential international suppliers, the other being Eurenco
in France. The hon. Gentleman raised the point about security in a
previous debate. I have been assured that BAE Systems has talked to the
company about security, and perhaps some of his concerns could be
allayed by its security
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06060647000503">My
officials have visited Holston and are wholly assured that it can
easily produce ample quantities of the materials we require while
meeting the stringent quality standards that he says are vital.
However, the final decision on sourcing will be for the company, based
on the parameters that we offer in the
contract.</p><p><a name="06060647000504">The hon.
Gentleman tried to test my French on quality control. I shall not even
attempt to come up with a phrase, but I assure him that quality control
underpins everything that our officials are trying to achieve in the
contracts. It is important that we include a system of monitoring and
testing so that quality never decreases. He raised an important point,
and I hope that the systems that we put in place will reassure him in
that regard.</p><p><a name="06060647000505">It should
also be noted that the Holston plant can manufacture crude RDX to the
same standard as that previously produced at Bridgwater. BAES Land
Systems, overseen by the Defence Ordnance Safety 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 73WH</b><br>Group, validated initial samples, and I am assured that they are of
excellent quality. From the frown on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s face,
we might have to disagree on that point as well. Each batch of raw
material will be tested in the same manner to ensure continued
quality.</p><p><a name="06060647000506">The hon.
Gentleman should be reassured that the decision to support the
company&#146;s plans was not taken lightly. The company could not
allow a situation to continue in which BAE Systems was starting to
underwrite inefficient production. We applaud the company&#146;s
efforts to achieve a better balance of cost and capability. Its
decisions are in line with the defence industrial strategy and are in
the best interests of producing a modern and sustainable munitions
business in the UK for which we can tell the British taxpayer we are
getting value for money. I hope he understands that that is the balance
we must strike.</p><p><a name="06060647000507">The
hon. Gentleman should be reassured that a project team is closely
monitoring and challenging BAE Systems as it undertakes that
transition. I congratulate him, because these debates are profoundly
challenging to BAE Systems as well, and perhaps a bit of parliamentary
scrutiny will its keep technicians&#151;although he mentioned its
parliamentary officer&#151;on their
mettle.</p><p><a name="06060647000508">In addition,
the company has contingency plans, particularly as there are at least
two overseas suppliers for each of the main raw energetic materials
that we require. Should the unforeseen happen and supply be interrupted
from one source, BAE Systems will retain the technical ability to
switch to the alternative or draw on existing stockpiles.</p><p><a name="06060647000509">Another benefit of the
company&#146;s transition is the considerable investment&#151;up to
&#163;10 million&#151;in its facility at Glascoed. That will become
a centre of excellence in the development and production of insensitive
munitions, which are what we will need to operate all our future
munitions requirements safely.</p><p><a name="06060647000510"><b><a name="06060647000735">Mr.
Liddell-Grainger:</b> The Minister has been generous in giving
way and I hardly dare ask him another question, but can he give an
assurance on whether we have any long-term commitments as a nation to
ensuring that the Glascoed plant is retained? Are there any long-term
guarantees from BAE Systems on
that?</p><p><a name="06060647000511"><b><a name="06060647000736">Mr.
Watson:</b> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a long-term
guarantee, but I can certainly write to him and sketch out the future
arrangements for munitions
manufacture.</p><p><a name="06060647000512">The
company has already invested about &#163;12 million in the new
insensitive munitions plant at Glascoed, and we continue to examine new
ways to provide capability and value for money. That is not an
exclusive process, and if the hon. Gentleman can bring his experience
to bear on it, I will welcome his input and that of his
colleagues.</p><p><a name="06060647000513">In
munitions, that aim is being exercised through project
MASS&#151;munitions acquisition, the supply solution. With the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s defence background, he will know that the MOD is
fuelled by acronyms, and project MASS is one that does what it says on
the tin. The project is in its assessment phase and is examining our
requirements beyond 2010 with 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 74WH</b><br>regard to the entire munitions supply chain, as well as analysing the
potential benefits of further involving industry in the end-to-end
supply chain for
munitions.</p><p><a name="06060647000514">The
hon. Gentleman should also be reassured that even though BAES Land
Systems is doing its utmost to guarantee security of supply, we have
gone one step further. The Department is taking active steps to help
the company to create an even more robust supply chain. A good example
of that can be seen in the potential Holston arrangements. The supply
arrangement from Holston will be a commercial one between two separate
arms of BAE Systems&#151;BAES Land Systems in the UK and BAE Systems
Inc. in the US, which runs Holston&#151;but we are already in
negotiation with the US Department of Defence for a stand-alone
munitions memorandum of understanding to underpin that. That will
ensure clear understanding on both sides of the importance of reliable
supply.</p><p><a name="06060647000515">A similar
memorandum of understanding with France is being considered for the
products supplied by Eurenco, so on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
about Belgium, I hope I can reassure him that we are trying to offer
that extra confidence to the
system.</p><p><a name="06060647000516">More widely,
there are also a number of international agreements with our allies,
such as the implementing agreement on security of supply with France,
Italy, Germany, Spain and Sweden, and the US-UK defence co-operation
memorandum of understanding, which provide support and assurance in the
security of supply of defence equipment, including munitions.</p><p><a name="06060647000517">Although the
supply of explosives to our armed forces is an emotive matter, it must
be remembered that we already rely on overseas suppliers for a great
deal of our equipment. The UK is successfully procuring a range of
munitions components from overseas already, not to mention a range of
complex weapons. Therefore, even if BAES Land Systems was to reinvest
at Bridgwater and accept the resultant cuts in other capability areas,
we would still have to source many of the remaining components of each
ammunition round from
overseas.</p><p><a name="06060647000518">In
general, even if a UK company is the prime contractor for a particular
equipment, it is likely that it will source many of the components from
overseas. We would not wish to hamper UK companies in their efforts to
produce top-line equipment for our troops by insisting that they source
components in the UK. Obviously, a balance must be struck between
security of supply and value for money, and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will, if not be happy with my contribution, understand that
we keep the issue at the forefront of our minds in every decision that
is taken.</p><p><a name="06060647000519">Conversely,
many of our allies rely on us for many of their defence equipments
where we are the leaders in a particular area. Only through that global
marketplace can we ensure that we can afford to give our troops the
best equipment they
deserve.</p><p><a name="06060647000520">As
a new defence Minister, I say to the hon. Gentleman that I want the
best equipped and the best trained forces, so that they can live up to
their name as the best armed forces in the world. Although I do not do
defence procurement&#151;that is done by another Minister&#151;and
I am not the Minister with responsibility for the armed forces, that is
a shared goal that all four Ministers at the 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 75WH</b><br>Department are keen to achieve. Our new Secretary of State is
particularly keen that we give the reassurances that the hon. Gentleman
and other Members are looking for on security of
supply.</p><p><a name="06060647000521">To
sum up, I am confident that the changes that I have described will
provide better capability at better value for money in such an
important sector, ensuring that our armed forces are provided with the
general munitions necessary for success on operations. The hon.
Gentleman might not walk away with the assurances 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 76WH</b><br>that he requires on the future of Bridgwater, but I hope that I have
been able to allay some of his fears on the strategic level of security
of
supply.</p><p><a name="06060647000522">I
understand how the hon. Gentleman is standing up for his constituents
and the work force, and he has also talked to the trade unions about
the issue. If there are any other ways in which the Department can
soften the blow in our commercial relationship with BAE Systems, we
will do everything we can to help him and his constituents.</p><p><a name="06060647000523"><i>Question put and agreed
to.</i></p><p><a name="06060647000524"><i>Adjourned
