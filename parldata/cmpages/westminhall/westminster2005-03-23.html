<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Mr. Ainger.]</i>
</p>



<a name="50323h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>


<p><a name="50323h01_spnew0"><b> Vera Baird  (Redcar)</b>  (Lab): I am pleased to have drawn this debate on the day after the recommencement of the Fawcett commission on women and the criminal justice system, which I chair. The commission was re-launched by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary last night, and we also saw the launch of our new document &quot;One Year On&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para0">The first phase of the Fawcett commission was set up by the Fawcett Society as a result of concerns about the treatment of women in the criminal justice system. It is a system largely designed by men for men, and it continues to be a man&#039;s world. That is something about which it is possible to feel ambivalent, because at its root is the fact that 90 per cent. of all crime is committed by men, as is about 95 per cent. of all violent crime. It is reasonably well known that about the same percentage of senior judges are men.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew1"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I stand second to none in my admiration for the work that my hon. and learned Friend does in the House in this regard, but does she accept that there can be a gender bias against men in the courts, particularly in cases involving child custody?
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew2"><b> Vera Baird </b> : I do not accept that there is a bias against men in such cases.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew3"><b> David Taylor </b> : Or can be.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew4"><b> Vera Baird </b> : Nor that there can be. In a small percentage of difficult cases, the parties can become polarised. My hon. Friend will be aware that there is a new Bill on that very topic, and I am a member of the Committee that is scrutinising its drafting. I think that he will find some of our suggestions to improve it helpful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para1">I return to the criminal courts, and the treatment of women&#151;the topic of the debate. It is not surprising, given the figures that I quoted, that women have been treated as an add-on, an after thought, an also-ran; they are tacked on to the end of the male system as if they had no distinct or separate needs. Indeed, that was the finding of the first phase of the Fawcett commission. In the year prior to March 2004, we gathered a great volume of our own evidence, and we also drew together existing research on adult women in the criminal justice system in England and Wales.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para2">We found a common theme, with systemic disadvantage being faced by women in the courts, whether as victims, offenders or as practitioners. To address that disadvantage, our primary recommendation was that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 256WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
public bodies should have a duty to promote gender equality, and we are delighted that the new Equality Bill contains provisions for exactly such a duty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para3">The diversity of agencies that work in the criminal justice system makes a firm argument for such a duty. The Prison Service, the courts, the Crown Prosecution Service, the police, the National Offender Management Service and a range of other services all come together to form the criminal justice system, and it is difficult for each organisation to ensure that it has no gender bias. It is imperative that they work together to end it. The Fawcett commission felt that the need for a gender duty was pointed up strongly by the criminal justice system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para4">Our findings were published March 2004 received, and they received widespread attention both domestically and internationally. My right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), the former Home Secretary, described it as
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;a unique and invaluable contribution to the debate on the reform of criminal justice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para5">So far as we are aware, it is truly the first study undertaken in the United Kingdom on women and the criminal justice system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para6">The Fawcett Society lobbied the Government and the courts to make the necessary reforms, and we monitored progress on our recommendations. We then produced our report &quot;One Year On&quot;. We had found systemic disadvantage, but that was in March 2004, when our money ran out, so all we could do was say, &quot;Everything is terrible, but I&#039;m afraid we have to leave the job now.&quot; Happily, we can now express our gratitude to the Esm&#233;e Fairbairn Foundation and to the Barrow Cadbury Trust, which have allowed us to continue for two further years. &quot;One Year On&quot; launches this new phase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para7">In our view, there are two key strategic challenges for the Government in connection with women and the criminal courts. First, there is an overwhelming need for a coherent and structured approach to addressing violence against women. Secondly, there is a similarly powerful need for all agencies to take responsibility for stopping the ongoing horror of self-inflicted deaths and injuries in women&#039;s prisons. These two areas are closely related.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para8">Violence against women is an issue of fundamental human rights that includes, among other offences, rape, sexual exploitation, trafficking, domestic violence, forced marriage, crimes in the name of &quot;honour&quot; and female genital mutilation. These offences have a terrible impact on the lives of women and girls and are far more widespread than is commonly thought. The most recent British crime survey shows that almost half of women have experienced domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking. Violence against women also has a wide impact on society. Government research estimates that domestic violence alone&#151;just one of the strands of violence against women that I have cited&#151;costs the country &#163;6 billion a year, rising to &#163;23 billion if the human and emotional costs are taken into account.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para9">Our report on victims and witnesses who are women in phase 1 of the commission highlighted the &quot;post-code lottery&quot; of services for victims. We have found in our review &quot;One Year On&quot; that provision is still pretty patchy. We are therefore throwing our weight, such as it is, behind the call from Amnesty International and the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 257WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Women&#039;s National Commission for a comprehensive strategy cutting across all Departments to tackle violence against women.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para10">We also need to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship between women&#039;s victimisation and their offending. Our courts categorise people as either victims or offenders, ignoring the considerable overlap between the two. Good research by the Fawcett gender and justice policy network shows that a disproportionately high number of women in prison have a history of suffering violence, abuse and victimisation. Those are features of people&#039;s lives that tend to lead to self-harm, too. It is a shocking fact that death and self-harm are a matter of routine in women&#039;s prisons. We are deeply concerned about the systemic failure to protect vulnerable women in the state&#039;s care. Since we reported in March 2004, there have been a further 12 self-inflicted deaths by women who were sent to prison by the courts. The Government committed themselves in the 2004 spending review to funding radical alternatives to custody for women offenders&#151;that was the turn of phrase&#151;which was a welcome move. However, the provision must be resourced properly if it is to be effective.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para11">The third approach that we took to considering women, the criminal courts and the broader justice system was to consider their experience as workers in the criminal courts. We strongly believe that improving the treatment of women practitioners will lead to better treatment of women victims and offenders. Since we reported in 2004, it has been a difficult time for those in the prison and probation services, because of the changes taking place and the merger of what, even to the most casual observer, are the two completely conflicting cultures of the probation and prison services. However, we welcome the progress being made and Government proposals to set up the judicial appointments commission and to make reforms to the police service. We hope that both sets of proposals will help to improve diversity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para12">These are the general ways in which we considered the position in 2004. Specifically with regard to the courts, women&#039;s lack of representation at senior level in the judiciary was the most obvious thing that jumped out at us. The system of appointment varied across the judiciary, and still does. It is much more transparent and open in the lower parts of the system&#151;for example, in the magistrates courts and tribunals&#151;where the work force are consequently more diverse. The independent Commission for Judicial Appointments has found systemic bias against female and ethnic minority candidates in the appointment system, and the evidence that we collected suggested the same.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para13">Our male-dominated criminal courts have affected the experience of women who come before them as victims, witnesses or defendants. We found&#151;this is not new to insiders&#151;that rape victims felt that they were the ones on trial, rather than the defendants, and they blamed the attitude of the judiciary in large part for that.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew5"><b> David Taylor </b> : My hon. and learned Friend outlines the case comprehensively. Is not the judicial system disfigured by a pernicious stereotype of women? Where women are offenders, are they not doubly disadvantaged, because they are measured by whether 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 258WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
they fall short of some idealistic expectation of good womanhood, as Helena Kennedy has said? Is that not a problem in the legal system?
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew6"><b> Vera Baird </b> : I can perceive that it may be a problem in society more widely, but there is much in what my hon. Friend says. There has been a huge domination by males in the judiciary, and consequently there is a canteen culture that can confirm out-of-date stereotypes of women. That makes it difficult for those in the judiciary who, with the best will in the world, intend to be independent and neutral, to shed those biases when they come to do their work. I thank my hon. Friend for making that point.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para14">We found in our research that special measures to help vulnerable witnesses, introduced as long ago as under the Access to Justice Act 1999, were not being implemented properly in court. Those special measures are opportunities for vulnerable witnesses to give their evidence in a sheltered way, such as from behind a screen, by television link or, ultimately, on video; that way, they would not have to go into court at all. However, we found that these measures were not being implemented consistently, and that they were still regarded rather as measures for children, not adults.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para15">We found also that lengthy court processes could lead to the withdrawal of vulnerable victims. As for domestic violence, lengthy court processes provided the opportunity for further violence and intimidation to occur. Domestic violence has the highest rate of repeat victimisation of all crime, at 50 per cent. Specialist domestic violence courts have been established to try to improve victim safety and ensure an integrated approach. I shall return to those specialist courts later.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para16">In our research inquiries, we found widespread concern that the courts were becoming increasingly punitive against defendants, particularly women. In 2002, 12,650 women were sent to prison. Last year, the figure was about 500 more. The majority of those women are no risk to the public, and the single most common offence for which women are imprisoned is shoplifting. Almost 40 per cent. of women in prison had attempted suicide at some stage in their life prior to going to prison&#151;a much higher figure than for men in prison and than for the general female population. The growth in the female prison population has much outstripped the growth in the male prison population. On 19 March, the number of women in prison stood at four thousand, eight hundred and thirty-something.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para17">The average sentence that the courts give a woman is 39 days. That is insufficient for any rehabilitative process to commence. It is insufficient for any courses to be gone on, or for women to address their offending in any way, and of course they are not required to do so; all that they are required to do on short sentences of that sort is cool their heels until they are released. It is, however, quite long enough for women to lose their homes, to lose their jobs, or to have their benefits disrupted for their children to require a different sort of care. Their lives, as I shall describe, are often chaotic in the first place, and are thrown into even deeper chaos by the time that they come out of prison.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para18">Nothing is gained by short sentences, especially as two thirds of women who have been sentenced to prison for non-violent offences reoffend within two years. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 259WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Short sentences do the women damage and, given the disruption to their children&#039;s lives, are bound to knock crime into the next generation. Nor do they do us any good, because they simply do not work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para19">In the course of our research, the Law Commission examined partial defences to murder, which is particularly relevant to women who kill a domestically abusive partner. They often go to court facing that charge with no appropriate defence available to them. They have not killed because they lost their self-control as a result of the provocative behaviour of their male adversary. Usually, they act in fear rather than in anger. If they have acted in self-defence but have gone too far, perhaps by stabbing&#151;the most common form of domestic killing of an abuser is stabbing him, having run away from him into the kitchen and seizing a knife from the draining board&#151;they are guilty of excessive self-defence, which carries a conviction for murder, not for manslaughter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para20">To be fair to the Court of Appeal, it has stretched case law in this area, through famous cases such as Sara Thornton and Emma Humphreys, until it has almost cracked, and it cannot cope with such cases much longer. There is an urgent need for the law to be reviewed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para21">Furthermore, although the Court of Appeal has stretched case law, which is to the benefit of women in the appalling position of having to strike back against an abuser who has often been violent to them for many years, these developments are not very well known. They are not, for instance, statutory. Given that the understanding of the relevance of domestic violence to the way women react in such situations is relatively new, we have a real fear that several women are in custody or have been convicted of murder who should not be in that position, and we are anxious to persuade the Government to assist us to review those cases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para22">One year on, is there a great deal of change in the courts, Mr. Cook?
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. I would be remiss in the exercise of my duties if I did not ask hon. Members to bear in mind that in establishing this parallel Chamber, the House decided that the Chairman should be addressed as Mr. Deputy Speaker when the Chair was occupied by one of the four senior members of the Speaker&#039;s Panel of Chairmen.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew8"><b> Vera Baird </b> : I cannot apologise enough. The fact that I am familiar with the Deputy Speaker day to day&#151;not in the way that your facial expression suggests, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but he is my next door parliamentary neighbour but one&#151;has lent me to be inappropriately over-familiar in my mode of address. I am sorry. I thought that I had done something absolutely terrible, and I have.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para23">One year on, have things changed in the criminal courts? Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is little change in women&#039;s representation in the senior judiciary from a year ago. There is, of course, the one woman in the House of Lords, to whom we all cling as a sign of light at the end of the tunnel, two women in the Court of Appeal and 10 women in the High Court. A very pleasing development that we must make a point of noting is the appointment of Linda Dobbs, the first black and minority ethnic woman to be appointed to the High Court.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 260WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para24">Despite changes to the system of appointing judges, which are already ticking over, the independent Commission for Judicial Appointments and our research still found cases in which comments had been made about women&#039;s dress sense or their marital status when their appropriateness for an appointment was being discussed. There is a deeply embedded cultural problem in the system, which will be hard to crack, but the Government&#039;s document welcomes increasing diversity in the judiciary. We make recommendations in our paper &quot;One Year On&quot; that are very similar to those made by the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para25">We would add that part-time work as a judge will be important in ensuring that women play a fuller role, and we hope that that will be given greater emphasis as the Commission for Judicial Appointments Commission develops. Largely as a result of pressure from the commission, High Court judges, like circuit judges, now have to attend training on serious sexual offences before they can hear rape cases. Only two years ago, High Court judges had no training whatever on those offences, but in the last year, we have seen research on section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 about judicial attitudes. That section attempts to restrict occasions when previous sexual history can be given in rape trials to discredit the complainant, and research into its efficacy was carried out by the Criminal Bar Association; it was problem based and merits a good read.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para26">Contrary to its conclusion that section 41 should never have been passed and has made no difference, it shows some very good thinking by a small number of judges about the relevance of previous sexual history. It shows that they have taken on the spirit of the section and that they require their own thinking to go through the hurdles and over the fences in order to prove a sexual history. They looked again at the measure&#039;s relevance and said, &quot;I would have let that in before, and section 41 has made me think differently.&quot; The overwhelming bulk of judges do not think like that and the way they approach problems is, frankly, a disgrace in this modern time. I recommend anyone who takes an interest in the issue of women and criminal justice to read the research, by Neil Kibble, to understand the depth of cultural attitudes, and the extent to which they still prevail in our modern judicial system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para27">We have genuine worries about the calibre of judicial training because there is a problem persuading judges that there is a distinction to be drawn between their preserving their independence, which is imperative, and their need to understand complex modern issues such as domestic violence and rape. Any attempt to teach them modern attitudes to these offences which they can take into account in their judicial functioning is seen by them as an assault on their independence, which it should not be.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para28">As to defendants, intermittent custody has started to be implemented since the commission first reported; we considered it in the new report and found problems for women. The pilot study showed that when and if it is rolled out, the fact that there are only 19 women&#039;s prisons, far fewer than there are men&#039;s prisons, means that women will be required to travel longer distances. There is evidence that it is extremely difficult and expensive for women to get to intermittent custody locations for the weekend. None the less, it is imperative 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 261WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that women, especially, should be given that opportunity so that they can keep their jobs and stay with their families for the rest of the week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para29">The Government will have to bite the bullet and pay the costs for women travelling to intermittent custody. If that is positive discrimination, it is based on the fact that women live further away from the prisons than men, that overall they are poorer than men and that many women who go into custody, intermittent or otherwise, have been convicted of crimes that are linked to poverty. It is a problem, and we invite the Government to consider it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para30">A single community order will replace all current community sentences in April, with the aim of allowing such a sentence to provide a tailored package for the individual needs of the offender. That will work for women only if the National Offender Management Service tailors community provision to be women-specific, of which it does very little now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para31">We were pleased that last night, in launching our report, the Home Secretary announced &#163;9.1 million over the next four years for community provision for women offenders to replace custody. It is clear that the detail has not been fully realised, but we are pleased that for the first time, as we requested, attention and money is being given to women-specific sentences. That was the thrust of the report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para32">It is likely that poor mental health contributes significantly to women&#039;s involvement in crime. We have found that vulnerable women whose psychiatric condition is giving courts concern are often remanded in custody&#151;put into that dangerous location&#151;specifically to obtain psychiatric reports on their state of mind. That seems short-sighted and wrong. We believe that local psychiatric services and voluntary services have to be brought together with local courts to provide fast-track psychiatric assessment and appropriate community treatment packages. That should be done as a matter of urgency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para33">We make some specific recommendations in &quot;One Year On&quot;, which I commend to the Minister. We are convinced that the gender, race and disability duty should apply to the new judicial appointments commission. I cannot see any reason why it should not. Could the Minister confirm that? We also recommend that the Sentencing Guidelines Council should take account of diversity issues, including gender, when it drafts guidelines on sentencing for the court, and that the Home Affairs Committee, which scrutinises its work, should likewise take account of diversity, including gender.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para34">As the new public duty to promote gender equality will not apply to the judiciary&#151;there is an express exclusion&#151;can the Minister confirm that it will apply to the Sentencing Guidelines Council so that gender can be taken into account when the judiciary is sent guidelines? We think that where the defendant has caring responsibilities, they should not be remanded or sentenced to prison without a report on the impact of that incarceration on their dependants. We should like to see that become a rule of law. We think that where the defendant appears to the court to have mental health problems but does not justify admission to hospital, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 262WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
they should not be remanded or sentenced to prison without a medical report on the impact of incarceration on their mental health.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para35">In view of the problem that we have raised about intermittent custody, we believe that it and the new community orders should be monitored carefully to ascertain their impact on women offenders and the impact on families. We support the call I mentioned, which was first raised by Justice for Women and Southall Black Sisters, that the cases of women currently in prison serving murder sentences for the killing of violent partners should be reviewed, because we have real fears that many of them are there wrongly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para36">I return quickly to the issue of specialist domestic violence courts. Research carried out by the Government shows that they are improving the treatment of victims, increasing effectiveness and promoting information sharing. We visited a very good example of a domestic violence court in west London. We wonder what is to happen to these courts. There have been five pilots&#151;in west London, Derby, Leeds, Wolverhampton and Cardiff. The Leeds one is five years old. The Derby one is now 18 months old. They all differ but they are all grounded in some pretty straightforward principles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para37">The police identify cases at the earliest opportunity to ensure that they go to the special domestic violence court. In west London, it meets every Thursday. None of these centres meets every day. Overnight arrests and remands in custody are bailed or remanded again by the ordinary courts to the domestic violence court, once the offence has been identified. District judges are trained specifically in domestic violence. There is great reliance on professional district judges, as everyone seems to think that they are preferable to lay magistrates for these cases. They build up a body of experience and do not consequently have the sort of light attitudes to domestic violence that other judges, who are less well trained and less well versed in the complexity of these issues, may have. Yet these district judges are capable of being fair to defendants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para38">In addition, Crown Prosecution Service representatives are experienced and trained so they are particularly able to make early applications for special measures such as screens. Pre-trial reviews are held early to fix a trial date. They deal with all the issues, including child care and transporting the complainant to court, and trials are fixed within 28 days if possible. A specific case progression officer monitors all cases to spot and to try to iron out glitches causing unnecessary delay. The specialist court also has copies of any civil orders against a defendant in relation to domestic violence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para39">A domestic violence police officer is invariably available by the time of the trial, and they are always present whenever the complainant is. The witness services make special provision for the complainant to be brought into the building separately and looked after in every way. They facilitate a court familiarisation visit if she wants to get a sense of the surroundings before the court date, and the probation service is also available to help. In most cases, a system of domestic violence advocates, who are essentially befrienders from the voluntary sector, look after the interests of a domestic violence complainant from the start of the case. In 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 263WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
normal courts the notification of bail sometimes goes wrong, but in the special courts care is taken to send bail decisions and conditions to the complainant.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para40">These are the principles according to which the courts operate, and they have led to much quicker hearings. That means that there is less opportunity for intimidation or for women who may be ambivalent about giving evidence against their partner to change their minds. The courts have also reduced the number of hearings, of which there are typically seven or eight in a normal court for the simplest domestic violence case, to 3.5 on average in west London, and a similar number elsewhere. That is obviously helpful, and the figures for repeat victimisation in the west London court, which were at the national average of 50 per cent., have dropped to 32.7 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para41">What do the courts cost? According to the Government&#039;s own evaluation, not much, and I am sure that they have read the bottom line. The courts involve a remarshalling of existing resources rather than the provision of new ones. The evaluation of the five pilot specialist domestic violence courts expressed positive views about them and pointed to the improvements. However, that was in January 2004 and nothing has happened since. In our manifesto at the last general election, we said that we would consider the effectiveness of special domestic violence courts. Now that we have considered them, can we have a commitment to roll them out nationwide?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para42">I return briefly to the Fawcett Society&#039;s theme of the two challenges facing the courts and the criminal justice system? They are the need for a coherent strategy on violence against women, and the need to stop vulnerable women, who are often victims of violence at an earlier stage, from going to prison where they deteriorate or from where they sometimes do not emerge. We urge the Government to consider those challenges as two sides of the same coin and to examine closely the courts&#039; role in failing adequately to protect the first cohort in general and the second cohort by too readily sending them to prison. We invite the Government to rise to those challenges.
</p>

<p><a name="50323h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome)</b>  (LD): First, I congratulate the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) both on securing the debate and on what she said. I also pay tribute to the commission on women and the criminal justice system, which the hon. and learned Lady so ably chaired on behalf of the Fawcett Society, which has made an extremely valuable contribution to the debate in many ways. I hope that she feels that that contribution has gone some way to informing the debate and moving it forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para43">There has been a small but perceptible shift in attitudes over recent years. There is more understanding of the parameters of the debate, certainly in Government&#151;I acknowledge the role that they have played&#151;and, more widely, in the legal professions. There is a recognition of the need to take further action on these issues; what is disappointing is the glacial movement on many of them. The problems have been identified, but it has sometimes been more difficult to find the solutions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para44">I shall not repeat everything that the hon. and learned Lady said because that would be pointless, but I agree with the basic structure of what she has said today and in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 264WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
her reports. There are three broad areas in which women encounter the criminal justice system: as victims of crime or witnesses to it; as offenders and as workers within it. That is a useful framework in which to set one&#039;s comments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para45">I shall deal first with women as victims of crime. The hon. and learned Lady is right to identify the great concern about women who are subject to violent crimes, including domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. Although such matters are dealt with better than they were at one stage, they are still often not addressed coherently, and the performance of courts and investigating authorities throughout the country is patchy. The hon. and learned Lady rightly drew attention to the value of specialist courts such as the domestic violence courts dealing with this issue, and it is right that they do. However, most people do not have access to them; even if we rolled out the programme in the way that she suggests, it would still be a considerable time before women in my constituency, for instance, had the benefit of such a court. We need to see these courts as &quot;beacons of excellence&quot;&#151;to use the Government&#039;s phrase&#151;in the treatment of domestic violence, but we must not forget the need to examine the performance of other courts, including lower courts, on these issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para46">The reports also bring out the fact that there is a huge disparity in police attitudes. Some police forces have gone a long way from where they were a few years ago in dealing with complaints of domestic violence and in investigating allegations of rape. Others, unfortunately, are still fairly antediluvian in their attitudes and seem not to have the mechanisms to provide for a successful intervention. We should recognise that the police service is still seen as a masculine domain. Going into a police station&#151;if one can find a station that is open, which is unlikely in my constituency, although I know that there are stations that are open&#151;is still intimidating for many people, but particularly for women. The likelihood that they will then face a male officer is a great concern. One hopes that he will not have preconceptions and prejudices, but it is perhaps more likely that prejudices will exist.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para47">Having gone through the investigative process, we then have the court process. In many ways, that, too, is not very friendly. The Fawcett Society reports bring that out, and I do not propose to cover the same ground. However, there is a failure to recognise the particular difficulties that many women have in attending court when they are family carers, or to provide for them in any sensible way. I have often brought up the closure of small courts, which has an effect on victims and witnesses. It has a disproportionate effect on those who do not have their own transport and have family commitments of which they cannot easily divest themselves. They face a barrier if the nearest court is many miles away, and is not accessible by public transport. We need to address the fact that few courts take seriously the difficulties involved in providing child-care facilities for those with younger children. Many of the support systems for victims of crime are still inadequate. The continuing follow-up, following the conviction of an assailant, is insufficient to provide the support that people need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para48">The numbers of women in our prisons have increased significantly, although they still represent a small proportion of the prison population. In 1993, there were 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 265WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
1,560, and in 2003, 4,461. As the hon. and learned Member for Redcar says, that is due largely to crimes not of violence but of acquisition, normally shoplifting. Many are serving short sentences, whose effectiveness in preventing recidivism is dubious. In their cases, it is clear that prison does not work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para49">The effect of prison on the individual and her family,    however, can be considerable. There is a disproportionate propensity among women prisoners to self-harm and suicide. That should worry us. The innocent families of women who are sent to prison are hugely affected: they are subject to stigma and privation as a result of the women going away, and can find themselves in considerable difficulties as a result of the imprisonment. As there are few women&#039;s prisons, their geographical distribution is extremely skewed, so in many cases women are sent to prisons that are a long way from their families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para50">All of that suggests that first, the courts should more often use dispositions that do not involve a custodial sentence&#151;they are more effective&#151;and, secondly, early intervention is a more satisfactory answer for an offending female, so it should be resourced and used more effectively.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. I ask the hon. Gentleman to increase the volume of his delivery. I am partially deaf, and I need to hear what is being said.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Heath </b> : I must apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Perhaps I was not speaking sufficiently in the direction of the microphone. It is unlikely that I was speaking quietly. I shall increase the volume a little, but I do not want to bellow.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para51">Women prisoners also have a propensity to mental health problems. That suggests that mental health provision to women&#039;s prisons should be increased. It is certainly inadequate at the moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para52">Taking all these factors together, it is demonstrable that short-term prison sentences are often not the answer to women&#039;s offending behaviour. Courts do not always&#151;particularly in the cases of women from abroad&#151;take into account the circumstances of offenders who find themselves under duress, and the effect of that on their behaviour. It worries me that there is a substantial population who have effectively been trafficked here, and who are required to commit offences. They are really the innocent victims, rather than the perpetrators, of criminal offences.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield)</b>  (Con): I am following with interest what the hon. Gentleman is saying. It is probably wrong to criticise the courts about this, because if one goes to the average women&#039;s prison and ascertains the proportion of women who are there for drug importation-related offences, there is no point in criticising the judges for putting them there for sentence. If that is to be an area of criticism, it must lie with Parliament for having made absolutely clear that those sentences have to be imposed in tariff fashion.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Heath </b> : That is a valuable intervention.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 266WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para53">I turn now to women working within the criminal justice system. The hon. and learned Member for Redcar gave a clear exposition about the deficiency in numbers of women working in the criminal justice system. That is so in the case of judges, chief constables, chief probation officers and chief Crown prosecutors. In all those professions, there is a gross deficiency in the numbers of women represented at senior levels. In the case of the police, there has been a welcome advent of women police chief officers, and there are now a few scattered around the country but, of course, not nearly enough to represent the population as a whole.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para54">Women in the police service say that there are still distinct institutionalised discriminatory processes within the police service, despite the best endeavours of those who are trying to institute equal professional practices within the service. There is still a distinct propensity within the police service to divert able women officers into particular specialisms, which often do not have the highest status within the service, and therefore act as a bar to senior promotions. That is unfortunate because there should be no differential: some of the most effective police officers are women who have had the opportunity to use all of the specialisms available within their profession. That fact remains, and the situation is probably the same within the probation service, although the present financial constraints of that service means that is difficult for all probation officers to meet the demands that are placed on them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para55">Within the legal profession, there is an extraordinary pyramid that has been illustrated time and time again. The majority&#151;59 per cent.&#151;of law graduates are women, and 50 per cent. of lay magistrates are female. At the bottom end, as it were, there is no discrimination, yet that pyramid tapers towards the top end. There is, at long last, one female Law Lord, but no more than that, and there is a gross under-representation of women at the level of High Court judges and QCs within the Bar.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para56">Underpinning that taper is a pay differential, which has still not been satisfactorily explained to me, both within the solicitors&#039; profession and the Bar. There is also a wastage of able women at the level of pre-partnership in solicitors&#039; firms, and a similar wastage at the Bar: some women face difficulties in reaching the level of silk. Only 8 per cent. of QCs are women, yet the hon. and learned Lady is a very fine advertisement of the value of women QCs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para57">I know that such matters are being addressed in rhetorical terms, if nothing else. I hope that the new judicial appointments commission will do much better. However, it seems abundantly clear that until we achieve a degree of parity in the legal profession, we will have a one-sided, one-gendered profession that will not serve the country as well as it might.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para58">I look forward also to the first woman Lord Chancellor. Now that there is no bar, as the result of the passing of legislation in another place, there is no obstacle in the way of the hon. and learned Lady as the first woman Lord Chancellor. I look forward to her undertaking that role in the near future. But there we are: even in the House we have difficulties recognising the fact that there should be equality of treatment in the legal profession at the senior level. The Equality Bill, so ably championed by my noble Friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill, will do some good in that respect, as the hon.

and learned Lady said. However, despite the improvements in recent years, there is a still a long way to go.
</p>



<a name="50323h01_time2"><h5>10.21 am</h5>


<p><a name="50323h01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Dominic Grieve  (Beaconsfield)</b>  (Con): It is a pleasure to participate in this debate. I suspect that I shall give the Minister ample time to respond, and I am sorry that there has not been more participation. I welcome this opportunity and congratulate the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) on securing the debate. I was aware of the Fawcett commission&#039;s work; indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) was involved in that work prior to taking her place on the Front Bench, and I know that she found it particularly valuable. I certainly found the conclusions interesting and useful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para59">The issues that the hon. and learned Lady highlighted&#151;which I am delighted to hear will be considered further in work by the commission&#151;are absolutely the right ones. Women confront a series of problems in the criminal justice system, whether as victims, defendants or participants&#151;I adopt the same model as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)&#151;that need to be addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para60">It is sensible to start with women as victims. One of the problems with the debate is that it is difficult to know the extent to which the much-needed reforms introduced by the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 will work in practice. That legislation may provide compelling improvements in the way that women are treated as victims in the criminal justice system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para61">I certainly acknowledge, from personal experience, that the courts can be a difficult and hostile environment for victims at the best of times. That is particularly so if the offences of which the victim comes to give evidence have major emotional and physiological content. In truth, that is often so in the sorts of cases about which the hon. and learned Lady talked. I do not think that that is necessarily a gender issue, and in some cases the problem applies to men who come to give evidence. However, in the order of things, it is women who are principally put in that position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para62">The lack of facilities in court for people to be found a place to sit before giving evidence, the delays that are inherent in the criminal justice system&#151;all practitioners and judges try to eradicate those delays, but they continue to plague us&#151;and the difficult task of balancing the right of the defendant and his representatives to cross-examine with the right of the victim to be protected from intrusive questioning are all difficult matters. My experience is that much can done without any statutory change at all, simply when people are much more sensitive to the underlying issues. There I agree with the hon. and learned Lady.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para63">It is unfortunate, but although we often see wonderful examples of good practice in court that create an atmosphere in which justice can be done and the victims can feel that they have been treated properly, we are still confronted by plenty of examples where that does not seem to happen. That seems to be due to ignorance, although on some occasions it is possibly due to prejudice. However, I suspect that ignorance underlies it, which raises issues about judicial training, and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 268WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
potentially the question of providing continuing training for advocates in areas that are slightly removed from advocacy but that relate to proper conduct in such cases. There are some fertile areas for exploration in relation to these topics.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para64">As the hon. and learned Lady knows, in the course of the domestic violence legislation we have provided for some changes in the law in practice in court. It is too early to say how that will work out. However, these are positive steps and we welcome them. The Government were right to take them, and I hope that they produce some benefits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para65">The second area about which I wish to speak is that of women as defendants. The hon. and learned Lady put forward an astonishing statistic about the average period of imprisonment that women undergo. I believe that there is universal agreement that very short sentences are entirely useless&#151;whether for women or men&#151;so that statistic raises serious issues as to why that average stands as it does. However, an average is an average; it would be necessary to examine carefully at how it is working out in practice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para66">As I said, there is a universal view that short sentences&#151;under 12 months spent in custody&#151;allow for no opportunities of constructive rehabilitation and training. What, therefore, is going on? I suspect that what is happening&#151;as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome highlighted&#151;is that, as a consequence of societal changes, the number of women going through the criminal justice system has been increasing. Although it may be true that the majority of these women are being imprisoned for shoplifting offences&#151;I suspect that that must be for persistent repeat offences, because it is unlikely that someone would be imprisoned for a first time offence of that nature&#151;there has also undoubtedly been an increase in the involvement of women in violent offences. I suspect that that increase has taken the criminal justice system largely by surprise, and that it has been unable to respond adequately&#151;people have been flapping around searching for a solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para67">The hon. and learned Lady rightly highlighted that in some instances one cannot distinguish between victim and criminal. In many cases&#151;this applies to men as well&#151;people who are victims of crime are also perpetrators of crime. However, in the context of violent crime, I have no doubt that that correlation exists in relation to women. Indeed, one of the reasons why more women may be involved in generalised violent crime&#151;such as girl teenage gangs on the street&#151;may be that there is a greater incidence of violence against them. We do not know. The Fawcett commission may be interested in examining that area, because it is certainly an area of societal change. It may reflect a greater sense of empowerment in women generally, so that they stray into more male areas. It is a worrying phenomenon, and I suspect that the courts are unable to cope with it and do not know what to do about it.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew15"><b> Vera Baird </b> : We always assumed in the Fawcett commission that although we were studying women, and expected to find that they were at the sharp end of features of the criminal justice system, our findings would have application to men as well. We hope that some of our recommendations will play out in the area of male involvement.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 269WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para68">I also wanted to reassure the hon. Gentleman that when the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) withdrew from the commission, she was replaced by the right hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mrs. Shephard), who serves us very well.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Grieve </b> : I am grateful to the hon. and learned Lady for reminding me of that&#151;I had temporarily forgotten it. I well remember the circumstances in which my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham started to work on the commission. I know that she was delighted to participate in that work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para69">In relation to women as defendants, there is also the question of prisons. The truth&#151;I think that it applies to the custodial system generally&#151;is that the variability is astonishing. I know that the commission visited Holloway. I remember discussing it with my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham, who was horrified by the conditions there. Against that, not so long ago I visited Send prison near Guildford, and I was impressed&#151;although I am always hesitant when talking about the prison system, because changes seem to happen in it very quickly. There were opportunities for drug rehabilitation at Send. In excess of 50 per cent. of its inmates were foreigners, most of whom were serving prolonged sentences for offences linked to drug importation, but despite having to cope with that situation, it provided a humane regime for the women incarcerated there; there was a great deal of hope in the atmosphere. The trouble is that such examples are all too rare.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para70">The link between self-harm in women and imprisonment, and the problems associated with women&#039;s prisons generally, as well as the fact that many women prisoners have serious mental health problems&#151;that applies to male prisoners, too&#151;are important issues. It is also the case that many women who commit offences that bring them to public notice&#151;as opposed to merely the notice of the courts&#151;experience degrees of demonisation that are often unjustified, and that they experience them because they are women. That is a societal problem with which we have great difficulty in grappling. Given all those circumstances, I am unsurprised that mental health problems are prominent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para71">The hon. and learned Member for Redcar highlighted that considerable progress has been made with regard to practitioners in the system, including Law Lords, members of the Court of Appeal, and High Court judges. The criminal justice system often operates at a lower level than that, and it is now unusual to find a court where there is not a female Crown court judge sitting, along with other colleagues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para72">However, there are serious problems in the recruitment of women into the judiciary, and they are rather more complicated than has sometimes been acknowledged. In recent years, there has been a tendency to look at career structure, and to identify as the key obstacle the desire of many women to take a period off work in which to have children, but I am coming to the conclusion that they are not the real problems. The real problems were highlighted in a recent meeting of the all-party group on the Bar that I 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 270WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
attended. The first of them is the number of women who are deterred at an early stage from pursuing careers in advocacy or the solicitor profession. Recruitment statistics suggest that there is a large input of women, but many of them leave the profession within three or four years of starting in practice. Secondly, what has always been underestimated is that the problem for women who take time off to have children is not that period itself, but the period when they have returned to work&#151;as my wife, who is a barrister who has returned to full-time practice after having had children, points out to me. That is potentially the busiest time of their careers, and it is when judgments are likely to be made about whether they are suitable for appointment to the judiciary, if that is their chosen career option. It is the time when the ambition of many women filters away; they do not put themselves forward for promotion when plenty of them are worthy of being appointed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para73">These are complicated issues, and I very much hope that the judicial appointments commission will address them. We have welcomed its creation, and I hope some changes will flow from it. We must encourage&#151;subject, of course, to the overriding consideration of merit&#151;a wide pool of talent, and we must ensure that women are represented throughout the criminal justice system. That is essential; it applies not only to advocates and judges, but, as the hon. and learned Lady said, at every level, whether that be the police or the National Offender Management Service. We all know that in those areas, particularly in the police, there has often been a culture that many women may not find congenial in terms of participation. There are some big issues to address.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para74">In conclusion, I welcome what the hon. and learned Lady has said. I am particularly pleased to hear that there will be an opportunity for the commission to do further work; I did not know that. I congratulate her on securing the debate and on putting her points forward, and I look forward to hearing the Government&#039;s response from the Minister.
</p>



<a name="50323h01_time3"><h5>10.35 am</h5>


<p><a name="50323h01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Mr. Christopher Leslie) </b> : First, I congratulate my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) on her contribution in steering the Fawcett Society&#039;s commission on women and the criminal justice system, which covers such vast ground that it has been useful to have a proper, quality, in-depth look at its results and conclusions, and to hear such a warm welcome to many of its findings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para75">I want us to pay tribute to the commission&#039;s work, but I do not want to give warm words of welcome only; I want to consider what action might be taken in several areas. We know that reform in the criminal justice system can be fairly gradual and slow, but good steps forward are being taken. However, there is still a long way to go toward an equal and fair justice system for all that is more sensitive to the needs of certain groups of society, particularly women&#151;the largest group in society. It is important to set that work in the wider context of what the Government are doing on women&#039;s policy in general. We want to ensure that there is an improvement in gender equality in all areas of policy and work, and we must keep at the forefront of our 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 271WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
minds the basic principle that all people must be equal in the eyes of the law and that we must therefore have fair approaches to achieve equal opportunities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para76">My hon. and learned Friend talked about the positive duty being put into the Equality Bill to give the promotion of gender equality a statutory footing much the same as the existing duty on race equality. That will go a long way toward delivering some of the more      general aspirations of the commission&#039;s recommendations on duties on public bodies. We need to work out the implications for each public body, particularly those in the criminal justice service. I would like to consider them one by one and write to my hon. and learned Friend about progress on that, and about how the measure will apply to the Sentencing Guidelines Council and other bodies. That is an important issue: how in generality we can say these things, and how they will work out in practice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para77">We should always remember the difficulty that the criminal justice system has had in dealing with domestic violence. Of course, that crime affects both men and women, but women are disproportionately afflicted as victims. Everybody has the right to feel free from crime and to feel that when a crime takes place it will be dealt with justly by the criminal justice system. We must make significant changes regarding domestic violence, particularly to aid women who have been victims; there are major steps that we can take.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para78">We need to be much more determined to tackle the issue; the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 is the biggest overhaul of domestic violence legislation for at least 30 years, and is a crucial part of our wider strategy to prevent domestic violence by protecting and supporting victims and bringing perpetrators to justice. The Act ensures that both civil and criminal law offer the maximum protection to all victims to stop violence from recurring and to bring offenders to justice. The Act is clear and straightforward and will significantly aid women. For example, it makes breaches of non-molestation orders a criminal offence, so that the police have clearer powers of arrest when attending incidents, and will extend the eligibility of non-molestation and occupation orders so that victims can make an application for protection even when couples have never married or lived together.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para79">We need to make it more widely known that common assault is an arrestable offence, to ensure that police can get perpetrators away from the scene of a crime so that violence does not escalate. In the courts, we need to ensure when sentencing that restraining orders can be imposed for any offence, so that victims can have immediate protection and will not need to make a separate application to the civil courts, as used to be the case. Cases would be held in a criminal court without the restriction order, and people would not have to be accompanied over the road or to another side of town to the county court to get the restraining order in place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para80">We need also to enable courts to impose restraining orders on acquittal for any offence, if they consider it necessary to protect the victim. Again, that will mean that victims will get more immediate protection without the need for a separate application to a different court. These are specific and detailed but important changes to the law that start to shift the balance in domestic

<br>&nbsp;<br>
violence, and will make an appreciable difference to many women who are the victims of domestic violence crimes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para81">There are other measures, too. My hon. and learned Friend mentioned the specialist domestic violence courts, which the Fawcett Society&#039;s commission has been keen to see not only properly evaluated but rolled out more across the country. That initiative has so far seen seven specialist domestic violence courts across England and Wales, which are being evaluated. The term does not necessarily refer to a free-standing building or a particular jurisdiction, but rather to a better and more tailored, specialist way of dealing with domestic violence cases in the magistrates courts. Common features include the better identification or flagging-up of cases to facilitate clustering or fast-tracking them through the system, the pre-trial hearing aspect mentioned by my hon. and learned Friend&#151;the use of that opportunity for pre-trial reviews for better progression on the case&#151;and better multi-agency working between the different public sector bodies that can help find solutions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para82">The key to the successful operation of specialist domestic violence courts is the availability of good advocacy or a support worker who can help a victim navigate their way through what can sometimes be a complicated spaghetti of statutory and voluntary support, to make it clear and help them walk though the process. We have evaluated that and have found that the specialist courts enable the development of best practice and can improve victim satisfaction and inter-agency co-operation as well as increased public confidence in the area in which they are based and reduce the number of cases that sometimes do not need to proceed to a hearing. It has also been evident that some of the specialist domestic violence courts often result in more community sentence punishments, which are more rehabilitative than the custodial approach.

<a name="50323h01_para83">We are convinced of the benefits of specialist domestic violence courts coupled with dedicated support for the victim. I am pleased to be able to say that earlier this month, in conjunction with the Home Office, an extra &#163;1 million has been announced for next year to develop more specialist courts, supported by the advocates. We hope to have 25 such dedicated domestic violence courts by the end of 2006&#151;a step in the right direction. We all want to see more done at a quicker pace, but the investment in public services really makes a difference. It is a classic example of where money and resources can benefit our criminal justice system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para84">We want to develop the first integrated domestic violence court where the criminal and family aspects of cases are dealt with in one court, and we want to pilot that by the end of the year. That will be an innovation in the way that our justice system works. In addition, we refer sentencing issues in domestic violence cases to the Sentencing Advisory Panel, working with the Home Office, to develop a register of civil orders so that the courts and the police will know about previous non-molestation and occupation orders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para85">Good progress on domestic violence has been made across the board, but more work still needs to be done. I want to continue to work with the Fawcett Society and my hon. and learned Friend in developing policy. Woman are concerned about the effect of domestic violence on children and it is important to recognise that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 273WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
all too often children can be victims of domestic violence, as a result of witnessing crimes. We have tried our best to introduce changes and improvements so that better consideration is given to a child&#039;s needs under the criminal justice system. I cannot refer to all the matters that we are focusing on, but I wanted to highlight that aspect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para86">My hon. and learned Friend categorised the experience of women in the criminal justice system by referring to their work as practitioners or in the judiciary as defendants or offenders, and as victims and witnesses. Historically, women have faced barriers to justice, but recently changes have been made to the rules and procedures of courts to bring about improvements. For example, women are routinely cross-examined less frequently now about their previous sexual history in sexual offence cases because of changes introduced under the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. There is still some way to go, but that was a positive change in the law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para87">Given the special nature of sexual offences and sensitive evidence, victims of sexual offences are automatically eligible for special measures. In other words, the protection that is provided for the victim or witness makes it a little more palatable for them to participate in the court process. That applies to younger witnesses, too.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew17"><b> Vera Baird </b> : The Minister has hit on a topic that adds force to my argument that a holistic approach should be taken towards violence against women. He is right: special measures are available automatically to a victim of sexual abuse, but not to a victim of physical, domestic abuse. Such measures must be applied for and are ordered only at the court&#039;s discretion. People at the CPS are experts in such cases and they make applications early to specialist domestic violence courts so that women can be assured of protection. However, outside of that, when women are close to the hearing, they do not know whether they will receive protection. In itself, that is obviously a deterrent to their sticking with the case, and it is a prime example of when we must consider domestic violence across the board and reconcile the two different approaches.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Leslie </b> : I agree with my hon. and learned Friend. The application of special measures is a rapidly developing area of public policy. We have been discussing it in respect of a wider number of cases, including antisocial behaviour cases, when people often need to be encouraged to come forward to give evidence. We must bear in mind the wider principles of public justice being carried out in a public forum, but more can be done more quickly. I ask her to watch this space for announcements about such matters.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Heath </b> : I entirely agree with the hon. and learned Lady and I was interested to hear the Minister speak in agreement. I tabled amendments to the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill, as it then was, in the terms set out by the hon. and learned Lady, but they were rejected by the Government. If there has been a change of heart, I welcome it.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Leslie </b> : I want to study carefully the recommendations that are being made and make sure 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 274WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that we can find a way in which to reconcile them with some of the other principles of justice. There has been a shift of culture within the criminal justice system generally and a wider acceptance of the benefits that special measures can sometimes bring to the justice system, such as screens for witnesses and better assistance for them in the court room.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para88">The Office for Criminal Justice Reform has been working on a victims and witness delivery plan. It was published some weeks ago and provides better directions to local criminal justice boards on how to improve services. It sets out seven national priorities to cover minimum standards for victims and witnesses, and principles with which both sides of the House will agree. The substantially resourced and funded initiative known as &quot;No Witness, No Justice&quot; has also begun to change the culture of the criminal justice system, as different Departments that do not necessarily talk to one another are joining things together to ensure that, from the point of reporting a crime through the court process, going to prosecution and ensuring that a good case is put in the court, witnesses are navigated and helped through the system. That is valuable and to be welcomed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para89">I would not want to neglect some of the good that we in the Department for Constitutional Affairs are doing, even in our little corner of the system. For instance, our target is to install video links into 75 per cent. of magistrates courthouses by 2006, and we are ahead of schedule in that roll-out. There will be separate waiting areas: that may seem basic and obvious, but it is vital so that a witness does not necessarily have to sit next to the defendant before going into court. It can be an intimidating process and it is amazing that witnesses sometimes have to do that. We are aiming to cover all magistrates courts by 2008, and we are on target for all Crown courts too. Witness liaison officers are being appointed in magistrates courts to be a more welcoming presence at the entrance to the court. A number of these changes are very positive, but more needs to be done, and we must keep our foot on the accelerator pedal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para90">The other aspect of my hon. and learned Friend&#039;s comments, based on the Fawcett Society&#039;s report, covered women working within the criminal justice system. Women have historically experienced under-representation, not just in the judiciary but as practitioners in general. Although it is not now true in the magistracy, where about half of magistrates are women, it is regrettably still true in the professional judiciary, where women make up just 23 per cent. of district judges in magistrates courts, 10 per cent. of circuit judges, 10 per cent. of High Court judges, 5.5 per cent. of Court of Appeal judges, and just one of 12 Law Lords. There have been notable changes in recent months, but much more can be done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para91">I do not have too much time to go into the improvements that can be made. However, at the Women Lawyers Forum held on 5 March, my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor announced the outcome of the recent consultation exercise on increasing diversity in the judiciary, and set out a consequent programme of work that is now being taken forward. Some strands of that work, such as improving information and communication about being and becoming a judge, and the introduction of career breaks for salaried judges, are being introduced immediately. Other areas of work need 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 275WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
further consultation because, for example, any change would require primary legislation or detailed exploration with the judiciary or other stakeholders. That is why we are getting on with it, talking to them and ensuring that we can make those changes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para92">Turning to the Court Service itself, more than 66 per cent. of staff are women, and 43.6 per cent. are in higher management grades. Although only 28 per cent. are senior civil servants, we recognise that it is not just at the level of the players in the courts themselves, but at that of those who support and administer the courts where better equality is needed. We are doing our bit there too. The Bar Council has published figures showing that 44 per cent. of barristers in employed practise are women, and that 48 per cent. of barristers in self-employed tenancies are women. There is a general shift but, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said, the question is what we can do to break through that ceiling and ensure that women have the opportunity to progress to senior level. We need to work much harder to ascertain what those factors are and to tackle them one by one. We must not let these obstacles arise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para93">There has been a universal welcome for the creation of a judicial appointments commission that is independent and much more transparent in the way in which it appoints the judiciary, and we hope that it will be established around this time next year on 1 April 2006, and will get under way in earnest. The Constitutional Reform Bill will, we hope, become an Act any time now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para94">We will undertake all judicial office appointments from 1 April 2006, when the work will be transferred from the Department for Constitutional Affairs. The judicial appointments commission will be tasked to improve the overall diversity of the judiciary in gender and ethnicity under a specific clause in the Constitutional Reform Bill.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para95">Of course, the overriding criterion for appointment is merit, and we would not want to depart from that. I was glad that the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs recommended that the Bill be amended to ensure that the judicial appointments commission has a statutory duty to seek to increase the diversity of those 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 276WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
applying for judicial posts, subject to that criterion of merit. Improvements have been made, but there is more that we can do. I look forward to the work of the judicial appointments commission.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para96">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar also talked about the experience of women in the criminal justice system as offenders. She particularly noted that female victims of crime can also be offenders, and that offenders can be victims. Sadly, there can be a cycle, and we often find the same people in the criminal justice system on either side of a case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para97">I note in particular what my hon. and learned Friend says about prison policy. That is not a direct part of my portfolio in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, but we take particularly seriously issues such as the experience of prison life and the stresses and burdens that that can create. I am particularly worried about the propensity for suicide and self-harm in prisons. We need to do much more work on suicide prevention, and need to focus on women, among whom the preponderance of suicides in prison is much greater.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para98">We are also pleased that the Fawcett commission has broadly supported the women&#039;s offending reduction programme, which aims to tackle the factors that affect the reasons why women offend in the first place and to   reduce the numbers of women who end up in custody by ensuring that community-based services and interventions are tailored better to meet women&#039;s needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para99">Some of the approaches from the beginning to the end of the criminal justice system can be improved to make us more sensitive to the issues that affect women and to their different experiences in the system as victims, as witnesses, as defendants and as offenders, and as practitioners in the judiciary.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h01_para100">We want to ensure that we aim at all times for a justice system that is fair and balanced for all. That must be our objective. It is good news that the Fawcett Society has secured extra funding to continue its work. The Home Secretary helped to relaunch the &quot;One Year On&quot; study, and I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will continue in her work to keep pushing public policy makers to ensure that we attend to these issues as regularly and as routinely as possible.

<a name="50323h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Pensioners (York)</h3>

<a name="50323h02_time0"><h5>10.59 am</h5>


<p><a name="50323h02_spnew0"><b> Hugh Bayley  (City of York)</b>  (Lab): Every year, the Labour Government introduce new measures to improve the welfare and the standard of living of pensioners. In the Budget last week, the Chancellor made two announcements that were particularly important to pensioners: first, the introduction of a national scheme of free local bus travel and, secondly, the introduction of a &#163;200 payment to reduce the effect on pensioners of council tax increases. Both new initiatives will be widely welcomed by pensioners in York.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para0">The free bus pass is a great deal better than the &#163;40-worth of travel tokens currently available from City of York council&#151;reduced from &#163;50 last year by the Liberal Democrat-led council. The Government&#039;s &#163;200 payment towards council tax is worth an additional &#163;2 a week to York pensioners and is a considerable improvement on last year&#039;s &#163;100 payment. It is badly needed in York, because City of York council increased council tax by twice the rate of inflation this year. It was one of the largest council tax increases in the country and it should not have happened: the Government increased the city council&#039;s grant by more than twice the rate of inflation, so there was no need for a large tax rise to be passed on to local people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para1">The Chancellor&#039;s initiatives are good moves by a Labour Government, but I want the Government to go further and to do more to help poorer pensioners to claim their entitlements to extra money from pension credit and council tax benefit. Angela Barham, the information officer and benefits adviser at Age Concern York, says that council tax benefit has a poorer take-up rate among York pensioners than any other benefit. I have a proposal for the Government that could, at minimal cost, do a great deal to increase take-up of council tax benefit. I suggest that when the council writes to pensioners in York to distribute the Government&#039;s free bus passes, it should also circulate claims information and claim forms for council tax benefit and pension credit. In addition, I should like the Minister to consider the feasibility of creating a single claim form or claim line for those benefits to make it simpler for pensioners to claim them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para2">On 12 January, I put my name to the Council Tax Benefit (Entitlement Information) Bill, a private Member&#039;s Bill to change the law to require each local council to write to every pensioner in its area or to undertake door-to-door visits to all pensioners, or both, to inform them that they might be entitled to council tax benefit. The Bill was due to have its Second Reading on 4 February, but was unfortunately blocked by hon. Members who opposed it. I propose that the Government take up the idea behind the Bill and implement it in relation to council tax benefit and pension credit in order to promote take-up of the benefits. The information officer at Age Concern York said that the Government&#039;s take-up campaign on pension credit had been highly successful, but some people who are entitled to it are still not claiming it, and even more do not claim council tax benefit to which they are entitled.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 278WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para3">Let me explain why it is important to do more to help poorer pensioners. Unlike Margaret Thatcher, I believe that there is such a thing as society. Society imposes on its stronger and wealthier members the obligation to support those who are more vulnerable than they are. Of all the vulnerable people, those who most need support are elderly people on low incomes. Unlike younger people, the elderly do not have the opportunity to work and save, they are likely to be on a fixed income that does not rise in pace with earnings or with the rise in living standards, and their savings&#151;if they have any&#151;diminish with the passage of time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para4">I have always argued that the Government should treat pensioners as a priority. I spoke about the needs of the elderly when I first spoke in this House, in my maiden speech 13 years ago. If we think back to that time, when the Conservatives were in power, we are reminded how much better off pensioners are today, under a Labour Government. The Conservatives broke the earnings link for the basic state pension, abolished free NHS eye tests, and dismantled the state earnings-related pension scheme. They mis-sold pensions, encouraging many people to opt out of viable and successful final salary pension schemes and instead to put their money into personal pension plans, which have yielded nothing like the benefits of the pension schemes that they were in originally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para5">The Conservatives took pension rights away from employees when they privatised companies. Think of the bus employees superannuation trust scheme&#151;the bus pensions scheme: bus workers who had spent a lifetime paying into a pension scheme suddenly found that the pension would not be paid on their retirement. It took a Labour Government to restore their pension rights. The Conservatives tried to do the same with the railway pension schemes when they privatised British Rail, but I introduced amendments to the legislation that eventually made them back off.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para6">In the whole of their 18 years in office, the Conservatives raised the basic state pension by more than inflation only once. They did so to compensate in part for their introduction of value added tax on fuel. That sums up their approach. The Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), who was a leading member of the Cabinet in those days, recently wrote in an introduction to the Conservative party&#039;s pensioners&#039; manifesto:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;How a country treats the older generation is a test of its values.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para7">It is indeed, and one need only look back at the Conservatives&#039; record in office to see their values in practice and to realise that they do not value the welfare of pensioners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para8">One might compare the Conservatives&#039; record with Labour&#039;s. A great deal has changed. First, we have provided above-inflation increases to the basic state pension. When Labour came to office, the basic state pension for a single pensioner was &#163;61.15 a week; it is now &#163;79.60 a week&#151;&#163;5.45 a week more than the rate of inflation increase. For a couple, the pension has gone up from &#163;97.75 to &#163;127.25&#151;&#163;8.75 more than the rate of inflation increase. I remember when pensioner campaigners led by Jack Jones demanded a &#163;5 and &#163;8 increase in the basic state pension. That, and more 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 279WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
besides, has been provided by the Labour Government. Those increases are received by 17,520 pensioners in my constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para9">Secondly, the Labour Government have brought in winter fuel payments&#151;originally &#163;50, then &#163;100, then &#163;200, or &#163;300 for older pensioners. Under the Conservatives, there was a winter fuel payment, but pensioners had to wait until there were seven consecutive days of below-freezing temperatures, which practically never occurred. When it did, pensioners got about &#163;1 a day for the cold period&#151;but by that time pensioners had turned down the heating. They did not know whether the cold spell would last four, five, six or seven days, so when the payment came through, paltry though it was, it was too late. In York this year, 19,755 pensioners received their winter fuel payments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para10">Thirdly, the Government have introduced free television licences for the over-75s. Some 6,525 households in York are entitled to free licences. Fourthly, the Government introduced the minimum income guarantee to raise, as a right, the income of poorer pensioners to a satisfactory level. However, that provoked complaints&#151;with some justification, I have to say&#151;from people who during their working life had saved or paid into a private pension scheme and who found that because they had been prudent they did not receive the minimum income guarantee. The Labour party listened to what they said and, fifthly, introduced the pension credit as a supplement to the minimum income guarantee, to extend the benefits of that guarantee to people with modest savings or smaller private pensions. Some 4,265 people in York now receive pension credit; on average, they receive &#163;36 a week on top of the basic state pension. Then, sixthly, the Government decided to uprate the value of the pension credit in line with earnings, not prices, which is the normal uprating for benefits. In that way, the basic minimum standards that the Government have introduced for pensioners will keep pace with the growing increase in living standards in the country as a whole.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para11">Seventhly, last year the Government introduced a &#163;100 payment towards the cost of council tax for pensioners. Now, of course, that has been increased to &#163;200. No one should be fooled by the Conservative promise to make payments of &quot;up to &#163;500&quot; towards council tax. People should read the small print: up to &#163;500 does not mean &#163;500, and for many pensioners, it would mean much less than the guaranteed payment that they will get from the Labour Government. The truth behind the small print of the Conservatives&#039; promise is that they will give bigger payments to better-off pensioners living in larger houses. Furthermore, of concern to me and to the Minister, who also represents a constituency in the north of England, is the fact that under the Conservative proposal bigger payments will be made to pensioners in London and the south-east than to poorer pensioners in the north. That is wrong; it shows that the Conservatives are unreformed and up to their old games on pensions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para12">Eighthly, the Labour Government restored free eye tests on the NHS for pensioners who need them&#151;free eye tests were, of course, taken away by the Conservatives. Some 26,300 pensioners in my constituency and the surrounding area had free eye tests on the NHS last year. Ninthly, the Labour Government 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 280WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
introduced health checks by their general practitioners for all pensioners. Tenthly, they introduced a regime of free flu injections: 75.3 per cent. of people aged over 65 in York have had their free flu injections this winter, one of the highest take-up rates in the country. Eleventhly, the Labour Government removed charges for nursing care in care homes. Twelfthly, we introduced a national half-price travel scheme some years ago to ensure that pensioners in all parts of the country had the benefit of a travel concession. Finally, in his Budget this year, the Chancellor has announced that it will become a free local bus travel scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para13">So, there are dozen benefits&#151;or a baker&#039;s dozen of benefits&#151;that the Labour party has brought to pensioners in my constituency and throughout the country. We have changed the incomes and quality of life of pensioners in York. In the past, old age was always closely associated with poverty. If we look at the Seebohm Rowntree surveys of poverty in York 100 years ago, in the 1930s and in the 1950s, we see a strong correlation between age and poverty. The group most likely to be living in poverty was the elderly. Pensioners had to choose between heating and eating, but that is no longer the case. A recent report by the Institute of Fiscal Studies shows that, for the first time in Britain&#039;s history, pensioners are now no more likely to be living in poverty than other age groups. That is not an argument for the Government to change the priority that they give to pensioners; still less is it an argument for this country to change the Government, because the Conservatives are the only possible alternative. Instead, it is an argument for maintaining the focus and priority on working to improve the security and welfare of pensioners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para14">There are still poor pensioners who do not claim their entitlements, which is why I am proposing new measures to boost the take-up of council tax benefit and pension credit. That is also why I back the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in his continued support for radical pension reform. He is right to identify that the poorest pensioners are women. In the 21st century, it is a scandal that, on average, single women pensioners have an income of &#163;24 a week less than men, and that only 16 per cent. of women now retiring have a full basic state pension in their own right. It cannot be right in this day and age that the welfare of women pensioners depends on the work record of their husband. That problem must be tackled and I congratulate the Secretary of State on saying that the Government will tackle it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para15">The second big problem for the future which I want the Government to consider is that of private pension schemes going bust. The Government rightly have a responsibility to help those who face that terrible problem&#151;people who have paid into a pension scheme throughout their working life, but find that the promised pension is no longer available. I congratulate the Government on establishing the financial assistance scheme to help some of the pensioners in that position, which they have decided to base in the city of York, at Monks Cross.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para16">I urge the Government to continue to seek ways in which to maintain defined-benefit pension schemes&#151; final salary schemes, in common parlance. I asked my hon. Friend the Minister for Pensions about the proportions of employees in defined-benefit schemes. Since the Labour Government came to power, the proportion of public sector employees in such schemes 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 281WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
has increased by 5 per cent.; at the same time, the proportion of private sector employees in defined-benefit schemes has declined by 5 per cent. That has happened against a background of private employers trying to pull back from their obligations to their employees in retirement. I am pleased that the Government have not only sought to maintain defined-benefit schemes for people employed in the public sector, but have increased the number of people in such schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para17">The public sector schemes will need further reform, however, if we are to maintain the principle of the defined benefit&#151;of final salary or the best of a number of years&#039; salary being the basis for the pension. I wish the Government as a whole well. The Department for Work and Pensions is not the only Ministry involved&#151;Education Ministers are responsible for education schemes, and so on. I wish all the Departments well in their work to reform their schemes and to maintain them as viable final salary or defined-benefit schemes, because it is important for employees who have worked for the Government or a public agency in the expectation that they will receive a pension based on their salary, and it sends an important signal to the private sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para18">Unless we as a nation start saving more than we have saved hitherto during our working lives to support ourselves in ever-lengthening retirements&#151;fortunately, we are all living longer&#151;we will not escape the problem that the Labour Government faced when they first came to power of large numbers of pensioners living in poverty. We need both to tackle the immediate problems of people who are already retired on low pensions and to reform pension schemes so that in future people retire with a reasonable retirement income.
</p>

<p><a name="50323h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Maria Eagle) </b> : I congratulate my hon.

<p>
<a name="50323h02_para19">As a fellow northern MP whose local city council is controlled by the Liberal Democrats, it strikes me that Liberal Democrats seem to be pretty much the same wherever they are. When they get the chance to do so, they do not always deliver what they promised. My hon. Friend&#039;s example of his Liberal Democrat council cutting the value of travel vouchers contrasts starkly with the Chancellor&#039;s approach of introducing free travel across the entire country. That is the difference between Labour delivering on its promises and the Liberal Democrats saying anything to get elected and then doing appalling things when they do get control.

<p>
<a name="50323h02_para20">I welcome the chance to take forward some of the ideas that my hon. Friend has raised. He will remember that a Minister&#039;s ears immediately prick up when we hear of a proposal that can be realised at minimal cost. His idea of including letters about free bus passes and claim forms for council tax benefit and pension credit with other literature that has to be sent to individual groups in society&#151;in this case, pensioners&#151;has got to be worth looking into.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para21">As my hon. Friend knows, the present Government more than any before them are committed to reaching out to all those who may be entitled to a range of benefits and services to try to ensure that they get them. We have an extensive ongoing strategy to encourage all those who may be entitled to help with their council tax to apply for council tax benefit, particularly pensioners, who, as my hon. Friend made clear, are the group most likely to be missing out. That is why we launched a campaign in the lead-up to last year&#039;s council tax billing round to ensure that procedures were in place locally to encourage people to apply. In addition, we have issued new versions of the posters and flyers called &quot;Cut your Council Tax&#151;Find out if you should be paying less&quot; which should engage the interest of people who perhaps would like to pay less. We have already sent out the council tax benefit flyer with the winter fuel payment letters to around 12 million people in around 8 million households, many of whom will be in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency. Council tax benefit already makes a valuable contribution in providing financial security for nearly 5 million households responsible for paying council tax, but we remain concerned about those who are not taking up their entitlement and we recognise that we need to do more.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para22">The latest available figures are somewhat out of date&#151;they are from 2002&#150;03 and therefore pre-date the introduction of pension credit and the big take-up campaigns that followed. We hope that there will be significant improvements in the next few years. It is estimated that up to 2.4 million people, up to 1.8 million of whom may be pensioners, are missing out on council tax benefit. There is clearly a lot of work for us to do to ensure that the people who have an entitlement to that additional assistance get it. We must also ensure that they are able to get it in the simplest and easiest way, without having to jump through too many hoops.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para23">Encouraging people to take up their entitlement to benefits such as council tax benefit is very much at the heart of our agenda. We have learnt a lot about how to do that through the pension credit take-up campaigns and the work of the Pension Service local service. I was most encouraged to hear the comment from my hon. Friend&#039;s local Age Concern branch about the effectiveness of the campaign in his area. One often hears when things go wrong; it is nice to hear when things are going well and to receive a little bit of praise. I hope that he will convey our appreciation to Age Concern York.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para24">In recognition of the recent high levels of council tax in some authorities and their likely impact on those on fixed incomes&#151;I have taken on board the points that my hon. Friend made about fixed incomes often implying poverty in particular age groups&#151;we are making a one-off payment of &#163;200 to each eligible household containing someone aged 65 or over. That is a significant amount of money, which will make a big 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 283WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
difference to those in receipt of it. However, we also know that the oldest and poorest pensioners are likely to be disproportionately affected by the rise in cost-of-living expenses. To help with those additional costs, we are making a further one-off payment of &#163;50 to those households containing someone aged 70 or over in receipt of pension credit guarantee.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para25">The free off-peak travel will be tremendously popular among those who receive it for the first time, particularly if they have had to put up with using vouchers in the past&#151;vouchers are inevitably a form of rationing travel rather than encouraging it, because vouchers of a fixed value always run out. That will be a valuable improvement in pensioners&#039; opportunities to travel and get around. It is important that they can do that and not be stuck at home. I hope that when local authorities contact pensioners about the concession they will use the opportunity to promote council tax benefit and other benefits. I would be happy to have further discussions with my hon. Friend about how we might ensure that that happens.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para26">I should like to say a little about progress on our link age strategy, which is an attempt to join up services and provisions for pensioners, ensuring that pensioners are assisted more holistically across Departments and local authorities. The strategy aims to remove duplication and ensure that our older citizens receive not only their cash entitlements, but the vital services that so often determine an individual&#039;s quality of life. The scheme is good news, because it means that more people with an entitlement to pension credit and council tax benefit, as well as other benefits and services, receive assistance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para27">There is an example from my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency that might interest him. A pensioner living in his constituency received a visit from a local Pension Service representative and was found to be entitled to pension credit of an extra &#163;51.32 a week. He received a backdated payment of &#163;2,800, which he had not expected. I am sure that that came in handy. That pensioner was a chap who did not think that he might be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 284WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
entitled to any extra help. In that way, the local service, the joint teams and link age can help to get to people who just assume that the extra help available that they hear about is not really for them.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h02_spnew1"><b> Hugh Bayley </b> : My hon. Friend was kind enough to ask me to pass on thanks to Age Concern York. I would also like to thank the Pension Service staff in York, who have spearheaded the campaign and achieved good results by working with local agencies such as Age Concern. There really is a partnership and it works.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h02_spnew2"><b> Maria Eagle </b> : I am happy to hear that from my hon. Friend and hope that he will pass on those remarks to the local service, because it is nice to hear praise. It should be passed to the people who deserve to hear it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para28">On the wider front, the local service continues to work with partners such as primary care trusts, Age Concern, York, Older Citizens Advocacy York, and the energy efficiency unit, in bringing together the different types of assistance available to make a real difference to people&#039;s lives. Those organisations have arranged a series of joint events, one of which my hon. Friend may recall attending in September last year. I am sure that he found it worth while&#151;I have not heard that he did not&#151;and he might be interested to know that it generated 117 pension credit applications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para29">My hon. Friend gave a figure for the number of people receiving pension credit in his constituency, but the figure that he quoted was the number of households. The actual figure is 5,141 individuals. His figure was lower, because in some households there are two pensioners rather than one.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h02_para30">Such initiatives are important in ensuring that all our pensioners can receive the assistance that we want them to have, so that they can live their lives with dignity, without having to worry about poverty in their old age.

<a name="50323h03_head0"><h3 align=center>Reserve Forces (Iraq)</h3>

<a name="50323h03_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50323h03_spnew0"><b> Richard Ottaway  (Croydon, South)</b>  (Con): I start by paying tribute to the men and women of the armed forces around the world, whether or not they are reservists. Their courage and dedication to duty in the most difficult and trying conditions is paramount in our minds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para0">I had the privilege of serving in the Royal Naval Reserve for more than a decade and other than the annual training deployment, I was not mobilised. Today, young men and women in the reserves expect to be called up regularly for a substantial period, of which my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) is an excellent example. It is critical that policymakers do not forget that although those people are volunteers, we should acknowledge the disruption to their lives and the consequences of their mobilisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para1">In 1996, the previous Government recognised the changing pattern in maximising the effectiveness of the reserve forces, and they started to allow them to engage more freely in the operations of the regular forces. In 1998, the incoming Government acknowledged their manifesto pledge to conduct a strategic defence review of the armed forces and the Territorial Army was restructured away from its original cold war role to support the armed forces in rapid deployment missions abroad. It has become involved in the type of peace-keeping operations that characterised the post-cold war period: for example, the RNR lost its minesweeping role.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para2">Although there was little change to the size of the RNR and the reserve Air Force, there was a significant reduction in manpower in the Territorial Army&#151;from 57,000 to about 40,000&#151;which, with hindsight, was possibly a mistake. The defence White Paper in 2003 did not announce major changes to the reserves, but it acknowledged their growing importance and made several recommendations regarding support and financial assistance for reservists and employers. One purpose of the debate is to explore whether that has gone far enough and has adequate vigour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para3">There is no doubt that the retention of the reserves gives a number of distinct advantages: a reservist is cost-effective and costs about 20 per cent. of his regular counterpart. Equally important, with the decline of national service and conscription, is that the reserves provide a link between the armed forces and the wider community. In the aftermath of 9/11, a further role with responsibilities in civil defence contingencies was added.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para4">It was a good decision to use the reserve forces as civil contingency units; 9/11 changed the world as we know it for ever. There are, however, questions about whether those units are properly equipped and have all the resources they need. There is also the question whether some of the personnel could be double-hatted. To be fair, the Ministry of Defence has vigorously rejected those concerns, but they still exist and it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us what is the position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para5">Last December, I had a golden opportunity to visit Iraq with the Select Committee on Defence. It was obvious straight away that the reserve forces play a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 286WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
major role there, providing 15 per cent. of the forces. The very efficient female private driving my car told me that only a year earlier she had been a beautician in Belfast. She joined the TA for a bit of variety and now finds herself in the middle of the Iraqi desert. That example was commonplace; reservists have a wide range of responsibilities and make a first-class contribution. They are fully engaged in activities well over and above their expectations.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Wilkinson  (Ruislip-Northwood)</b>  (Con): Will my hon. Friend recognise the outstanding role played by the Royal Auxiliary Air Force as well as those of the Territorial Army and the Royal Naval Reserve, to which he belonged? Is it not notable that No. 600 (City of London) Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force, from Northolt in my constituency, sent a range of different specialists to fill gaps and provide essential skills, without which the service could not have functioned effectively?
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew2"><b> Richard Ottaway </b> : I do recognise their contribution. To pick up on my hon. Friend&#039;s point; I realise that whole operations may not be able to take place without the contribution of the reservists. When talking about the reserves it is easy to think primarily of the TA, but it is essential to include the Royal Naval Reserve and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. That is why I use the word reservists as much as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para6">Since 1999, 30 per cent. of the TA&#039;s total strength has been mobilised for operations in support of the regular Army. The majority of them have served in Iraq, but a large number have been mobilised voluntarily as individuals to serve in theatres of operations from Afghanistan to the Balkans. The mobilisation culture has transformed the TA post-cold war. Once seen as the weekend warriors, the TA and other reservists are now largely accepted as an integral part of the armed forces by regular servicemen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para7">When I was in the Gulf, I visited HMS Marlborough and met key Royal Naval Reserve personnel serving on board. They were playing a full part in the operation of that ship and in protecting the oil platforms essential to the survival of the Iraqi economy. The phrase &quot;one Army&quot;&#151;and, dare one say it, &quot;one Navy&quot;&#151;has been coined and is much used by the Ministry of Defence; that is supported by the announcement that each regular infantry regiment will have a TA infantry battalion attached.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para8">All that is illustrated in the excellent publication by the directorate of reserve forces and cadets entitled &quot;Future use of the UK&#039;s Reserve Forces&quot;, which also starkly points out that everyone who joins the reserves should expect to be mobilised at least once&#151;a far cry from yesteryear. The crunch lies in the section entitled &quot;Frequency of mobilisation&quot;, from which I shall read as it puts the case far more succinctly than I possibly could. It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Volunteer Reserve Forces are not an infinite resource. Their availability to fulfil the roles set out above depends upon their levels of recruitment and training and upon their availability for mobilisation. The attitude of Reservists, and of potential Reservists, will in turn be influenced by the attitudes of both their families and of their current and potential employers.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 287WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para9">It could not be better put. It goes on to say that, of late, mobilisations have resulted in
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;a maximum cumulative total of one year out of three&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para10">but that it believes that to be unsustainable, so it is now considering an aggregate of 12 months over five years, which it considers to be far more reasonable. I am sure that everybody will agree. It is important that the director of reserve forces and cadets recognises the difficulties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para11">All of that prompts several questions. Are we treating reservists properly? Are we rewarding them properly? Could we operate without them? As the answer to the latter question is increasingly likely to be no, the first two questions deserve serious scrutiny. A clue to the answers lie in the recruitment and retention of reservists. In his appearance before the Defence Committee, the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Michael Jackson, acknowledged that the reserves were below their establishment level of 42,500. The latest figures indicate that TA numbers are at 38,320, including the non-deployable university officers training corps of 4,800, leaving the TA with a deployable 33,530&#151;way below the required number. General Jackson acknowledged that he had concerns about TA recruiting. With the greater use of reservists in the front line, up to 20 per cent. of the Army could be reservists in future wars. We have a serious problem that has to be addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para12">As the director of reserve forces and cadets recognised, the attitudes of families and employers are critical. I, like others, was concerned to read reports of TA veterans of the Iraq war being sacked by their employers in Britain while on active duty. That is a worrying development and could severely undermine morale in the reserves. It is one thing for them to risk their necks, quite another to risk their jobs. An employer cannot refuse to allow a reservist to go when called up and it is a statutory offence to sack the reservist if that happens. However, that is only a right and the Government have left it to the individuals to pursue their cases. One of the problems is that reservists have to take legal action on their own without any financial or legal support from the Ministry of Defence. Cases of reservists using up all their savings are not unknown. Will the Minister set out what plans he has to give a greater degree of support to reservists who have lost their jobs?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para13">There is also the problem of reservists injured on duty. In one particularly high-profile case, Mr. David Corrigan damaged his knee while on active service as a paramedic with the parachute regiment. He has had a number of operations and incurred considerable personal expense. He has had to leave the TA and give up his job with the ambulance service. Because he was no longer on active service, the Army stopped paying for his treatment. Mr. Corrigan has been shocked at the difference in treatment between TA soldiers and their full-time colleagues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para14">Mr. Corrigan&#039;s Member of Parliament, who happens to be the Prime Minister, has written to the Secretary of State for Defence calling for TA members who served in wartime to be treated as regular soldiers. The Prime Minister&#039;s agent said that Mr. Corrigan had been
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;treated very badly. His case has raised the whole issue of how TA members are treated when they return from serving in wartime.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 288WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para15">I welcome the Prime Minister&#039;s intervention to try to remedy a medical wrong. It would perhaps be described in some quarters as opportunistic, and this case illustrates what a childish response that is to addressing today&#039;s problems. At least Mr. Corrigan will be able to recover 50 per cent. of his expenses under a future Conservative Government. Given the high profile nature of the Prime Minister&#039;s intervention, will the Minister tell us whether medical treatment can be made available to reservists who suffer injury when on active service?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para16">The important point is that if reservists are to be treated like regulars and the principle is established, they should have the same rights and protection. The irony is of course that reservists have had the greater disruption to their lives and have a greater need of the services than some existing servicemen. That is not only the case in health and employment protection. Questions are being raised about military pensions. A long-serving TA major who launched a High Court battle for the right to a military pension after 1,100 days of active service has had to reject the unbelievable contention by the MOD that he was casual labour. Will the Minister assure us that that defence will no longer be used and give us an insight into his thinking on the issue?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para17">Employment rights, health care and pension rights are all important issues for the men and women who serve the country in the reserve forces. They know what danger is all about. The question is whether their Government will recognise that. I said at the beginning that the reserve forces are a cost-effective option for the Government, but with their numbers down and difficulties with recruitment, the MOD has to take a hard look at its approach. All that goes to strategic commitment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para18">In the recently published report on future capabilities by the Defence Committee it was perfectly clear that financial constraints are behind the tensions and stretch now being experienced in the armed forces. The reservists in Iraq are a sharp reminder of that. If there are cuts in ships and aircraft, and reductions in infantry sizes, sooner or later something will have to give, and there will be gaps in capability. That will create a risk that need not have been taken if there had been more careful planning. As the First Sea Lord said, we have now got into the business of coping with risk upon risk. The cuts have been caused by the high costs of new equipment, which is being introduced in a haphazard and poorly planned way. These gaps will have to be filled by men and women who must be supported at all costs. The reserves will play an integral part in doing that, and we ignore them at our peril.
</p>



<a name="50323h03_time1"><h5>2.15 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50323h03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Huw Edwards  (Monmouth)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) on securing this debate. I am interested in the topic under discussion, although I have no personal experience of serving in the military or the Territorial Army. However, I have the privilege of representing Monmouth, and I think that the hon. Gentleman mentioned that he was recently on board HMS Monmouth. Am I right?
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew4"><b> Richard Ottaway </b> : Marlborough.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 289WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Edwards </b> : I apologise for my mistake, but if the hon. Gentleman were to have the opportunity to go on board HMS Monmouth, I would encourage him to do so. I have been on board the ship several times.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para19">I have an interest in the debate: Monmouth is the regimental headquarters of the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers, which is the senior reserve regiment in the British Army. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) always disputes that; however, although it is not the oldest regiment in the Army reserve, it is the senior one, and it is the only regiment in the British Army that has two &quot;Royals&quot; in its name. There is not sufficient time now to go into the history of the regiment, but if any Members want to visit the regimental museum in Monmouth, they will find it very interesting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para20">When we had the strategic defence review, many Members wanted to save their local TA regiment. The Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers was not only saved, but its role was enhanced, although there was a minor reduction in one of its bases in the midlands. Good representation, and the case that it makes for its important role in serving the Army and in having engineering expertise, helped to protect it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para21">The regiment provided the largest reserve force deployment in Iraq. About 40 of its members were deployed in Operation Telic 1, and about 140 in Operation Telic 2. I had the great privilege of attending its medal ceremony a few months ago, when His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester presented medals to all those who had served in Iraq.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para22">Their role there was largely threefold. First, they contributed to the post-conflict infrastructure: they were involved in developing new water and sewerage systems, and in establishing electricity supply and restoring power in general, and they helped in the reconstruction of what become known as the Aldershot bridge. Secondly, they performed a humanitarian role: in the post-conflict situation in Iraq, they supported communities in the Basra area. However, that role was curtailed by the need for force protection, and the regiment was also greatly involved in that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para23">The hon. Member for Croydon, South has made some important points about support from employers for the TA. I would have been appalled if any employer had discriminated against someone who had served in the reserve forces and had been deployed abroad. However, there is a concern about that. It is my understanding that reservists cannot be deployed more than once in three years, that the norm is about once in five years, and that the general feeling is that that norm should be adhered to. Many of the families of those who serve in the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers are worried that, as members of the regiment served in Iraq more than a year ago, they might be deployed again next year. If the Minister can give an assurance that that is not the case, I am sure that they would welcome that. Members of the regiment are aware of the responsibilities that they take on when they join, and they want to use their skills to the best effect.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew6"><b> Richard Ottaway </b> : It is important just to draw the hon. Gentleman&#039;s attention to the fact that a cumulative period of 12 months in five years is what is being proposed, and that that could result in more than one deployment in that period.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 290WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Edwards </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying that. If that were to increase the pressures on them and the chances of them being deployed in difficult situations such as those in Iraq, the representation to which I have just referred would need to be seriously listened to.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para24">Brigadier Ian Cholerton, who heads the Army in Wales, gave a briefing at Westminster a couple of days ago to Welsh Members of Parliament. I asked him to give that briefing after I heard a similar one that he gave at the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers&#039; headquarters in Monmouth only a few weeks ago. He gave a very good briefing to the Secretary of State for Defence, and I asked if he could give a similar one to Welsh Members of Parliament on Monday.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para25">Unfortunately, not many hon. Members from Wales could attend, but the brigadier talked about the future structure of the Army in Wales and the central role that the Territorial Army will have. It has the expertise, especially in engineering, and it is a great honour to be the Member of Parliament for the constituency in which the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers are based. I am an honorary associate of the regiment, and I am happy to do anything that I can to represent its interests and those of its families.

<p><a name="50323h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Desmond Swayne  (New Forest, West)</b>  (Con): I draw the attention of the House to my entry in the Register of Members&#039; Interests as a serving officer in the Territorial Army.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para26">I was fortunate to be granted an Adjournment debate by the Speaker about a year ago, shortly after I returned from Iraq and when that experience was fresh in my mind. By and large, I have said what I have to say, and that is on the record. That brief was not dissimilar from the one that I gave to the Chief of the General Staff conference on 2 December 2003. I made it clear in the Adjournment debate that I was broadly happy with the way in which things were going for the Territorial Army, although I had one or two reservations, which I shall talk about briefly again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para27">Undoubtedly, the measure of the effectiveness of the Territorial Army is that its soldiers&#151;the reservists&#151;should be indistinguishable when compared and serving with their regular counterparts. I am broadly satisfied that they are, which is a credit to them and to the regulars with whom they serve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para28">I did, and do, have a reservation about the extent to which we are using reserves in medium-sized operations of low intensity. The ordinary citizen&#151;the taxpayer&#151;is entitled to ask how we can do with a smaller regular Army and fewer infantry, but expect to call out reservists more often. By and large, however, it is undoubtedly true that the reservists welcome the opportunity to serve and enjoy doing so. That is largely why they join.

<p>
<a name="50323h03_para29">Many of us will have participated in debates on the reserve forces. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) called for the much greater use of the reservists, and argued for ways in which we should make them more useable. We have done so, and we are using them, so it is difficult to complain on that account.

<br>

<p>
<a name="50323h03_para30">If members of the reserve forces were in any doubt about the commitment that they were making when they joined&#151;if they believed, perhaps, that they were joining the boy scouts&#151;they will have been disabused of that belief by now. Members of the reserve force now know exactly what it entails, so there should be no particular problem on that account. There will, however, be a considerable problem when it comes to employers and careers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para31">When I joined the reserve forces, we did not have to worry about our jobs, because we would be mobilised only when there was the danger of the first Russian shock army advancing across the north German plain. We did not have to worry too much about returning to our jobs, because we would be packing our bergens when our wives were reading the Home Office leaflet about how to build a nuclear shelter under the stairs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para32">I always wondered how many people would actually leave their wives in those circumstances, packing their nuclear, biological and chemical warfare gear into their bergens and leaving their families exposed in city centres. Mercifully, we were never faced with the reality of finding what would have happened in those circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para33">We now have the new policy of show and tell, if I might paraphrase it in that way. Reservists must now inform their employer and authorise their military unit to communicate with their employer about their reserve liability. Undoubtedly, that will be a disincentive for employers to employ members of the reserve forces due to the consequences of that liability. For the mobilisations that we had with Operation Telic, it worked tremendously well, and by and large, employers have been supportive. However, we have yet to see how that will roll forward in future, and whether they will continue to be as supportive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para34">The burden can be shared by a larger reserve force. The larger the reserve force, the more the burden of mobilisation can be spread, and the less frequently the same individuals will be called. At the moment, my fear is that we are dipping into a pretty small pool, and the water is getting muddier. We must be particularly aware of and concerned about that. It is all very well asking for larger reserve forces, but when they are as under-recruited as they are at present, that prompts the question of how we shall achieve that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para35">When I joined the Territorial Army, I did it for the money. It was fun, but when I joined the officer training corps at university, I think it was &#163;13 for a weekend, which was money well worth having in the mid-1970s. I am not so sure that in today&#039;s society, with relatively high levels of employment and wages, that is the incentive or the attraction that it was, and we must start to look for more innovative ways of recruiting and retaining reservists. There are opportunities, but I wonder about the extent to which the training available, and the qualifications that reservists&#151;and any military personnel&#151;can acquire through courses, can be encouraged to be recognised in civilian life. For example, modules for certain courses could be, by arrangement with certain business schools, made eligible as part of the modules for a master of business administration. More technical and vocational training could be recognised as a contribution to a corresponding civilian qualification. That would provide an incentive for personnel to go into the military 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
and to stay there; at the same time it might also provide a more tangible benefit for employers. That is worth investigating; I know that the Ministry has been considering that, and I hope that that continues and gingers up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para36">My principal concern is that of tour length. The policy when I was in the Gulf was that reservists were mobilised specifically to serve with a particular formation, and their tour length would be that of the formation. If the formation was going out for a four-month tour, reservists did a four-month tour. The general policy for augmentees, such as staff officers who were mobilised and sent out to a headquarters formation, was that they would do six months. Generally, the tour lengths were four or six months: four with the regular formation going into a roulement or six months for augmentees. Can the Minister tell me, either in his summing-up or by correspondence, whether that policy has changed?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para37">My concern is that if one moves beyond that six-month barrier, and extends tour lengths beyond six months&#151;I know that the liability that one signs up for is one year in any three at present, although there are proposals to change that to one year in any five&#151;that makes it more difficult for employees to return to their careers and to pick up the threads of a civilian life. My advice to the Minister is to stick as close to the six months for the maximum tour length as he can get away with.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para38">I was interested in the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) raised in respect of providing some legal back-up to the statutory rights of personnel. It is all very well to give someone a statutory right, but to tell them, when they come back and find that they have lost their job, &quot;Sorry, mate, you&#039;re on your own&quot; is not a proper response. The point about legal back-up is worth considering. It will be interesting to see how my employers react to my mobilised service at the first opportunity that they will have to do so on 5 May. However, I suspect that if they choose to sack me that will be for other reasons.
</p>



<a name="50323h03_time3"><h5>2.31 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50323h03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Colin Breed  (South-East Cornwall)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) on securing the debate. Although we suffer a little from few Members being present, we all appreciate the way in which he has brought this matter to the attention of the House. There is very little in what he said with which we do not all agree. We have benefited considerably from the broad experience and knowledge of the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), who provided even more support for the humane, reasonable and sensible suggestions that have been brought to the Minister&#039;s attention.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para39">At this point, I am uncertain whether this may be the swan-song in office of the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin)&#151;an office that he has held during an interesting and perhaps difficult period for the Ministry of Defence. I wish him all the very best. We have met regularly in the Committees considering the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Act 2004 and other legislation, and although he was probably working under the considerable constraints of the Treasury and others, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 293WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I often felt that he sympathised with our views, even if he ultimately did not agree with us. Perhaps on this occasion, at the twenty-third hour and fifty-ninth minute of his ministerial career, he might give some indication he has sympathy with some of the things that we are saying.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Ivor Caplin) </b> : I was trying to resist, but could do so no longer. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. I thought that he was going to talk about a compensation scheme because he, among others, argued in Committee that we should make the armed forces a special case. He will have noticed from various recent announcements, and will see in the written statement that I will make tomorrow, that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor agreed that, provided the personnel in question stay within the armed forces, compensation payments in the new scheme should be tax-free.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Breed </b> : I am delighted by that confirmation. No one would say that that is not a good thing. However, many of us think that opportunities in respect of certain aspects of the compensation arrangements were missed during our consideration of the Act, which will come into force from the 1 April. Some of those omissions will perhaps be exposed by some of the cases that have been mentioned and some that I will mention.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para40">It is right to pay proper tribute to the courage, commitment and professionalism of our armed forces and particularly, in this debate, to our reserve forces. I pay a warm tribute to the reserve forces for all that they do. I sometimes think that their role is not well publicised in the media. They are so interchangeable with the full-time personnel that that they are sometimes indistinguishable and therefore do not receive additional recognition. As has been said, however, they are a vital part of the UK&#039;s armed forces. The reserve forces consist of men and women who give considerable amounts of their time, and in some cases even their lives, on behalf of their country. The operation in Iraq has involved the largest call-up of reservists since the Suez crisis in 1956. Since January 2003, some 11,000 reservists have been mobilised to support the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and considerable numbers remain there today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para41">Regrettably, the violence in Iraq persists&#151;we see that on our television screens fairly regularly, Even so, more countries are considering withdrawing their troops or actually doing so. Future operations, especially in peacekeeping, peace enforcement and reconstruction support, will be manpower-intensive. The work cannot be done by the vast quantities of technological equipment that we now have; it requires men and women to do it. It is clear to me and to all hon. Members that the pressures on our reserve forces will increase. That will have serious implications, not least for training periods, recruitment and the treatment of reservists when they return home in terms of employment and job security, as has been amply demonstrated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para42">There are increasing demands on all our armed forces. The present manning levels have resulted in a growing dependence on the use of reservists to meet our 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 294WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
commitments abroad, which in turn places greater pressure on them, and then we see that they are not up to full strength either. At the beginning of the year, the Under-Secretary renewed the compulsory call-out of reservists to support operations in Iraq. At that time, we were told in the House that some 2,350 reservists were called out in the previous year. The decision to use the TA and reservists to an increasing extent on the front line raises the question of the extent to which the Ministry of Defence is compensating for a basic lack of manpower in the British Regular Army.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para43">The Government&#039;s decision to cut manpower in the Army has been questioned on a number of occasions. As we have said repeatedly&#151;I firmly believe this&#151;our troops are the best piece of kit in the British armed forces and we must ensure that they are properly trained, highly motivated and well equipped. The pressure on reserve forces was highlighted a couple of years ago, when the members at an armed forces reservist field hospital were told that they would have to stay in Iraq while the personnel from both regular field hospitals came home.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para44">As has been mentioned, the length of operations and the time between them for reservists should be carefully considered, because any additional pressure will have a detrimental effect on the morale of the TA and on recruitment. I was struck by what the hon. Member for New Forest, West said about the periods for which people are away. I, too, think that six months should be the maximum period. When we think of how businesses operate today and the speed with which they move when it comes to their customer base, technology, systems, mergers, acquisitions and so on, we see that even six months can be quite a long time to be away from one&#039;s post. When people return, they have to assimilate into that company or business again. There may be new personnel and new systems to deal with as well as all the other issues, not the least of which is the experience of spending six months in a place such as Iraq.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para45">The standard of training for our reserve forces is very important. This month, a newspaper report instigated an investigation of a case in which British troops were sent on guard duty in Iraq without bullets because they were not fully weapons trained. I am sure that that was a relatively isolated incident, but it showed that there is pressure to put people into posts for which they might not be fully trained. They might be required to undertake the last part of their training on deployment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para46">It is, however, clear that there are continuing problems with training and equipping our forces in Iraq. We want no corners to be cut in training because it is so vital to the expertise that we deploy and safety of those who undertake such work. We must also ensure that reservists are treated in a similar fashion to regular soldiers in the British Army, not only because that is right, but because they cannot be seen to be indistinguishable when they are required to undertake the same job and might face even greater pressures because they have to return to civilian life. Those men and women deserve to have the same rights as soldiers in the Army, if not better.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para47">A month ago, a case went to the High Court concerning the right to a military pension. There were times during the passage of the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Act when pensions for reservists were highlighted. The hon. Member for Canterbury 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 295WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
(Mr. Brazier) was particularly exercised about the subject and cited a significant number of examples. We will see more such examples if the Government continue to rely more on reservists to fulfil certain functions. More claims will be made for a military pension and it is something that should have been tackled under the Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para48">The case in the High Court could be a landmark case; its outcome will certainly affect many TA members. The major who took his case to court had been a member of the TA for more than 34 years. He claimed that, under European Union law, he should be treated no less favourably than full-time members of the armed forces, who have pension rights. Although he was a part-time soldier, he was not&#151;in his words&#151;&quot;casual labour&quot;. I am sure that we support that argument.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para49">In the Prime Minister&#039;s constituency, we have the high-profile case of David Corrigan. When I read that the Prime Minister was writing to the Secretary of State for Defence saying that TA soldiers should be treated the same as regular soldiers, I thought it strange that he could send those people to war, but could not decide whether they should be treated the same as regular soldiers. I am not certain how that works, but if the Prime Minister felt that the case was proven and he wished to support it, it should not have been difficult for the Secretary of State to answer in the affirmative. Can the Minister say how that case is being considered now?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para50">The increasing pressure on reserves to participate in ongoing military operations in Iraq will have an effect on the retention and recruitment of reservists. Let us consider the relationship between businesses and their employees who are members of the reservists. Many years ago, people would have proudly put the fact that they were TA reservists on their CV. It would have been positive information for an employer to consider when men or women applied for jobs. It would have provided a real character reference, but I wonder whether people would include that information on their CV today. It might be difficult for the employer to assimilate. We must accept that businesses are under much pressure&#151;I do not mean usual business competitive pressures, but pressures in respect of their employees. We are all aware of the terms of maternity leave and paternity leave, and now reservist staff must be taken into account. Businesses today tend to function with the staffing required for the job in hand&#151;there is very little slack. More and more companies take on contract staff, preferring not to employ the staff themselves but to use an agency to provide the number of staff required at any one time. The opportunities for what I might call the ordinary business to employ people in the usual way are becoming fewer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para51">If more businesses are being required to consider such leave patterns, it will change their view of whether they want to employ people in the reserve forces; it will become more and more difficult. The Government have to recognise that they cannot continue to pile additional pressures on businesses without there being a reaction. The Minister might like to give us some idea of how the Ministry of Defence is approaching the problem. It will not go away. Businesses are not suddenly going to say, &quot;We will be only too pleased to see many of our staff disappear for six months at a time.&quot; If we are going to rely more upon reservist forces, a lot more work will have to be done with employers.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 296WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para52">Finally&#151;I think that this is the undercurrent of what has been said so far&#151;the Government have made a positive decision to create a reserve force that will be deployed far more than was thought possible some years ago. It will become an integral part of our forces and we will make much greater use of our reservists. That will require the Government to take a different approach and to consider those men and women in a different light. We did not see much of that in the legislation on paying compensation, but I hope that such debates as this will begin to change the MOD&#039;s mind about how it treats those whom we want to attract to the reserve forces, because in the years to come they will become more necessary and we will be more reliant on them.

<p><a name="50323h03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Keith Simpson  (Mid-Norfolk)</b>  (Con): I, too, congratulate my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) on bringing the subject to the attention of the House. Not only did he serve in the senior service, but he is a now member of the Defence Committee. He brings a lot of experience and thought to our debate. He raised the subject in a non-confrontational way in an attempt to mark out not only the role of our reservists&#151;many of whom, as we speak, are serving in the line of fire&#151;but some of the problems that they will face in future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para53">I add to the comments of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed), who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, by saying that this is notionally the Minister&#039;s last appearance at the Dispatch Box. I genuinely wish him all the best. We have not always agreed, but he has worked hard in his post, and his work for veterans and veteran organisations was much appreciated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para54">I do not know what the Minister will do when he eventually stands down. I believe that the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Mrs. Liddell) has been promised the post of high commissioner in Australia&#151;assuming that the Labour party returns to Government&#151;and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the right hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), has a promissory note for South Africa. Governor of Gibraltar might have been the kind of largesse that an old Labour Government or an old Conservative Government might have bestowed. However, we wish the Minister all the best.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para55">My hon. Friend and others have attempted to put the core of our debate, the service of reserve forces in Iraq and the challenges and problems that they face, in some sort of historic context. You would expect me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as someone who started his working life as a military historian, to appreciate what has been the traditional view for more than 100 years, and especially in the Regular Army, of reserve forces and particularly of the Territorial Army. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), who is no longer with us, rightly noted that the reserves are also drawn from the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force; but the bulk today come from the TA, and the regulars often regarded the TA as a bit of a joke.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para56">At the beginning of the first world war, Field Marshall Lord Kitchener disparaged the TA as a town clerks army, but they contributed more than 50 per cent. of the soldiers who served in the first world war, and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 297WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
more people served in the TA than in the Regular Army or Kitchener&#039;s Army. I would hazard a guess that the situation was nearly the same in the second world war, too. So, that town clerks army provided a massive amount of manpower, which was used physically to defend the United Kingdom and on many operations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para57">It always used to be thought in the Regular Army that an attachment to the TA was the kiss of death, and becoming adjutant of a TA battalion was the equivalent of being appointed a junior Minister at the Department for Work and Pensions: it was not necessarily the most exciting appointment. Of course, General Mike Jackson is living proof that that is not true. He was posted to outer Siberia, as it were, when he became adjutant of the 10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment in Scotland&#151;if he could survive that, he could survive anything. As we know, he ultimately became Chief of the General Staff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para58">The Regular Army has always had an ambivalent attitude to its reserves, and I suspect that the same is true in the Navy and the Air Force. That ambivalence comes down to two things. In the past, reservists were part-time soldiers; the reserves were seen as a drinking club or something that people joined for money. It was thought that reservists wanted to wear the uniform and that they sashayed around, but did not do real service. Their medal ribbons were thought to be for 25 years&#039; undetected crime, rather than for real service. Secondly, whatever limited money the regular armed forces had, it sometimes had to go to the reserve forces, and the regulars always felt that they could use the money better.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para59">There is no doubt that a major change has come about in the past 10 years. That is because the old wartime generation has gone, and the cold war generation is on its way out. It is also because of the nature of the operations in which we are now involved, as well as the basic line taken by the strategic defence review and, more recently, by a whole series of add-ons to that review, culminating in the defence White Paper.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para60">I am not saying this as a purely partisan point, but it is fair to say that the Government are having to claw back from the strategic defence review in many respects. Colleagues on both sides of the House felt that the territorial and reserve forces had been cut too much. The basic line, certainly as far as the Army was concerned, was that if push came to shove, and it was a choice between money for the regulars and money for the TA, the TA would have to take the cuts. We now recognise that those cuts went too far, not least because of the need, during so-called peacetime, to deploy the reserve forces on a scale never before seen in our history, as several colleagues have mentioned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para61">The deployment of our reservists in Iraq, whether in the Army, the Navy or the Air Force, points to a major sea change in our attitude towards reserve forces. Potentially, reserve forces can now serve three times over; it used to be said that they were twice a citizen, but they are now at least three times a citizen. First, they may be mobilised to take a direct role in operational, active service, in formed units or as individuals. Secondly, they are likely to be deployed as back filling&#151;to use old terminology&#151;allowing regulars to be deployed on operations. Finally, we should not forget that some are now organised in the civil contingency 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 298WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
reaction forces&#151;engaged in what used to be called home defence&#151;and they will play a major role in the unfortunate event of a serious major terrorist incident in the United Kingdom. Those three roles overlap&#151;sometimes literally. In some cases, TA soldiers have been told that they form part of a civil contingency reaction force, and they have been mobilised to serve overseas. Our reserve forces experience overstretch as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para62">In thinking about the role that our reserve forces play, we should also bear in mind the fact that, traditionally, they have been a recruiting ground for our regular armed forces, just as the Army Cadet Force and the university cadets have been. A significant number of reservists who have served with the regular armed forces have transferred across. That pool of what I might call generically manpower&#151;so, womanpower as well&#151;is spread pretty thinly. We call upon those people to fulfil a number of functions. Hon. Friends and other hon. Members have rightly pointed out that many members of the reserve forces are proud to serve alongside members of the regular armed forces, integrated with them. Many of them also enjoy being deployed on operational active service&#151;that is one of the reasons why they joined the reserve forces&#151;and not only because of the excitement; they like the physical recognition in the form of a medal that proves that they are not just Saturday night soldiers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para63">Given the momentum of operations, even if those in Iraq eventually wind down, and given that the defence White Paper has made the assumption that expeditionary warfare will continue on the current scale, the situation cannot continue indefinitely; we will require our reservists.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para64">Drawing together the points that my hon. Friends have made, the Ministry of Defence faces a number of challenges, to use the awful Sir Humphrey, civil service terminology. Let me rehearse them. First, as my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) said, there is a feeling that, ironically, if the regular armed forces are overstretched and are having to be supplemented by the reservists, ultimately the reservists will be overstretched as well. He and others posed the interesting question: if we reach the stage at which we almost run out of deployable reservists&#151;if operations continue in Iraq or elsewhere&#151;how will we man our reserve forces?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para65">Historically, in peacetime the armed forces have always been undermanned and overstretched. A number of tools are used to get round that problem in relation to overseas operations such as Iraq. The first is to employ people who are not British citizens. We have done that frequently and we are doing it now. The second is to offer higher pay and rewards of various kinds, not only to recruit people but to retain them. The third is the use of honours, awards and recognition. I shall come back to that. Finally, one can substitute mechanical means for people. I suspect that the MOD has considered the full range of options for our reserve forces.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para66">The problem is that the kind of operations in which we are now involved are, as the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall said, manpower intensive for the Army. In such circumstances, far from needing fewer men we need more. For various reasons, we have not reached the same stage as the United States, where the national 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 299WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
guard is undermanned by 42 per cent. It is having incredible difficulty recruiting people, largely because of what is called the mother factor. Mothers do not want their sons and daughters to go to Iraq, where the large scale of the casualties&#151;fortunately, we have not experienced this&#151;does not balance the financial rewards for serving in the national guard. I am not referring simply to money; joining the national guard is frequently a way to receive education on the cheap. As my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said, one way to recruit and retain members of the reserves is by ensuring that the training and skills that they receive through serving in the armed forces can be recognised in civil life, as is the case with the regular armed forces.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para67">I conclude by bringing together a number of points relating to the future rather than to the past. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the nature of reservists&#039; integration with the regulars means that they have a higher status than ever before. Is that status recognised by the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces? The most senior rank for any reservist is a two-star rank, as is currently held by Major-General His Grace the Duke of Westminster. What a marvellously 19th-century ring that has about it: cool Britannia and new Labour appoint Major-General His Grace the Duke of Westminster as the first two-star reservist officer. Life is full of contradictions. That rank is a central staff, administrative appointment. Does the Minister know the highest rank or command position that a TA or reservist officer holds in Iraq outside an administrative unit&#151;in a combat arm unit? I suspect that it is difficult to get much beyond the equivalent of lieutenant-colonel in all three services. One way to encourage reservists with the necessary qualifications and experience is by giving them the opportunity to hold high field command or staff positions beyond administrative ones. There are arguments against that, but it is an important idea.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para68">The MOD has made good progress, but the level of training and resources given to the TA and other reserve forces should be absolutely comparable to the regulars, particularly if we wish to deploy them on overseas operations. I salute the progress made by the Government, but all hon. Members present have made the point that if we expect reserve forces to continue to be used on such a scale, we cannot afford to have any anomalies in their pay, allowances, pensions or the medical treatment that they receive if they are wounded while serving on overseas operations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para69">The role played by the reservists over the past five years has been outstanding, and they are a credit to our country. We should also praise employers who not only allow reservists to leave their jobs, albeit under legal constraints, but are prepared to employ members of the reserve forces in the first place. As the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall pointed out, many employers employ only about six to eight people in an integrated team. If one man or woman is taken out for six months from such a company, as opposed to Tesco or Marks and Spencer, it is hard to bear. Reservists are a credit to us all, and this debate has shown our appreciation.

<p><a name="50323h03_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Ivor Caplin) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway) on securing this debate and welcome the contributions of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 300WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) and my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards), who I know takes a close interest in such matters. I fully endorse the praise that has been given to our forces in this debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para70">I hope that the Chamber will understand, however, if I begin with a rather more sombre reflection. I know that the whole House will wish to join me in paying tribute to the late Baroness Strange, who sadly died earlier this month. She had been president of the War Widows Association of Great Britain since 1990. She pursued her agenda vigorously, but also with charm and persuasive argument. Over the years she helped to secure a wide range of benefits for our war widows. Most recently, during the passage of the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Act 2004, she helped to ensure that widows whose spouses had died before 1973 did not lose their war pension on remarriage. Baroness Strange was a larger than life person, and was held in great respect and affection in both Houses. Her absence will be a sad loss for us in Parliament and for the War Widows Association of Great Britain. All our thoughts are with her husband Humphrey and the family at this difficult time.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Keith Simpson </b> : I am grateful to the Minister for making those comments. I am sure that all hon. Members would agree that Baroness Strange was a quite outstanding lady. Those of us in the corridors of power who were gripped by her knew exactly what she wanted, and frequently she got it.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Caplin </b> : The mobilisation of reservists in January 2003 to support United Kingdom operations in Iraq was the largest call-out of the reserve forces since the 1950s, as has been said. The initial phase saw 5,200 reservists mobilised in sufficient time to participate in the war-fighting phase of the operation. They served in formed reserve units and sub-units, and as individual reservists in both regular and reserve units. The latter use&#151;to bring units from peace to war-fighting complement&#151;has always been a traditional role of the reserve forces.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para71">Reservists performed many varied and essential roles, from cooks and drivers, to intelligence analysts, amphibious engineers, infantry men and some unique to the reserves. In all, they constituted more than 10 per cent. of the UK ground forces deployed in Iraq. Many were called out at short notice, and it is to their credit, and that of their families and employers&#151;I share that view with the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)&#151;that they met that challenge. The contribution of the reserve forces to that stage of the operation cannot be overemphasised. Without the support of those forces, we would not have been able to achieve the success that we did.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para72">Since the war-fighting phase of Operation Telic has drawn to a close, the reserves have had a continuing role in supporting British forces in Iraq. The United Kingdom is committed to Iraq for as long as the Iraqi Government judge that the coalition is required to provide security and assist the Iraqi security forces. Therefore, just as reservists were mobilised during the war-fighting phase of the operation to fill a variety of roles, now they fill important roles in intelligence, and as linguists, medics and members of the civil and military co-operation group, which specialises in reconstruction tasks.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 301WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para73">Reservists from the RAF have filled many roles, including as meteorological officers, medics, aircraft ground crew and force protection personnel. The RAF&#039;s No. 2 Force Protection Wing has been deployed to Iraq and includes reservists from two Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadrons. The wing&#039;s role is varied, but one of its key functions has been to train around 250 Iraqi policemen. With nearly 3,000 local employees and contractors passing through the airport&#039;s vehicle checkpoint each day, it is vital that those people see Iraqis running their own security. The senior Iraqi police officer, Colonel Imad Abass, who is commander for the directorate of border enforcement at Basra international airport, recently said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It is very good for local people to see Iraqi police occupying the entrance of the airport, organising and controlling things by themselves. It is very good for us and the Iraqi people.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para74">The Royal Naval Reserve has served as logisticians, intelligence analysts, medics, linguists, and mine and amphibian warfare specialists, and RNR sponsored reservists crewed the strategic sealift ro-ro vessels that took so much of our heavy equipment to the Gulf. In particular, we were able to draw on the expertise of one RN reservist who in civilian life worked in Arabian oilfields, and who provided invaluable advice on the pitfalls and possible booby-traps in Iraqi oilfields. Another, a manager of a UK port, was able to set up the new port facilities at Umm Qasr. That demonstrates the invaluable contribution that reservists make.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para75">The process by which individuals are identified and selected to be mobilised has evolved since Operation Telic 1. For that stage of the operation, the numbers required and the time scale in which we needed them resulted in us exercising less discrimination in our choice of who to mobilise than we do now. The attitude of the individual and his employer towards mobilisation could be given less weight in a large-scale compulsory call-out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para76">In short, intelligent mobilisation is the process of identifying willing and available individuals for specific appointments through dialogue between an individual, his or her employer and the unit, and then up through the chain of command. I accept that during Operation Telic 1 that process was less intelligent, but it has become progressively more so. I can confirm to the House that all reservists being called out for Operation Telic 6 have said that they are willing to be mobilised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para77">In continuation of the policy of using reservists to augment the regular forces in Iraq, I announced on 14 December last year a further call-out of reservists for the UK&#039;s area of operations. That will consist of approximately 900 reservists, with a view to deployment from April onwards, and is part of a natural roulement of UK forces that takes place in May. They will undertake a range of activities including force protection duties, medical and logistical support, and providing individual reinforcements to units of all types. The increase from 700, the current mobilised figure, to 900 is due mainly to the replacement of a regular field hospital with a Territorial Army one. That rotation has been long planned. It demonstrates that the reserves are now fully integrated into the overall force structure, and their flexibility and utility. The matter is very much normal business, as far as the reserves and the rest of the armed forces are concerned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para78">The skill and dedication that the reserves have shown while carrying out their duties in south-east Iraq is reflected in the success that we have achieved in that region. In recognition of the reserve forces&#039; contribution, a number of personnel have been recognised in the operational honours lists; the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk referred to that. They included Kingsman Michael Davison from the King&#039;s and Cheshire Regiment, who won a military cross, and Staff Sergeant Anthony Wyles from the Corps of Royal Engineers, who won the Queen&#039;s gallantry medal. Only last week it was announced that reservists were to be awarded an MBE and a military cross for services in Iraq, and a George medal is to be awarded to an individual serving in the Congo. Such men and women exemplify the spirit and quality of Britain&#039;s reserve forces.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para79">Sadly, we have suffered some deaths in action, namely those of Private Smith of the 52nd Lowland Regiment; Corporal Pritchard of 116 Provost company; Fusilier Beeston, also of the Lowland Regiment; Sergeant Nightingale of 150 Transport company, which was attached to the 27th Regiment of the Royal Logistic Corps in Iraq; and Private Kitulagoda of the Royal Rifle Volunteers in Afghanistan. We are indebted to all of them and to their families for the efforts that they made on behalf of the United Kingdom here and abroad.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para80">I want to deal with some of the issues in relation to the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985, which was mentioned by all Members here. Reservists who are called out into permanent service benefit from employment protection under the legislation, which, unless history is playing tricks on me, was passed under a Conservative Government, as was the Reserve Forces Act 1996. Under section 1, an employer is required to take back into employment former employees who have completed their call-out service. Should an employer fail to reinstate a reservist in accordance with the Act, reservists may apply to a reinstatement committee, which will hear the case. The committee can order the employer to reinstate the reservist, pay compensation or both. Failure to comply with an order of the committee is a criminal offence, and the employer may be fined on summary conviction. I am afraid that the Act confers no powers on the Ministry of Defence to take measures against employers who fail to reinstate a reservist.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para81">We also provide advice to our reservists when they return. On demobilisation, as the major will know, reservists receive a briefing about returning to civilian employment. I do not intend to comment on whether he will need a reinstatement committee later this year or next year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para82">Each reservist is also provided with a copy of joint service publication 532, headed &quot;Guidance for Reservists Returning to Civilian Employment: Procedures to Secure Reinstatement&quot;. In co-operation with the regional Reserve Forces and Cadets Associations, we have also introduced the regional directors of the supporting Britain&#039;s reservists and employers campaign to provide advice and guidance to employers and reservists on reinstatement issues. We also have unit employer support officers to boost our capability further in this area. The MOD&#039;s SaBRE campaign team also has a helpline.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para83">I believe, and hope, that the House will recognise that we are doing the very best that we can when our forces return from mobilised service.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Breed </b> : Does the Minister recognise the fact that there have been problems recently with some reservists&#039; jobs ceasing to exist and those reservists being made redundant? There is a feeling that the redundancies were created as a way of getting around the legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Caplin </b> : I was about to deal with the figures, but I spotted the hon. Member for Croydon, South first.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew16"><b> Richard Ottaway </b> : Could I persuade the Minister to go a step further? What people need is advocacy support. I welcome what he just said about the package of support, but these people need someone to represent them. We are not talking about large numbers. It cannot be a significant sum. The Minister has legal departments at his disposal. It would be good if he could go the extra step and provide advocacy support.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Caplin </b> : I entirely recognise the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but we must reflect on the fact that a member of the armed forces returns to their civilian employment once we have demobilised them. Their employment with the MOD ceases. SaBRE and the unit officers that we have put in place do offer the sort of advocacy that he suggests. I suggest that he visits the local SaBRE director in south London or in the London region who might be able to explain SaBRE&#039;s advocacy role better.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para84">I said that I would deal with the numbers for which the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) asked. I must begin by rejecting the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South that large numbers of reservists have had to apply to the reinstatement committee to get their jobs back. That is simply not true.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para85">More than 10,900 reservists have been mobilised to support Operation Telic. Since February 2003, a total of only 24 applications have been made under the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act, eight of which have been referred to a reinstatement committee. The reservists won four of those cases and lost three, and one case is outstanding. Those are not huge figures in the context of almost 11,000 mobilised members of the reserve forces, but I accept that there is more work to do. I intend to talk later about some of the measures that we are introducing to deal with these issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para86">Questions were also asked about pensions. All members of the reserve forces have access to the pension scheme when they are on mobilised service&#151;I thought that that was well understood&#151;which includes the reserve forces pension scheme. Reservists may well have their own occupational scheme, so they are free to continue to contribute to that if they want to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para87">I cannot comment on the case cited, but let me make two brief points. Any reference to casual labour, which the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall mentioned, has a technical meaning in employment law. Those who have studied the matter will be able to explain that in greater detail than I can. Casual labour means intermittent employment, so it is certainly not meant to indicate unprofessional behaviour or a lack of respect for reservists. Appropriate pension provision is in place 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 304WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
for such service, which would include contracting into the state second pension scheme, should that be required.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para88">Iraq is not the only place where reservists have been deployed. They continue to support operations in Afghanistan, the Balkans, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The reserves have consistently provided between 10 and 18 per cent. of United Kingdom manpower in the former Yugoslavia since NATO operations commenced there in 1995. I had the pleasure of meeting a significant number of reserve forces during my visit last week to Kosovo and Bosnia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para89">All the deployments reflect the Government&#039;s policy on the use of reserves as outlined in the 1998 strategic defence review: having a more capable, usable, integrated and relevant reserve force to support their regular counterparts in operations overseas. That policy has implications for reservists and the Government beyond the bounds of military planning and operational commitments: it has a fundamental impact on our people. For reservists, it requires a mindset that views mobilised service as a likely consequence or at least a very real possibility of his service, rather than as a theoretical commitment relevant only in a dire emergency. The reserves community already recognises that and has continued to adapt to it over the past decade.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para90">The Government, too, recognise that we have a duty to support reservists at home and abroad and we must acknowledge the impact that operational deployments can have on those affected&#151;the individual, the family and those around them, their employer, of course, and the reserve forces as a whole. The effect on each of them must be managed in a way that is fair and which will preserve the reserves as a sustainable military resource in the long term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para91">Unsurprisingly, operations in Iraq have taught us some important lessons. The mass mobilisation prior to the war-fighting phase showed that the system could generate a large number of personnel in a short time, but highlighted the practical problems that arose. It was a military necessity that the action was taken but we would in future wish to give 28 days&#039; notice of mobilisation whenever possible. It will not be possible in every case, but the policy is a significant step forward in minimising the disruption associated with mobilisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para92">The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked about welfare medical support, which is important. When mobilised and deployed, reservists are treated in the same way as regular personnel. We continue to examine and refine the aftercare which reservists can access when they return. As with regulars, the mental stresses that can arise from deployments are more widely recognised and better understood. All personnel are briefed on post-traumatic stress reactions and sources of support are made known to them. A reservists welfare study has recently been concluded and several recommendations covering support to reserves at home and abroad are about to be implemented.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para93">I want to deal briefly with the case of Corporal David Corrigan, which was raised by the hon. Gentleman. I apologise for Corporal Corrigan&#039;s treatment, which fell far short of the usual standards that we expect. We accept that owing to initially incorrect advice, Corporal Corrigan did not receive his entitlements and we are 
<br>

<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 305WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
keeping in regular contact with him to put the matter right. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister was representing his constituent in the letter to the Secretary of State.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para94">The new armed forces compensation scheme comes into effect on 6 April. The House will be aware of some of its provisions from recent coverage, but for members of the reserve forces in particular, these new terms are much more favourable. They allow the value of a reservist&#039;s civilian earnings to be taken into account when determining payments. Therefore, a doctor who is injured while carrying out his military duties as a private soldier in the Territorial Army will not be compensated simply as a soldier but according to his civilian job, where his ability to continue that employment is affected.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para95">A number of reservists who are deployed in Iraq have suffered financially when their civilian earnings exceed their military pay. The system currently in place to make a financial award to a soldier is far from straightforward. It places an additional burden on what can already be a difficult time for soldiers and their families. The values of the awards have been fixed since the system was first introduced, and have gradually eroded over time. The system was outdated and needed an overhaul. I am glad to be able to announce that the new regulations will be laid before Parliament this afternoon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para96">The new awards are much more advantageous to the reservists, from a practical and a financial point of view. We have abolished the complex and invasive reservists hardship award, and the system of tiered payments according to rank. Instead, there will be a single award, applicable to all ranks from private to general, and capped at &#163;200,000. The system of awards to employers has also been reformed; it makes it simpler for them to claim, and it allows them to do so for the full additional cost of replacing a mobilised reservist, up to a cap of &#163;40,000. I hope that the House will join me in welcoming the introduction of these new arrangements, which significantly enhance the financial support on offer.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew18"><b> Mr. Edwards </b> : Does my hon. Friend acknowledge that recruitment to the reserve forces has been a problem, and does he feel that that the new pay, allowances and compensation will help to rectify it?
</p>




<p><a name="50323h03_spnew19"><b> Mr. Caplin </b> : I very much hope so. We consulted properly on them, and they will be the subject of annual review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para97">Our proposals demonstrate the Government&#039;s commitment to supporting the reserve forces, and back up the words about minimising concerns that arise over mobilisation with actions. However, no amount of support&#151;practical, financial, or in any other form&#151;can eradicate the disruption that mobilisation causes to our reservists&#039; personal lives. They continue to volunteer for service in such circumstances; that is at the heart of the volunteering ethos that sustains the reserve forces. I recognise the sacrifices that our reservists make, and we must not take them for granted. Mobilisation at the maximum frequency allowed by the Reserve Forces Act 1996 is not a sustainable demand.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 306WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para98">That is why we recently published the &quot;Future Use of the UK&#039;s Reserve Forces&quot;, which introduced a provision to mobilise people for not more than one year in five, unless there is no viable alternative, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South mentioned. I hope that Members have the chance to read that document. It summarises the effect on our people of our policy on the use of reserve forces. It also demonstrates the steps we have taken as a result of recent deployments, including in Iraq, to refine and improve our arrangements to support them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para99">The structure of the reserve forces must also be designed to support the demands of future operations. The principles of having usable, integrated and relevant reserve forces were developed in the 2003 White Paper, as the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk acknowledged. It stated that we will continue to use the reserves, not only for large-scale operations, but to reinforce some specialist capabilities, such as medical and logistic support to smaller-scale deployments. That will require ever-closer integration between the regular and reserve elements of the services. Generating genuine readiness, and being properly prepared in the right time scale, are the keys to this integration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para100">Most reservist units are held at low states of readiness at present. To better meet the demands of future operations, some sub-units and individuals now remain at higher states of readiness than parts of the regular forces. That applies in particular to certain logistic, medical and other specialists, reflecting the need for them to be able to respond rapidly, as their services will be among those most likely to be required.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para101">Such has been the contribution of reservists to operations that we intend to integrate them even further into force structures. For example, while the TA will remain broadly the same size as it is today, there will be some adjustments to their capabilities to meet new requirements and to best support the regular Army on operations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para102">The final structure will be validated, in close consultation with the reserves community, over the coming months. However, rebalancing or restructuring should not be taken as an indication that reservists will be mobilised more frequently. Although we plan to continue to use reservists to support operations, we do not expect routinely to mobilise the high numbers of the start of Operation Telic in 2003; that was an exceptional situation. The frequency of mobilisation is also limited by law in the Reserve Forces Act, as well as by the one year in five policy, which I have outlined this afternoon. The outcome of restructuring is simply that the reserve forces are better structured to support their regular counterparts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h03_para103">I want to conclude by making two points. It would be remiss of me not to thank the hon. Members for Mid-Norfolk and for South-East Cornwall for their kind words on my personal future. More importantly, I restate my praise for the job that our reservist soldiers, sailors and airmen are doing in Iraq; conditions may be tough, but they are more than equal to the task. I know that the whole House will join me in offering them our thanks for the manner in which they are doing their job in the service of our country.

<a name="50323h04_time0"><h5>3.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50323h04_spnew0"><b> Dr. John Pugh  (Southport)</b>  (LD): I originally intended this to be a rather more far-ranging debate and hoped to secure a one-and-a-half hour slot, but as I have only half an hour, the Minister will forgive me if I concentrate more narrowly on the concerns that affect my constituency, while still sticking entirely to the topic as advertised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para0">The Government have a vision for housing in this country that is laudable in many respects. It centres on the concept of sustainable communities, to which we all hope to belong. Part of that vision is to avoid unnecessary encroachment on to green belt and greenfield sites, which would take away from sustainable communities the countryside that surrounds them. An equally laudable objective is to revive cities&#151;to encourage people to live in cities as well as to shop in them and visit them for recreation. City centres are, as a result of a number of Government initiatives, being gradually repopulated, and I support that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para1">The Government wish to reduce the distances that people have to travel to work, which is surely a sound environmental objective. They share with everybody in this country a laudable concern about the lack of affordable housing and they want to do something about it. They also have it in mind to tackle the scandal of empty homes that could be filled, and the correlative problem of unwanted homes in communities in which there is no demand for them. They are homes in communities where employment has gone and the community is in a state of relative decline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para2">During my time in Parliament, I have investigated those topics. I served on the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which considered the problem of empty homes in detail. We went to Bootle, Burnley and east Manchester, and I found the whole experience informative and thought-provoking. We studied and assessed what regeneration schemes based on housing actually achieved. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Bennett), who is likely to retire in the next few weeks, on his work in ensuring that those topics are firmly planted on the political agenda of all politicians.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para3">I have had a long-term personal commitment to regeneration, even outside the confines of my constituency. I served on Sefton council, where my votes and those of my party were crucial in ensuring that Bootle received city challenge status. At the time, the Labour representatives had reservations about that, because they viewed it as top-slicing money from other local authority budgets. I supported city challenge and neighbourhood renewal schemes in my constituency and elsewhere, and I have seen genuine success emerge from them&#151;perhaps not as much success as was envisaged when they started but, by and large, they were worthy schemes that achieved genuine, real benefits that permeated into people&#039;s everyday lives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para4">I am delighted to see money spent on deprived areas, but have always been slightly anxious about the fact that when money is too tightly focused, as could have been the case with city challenge until some latitude was shown, it is not best spent and is pumped into one patch of land. Then, the aim can become to use up funds, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 308WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
rather than to use them most efficiently to secure the best benefits for the area. In common with most people who have studied regeneration, I accept the need for targeting and ensuring that the jam is not spread too thinly, but if there is insufficient flexibility, targeting can become a weakness in a scheme&#151;leading to a situation in which the funds are present within a targeted area, but the projects are not.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para5">There is a theory that housing development can lead to regeneration. I do not depart from that theory because, in part, I agree with it, but it can be pushed too far. The most extreme example was the Hatton Garden area in Liverpool, where there was a presumption that if lots of council housing were built, the area would be regenerated. That missed the fact that the net effect would be to produce high rates of council tax, which acted as an economic disincentive for businesses to come to that area, with the result that one might have housing in the area, but not employment. That theory must be examined and, in some ways, contested.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para6">There is also a theory that the prime housing problem in the north is one of managing decline&#151;that housing stock is the same throughout the north and that in most areas of the north all we really need to do is to lose a few houses so that the number of houses matches the number of people. It is similar to the concept that the north-west consists of Burnley writ large. However, that is not the situation in large parts of the north-west, and certainly not in large parts of Merseyside.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para7">In my constituency, we have had something of a mini-economic boom. Unemployment is at its lowest for some time, having fallen rapidly since 2001&#151;it is a happy coincidence that I was elected then. Many of the jobs in my town are in the care and leisure sectors and are relatively low waged. However, there is pressure on housing, which leads to high prices. As unemployment has fallen sharply, house prices have risen sharply. There is a genuine shortage of affordable housing, but that has been masked in some ways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para8">Those who read <i>The Times</i> assiduously for housing articles might have seen one weeks ago about an organisation called Green Pastures, which does a lot of work for the homeless in Southport. It buys fairly elderly detached and semi-detached properties of a substantial size and converts them into flats, mainly paying for the cost of purchase via housing benefit. The scheme has made Green Pastures a substantial landlord; I pay tribute to its work in bridging the gap between people needing houses and getting them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para9">However, the current situation leads me to review and reflect on the Government&#039;s overall strategy&#151;not so much its goals, but its implementation. Planning policy guidance note 13, as it affects us, is a two-edged sword. As in many places outside the pathfinder areas, it is interpreted locally as a housing limit&#151;a limit on the number of new houses that can be built. In one sense, I am not unhappy with that because it prevents the demolition of lots of lovely old Victorian houses in Southport and their replacement by sometimes, but not always, elegant retirement homes, sold at an appreciable cost. To be sustainable communities, towns need balanced populations. If the houses in Southport attract only elderly people, there will be a problem in future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para10">The way in which the housing market moves does not necessarily reflect what the community requires. I recognise that there is a need for flat accommodation

because of the number of marriage break-ups and single people looking for homes, but, crucially, that limits the number of new builds for family homes. There are exceptions to the rules, however, as the Minister&#039;s civil servants will readily anticipate. Even in Southport there are brownfield sites, but not large ones: they tend to date back to the era in which people would start businesses in their back gardens and then extend a little beyond them and start garages or printing businesses or whatever. Brownfield sites can be released, but site assembly is expensive for building interests.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para11">We really need an influx of affordable housing; we need a mix and we need flexibility. That is what the house builders say and what common sense tells us, but we have PPG13 to deal with. The problem is not that we cannot build affordable housing on new land, but that in order to build sustainable estates with a variety of houses, we need the latitude to build a mix of affordable and other kinds housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para12">The other solution open to my constituents is to go into the pathfinder areas. I am sure that there is an inherent logic that makes people investigate that possibility. It is meant to be there; I understand that. However, the arguments against it are actually quite strong in Southport within Merseyside. First, it is environmental nonsense to make people travel any further to work than they need to. Secondly, the expense of a lengthy journey time is often unaffordable for people on low wages. Thirdly, in the pathfinder areas, we are finding prices increasing appreciably: I am told by reliable people that some houses in the pathfinder areas are being bought as investments by firms, building societies and so on because they can see a real prospect of their increasing in value. That is not the objective of the pathfinder initiative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para13">Across Merseyside in general&#151;this point is well encapsulated in the recent Heartlands debate&#151;mass demolition further reduces the housing stock in many areas and means that those houses that are available rapidly become more expensive. To put it in a personal context, a gentleman who worked for the council came to me the other day with his wife and child. They were unable to find a house in Southport that they could afford. They were asked to go to the pathfinder areas and look at property lower down in Sefton, towards Liverpool. They explained that would mean the man giving up his job. The housing department said, &quot;Well, that&#039;s really what you ought to do.&quot; When somebody who has a job has to move and render themselves unemployed to get a house, we have to investigate whether general regeneration is taking place or people are being shuffled along without achieving any positive economic or personal effect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para14">It is not true that jobs follow housing. Normally, housing follows jobs. There are problems with that, but there are equal problems with the expectation that jobs will follow housing. Most people come to the obvious conclusion that what is required is that we strike a sensible balance. I query whether we are likely to achieve that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para15">In my constituency the Southport partnership, which has done a great deal of good regeneration work, believes that the most significant break for the economic expansion that has taken place in the town in the past

few years is the availability of housing. I have been convinced not only by the partnership, but by speaking at great length with the Housing Corporation, which is entirely sold on the idea that there is a problem. At some point, the Housing Corporation wishes to present further details of its analysis to the Minister and her civil servants. The issue has been brought up when we have discussed the regional housing strategy and it has been reflected in many other boroughs across Merseyside. In addition, it has been accepted by the Government office for the north-west. I am not saying that we have got to the stage where, a little like the emperor&#039;s new clothes, the housing strategy for Merseyside is not what we would take it to be, or that it is not achieving the objectives. I am sure that the Minister can cite statistics that prove all sorts of genuine and real benefits from it. However, I do not think that we will maximise the benefits unless we have a greater degree of local flexibility.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para16">That is not the view of an isolated, oddball MP for an atypical constituency. I am sure that the hon. Member for City of Chester (Ms Russell) could make an identical speech, although she would refer to Chester rather than to Southport. If one were to speak to the leader of Liverpool city council, as I have done recently, and to analyse the problem as I have presented it, I do not think that he would have any difficulty in recognising the problem and acknowledging that to solve it a degree of flexibility is required in the Government strategy. The Government should not simply have a global strategy for the United Kingdom but should implement it properly in particular areas, and not in a doctrinaire way. One of the Government&#039;s favourite clich&#233;s at the moment is &quot;one size fits all&quot;, and Ministers have used that expression time and again as they have sought to introduce novelty and diversity into areas of public service. Sometimes, they put things the other way round, saying that we do not live in an age when one size fits all. If I had a fiver for every time a Minister has used that expression, I would be a very rich man indeed; it is a clich&#233; of the times.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para17">What I am saying, however, is that one size does not fit all in terms of housing need in the north-west; it is certainly not fitting very well in Southport. Given the Heartlands controversy, it is probably not fitting very well across Merseyside either. I therefore ask the Minister to think about my comments, to acknowledge that I am coming at the issue not with a set of anecdotes behind me, but with the support of the regional Housing Corporation and a good number of councils, and to respond.

<p><a name="50323h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Yvette Cooper) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) on securing this Adjournment debate and on raising some important themes relating to housing and, in particular, the relationship between the housing market and the local economy in Merseyside.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para18">Local authorities and regional housing and planning bodies have to address a set of challenges. They have to respond to housing need&#151;one of our most basic human needs is to have a home&#151;but they must do so in a way that supports communities, not dormitories, and that recognises the relationship between the local economy and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 311WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the local housing market. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that housing and the local economy are closely linked, but often in complex ways. Housing has a big impact on the local economy. Businesses will not invest in places where the work force do not want to live. Equally, a tight housing market can make it difficult for people to move to where the jobs are, which can cause recruitment problems for businesses. Low housing demand can also have a big impact on an area&#039;s wider economic performance. We need to address housing and economic strategies together. That is why we have investment in the growth areas in the south-east. That means that we can invest in the housing that is needed to respond to economic growth. It is also why we have the housing market renewal programmes&#151;the pathfinders&#151;to work in areas of low demand in various places around the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para19">I agree that it is wrong to suggest that the north is simply a region of low demand while the south, particularly the south-east, are regions of high demand. That is simply not the case and such an approach is far too simplistic. In many areas in the north, such as Yorkshire, as well as in the north-west and the north-east, house prices have increased considerably and there are areas of high housing demand. Equally, some areas, including parts of Merseyside, have been plagued by serious problems of low demand. That is why we have the housing market renewal pathfinder based there. The hon. Gentleman is right that we need to strike the right balance in our approach to the local economy and housing development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para20">The hon. Gentleman asked whether the pathfinder was about managing decline, but that does not need to be the approach. In fact, the approach of the pathfinders should be about ensuring that we have the right mix and the right choice of housing for local people and about responding to a changed economy. The pathfinder areas are often those in which housing developed in response to particular social and economic circumstances&#151;certain kinds of housing were required, often reflecting particular industrial patterns of development and particular lifestyles. Those forms of housing are now out of date because people want different things with a different mix of housing in the area. Pathfinders can help to stem the flight from the cities and support regeneration. At the same time, they can reduce pressure on housing hot spots. That was certainly the approach taken by the Merseyside pathfinder, and it has been used to deal with pressure on housing hot spots such as Southport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para21">Sefton borough council is revising its housing strategy with the help of the Government office for the north-west. We believe that local authorities need to take a strategic approach to their housing priorities. The production of a housing strategy is an important part of developing a wider approach to the local economy and housing needs, but it needs to involve other stakeholders through consultation and partnership. It will allow local areas to provide a proper framework for making sensible decisions. The regional housing board is reviewing its strategy and has already asked for views through an issues paper published earlier this year. A new draft strategy will be issued for public consultation very shortly, which will provide an opportunity to address many of the specific issues raised by the hon. Gentleman about his constituency and Sefton.

<br>

</p>




<p><a name="50323h04_spnew1"><b> Dr. Pugh </b> : I attended one of the consultation sessions&#151;I was probably the only Member of Parliament present. A number of groups were arranged to discuss various topics. Strangely, when people came to decide what topics they wanted to discuss, the largest grouping&#151;two large groups&#151;wanted to discuss affordable housing. They wanted to discuss that rather more than the classic objectives that pathfinder projects initially set themselves.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h04_spnew2"><b> Yvette Cooper </b> : The hon. Gentleman is right. Although he would not expect me to anticipate the contents of the housing board&#039;s new strategy or the Government&#039;s response, I agree that one issue that has emerged from the consultation process is widespread concern about the extent of the shortage of affordable housing in some parts of the region. The problem is not confined to rural areas; it appears to be affecting urban areas such as parts of Sefton. The board and the Government will clearly need to take that into account when developing the new strategy and making investment decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para22">The hon. Gentleman will know that in the period 2004 to 2006, Sefton&#039;s allocation from the regional housing pot was &#163;26.2 million. Yesterday, we announced the allocations to be made to the regional housing boards and said that over the following two years &#163;500 million would be available to the north-west for affordable housing. We have substantially increased investment in affordable housing since 1997 because we recognise its importance to the housing market across the country. The individual allocations will need to be discussed within the region. The timetable suggests that they will be set out during the autumn of this year, but further discussion will clearly be needed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para23">At the same time, the North West regional assembly has started work on reviewing the spatial strategy with a view to submitting a new draft to Ministers in September. Again, although it is too early to say what will be in the draft spatial strategy, it will give us a key opportunity to address many of the questions on the future of the housing market in the region. It will also allow us to look much more closely at sub-regional housing markets, in recognition of the fact that different areas may face very different problems. Those problems need to be addressed not only through the housing board allocations but through the regional planning process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para24">As part of the preparation for the spatial strategy, the regional housing strategy and the consultation discussions to which the hon. Gentleman referred, reference has been made to the relationship between the housing affordability problem and the extent or appropriateness of different restrictions on overall provision. Such matters are complex because the over-supply of housing in some parts of the region, where building has outpaced increasing demand, has led to areas of serious low demand. It has not been a managed process. Many areas of low demand are being dealt with through pathfinders, but require substantial investment to turn the communities around. At the moment, they often contain street after street of boarded-up homes. That is partly because the housing market has not responded to different demands for choice and overall pressures on demand and supply in the area. If a new housing estate is built offering people alternative

<br>&nbsp;<br>
housing, and nothing is done to improve the existing stock, people might move from one area to another, which can have a detrimental impact on members of the community who are left behind.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para25">Such issues need to be considered extensively as part of the work on the regional housing strategy and the regional spatial strategy. The Government have issued new guidance for public consultation entitled &quot;Planning for Mixed Communities&quot; to replace the relevant parts of the national advice in PPG3. Responses to the guidance note are invited until 15 April. We believe that a sustainable community needs a mix of decent housing of different types and tenures to support a range of households of different sizes, ages and incomes. That must include the provision of affordable housing to meet local needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para26">The draft advice suggests that when drawing up development plans local planning authorities set out what affordable housing is in the context of local income levels, house prices and rents; the proportion of affordable housing that will be provided throughout the plan area; the proportion of affordable housing that will be sought on residential sites above a certain size, and the size and type of affordable housing that would be required. The fact that we are considering issuing revised advice on the issue shows how seriously we take it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h04_para27">We must always bear in mind the fact that markets change over time and so do local housing markets. Such change is often a response to local economic, social and community changes, but the triggers for a change in a local housing market can often be unexpected. For example, an estate that has problems with crime can be caught up in a vicious cycle when people want to move away because the problems in the environment were not tackled quickly enough, or improvements in a local school can attract people to the area and increase demand in its housing market.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h04_spnew3"><b> Dr. Pugh </b> : I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to intervene because she enables me to put on record my thanks for her constructive and helpful response. No one wants the Government to change their overall objective. All we want is the strategy to be reviewed in the light of evidence presented. Given what the hon. Lady has said, I do not think that the Government will object to that.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h04_spnew4"><b> Yvette Cooper </b> : The hon. Gentleman is right to say that such matters need to be taken into account. As he said, we have set out our clear objectives. The opportunity for him to discuss local issues further will be provided by the regional housing strategy draft, which will be put out for consultation very shortly. The consultation period will be relatively limited, so I urge the hon. Gentleman and his constituents to make representations to the Government office for the north-west as rapidly as possible. All factors need to be taken into account. It would not be appropriate for me to respond definitively about the way in which the balance needs to be struck in his area, because that is the role of the regional housing strategy and the local Sefton housing strategy. There is certainly plenty of opportunity for further debate.

<a name="50323h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Future Energy Markets</h3>

<a name="50323h05_time0"><h5>4 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50323h05_spnew0"><b> Alan Simpson  (Nottingham, South)</b>  (Lab): I am extremely grateful to you for choosing this subject for debate this afternoon, Mr. Deputy Speaker, particularly as it follows the Chancellor&#039;s announcements in his Budget speech about the intention to hold an energy services summit in the coming year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para0">I begin by declaring a couple of interests. Future energy markets have interested&#151;perhaps obsessed&#151;me since I entered Parliament in 1992. I have been chairman of the all-party group on warm homes for most of the time since then and I have had a continuing involvement in trying to determine how we address fuel poverty. Lately, I have had a personal interest in the subject in that I have taken it upon myself to try to turn a derelict shell in the middle of Nottingham into a property that I will live in and which, I hope, will generate 50 per cent. more energy than it consumes. I should add the caveat: I will tell the House whether it does that once I have completed the project.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para1">What fascinates me in broader structural terms is our extraordinarily impressive Government targets. Under the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, we are committed to eradicating fuel poverty entirely in the United Kingdom by 2016. Under the Kyoto protocol, we are committed to reducing our carbon dioxide emissions by 12.5 per cent. from 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012. The Government&#039;s own targets also commit them to supplying 15 per cent. of domestic energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2015.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para2">Those are admirable targets. The difficulty is that, according to current trends, we are unlikely to meet any of them. Last year&#039;s figures, which we have just seen, show that carbon emissions increased by 2.2 per cent. We know from answers given by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that only 16 per cent. of the current UK housing stock has a SAP&#151;standard assessment procedure&#151;rating of 60 or more. That percentage must comprise new housing stock that has been built to new housing standards, but the overwhelming majority of existing housing stock is fuel inefficient, if not fuel poor. We must work out how to address that problem against the challenges of climate change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para3">Last year, I spent quite a lot of time visiting energy suppliers and asking them their views on their responsibilities towards renewables and reducing carbon emissions under the Government energy efficiency contribution. The most difficult thing for me to deal with was that I could not find a single energy supplier with a business plan based on selling less consumption. We know that we must reduce our energy consumption nationally and globally by making the connection between energy consumption and carbon emissions. Yet there is no company in the land with a plan for doing that. The explanation given by the suppliers is simple: they tell me that they cannot make money out of selling less. If the Government want them to do that, we will have to change the nature of the market so that they can create markets that will supply energy services rather than energy consumption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para4">I drafted a private Member&#039;s Bill as a presentation Bill that sets out some of the ways in which we could do that, but I want to explore with the Minister today the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 315WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
precise way in which we could reconfigure our thinking on energy markets to engage with the really big challenges that the 21st century will present to us. It is worth turning the clock back and considering the perspective of Thomas Edison when he invented the light bulb. His intention was not to sell electricity, but to sell light. We need to take that concept on board and to create energy markets for the future that sell, not energy consumption, but home warmth. If companies can make money out of households consuming less, they will be encouraged to invest in long-term products that make our houses more energy efficient and, in all probability, energy generating.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para5">At the moment, we do not have such rules. I have spoken to Ofgem about its relaxation of the energy market rules. That has been helpful in principle: the relaxation regarding the sort of contracts that can be offered to customers has meant that companies can consider engaging in longer-term contracts and avoid the one-month trap that enables a customer who does not like his supplier to chop and change. That aspect of the market that we created initially meant that companies were willing to do a lot about the delivery of low-energy light bulbs, for example, or to invest in and make available at low prices things such as draughtproofing and loft insulation. Some of them went further, and were willing to go into broader conservation measures that reduced heat loss, particularly if those measures were targeted at the fuel poor.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para6">I congratulate the companies that have done those things. However, we are still scratching the surface of the problem. When I try to raise the issue with companies, they tell me that, in principle, they are not reluctant to go down that path, but they find either that there is little interest or that they have no lever if they try to offer such a service to the public. More particularly, they say that it is not the role of electricity suppliers to act as the Government. If we want to change the nature of the market, we should take a lead. The companies are right to ask us do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para7">The examples that are always quoted are properties that are in multiple occupancy, which figure disproportionately among the most fuel-poor properties in the UK. When energy suppliers have offered the owners of those properties different energy systems or more thermally efficient energy packages, the owners have, by and large, told them to get lost, assuming that their only interest is to sell products. The owners&#039; interest is in running the properties as a rental business for an income, so why on earth should they be interested in a package that will cost them money? I understand the dilemma in which that leaves the energy companies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para8">At one level, we have to give a lead that probably involves raising the thresholds that we set for the energy efficiency of all rented properties. I cannot see a coherent case for constructing or supporting housing markets that are based on access to properties that are of extremely poor quality in terms of their thermal efficiency. That would run completely counter to the Government&#039;s target of eradicating fuel poverty in the UK&#039;s housing stock. If we changed the thresholds and set a different SAP rating of 60 or 70, that would be a start. Then, those who sought to sell or let properties would know that they had to meet the new thermal thresholds that provide decent housing conditions for every household in the UK.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 316WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para9">Next, we should ask how to reduce the carbon consumption of our existing housing stock. If we are looking for an example of how best to do that, we would be hard pressed to find one much better than Woking. I never thought that a revolution would begin in Woking, but it has set out a model for the UK that the rest of us should stand in awe of and applaud. In the past 13 years, Woking has reduced its carbon emissions by 77 per cent. It has plans to come off the national grid: there will be a local generating system using renewable sources and micro-combined heat and power. Energy-generating lamp posts have already installed: the lighting comes from beautifully designed solar lamp posts with wind-generating capacity. No one objects because the design of the generating system is stylish and inconspicuous and as a network it is phenomenally successful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para10">We are going to have to rethink our expectations about the ability of every building in the United Kingdom to generate a proportion of its own energy consumption. We will have to consider this as part of the design requirements of new buildings. We will have to follow the Japanese example: if we want a market for photovoltaic roofs, the best thing is for the Government to give a lead and make a commitment that there will be 1 million installed in the UK, as there are to be 1 million installed in Japan. We need to take the same sort of lead as the German Government, who have created a market in which they are the purchaser of renewable and sustainable energy systems. That has given Germany its current lead over us in the global market for renewable and sustainable energy systems: the UK has about 4 per cent. of that market, whereas Germany has 15 per cent. Germany has that lead because its Government have created a market in which German technology suppliers have been able to test, pilot, install and go into production on a significant scale. In doing so, they have reduced unit costs, thus making the technology viable on the open market, whereas we in the UK are still stuck at the level of looking for research rather than creating new markets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para11">One of the saddest things for me was that in 2000 the Prime Minister made a commitment to set aside &#163;5 million to pilot sustainable energy systems targeted at the fuel poor. The money was set aside in a Department of Trade and Industry budget, but not a penny has been spent. The Government have not taken the lead in delivering those pilots, which the nation desperately needs. We have relied on the Wokings of the country and places such as Leicester, which have taken the decision to go out and look for their own renewable and sustainable energy systems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para12">I should like the Minister to address a number of issues, not necessarily in his reply to this debate, but perhaps by committing to taking them forward in the energy services summit&#039;s discussions. As a country, we will have to work out how we respond to the EU directive on energy services. It would be helpful to have some guidance on how the Government see themselves doing that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para13">We need to consider changing some of the rules governing energy services. One of the major obstacles is that someone who installs a self-generating system in their own home and has a two-way metering system that supports the re-absorption of any excess energy capacity generated&#151;so that it can be fed back into the system as clean, carbon-free energy&#151;receives only a fraction of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>23 Mar 2005 : Column 317WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the energy supply price as a buy-back price. The reason for this is that current market rules have large charges added on to the buy-back price for access to the supply and distribution system. In reality, those are nonsense charges because most of that energy does not need to go back into the national grid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para14">The experience in Woking led to the conclusion that their CHP systems were 90 per cent. efficient in generating energy because the transmission was local transmission. The same energy, if fed into the national grid, has an efficiency of about 20 per cent. The energy is spun round, the charges for access and use of the system are all added on and the cost to society amounts to something like five times the buy-back price. We therefore need to change those rules to narrow the buy-back price so that it reflects what it would constitute as energy gain in a local energy system. If suppliers were able to buy back from themselves at a more competitive rate than at present, the whole set of commercial interests would change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para15">So far, the only company that I have been able to find that is interested in a self-generation or local generation system has been Powergen. I pay tribute to Powergen, because it is willing to pioneer that system. However, all the energy suppliers must become part of the same game. We need to recognise that there is no coherent case for a national extension of the gas network to more remote communities: that would be colossal in its capital cost and questionable in its energy security, given our reliance on future gas supplies from outside the UK. However, if we were able to examine the possibility of microgeneration systems at a community level and to remove the existing ceiling on energy supply for domestic purposes, the market would change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para16">My final point relates also to local suppliers. There is a bizarre rule that states that companies that can acquire an exempt licence for energy generation can generate 50 MW of energy, but are only allowed to supply 1 MW of that for domestic purposes&#151;that amounts to energy supply for about 1,000 households. If we removed that ceiling, the prospect of introducing sustainable energy systems for whole communities, in urban as well as remote areas, would be transformed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para17">I believe that this issue is the most important part of the energy agenda for the 21st century. We all know that oil will run out, that there will be problems in gas transmission supplies and that coal cannot be compatible in the long term with the climate change challenge that we face from Kyoto. We have to offer ourselves a different view of sustainable energy markets. If we do so, it will also be the greatest gift that we can offer to emerging nations, which have their own energy needs but which must be freed from the burden of meeting those needs by taking the same polluting path that we did in the past century. I hope that the Minister will accept and meet that challenge, not only domestically, but as a gift to a century that will need sustainable energy supplies.

<p><a name="50323h05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Energy and E-Commerce  (Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien) </b> : I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) on

securing this debate on the importance of promoting energy conservation, which is a key issue. The UK faces not only the global threat of climate change, which every nation has to deal with, but the fact that we will become a net energy importer as from next year. Indeed, at least statistically we became a net importer of gas from December 2004. Although the position will vary from month to month, certainly by 2006 we are likely to be a net importer of oil, too.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para18">There are considerable implications for this country. It means that we must look to the security of our energy supplies for the future. We must consider the need to reduce our consumption of energy. We certainly do not want to waste energy, because much of it will be imported. That puts a premium not only on dealing with climate change by addressing energy efficiency&#151;that is why the Government published the energy efficiency strategy last year&#151;but on ensuring that we develop new technologies and new means of producing energy that do not damage the climate. We need to ensure that, as we move towards 2050, we are developing a low-carbon economy that is prosperous. We need to ensure that our manufacturing has enough energy, that our homes are lit and have enough energy and that we are not damaging our climate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para19">Security of supply, which is coupled with the need to prevent damage to the environment, will come about through diversity of energy sources. We have a range of energy sources. At the moment, fossil fuels are a component of that range. We will need to consider other ways to develop the range of fossil fuels without damage to the environment. That puts a premium on the issue of sequestration. Research is being done on that, and we are looking into a range of other areas, but as my hon. Friend said, renewables will also be a key component. We are not talking only about great wind turbines, whether offshore or onshore, but about microgeneration issues. He is right to talk about some of the innovative work that has been taking place on microgeneration and CHP. He drew attention to the innovative and laudable Woking initiative. The Government have been watching that with a great deal of care and are very engaged and interested in it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para20">We need to consider ways in which the generation of electricity can be more local and low-carbon. For that reason, as from this June, we shall set out a new consultation on how we develop a microgeneration strategy to move towards the sort of vision that my hon. Friend outlined. From my point of view, there is no reason why, certainly within our lifetimes and probably within about 20 years, most homes should not generate most of their energy themselves, whether through solar photovoltaic panels on the roof, perhaps coupled with a small wind turbine, or through something similar. There is every reason to believe that we can move towards energy being generated so locally that we are generating our own energy in our own homes. Whether we reach a stage at which no one has to pay an electricity bill, I cannot say, but it is not impossible that we will do so, and what we are talking about is not that far away&#151;it will certainly happen well within our lifetimes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para21">We are now seeing the growth of new microgeneration industries, which we want to continue to encourage. Together with the microgeneration strategy, which we are developing, we shall also launch in June a new strategy to consider low-carbon homes.

All the issues are linked. The question is how we develop the right planning regulations so that we can create new homes and new developments while ensuring that the expansion in housing in the coming decades does not damage the environment. We need to ensure that homes are more energy-efficient than they were in the past and that we encourage the development of better fuel sources. We must also recognise that the issue is not only about new housing. As my hon. Friend said, many of today&#039;s homes are fuel-inefficient. They do not have enough insulation or other ways to safeguard the energy and heating that they use. That is why the Government have placed burdens on a number of energy companies&#151;we do not dispute that&#151;to provide insulation and energy health checks for homes, as many companies are now doing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para22">In recent weeks, I have met chief executives and chairmen of energy companies to talk about how to address the key problem of fuel poverty, and how that can feed into the points that my hon. Friend raised about energy efficiency. We have reduced the number of people in fuel poverty&#151;defined as those spending more than 10 per cent. of their income on fuel&#151;from more than 5 million to 2.25 million, if I remember the figures correctly off the top of my head. That is a massive achievement for the Government. However, electricity and gas prices have risen over the past year. That is partly because of changes on the UK continental shelf and the fact that our oil and gas supplies are starting to deplete&#151;it will take 30 years, but we will become a net energy importer. We are importing more and are therefore dependent on broader energy markets. Our energy prices are rising, and that will probably bring about 200,000 people into fuel poverty in England alone over the next two years if we do nothing about it. The meetings with the energy companies were intended to try to do something about it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para23">The methods identified by my hon. Friend&#151;ensuring that our homes are better insulated and that we reduce the amount of wasted energy&#151;are precisely the ways to deal with fuel poverty. The fuel-poor can often switch suppliers or receive benefits to reduce their bills, but we must also address energy companies&#039; beliefs that their future will be secured just by selling more energy. In the

long term, they and we know that that will not be how they continue to make profits. We want them to make profits well into the future and still be around in 50 years&#039; time, but we must change our approach to energy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para24">We must move away from the idea that all our energy will be generated in large power stations that are located in one or two parts of the country and pass energy along transmission lines. We will move towards more localised energy and more microgeneration, but we will also need large energy plants, and they must be less polluting and give out fewer carbon emissions. Energy companies must be able to operate in a market in which they can make money generating electricity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50323h05_para25">There will always be a demand for more energy; even with an increase in energy efficiency there will be more demand because, I hope, we will become more prosperous. The problems are how to ensure that that energy is provided by renewables in a way that does not damage our environment, and how to ensure that companies can make profits by creating more energy-efficient homes. Initiatives such as the emissions trading scheme are important because they make companies consider ways to reduce emissions.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h05_spnew1"><b> Alan Simpson </b> : Will the Minister also consider granting renewables obligation certificates for microgeneration? That is how we will start to alter the market rules that favour precisely the developments that he is talking about.
</p>




<p><a name="50323h05_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien </b> : At exactly the same time as conducting our review of microgeneration and solar PV, we are considering how the renewables obligation operates and the issue of ROCs. We have a tremendous opportunity over the coming year to consider our whole energy strategy, ensure that we look after the interests not only of the consumer but of the environment, and produce an energy system that works for the whole country. My hon. Friend asked whether ROCs would be considered. The answer is yes, but we must be careful, because some ROCs are too big for microgeneration&#151;we may need roc-ettes.
