<p><a name="stpa_0">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;[Mr. Watson.]

</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60322h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mike Weir  </b> (in the Chair): Before we start, I should point out that there are three clocks in the room, each showing a different time. I intend to operate by the clock straight in front of me and behind me.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60322h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mark Harper  (Forest of Dean)</b>  (Con): It is a pleasure to open this debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Weir. I have never seen a happier Whip than the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson) when the Deputy Leader of the House arrived in the nick of time. It is good to see him in his place and to see my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) on the Opposition Front Bench.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">For any colleagues who do not know, it might be helpful to set out what the debate is not about&#151;or at least what I do not intend it to be about. It is not about ministerial accountability as it relates to the ministerial code. The debate is about Ministers being accountable to the House and by so doing making the House of Commons and Parliament more relevant to the general public and perhaps getting better coverage in the media. Before moving on to some suggestions on how to do that that I believe are worth at least considering, it will be helpful to set the scene and lay out the problem as I see it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">We are all aware that in the 2005 general election turnout was a little higher than in 2001, but it was still the second lowest since 1918. Turnout has decreased by more than 15 per cent. since 1992, which should worry all of us who believe in democracy and the importance of Parliament to our political process. The late Robin Cook is quoted in Lord Puttnam&#039;s report, &quot;Members Only? Parliament in the Public Eye&quot;, saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;The problem is not that the British people have no opinion on the issues of the day, but that more and more of them no longer feel ownership of their parliamentary democracy, or believe that its political culture can solve the problems of their lives&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">That is true. All of us talk to constituents, correspond with them and meet them at surgeries, so we all know that people are passionately interested in the issues. There is a range of subjects that energise our constituents, from local, domestic concerns, right up to the great, global issues of the day. Constituents are engaged in political debate; the problem seems to be that they are just not very interested in Parliament.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">The Power report contained some interesting statistics about political engagement. It found that, in a 12-month period, 62 per cent. of the population had donated money to a political or a campaigning organisation, 30 per cent. had helped to raise money for a political or a campaigning organisation, 42 per cent. had signed a petition, 25 per cent. had contacted a public 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 68WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
official and 13 per cent. had contacted a politician to change laws or policies. That evidence tells us that the citizenry are engaged and intervening in the political process, which makes it even more surprising that turnout in elections is falling. The easiest thing for people to do is to go along put a cross on the paper and put it in the ballot box or fill out a postal ballot paper.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">Campaigning organisations such Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the National Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds have seen their memberships grow in the same period as electoral turnout has declined. The Countryside Alliance demonstration, the demonstrations about the Iraq war and the Live 8 event were three of best attended political events in the UK&#039;s history, so why, at a time when people seem more politically active, although not in the traditional party political way, do we see less involvement in elections and traditional party activity? Is it a matter of the perception of Parliament and whether it is relevant to those questions, or is it to do with the conventional political approach to addressing the issues?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">One factor could be awareness of the important role that Parliament plays. The Power report&#039;s work demonstrates that that might be the case. The report states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;More media and especially television coverage is essential in order to make people more aware how central politics is to everyday life and the big questions.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">Its most important finding was that the view of the majority of people talked to was that basic understanding of our political system and the way in which Parliament worked was very low, leaving people unclear about how to get involved in politics and how to participate in our parliamentary process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">No matter what the public perception is of Parliament, it is&#151;or should be&#151;the place where decisions are made and Government scrutinised. The excellent report published in July 2000 by Lord Norton of Louth and his commission says that one of the core functions of Parliament is:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;To ensure that the measures and actions of government are subject to scrutiny on behalf of citizens and that the government answers to Parliament for its actions.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">With Ministers attending Parliament less frequently than I would like them to, it is difficult for Members to scrutinise them on a regular basis. This is, I hope, the only party political point that I shall make, but it needs to be pointed out that the Prime Minister&#039;s attendance at Parliament is even worse than other Ministers&#039;. The report of Lord Norton&#039;s commission states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;Evidence of prime ministers taking Parliament less seriously than before is to be found in the amount of time they spend in the House of Commons. Proximity is important and prime ministers are now relatively infrequent attenders.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">The report continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;The present incumbent, Tony Blair, has a particularly poor record of attendance. He is rarely in the House, even for the purpose of voting.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">We need say no more on that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60322h01_spmin0"><b>The Deputy Leader of the House of Commons  (Nigel Griffiths) </b> : I think that we do need to say more, because that is clearly a partisan and ill-informed comment by someone who is usually better informed. Does the hon. Member accept that the Prime Minister has made more statements 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 69WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to the House and on more issues than any recent Prime Minister, thus being very accountable in the House of Commons to all Members, including himself?
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60322h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Harper </b> : The Prime Minister certainly has made a number of statements, but he chooses when to make statements and he does so for his own reasons. I have in mind issues over which he has less control. It was noticeable that the very first thing that he did when he was elected to Government was to change the frequency of Prime Minister&#039;s questions from twice a week to once a week. Having Prime Minister&#039;s questions just once a week, albeit for 30 minutes, makes it much less likely that topical questions will be raised. If questions arise just after Wednesday, by the time we get round to the following Wednesday they have ceased to be topical, as they have been done to death by the 24-hour news media. The Prime Minister thus avoids having to be questioned on those topical issues at a time not of his choosing and in a manner that he does not control. That is not very helpful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60322h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner  (Isle of Wight)</b>  (Con): Was it not noticeable that the Deputy Leader of the House did not comment on the Prime Minister&#039;s frequency of attendance in the Division Lobbies, for example, where he is accessible to hon. Members, or at least to Labour Members and occasionally to Opposition Members?
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60322h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Harper </b> : That was noticeable. We know some good examples of critical votes for the Government for which the Prime Minister was not present. Lord Norton talked about proximity; one of the important things about voting in the Division Lobbies, particularly for Government Members, is that it is really the only opportunity that most Back Benchers get to buttonhole Ministers, especially the Prime Minister, and raise with them issues of the day and their constituents&#039; concerns in a free and frank way. There are few opportunities to do so during the rest of the week, because the Prime Minister of necessity has a busy schedule. We recognise that Prime Ministers have many calls on their time, but previous incumbents of that office, of both parties, made a bigger effort to attend the House and were more accessible to their Back Benchers&#151;sometimes more accessible than they would have wished. That is something that we need to look at again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">There is an increasing feeling that decisions are frequently made in private and announced, dripped out, or leaked to the media, and that Parliament has become increasingly sidelined. In his report, Lord Norton says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;The media revolution&quot;&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">The report continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;Ministers use the media for making policy announcements&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;exploitation of the media by ministers has been at the expense of Parliament.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">It points out that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;An interview on the BBC Today programme reaches a mass audience, is not subject to questioning for 30 or 40 minutes, and helps set the agenda for the day.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 70WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">Despite the best efforts of Front Benchers and the Speaker, on many occasions policy announcements and suggestions have found their way into the media before being announced to the House. For example, proposals that the Chancellor of the Exchequer may make in his Budget statement have been well-trailed in the media in the past few days. None of those should be in the media, and if the speculation turns out to be well informed, we will wonder how the information got there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">The Executive have grown too powerful at the expense of Parliament. There are a couple of quotes in the Power report that bear repeating. The first is from the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), who said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;Parliament has run away from its responsibilities in the sense that it should not allow its programme to be decided by the Executive.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">The second is a contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), who said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;My impression is that for at least two decades and possibly quite a lot longer, government control of parliament has been increasing . . . and ought to be diminished.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">It seems as though Parliament only ever features in the media when there is a contentious vote, such as the recent vote on the Education and Inspections Bill, or at Prime Minister&#039;s Questions. Those of us who regularly attend the House know that neither of those situations is particularly typical of the extensive work that goes on in the main Chamber, this Chamber or in the Committees of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">It is not the role of John Humphrys or Jeremy Paxman to hold Ministers to account. Although they can and do perform that task effectively, it is a task that belongs to the House of Commons and its Members. There is a vital role for the media in relaying and explaining to the public, but Parliament must have the first bite of the cherry. There are many ways in which that could be done. I am sure that all hon. Members who contribute to the debate will have their own ideas and I do not expect there to be a great deal of agreement with my humble suggestions, but I think that they are worth considering.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">When I looked at other Parliaments, I was struck by a possible solution. In Australia, to pick a country at random, the parliamentary system is relatively similar to ours. There, it has traditionally been expected that all Ministers who are members of the House of Representatives will be present at question time, which takes place every day that the House sits, unless they are ill, overseas or engaged on urgent public business. At one point, they introduced a rota system whereby Ministers had to attend only on certain occasions, but they dropped it after one session. Therefore, in Australia, all Ministers, including the Prime Minister, are available every day to attend and answer questions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">Compare and contrast the Australian system with ours, in which oral questions, which are the only opportunity that Members get to question Ministers on detailed departmental matters, take place only about once a month for each Department. I suggest that we should move toward the Australian system. I do not propose that we should go all the way&#151;Ministers and potential Ministers would probably be horrified at the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 71WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
idea of having to come to the House of Commons every day&#151;but I believe that there is a balance between our system and the Australian system that would enable us to increase ministerial accountability.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60322h01_spnew5"><b> Nigel Griffiths </b> : Like me, the hon. Member has looked at the Australian system very carefully. What debate did he find most enlightening in terms of the proposal that he makes?
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60322h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Harper </b> : I am sorry; I do not follow the Minister&#039;s question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60322h01_spnew7"><b> Nigel Griffiths </b> : What did the hon. Member observe in the Australian Parliament&#151;which specific debate or Question Time&#151;that best illuminated the issue? I must say that I found it difficult to find one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60322h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Harper </b> : The strength of the Australian system arises from the fact that the Prime Minister and senior Ministers have to attend every day and questions are put without notice. Other methods might be more suitable to the way in which our business is done, but in the Australian system, if there are questions of the day or topical issues, rather than hold them over to be dealt with when the appropriate Question Time arises, the Prime Minister can be questioned on them that day by members of the House of Representatives. In these times of a 24-hour news media, such questions are of no interest to the media when, through a parliamentary process such as ours, the formal opportunity to ask questions comes along. In the Australian system, rather than an issue being discussed purely by the broadcast media and in conversations in TV studios, with Ministers being questioned by journalists, the coverage of that issue in the broadcast media that reach people at home will be of the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives answering questions put by Members of that House. The advantage of that system lies in topicality&#151;Parliament is at the centre of the topical issues of the day.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">As I said, there may well be other, more appropriate ways to achieve a similar focus in this House, which take into consideration the way in which we traditionally do things. I simply put that example before Members to provoke discussion. Parliament and Ministers need to be more responsive to the events of the day, and Ministers need to be available to Members to respond to current events.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">Lord Norton&#039;s commission focused on that issue. Some of the recommendations that he made six years ago have been adopted by the Government, which is welcome to the extent that they have been adopted. The commission commented that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;there should be greater opportunity for short debates on issues of immediate importance.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">Obviously, this Chamber&#151;Westminster Hall&#151;provides such opportunities, but the commission thought that there was a need for that opportunity to be available in the main Chamber. It also recognised, as other hon. Members and I do, that there is provision
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;under Standing Order No. 24 for MPs to seek leave for an emergency debate&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 72WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">but that that seldom happens. The commission&#039;s recommendation, which is worthy of consideration, was that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;there should be provision for MPs to request short 60-minute debates, these debates to take place at the start of public business on the following day&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">and that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;responsibility for granting such debates should remain with the Speaker.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">That is not to say that that should become the default setting&#151;that we should have such debates every day, but neither should they be hugely infrequent and happen only once every few years. There is a balance in between. If the House were able to discuss topical issues on the Floor of the House at the start of public business&#151;the time of day when there is a chance of influencing and engaging with the media agenda&#151;that would put the House at the centre of public debate, rather than the debate taking place in the 24-hour news studio. That would enable us to set the agenda for the day, rather than follow behind and wait for the process of setting business for the House to allow debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">My final proposal involves the only mention that I will make of the ministerial code. As I said, an increasing number of policy initiatives seem to be leaked to the media in a stage-managed way. I am sure that the present Government are not the first Government to do that, but the practice has increased. That is damaging because it means that those policy announcements are questioned not by Members of the House, but in broadcasting studios in short interviews, which do not involve 40 minutes or an hour&#039;s worth of detailed scrutiny on issues that Members can raise on behalf of their constituents. The final Norton recommendation that I think worthy of note is the recommendation that the ministerial code should place
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;a requirement on ministers to make the most important announcements to Parliament&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">and making it part of the code to increase the importance of that, and the weight that Ministers should place on Parliament.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">If we wrap all those things together, it means considering making Question Time more topical and allowing Members to ask questions without notice of all Ministers; perhaps returning to a system with Prime Minister&#039;s questions twice a week for 15 minutes to increase their topicality and so that the Prime Minister would have to respond to issues in the House rather than in some other format; and increasing the frequency with which statements are made to the House. Such moves would increase the significance of Parliament and of Members of Parliament in the public eye, and make us more central to debate. The news media would become more focused on what happens here, not because we want it to be but because we would be at the centre of issues. That would be helpful for Parliament and it would help constituents to engage with issues. We have already been through the numbers of all those who are engaged with political campaigning organisations. They would find voting more relevant, turnout would rise, and this place would be at the centre of national life rather than increasingly marginalised.

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="60322h01_spnew9"><b> Sir George Young  (North-West Hampshire)</b>  (Con): I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) on his choice of subject and on the thoughtful way in which he presented it. He has clearly done all the required reading, including the Power report and the Norton report. I shall develop one or two of his ideas in my speech.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">The subject of our debate is every bit as important as that of our debate this afternoon on the Floor of the House. The health of our democracy is as important as the health of our economy. However, I fear that our debate in Westminster Hall might not get the same coverage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">I give the Government some credit for some of the changes that have been made. This debate takes place, metaphorically if not physically, in Westminster Hall. Ten years ago, we did not have Westminster Hall, so the frontier that Ministers have to patrol is now much longer. There have been many high-quality debates in Westminster Hall and I commend that reform. The Prime Minister appears before the Liaison Committee twice a year for up to three hours, which has been an important development in holding to account the most important Minister in the Government. So that the Government do not hoover up all the talent, we have begun to develop an alternative career structure within the House by paying Select Committee Chairmen and other Chairmen. Select Committees have been given more resources to do the work and to hold Ministers to account. The Minister may have other examples of reforms and I do not want to deprive him of all the raw material in his brief.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">However, there have been some backward steps as well. For example, the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill is a step backwards as it gives more power to the Executive. We have seen a growth in unaccountable special advisers and the erosion of collective responsibility. We have seen the way in which Cabinet is bypassed highlighted in the Butler report, and much else that I am sure that my hon. Friends will discuss when they make their own speeches.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">The first question that I want to pose is: who sets the terms of trade between Ministers and the legislature? In other words, who fixes the parameters that determine where power lies? At the end of the day it is Parliament, but one Committee of the House has enormous influence in setting those terms of trade between Ministers and Parliament, and that is the Modernisation Committee. Some of its reforms have been beneficial, and I touched on them, but some, such as the automatic guillotining of Bills, have most certainly not been.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">There is to my mind a fatal flaw in the working of the Modernisation Committee, which sets the parameters for today&#039;s debate. That is that the Committee is chaired by a member of the Government, and not just any member of the Government, but the Leader of the House&#151;the person appointed by the Prime Minister to drive the legislative programme through the House of Commons. It cannot be right that the Minister tasked by the Prime Minister with the task of getting the manifesto on to the statute book should also be the Chairman of the House of Commons Committee that decides how those Bills should be scrutinised by the House. It is a short circuit of the highest voltage possible in constitutional terms. There is a clear conflict of interest.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 74WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">The House of Commons needs to regain control of its agenda and provide its own Chairman of the Modernisation Committee, which should probably be merged with the Procedure Committee, with which it has much in common. It should be chaired by a Back Bencher, like every other Select Committee. Until we get that right and until the House seizes control of the Committee that can give power to the Executive or take it away, there will be a serious imbalance in the terms of trade between Parliament and the Executive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">In the time available, I want to touch on one or two ways in which ministerial accountability might be enhanced and to build on some of the suggestions made by my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean. One of the ways in which the Opposition hold Ministers to account is through Opposition days, when either a whole day or half a day is devoted to a subject chosen by the Opposition. When I was first elected, that was a useful way of holding Government to account. The debates were well attended and well reported, and quite often the Prime Minister came into the Chamber to listen to the winding-up speeches. Nowadays, one would be lucky to find any Ministers other than the one who is to respond to the debate on the Front Bench while a debate is taking place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">We need to answer the question that my hon. Friend posed. Is there a better way in which the Opposition can use their time to hold Ministers to account in the slightly different and faster-moving environment in which we work today? I think that there is. Building on what my hon. Friend said, we should swap part of the time allocated to Opposition days for the right to ask a topical question and have up to an hour of questioning Ministers on some topic of the day. As my hon. Friend said, there are urgent questions can be asked, but they have to clear a fairly high hurdle to get past the Speaker. There are often occasions when the Government face criticism on a matter of public interest and do not volunteer a statement, but the Speaker&#039;s threshold for urgent questions is not met. On such occasions, the Opposition should have the right to demand that a Minister come to the Dispatch Box and answer questions from Members of Parliament.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">Such occasions might arise when the Government try to get away with a written statement on an issue, but the Opposition feel that more rigorous cross-examination is needed. The Government might make a policy-related announcement outside the House, and we might not get an opportunity to grill the Minister. In such cases, an opportunity for questions would be good for accountability and for the Chamber, as we get more Members in the House for a statement than we do for a debate. There would be more coverage of the proceedings of Parliament if we became slightly more topical in such a way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">Secondly, would the world come to an end if Lords Ministers answered debates in Westminster Hall? We have Ministers in the House of Lords who have departmental responsibilities. A Lords Minister has often been in charge of defence procurement, for example, and Baroness Hollis was in charge of the Child Support Agency for quite a long time. If we want to hold Ministers to account and they have a ministerial

<br>&nbsp;<br>
responsibility within a Department, why should they not answer debates in Westminster Hall? There are no votes in Westminster Hall.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60322h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome)</b>  (LD): There is a reciprocal view, which might ask why we have Ministers in the House of Lords who are subject to double patronage in their appointment as both Members and as Ministers, and why can Ministers from the elected House not go to the House of Lords to introduce legislation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60322h01_spnew11"><b> Sir George Young </b> : That is the other side of the coin. The hon. Gentleman might want to develop that point, but I would hesitate before poaching on the House of Lords and who their lordships believe should appear before their House. I feel slightly more comfortable suggesting who I would be prepared to see in Westminster Hall. Perhaps I am unduly sensitive, but I think that it would follow from what I have said that Ministers from the Commons should be able to go down the other end of the corridor.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">My next point is that if the House is to hold Ministers to account we need enough MPs to do that task. There are now fewer Back-Bench MPs to hold Ministers to account and more Ministers: one third of the parliamentary Labour party are now on the payroll in one way or another. When I first became a Minister in 1979, there were 29 Parliamentary Private Secretaries; there are now 50 and they are out of play when it comes to holding the Government seriously to account. We need fewer Ministers and fewer PPSs to have a more balanced contest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">We also need&#151;I am sorry that the Government Whip is no longer here&#151;to prise the Whips&#039; steely fingers from Select Committee nominations. One of the most regrettable incidents in the previous Parliament was when the late Robin Cook was betrayed by his party and the Modernisation Committee&#039;s recommendations on a different way of appointing Select Committees were voted down. We need a rerun of that vote because we cannot have Ministers choosing their inquisitors on Select Committees through the Committee of Selection, which is dominated by the Whips.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">My hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean mentioned Prime Minister&#039;s questions, which I would reform. They are the highest-profile occasions on which Ministers are held to account, but possibly least productive. In one way, they are Parliament at its best, but they are also Parliament at its worst. For many people, Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time is the only impression they get of the House of Commons, but at times that impression is of a cross between a playgroup and a farmyard&#151;no wonder that some people get switched off by politics. Things have got better since Parliament has been televised, because fewer MPs want to be seen to be misbehaving. Things have also got slightly better now that we have more women in Parliament&#151;

of us. After half an hour of Prime Minister&#039;s questions, however, one leaves the Chamber wondering whether one has learned anything. I simply wonder whether there is a better way of using half an hour with the Prime Minister than posing a random sequence of questions that vary from the over-aggressive to the over-submissive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"><a name="60322h01_spnew14"><b> Mrs. May </b> : I suggest that the problem with Prime Minister&#039;s questions is not the structure, but the fact that the present Prime Minister does not answer any of the questions that he is asked.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60322h01_spnew15"><b> Sir George Young </b> : I think that I am right in saying that in the 1997&#150;2001 Parliament, our hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) analysed the Prime Minister&#039;s answers and juxtaposed those answers with the reality&#151;I put it no more harshly than that. He produced a very good publication, which he might like to bring up to date. However, my right hon. Friend is right that our frustration is in part due to the fact that the Prime Minister is often reluctant to give a straight answer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">Of the two issues I want to touch on before I sit down, the first is the royal prerogative. The biggest Executive decision that any Government can make is to take the country to war. The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) has proposed bringing the matter more within Parliament&#039;s remit. We need to explore that at some point.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">The other point, which my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean touched on, is the code of conduct. Ministers are rightly accountable to the House of Commons, but they are also accountable to the Prime Minister through the code of conduct. There are two outstanding recommendations from the Committee on Standards in Public Life in that respect: one has been accepted but not implemented, while the other has been neither accepted nor implemented. Ministers would be more accountable if the ministerial code had some teeth and it was not left entirely to the Prime Minister to decide whether a Minister had transgressed. I remember making a complaint about a Foreign Office Minister who had, in my view, acted outside the code of conduct. I wrote to the Prime Minister, who sent my letter to Robin Cook, who was the Foreign Secretary. Surprise, surprise&#151;he decided that the Minister had not breached the code of conduct. There was a circularity about that, which did not enhance ministerial accountability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">It might be in the public domain, but my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)&#151;the leader of my great party&#151;has set up a democracy taskforce chaired by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). I am sure that that taskforce will want to reflect on the ideas produced by my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean and other Members as we develop policy on an important matter that is driving itself fast up the political agenda.

<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 77WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) made a number of points that are taken as read in my book, so I shall touch on other issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">For a new Member of Parliament, coming into the Palace of Westminster is a thrill every day, and I cannot imagine that it will not still be a thrill if I survive a few more years here. This place is the mother of democracy, where the great issues of the day are debated and decided, and it is a real thrill to be here. I am sure that all new Members agree that the kindness that other Members have shown us is very encouraging. We have been welcomed, and our mistakes have been gently admonished. I should also mention the kindness of the Speaker, who has been very helpful to new Members, and I wish him well on his recovery from illness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">However, four problems have occurred to me that are within Ministers&#039; power to put right if they so wish&#151;there need be no change in the law. The first problem relates to media reports. I am getting a little fed up with phone calls at 8.30 am from some local radio station saying, &quot;Mr. Bone, can we have your comments on the failure of the Child Support Agency and what the Minister has said?&quot; I say, &quot;Actually, the Minister is not making a statement until 3.30 pm.&quot; The local radio reporter then tells me&#151;selectively&#151;what the Minister is going to say. A press release might have been issued and embargoed to the media until after 3.30 pm., but if they have had it in advance and are therefore trustworthy enough to consider the matter, why do Members of Parliament not get the same press release, with the same embargo on it, so that we are as fully informed as the media? How am I supposed to comment to the media on something that they have seen, but I have not seen? That would seem to be a discourtesy to Parliament. It might be happening because the news media operate 24 hours a day and have to work that way, but if they can be trusted, why can Members of Parliament not be?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">The second problem relates to parliamentary questions, and the Deputy Leader of the House will know the answer to what I am about to say. I assume that when a Minister is appointed, he is played tapes of &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, particularly the episode in which Jim Hacker explains to Bernard how to answer questions. He tells Bernard, &quot;If you get a question you don&#039;t like, don&#039;t answer it. Better still, totally ignore the question and make any statement you want on any matter.&quot; That seems to happen rather a lot at the Dispatch Box. Perhaps I am being a little unfair&#151;not all Ministers do that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"><a name="60322h01_spnew17"><b> Nigel Griffiths </b> : The director general of the CBI told me some time ago, when I was a departmental Minister, that &quot;Yes Minister&quot; was not a comedy programme, but a training video.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60322h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Bone </b> : I am grateful to the Deputy Leader of the House for confirming what I thought. I do not want to make a general accusation that all Ministers behave the same way, but certain Ministers tend to avoid the question that is put to them. Other Ministers, who try to tackle the question however difficult it is, have a high regard in this place and serve Parliament better. I remember asking the Leader of the House a question about a problem with waiting times&#151;a lady had been 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
waiting for treatment for more than a year. The Leader of the House referred to 1,500 extra nurses, 500 extra consultants and investment in my constituency, which did not address the question. I was also a little confused because I do not have a hospital in my constituency where those people might work. That is the sort of thing that frustrates Members in Parliament.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">I am just a junior Back Bencher, and I thought that it is simply what happens. Last night, however, I happened to be listening to a debate in which there was an exchange between the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality and my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), which illustrated my point rather well. <i>Hansard </i>recorded it as follows. The Minister said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;In fact, I shall ignore his question too because, if he has not listened to the substance of the debate, it does not deserve a response.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">My right hon. Friend then said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I would be grateful if you could confirm that my question was in order and it would be normal courtesy to answer it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">Mr. Deputy Speaker replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;One thing that the Deputy Speaker does not have to do is get embroiled in the debate itself. Questions may be put and they may be answered in the way that hon. Members and Ministers decide.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, </i>21 March 2006; Vol. 444, c. 257.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">Mr. Deputy Speaker&#039;s ruling is obviously correct, but it would improve our democracy if we had a little more courtesy and more of an attempt to answer questions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">The third issue, and the one that has concerned me most recently, is accuracy. Before coming to the House of Commons, I always thought that whatever was said at the Dispatch Box was 100 per cent. accurate. However, I have been engaged in a little battle on hospital waiting times. The Prime Minister said in November that no one was waiting more than six months for an NHS operation. He repeated that two weeks ago, yet in November, December and January all the latest figures showed that there are people waiting more than six months for an NHS operation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">I have raised the issue in points of order and parliamentary questions. I have written to the relevant Minister and to the Prime Minister. I thought that that would be enough to end what I can only say has been the less than 100 per cent. accuracy on the issue, but only the day before yesterday the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), repeated the statement. I raised a point of order and this is how <i>Hansard </i>records it:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Yesterday the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), said in respect of NHS operations</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">That may not be the most important issue in the world, but if Ministers are not absolutely in tune with the facts, the impression given to the outside world is that our democracy is not as good as it should be. My plea to the shadow Leader of the House&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60322h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Harper </b> : Deputy Leader of the House.

Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), as well, is for accuracy in comments and answers. That has been a problem with parliamentary questions. On the same issue as I mentioned, I received two answers to parliamentary questions from different Health Ministers saying completely contradictory things. I am pleading for more accuracy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">My fourth and final point is about meeting Ministers. That really is within their power. As hon. Members may have gathered, there is a real concern about health in my constituency and in the neighbouring constituency of Kettering. I have requested meetings with Ministers on only two occasions. On one occasion, we had a meeting almost straight away. The problem with the Secretary of State for Health was, first, that we could not get a meeting. Then Mr. Speaker said in the Chamber that Ministers really ought to meet Back-Bench MPs, and I was allocated a meeting at the beginning of December&#151;several months after I first requested it. The meeting was cancelled two days before it was due to take place and rearranged for March. A few days before that date, it was cancelled and it has now been rearranged for the second half of April.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">That is not good enough. Surely a Back-Bench MP should have the power to go to a Minister and say, &quot;We have a real problem here. Let&#039;s address it; let&#039;s have a meeting.&quot; If we request meetings with Ministers only now and again, we are not abusing the system and we should be allowed to have the meetings. That is within the control of Ministers and needs to be examined.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">I shall give another example to show that what I have described has happened to others. I understand that an hon. Member requested a meeting with a Minister who said, &quot;Sorry&#151;too busy. Can&#039;t see you.&quot; However, that hon. Member found that the same Minister was visiting his constituency only a couple of weeks later, so the Minister was too busy to see him, but not too busy to visit his constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House accepts that none of my comments is in any way intended to be party political. I simply think that there has perhaps been a drift away from the highest levels of democracy and that the suggestions that I have made could improve the situation. The Deputy Leader of the House is very highly regarded. If he could address the points that I    have raised, that would improve ministerial accountability to the House of Commons.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">I acknowledge that the Government have made advances during their term of office. However, they have gone backwards in some respects. The advances include the Westminster Hall debates, mentioned by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire, which have provided a good opportunity for Back Benchers to stimulate the sort of debate in which we are engaged today. I also acknowledge, and it is important to place it on the record, that the way in which Ministers conduct themselves in relation to the House and to individual hon. Members varies enormously. Some exhibit extremely good practice; others do not. We should strive to bring all Ministers up to the standards of the best in their relations with other Members of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">What areas should we consider? Hon. Members have already said that a key responsibility for Ministers is to keep the House informed of what is happening. That happens in a number of ways, some of which work well and others less well. I shall inevitably concentrate on the areas in which the practice is not as good as it should be. Let me start with the written statement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">The written statement is an innovation and it has its place but, to be frank, it is being abused. It is being used for controversial statements when Ministers do not want proper scrutiny of the decisions that they have taken. We need a mechanism to convert a written statement to an oral statement to the House, because a written statement, although it can inform, does not give hon. Members an opportunity to ask questions and to scrutinise properly what is being put forward. It is not an appropriate way in which to deal with matters that can be of huge importance to individual constituencies throughout the country. Nor is it right that, regular as clockwork, on the last day before a recess or Prorogation, an enormous number of ministerial statements are issued in the certainty that neither the House nor the media will be able to consider them properly. I think that I am right in saying that more than 30 statements were issued on the last day before the Christmas recess. That is an abuse that the ministerial code says should not, but that seems to be ignored.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">The hon. Members for Forest of Dean and for Wellingborough mentioned briefing of the media. It is not good enough that time after time we hear about important announcements from the Government on the morning news programmes&#151;announcements are made   through the media, rather than in the House. Mr. Speaker has deprecated that practice on a number of occasions, but still it happens regularly. I do not know how we are going to break the habit of always having the news before the news breaks, but it puts Members of Parliament at a huge disadvantage that prevents us from doing our job properly and it is a discourtesy to the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">Another way of keeping the House informed that has been lost over the years is the non-legislative debate. Inevitably, an enormous amount of debating time is devoted to the legislative programme, which is always too big and always takes up too much time, but as a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 81WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
result we have lost the opportunity occasionally to scrutinise the work of Departments through non-legislative debates. There are huge omissions, which regularly get brought up at business questions as the Deputy Leader of the House well knows. It is extraordinary that we have not had a genuine debate on Iraq in the lifetime of this Parliament. There have been very regular statements from the Ministry of Defence&#151;I do not fault Defence Ministers on that&#151;but we have not had a debate on the foreign policy implications of our occupation of another country and a theatre of war, and I find that a truly extraordinary omission. Another issue that affects the hon. Member for Forest of Dean as well as me is agriculture. When did we last have a debate on agriculture in Government time and have the opportunity to talk about the plurality of rural affairs in the context of bringing Ministers to account for what has happened? Given recent events to do with single farm payments, a debate of that kind would be extremely opportune. We need more opportunities for non-legislative debates. Westminster Hall fills the gap only to a very limited extent. In addition, Select Committees often produce important reports on which they have done a tremendous amount of work and which the House ought to have the opportunity to debate, but there are very limited opportunities so to do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">One innovation made by the present Government, cross-cutting questions, has disappeared. Why? I have asked that question of the Leader of the House, but I have not had a reply. New Members may not have had any experience of cross-cutting questions, so let me describe them. There are areas of policy that cut across several Departments. In cross-cutting questions, the range of Ministers involved in a particular area would be available to answer questions from Members on that wider topic. One of the problems was that cross-cutting questions were not desperately well attended, but that was because they were held in Westminster Hall while the Chamber was sitting, so Members inevitably faced a dilemma: should they attend the debate in the Chamber or be at cross-cutting questions? My answer to that dilemma is simple: if cross-cutting questions are important enough to be asked, they should be taken in the Chamber and extra time should be found for them. They were a good innovation, but they have been lost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para68"><a name="stpa_69">I have already said how important Select Committees reports are. It should not be for Ministers to determine that they will not give evidence to a particular Select Committee on a particular point. I encountered an example of that when I was a member of the Select Committee on Science and Technology. We were debating the scientific aspects of the war on terrorism, a very important issue, but we were told by the then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), that he was not prepared to give any evidence, or to allow any officials in his Department or officials of other Departments&#151;the Department for Transport in that case&#151;to give evidence to our Committee, because he did not feel that ours was the right Committee to investigate the subject. That is not a matter for Ministers; it is a matter for the House and the Committee, and Ministers need to be told that clearly.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 82WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para69"><a name="stpa_70">A second aspect of ministerial responsibility is keeping individual Members informed. Some Ministers and Departments are very good at that. Let me give an example of good practice: when something is planned that will affect a defence establishment in a constituency, the Ministry of Defence will always write in advance to the relevant Member to tell them about it. It does that assiduously, and I welcome it. The Department for Transport is often very good at telling Members about road issues in their area. Other Departments, however, are very bad.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">Oral questions are an effective form of scrutiny, but we get frustrated when Ministers do not answers questions properly. To be fair, sometimes we get frustrated simply because they do not give us the answer that we want, but at other times there is a deliberate attempt not to answer the question. Last week, I asked the Prime Minister a question about long-term care for the elderly; he gave me a reply about pensions. I did not feel that that was an adequate response to a question about long-term care for the elderly. The Prime Minister is more guilty than most in that respect. We must have the opportunity not only to ask questions but to get appropriate replies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">A real problem is developing with written questions. Sir Humphrey has always got in the way of written questions&#151;let us not kid ourselves that it is a problem that arose with the present Government. Some Departments seem to treat obfuscation as their main objective, rather than answering questions. One example is the Treasury: when does the Treasury ever give a direct answer? If there is any way for it to avoid giving an answer, it will do that. It is some sort of game between the Member of Parliament asking the question and the officials in the Treasury preparing the response. That is not the right way to treat Parliament.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">Delay in replying to written questions has become a problem. Nowadays, named day questions often get the reply, &quot;I will answer the hon. Member in due course.&quot; That is not the answer to a named day question and Departments must be told that in no uncertain terms. Late transfer of questions, whereby the day before an oral question is due to be asked it suddenly appears as a written question to another Department, is also a problem. I understand that Departments have different responsibilities, but as a matter of courtesy the Member concerned should be advised in the first instance that the Department feels that the question should be transferred. That way, hon. Members have the opportunity to ask an alternative question. Simply to transfer the question at a late stage is a discourtesy. Finally, responses to correspondence are sometimes delayed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">We need timely scrutiny of matters of the day. So often, Members have to resort to artificial devices such as entirely bogus points of order, which does the House no credit at all. People stand up and say, &quot;On a point of order, Mr. Speaker,&quot; and then ask a question about a matter of great importance to them, to which the only possible reply from the occupant of the Chair is that the matter is nothing to do with them. To whom does that do any good in reality? Surely we should have an opportunity to get timely responses to questions. Also, if early-day motions are supported by a large number of hon. Members, surely they should be a matter for debate. There must be a mechanism through which that can happen.

<a name="60322h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">Prayers of annulment are becoming a farce. We table a prayer and, months later, if we are lucky, we get a Statutory Instrument Committee in which to debate the matter; meanwhile, the order has actually been in force&#151;has been law&#151;for three or four months. Very often, prayers of annulment have no effect whatever. They are simply never debated, and that is an abuse. That is one reason why many of us are so deeply suspicious of part 1 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, which the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire mentioned and which drives a coach and horses through parliamentary scrutiny. It simply cannot stand in its present form.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">My final point on ministerial responsibilities is that Ministers are often able to palm off responsibility when there are arm&#039;s length agencies involved. They do not answer questions even though, in my view, they still have responsibility for the function.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">I cannot end my speech without mentioning probity and regularity. The worst possible news for the Labour party in this week of extremely bad news is that the fictional Alan B&#039;Stard has crossed the Floor and joined the Labour party from the Conservative party. That says everything that we need to know about the reputation of the Government in the country. As the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire says, we need a proper way of policing the ministerial code; we do not have that at the moment. We gather that Prime Minister is now at least partly, but apparently not completely, converted to the suggestions of the Committee on Standards in Public Life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para77"><a name="stpa_78">In light of the revelations of the past week, one more amendment is clearly needed&#151;an amendment to the ministerial code so that no one can be a Minister of the Crown if they are a major creditor of the party of Government. It is simply unacceptable in constitutional terms that someone can lend the Government party a very large amount of money and then be appointed to ministerial office, however creditably they perform their functions as Minister. What happens when the Prime Minister turns around to say, &quot;Oh, by the way, I am dispensing of your services,&quot; and that person says, &quot;Well, in that case, I&#039;ll take my several million pounds back, thank you very much.&quot;? It is not an acceptable constitutional position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">My last point is that there is need for a rebalancing of the powers of the Executive against the powers of the legislature. The hon. Member for Forest of Dean mentioned the Power commission, which has proposed not a written constitution&#151;something for which some of us have argued for a long time, but which we understand is a difficult concept to achieve&#151;but for at least a partial move in that direction through a series of concordats. Concordats are not alien to the present Government: a concordat was arrived at between the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the judiciary about the latter&#039;s powers and independence. A similar concordat is needed to preserve and protect the rights of Parliament and to order Minister&#039;s responsibilities to Parliament. It is time that we had that, time that it was made explicit, and time that Ministers adhered to the codes that are already in place.

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60322h01_spnew22"><b> Mrs. Theresa May  (Maidenhead)</b>  (Con): Mr. Weir, may I say what a pleasure it is to speak in a debate under your chairmanship for the first time? I thank my hon. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 84WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) for initiating a fascinating debate on ministerial accountability and wider matters, including the public perception of Parliament and public involvement in the political process and democracy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">It is only fair to the Deputy Leader of the House to remark on the fact that, whatever else we hear this morning, it is clearly true that, given the fact that he is sitting in splendid isolation on the Government Benches, this debate is an example of ministerial accountability, because he has nobody else to stand and support him in this debate. It is sad that no Government Member has been willing to enter into a debate that is not party political, but is a genuine one about the procedures and processes of the House and how we can ensure that Ministers are held more to account.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para80"><a name="stpa_81">I agree that a number of the issues that my hon. Friend mentioned in his opening speech need to be addressed, including public engagement, the problem of falling turnout at elections, the need to make Ministers more accountable to hon. Members in the House and, hence, to enhance Parliament&#039;s ability to fulfil its crucial role of holding the Government to account. A number of bodies have been considering those issues in recent months. My hon. Friend referred to the work of the Power commission and its report, the report by Lord Norton of Louth and work by Lord Puttnam. The Modernisation Committee is also considering how we can connect Parliament to the people and external involvement in the legislative process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">As a number of hon. Members have mentioned, my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has asked my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) to chair a democracy taskforce, which will look at such matters as strengthening Parliament, the role of Members of Parliament and Select Committees, the volume of legislation and regulation and scrutiny of national finances, ensuring the integrity and independence of the civil service, improving the workings of government, and addressing apathy with and alienation from the political process. That is quite a task and I can think of no better person to lead that taskforce than my right hon. and learned Friend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para82"><a name="stpa_83">Like my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), I want to comment on some of the good things that have happened. It is right to say that the Government have made some good innovations. Take the very existence of Westminster Hall debates: I will be honest and say that I was sceptical when they were first proposed, but I acknowledge that they have been a good development that gives hon. Members the opportunity to debate a wider range of issues than can be accommodated in the Chamber. Crucially, many debates that take place in Westminster Hall enable hon. Members to discuss topics not in such a party political way, but more generally, looking at the issues without trying to score party political points. I will deal with that later, in relation to further proposals. There have been other innovations, such as the Prime Minister appearing before the Liaison Committee. The Committee has, over time, been finding its feet in relation to its questioning of him&#151;it was a little tentative in the first couple of outings&#151;and the innovation has proved to be useful.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 85WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">Alongside those innovations, however, Parliament has all too often been sidelined by Ministers and by the present Government. A number of examples of that have been mentioned by hon. Members. The lack of statements is crucial. No only do Ministers announce things to the media before they are announced to the House, but sometimes they announce them to the media and do not announce them in the House&#151;or they use a written ministerial statement, which means that hon. Members cannot question them. There are a number of examples of that, the most recent one that I have encountered being raised in business questions last week. Last Thursday morning, the replacement&#151;we assume that that means the sacking&#151;of the chief executive of the Rural Payments Agency was announced in a written statement after months in which the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had been saying that everything was fine and rosy and going really well with the Rural Payments Agency. However, there has been no oral statement to the House, so hon. Members have not had an opportunity to question what led to that decision in relation to the chief executive of the agency and to question the Secretary of State on what farmers can expect from the agency and how it will operate in future. That is the most recent and obvious example of an oral statement being needed, but not being given so that Ministers cannot be questioned by Members of Parliament. Ministers may not like it, but part of their role is to be questioned by hon. Members. Ministers are accountable to the elected representatives through hon. Members and should be willing to come here and explain themselves.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">I have another example of a slightly different kind. For several weeks in business questions, I asked the Leader of the House to tell us the date of the Budget. The Treasury Committee advised that it would be good practice to give the date of the Budget two months in advance. I asked for about a month for a date to be given, until we were well within two months of the likely time, but sadly the date was not given. I first heard of it on Sky News. That is yet another example of how the media, rather than the House, are all too often the main channel for ministerial announcements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">There are other ways in which the power of the House to hold the Government to account has been reduced. First, there is the increasing use of statutory instruments and secondary legislation. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) spoke about the problem with statutory instruments, which is that all too often the prayer for annulment is not debated until after the date when the statutory instrument comes into force, which makes the debate farcical, because there can be no real expectation that the Government will allow it to be overturned. However, I am most concerned by the fact that so much of the detail of primary legislation is left to statutory instruments&#151;to regulations made by the Secretary of State&#151;and does not appear on the face of the Bill. That means that so many issues do not have proper time for debate as a Bill goes through the House, but are left to one-and-a-half-hour Statutory Instrument Committee debates, which, as we have said, come all too often after the regulations have come into force. That is another way in which the Government 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 86WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
avoid being held to account. Hon. Members have also mentioned the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, which gives unbelievable and deeply worrying legislative powers to Secretaries of State. I sincerely hope that the Government will listen to the arguments being put forward on that Bill and will be willing to amend it in due course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">We need to address several issues when we are seeking solutions to the various problems. First, we need to talk about the public perception and understanding of the role of Parliament and what happens in the House. Secondly, we need to enhance Parliament&#039;s role in holding the Government to account. When considering those processes, we have a duty to ensure that good government can take place. It is not Parliament&#039;s job to provide good government, but we should make changes in Parliament that, in some sense, make it less likely that good government can take place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">A number of ideas have emerged from hon. Members&#039; contributions to the debate and, in the spirit of open discussion, let me say that I agree with some, but not with others. However, the value of the debate is that it has raised a wide variety of suggestions that can be considered by the bodies looking at this matter. Despite my intervention on my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire, I support his view that, particularly given that PMQs is the main form in which most people see Parliament operating, it is important that they see not just gladiatorial combat, but serious questions being put to and answered by the Prime Minister.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">I do not agree with the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean that every Minister should be here every day to answer questions, as that would probably get in the way of good government. However, I agree entirely that Ministers need to be here more often, particularly to make statements. We need Ministers to be more willing to      make their policy announcements and their announcements of changes here in this House, and to do so in oral statements rather than hide behind written statements. Now, when Ministers say that a statement has been made, it has often been made only in writing and there has been no opportunity to question them about it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">We need to do other things as well. One area not mentioned by any other speaker today is the scrutiny of European legislation and ministerial accountability for it. In Europe, Ministers can take positions inside the Council of Ministers on potential legislation that has not been debated in this House. The timing of debates in this House, and how we manage such legislation, has to be considered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">The topicality of questions has improved thanks to suggestions made by the Modernisation Committee. We are able to table oral questions closer to the date on which they will be answered. However, there is still a need to find a mechanism to ensure that, when issues come up between the time of tabling and the date of oral questions, it is possible for hon. Members to raise those issues, rather than have to find ingenious ways of getting such topical issues into the subject of the question on the Order Paper.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">It has been suggested that the Government want to curtail Members&#039; opportunity to put written questions to Ministers. I am concerned about that. There are 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 87WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
many issues around written questions. When I first came to the House, one of the things that surprised me was my sudden discovery that I could not table any written question that I wanted to a Minister; there were blocks on certain questions and certain things could not be put into them. I have always said that one of the greatest arts in this House is learning how to get a written question past the Table Office. I shall always remember one of my great successes during my very early days in Parliament: I tabled a question about spam, but at that stage the Table Office did not know what spam was&#151;I should say for the benefit of Members that I was not referring to tinned meat. Somebody drew up a question, came back and said that an anorak somewhere who knew about IT had said that &quot;spam&quot; was a perfectly okay word to use in a written question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">We need to ensure that Members have the opportunity to table written questions and that it is not curtailed in any way by the Government. Ministers should not take so long to answer written questions. There are too many examples of hon. Members having to wait a considerable time for answers on information that should be readily available to Ministers and their Departments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para93"><a name="stpa_94">We need to find another way of holding Ministers to account for inaccurate, inadvertently misleading, or misleading statements made to the House. I shall give one example, which I have raised in business questions. In a written statement last December, the Secretary of State for Transport stated that the award of the Greater Western franchise to First Great Western would lead to improved services. In fact, it has led to significantly reduced services for my constituents, and, I say to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome&#151;I shall not describe Somerset as &quot;elsewhere&quot; as I did previously&#151;it has caused significant problems for stations beyond Berkshire. However, there is no mechanism for making the Secretary of State for Transport come to the House to change or explain that written statement, so that we can question him and point out that what he had said was&#151;perhaps inadvertently&#151;misleading to many people and to this House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para94"><a name="stpa_95">We need more debates on what I call general issues or themes and not to spend all our time simply debating legislation. There is far too much legislation in this country and this House spends too much time passing it. It seems to be a badge of honour for Ministers constantly to bring Bills to the House. We should debate issues. We have had criminal justice Bill after criminal justice Bill and measure after measure to deal with antisocial behaviour, but when have we ever had a debate on the causes of antisocial behaviour? People would see rather better that we were doing our jobs if they saw us debating the issues that affect them every day, rather than always debating legislation. We should also have fewer whipped votes. We should have an opportunity to have those sorts of debates, probably on a substantive motion, but without a whipped vote so that the genuine feeling of Members can be discovered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para95"><a name="stpa_96">We need an independent body to oversee the ministerial code, which a number of Members have mentioned. People regard with extreme scepticism the fact that Ministers are judged by the Prime Minister who appointed them in the first place.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para96"><a name="stpa_97">The real issue for public confidence in this House and public willingness to engage in the democratic process is how we present ourselves as politicians. People need to be confident that we make a difference to their lives and are worth voting for. To show them that politicians are worth voting for, Ministers need to show that they are willing to be accountable to the very Members who have been elected by the public.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para97"><a name="stpa_98">The hon. Member began by lamenting the lower turnout at general elections, and I entirely endorse his sentiments. I am sure that he sets a lot of store by ensuring that he gets the maximum turnout in his constituency, as I do in mine. Turnout in my constituency, at more than 70 per cent., is well above the national average, so we speak as kindred spirits on that issue. He made a number of useful suggestions. Not many had not been considered before, but that does not mean that they lack merit. I shall discuss one or two of the points that he made. Under our type of constitution, such issues will always be the subject of debate and can be amended from time to time. Nothing is fixed in stone.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para98"><a name="stpa_99">On the frequency of Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time, I understand that the Prime Minister took advice from his immediate predecessors, who told him that he should not cut the amount of time, but maintain it and have Prime Minister&#039;s questions on Wednesdays so that affairs of state could be better conducted. In my view, that move has brought about certain improvements. In opposition, I worked tirelessly prepping people for Prime Minister&#039;s questions, and it was often felt that 15 minutes was just too short for that killer question. I am sure that that was a delusion on the part of the Back Benchers and others whom I was advising, but none the less there was a feeling of frustration. It is not surprising that the hon. Member feels that under the present set-up, the gap between Prime Minister&#039;s Question Times is too long to get into topical issues. However, I am not sure that any future Prime Minister, having consulted their predecessors, would want to change that process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para99"><a name="stpa_100">There is an issue of topicality in relation to statutory instruments. Under the Conservative Administration, there were more than 50,000 of them. To be fair, I should say that the single biggest number was for road closures; if we could get them off the list, we could get to grips with the statutory instruments and regulations that we can agree to dispatch from the statute book.

I want to be as clear on this issue as the Leader of the House has been. We expect Ministers to observe the courtesy to Parliament of making their announcements to Parliament first. I think that the Treasury statement on the timing of the Budget statement was made at Treasury questions. The right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) might have seen it on Sky, but I think it took the details from there; I do not believe that I saw her at the Question Time when the Chancellor made the announcement.

<p>
<a name="60322h01_para102"><a name="stpa_103">On the more substantial aspects of the issue, the media now operate 24/7 and drive the pace. Parliament must ensure that it is not behind the media, although it is hard to see how it could be ahead in such times. Parliamentary reporting has been evolving to reflect that and to engage the public through websites and a good outreach scheme for citizenship in schools. That is also important.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para103"><a name="stpa_104">The suggestion made by the hon. Member for Forest of Dean about presenting questions without notice has been considered by the House in the past. It is one of the reasons why, as the right hon. Member for Maidenhead said, the number of days of notice of questions has been cut from eight working days to three. However, I caution him about raising things on the day. I am a former departmental Minister, and a distinguished former Cabinet Minister, the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), is present at this debate. I hope that the right hon. Member shares my view that it is good that where one has information from the Member, one has as many facts as possible. I fear that the criticism made of Prime Minister&#039;s questions, that it is hard to get an answer&#151;I am not saying that I accept that criticism but I am sure that hon. Members feel it is valid&#151;would only be replicated if, for instance, a Health Minister was given a question on an area about which he or she had no previous knowledge and was not able to use those three days to obtain information.

I know that the hon. Member encountered a slight problem, but I think that it was compounded by an Opposition debate on health, which caused a further delay. I hope that he is now close to securing the meeting. It is only a matter of courtesy that a Secretary of State or other Minister should meet Members to hear their concerns.

I was party to representations from Members from a number of parties about whether the Leader of the House should chair that Committee. I do not think that there is a political division on the matter. Some Members feel that it is an important that the Committee is chaired by the Leader of the House in order to progress its agenda&#151;my late friend Robin Cook certainly felt that way&#151;but others feel that there is then an issue of impartiality. I think that the Leader of the House probably sees the sittings of that Committee as among the least party politicised meetings for which he is responsible in his role. Of course, if the House were to decide, as it could, that it wished to change the Committee structure or bring the Modernisation Committee and the Procedure Committee together, it has adequate opportunity to do just that.

<p>
<a name="60322h01_para108"><a name="stpa_109">I know that Members and Committees have made proposals to restrict in some way the number of questions. I do not support that. When I first became a Member of Parliament there were restrictions on the number of oral questions that could be tabled by a Member at any one time. That restriction has been lifted and it would be wrong to go back. The number of written questions reflects the various concerns of Members of Parliament, many of which are extremely serious; others would not be judged to be so serious, but it is up to the Member to justify to his or her electorate why they have tabled certain questions. I am happy to leave that to the good sense of electors, as I am sure all hon. Members are.

circulated by the Whip and asked whether the Prime Minister would pander to his eccentricity. I think we have been pandering to his independence ever since.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h01_para111"><a name="stpa_112">The fact that today we have heard an updated version of the criticisms does not negate them. We want Parliament to operate effectively. The quality of the contributions to this debate shows that Members of the House are ever vigilant about the need to ensure that Ministers are held to account. I see it as my role as Deputy Leader of the House to reinforce that message. I do not give my colleagues a bad score&#151;I think that they are doing well, but as with everything else, there are grounds for improvement. I thank the hon. Member for Forest of Dean for allowing me to respond to his excellent debate.

<a name="60322h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Western Balkans</h3>
<a name="time_7">
<a name="60322h02_time0"><h5>11.1 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60322h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Randall  (Uxbridge)</b>  (Con): I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of developments in the western Balkans. Despite the fact that it is part of Europe and it is still in a volatile state, there are few opportunities to discuss these important developments in the main Chamber. That is why I am particularly grateful to Mr. Speaker for allowing me to secure this short debate. However, I do not think that half an hour will be long enough to address all the issues. We will be able to touch on only certain parts of what I wish to concentrate on. We are discussing the western Balkans, but I will concentrate my comments on the area around Serbia, including Kosovo and Serbia and Montenegro, and also Macedonia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para0"><a name="stpa_113">However, before I start doing so, I shall make a plea to the Minister. There is an excellent organisation called the British Association for Central and Eastern Europe, which many Members have become involved with. Visiting groups of different sorts of people from central and eastern Europe, including the Balkans, have come over to this country and, similarly, delegations of British lawyers and so forth have travelled to countries in that area. That has been a worthwhile exercise, and I was disappointed recently to hear that the Government have decided to reduce the grant in aid for that association by a third, and then by two thirds for the next two financial years, and finally to end it in March 2008.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para1"><a name="stpa_114">I understand that there is always a need for economies and for ensuring that money is well spent. However, I have been involved with some of the programmes&#151;I have seen them in operation both in this country and elsewhere&#151;and I feel that the association is doing important work. I urge the Minister to go back to his masters and plead its case. In respect of the area we are discussing, the sort of interaction the association provides is very important, not only in allowing other people to understand the complexities involved, but in trying somehow to work our way through what is a very tangled web in respect of the Balkan area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para2"><a name="stpa_115">Recent events have brought the area back into the headlines. The most notable of them was the death in custody of Slobodan Milosevic. I remember a debate of a few years ago with the then Member for Halifax, Alice Mahon, who, along with me, was a member of the all-party group on Serbia and Montenegro. We discussed the problems of The Hague tribunal, such as the fact that the process was going on for a long time and that Slobodan Milosevic&#039;s health meant that it might end with him dying in custody. Although his death might in    many respects close a chapter in that area, unfortunately, if the circumstances are not handled correctly, it will lead to all sorts of new conspiracy theories in an area where conspiracy theories abound. In particular, it will raise new questions for the Serbs about how they have been treated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para3"><a name="stpa_116">In saying that, I am not making any judgments about the process. However, as I said at the time, we should look at what is happening in Iraq. The Iraqis are being allowed to deal with the case of Saddam Hussein. I still find it strange that Milosevic and others were taken off to The Hague, instead of Serbia being allowed to deal with things. I have a feeling that that might become a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 93WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
slight problem in the future. I hope not; I hope that the death of Milosevic will to some extent allow the area to move on, but I am slightly fearful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para4"><a name="stpa_117">The Minister knows that, and it will become clear from some of my comments during this debate. There are other trouble spots around the world&#151;such as in Northern Ireland, which is not far from home&#151;where history runs very deep. It is difficult to separate the history, the legends, the traditions and so forth from modern peace processes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para5"><a name="stpa_118">The most important issue for the area under discussion is probably the status of Kosovo, but there will also be a referendum in May in which Montenegro will decide whether it wants to carry on with co-existence&#151;with Serbia and Montenegro as a country. It seems that the mood has changed somewhat; Montenegro may well opt for separation; I will not say secession, because they were two republics originally, and, going back further, two kingdoms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para6"><a name="stpa_119">That has been highlighted in a slightly trivial way by the problem the two areas have had over the Eurovision song contest; that has been reported in the newspapers. They could not even agree on who would present them because national feelings were running so high. I believe that, in the end, they have pulled out of this year&#039;s contest, and that they will not be in for some time while they sort things out. That is not of the greatest import, but that no agreement can be found on something like that highlights the problems that the countries face, as well as those facing the diplomats of other nations who are trying to understand what is going on. These problems are incredibly deep-rooted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para7"><a name="stpa_120">I used to go around the Balkans a lot and at that time, strangely enough, Montenegro and Serbia regarded themselves very much as twins and were fiercely proud of each other. It is a great shame that things have now got to this stage. Montenegro uses the euro as its currency, and the dinar is still used in Serbia, so ostensibly they are one country using two different currencies. I think there are also still different customs tariffs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para8"><a name="stpa_121">I should like to know from the Minister what the Government&#039;s view is. I remember that when I used to go around that region a lot&#151;even at the height of the problems, when Montenegro felt that it was being somewhat ostracised because of its associations with what was then seen as a pariah state&#151;the Government&#039;s view was that they should try to stick together. Is that still the case? I would be interested to know. It is not for me to interfere in that, but we have to tackle that issue. Ultimately, if all the countries in that area achieve the status of membership of the European Union, that may solve the problem, but I am afraid that that is a long way off for a lot of them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para9"><a name="stpa_122">Bearing in mind the time, I shall now concentrate on the current talks and discussions on the final status of Kosovo. That is obviously a very emotional subject for all parties involved and if I thought there was an easy answer to the situation, I would be the first to offer it to Governments. The pendulum in Kosovo has swung the other way: now it is the Serbs who feel very much at the wrong end of an apartheid system.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 94WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para10"><a name="stpa_123">The Serbs feel, perhaps as a result of the way that western Governments are talking, that there is a certain inevitability about Kosovo being granted independence. Mr. John Sawers, the political director of the Foreign Office, stated on 6 February that in the end Kosovo will be &quot;independent&quot;. That was possibly not a wise thing to say and it rather prejudges the discussions. It might be an opinion but it is not a very sane thing to say at the moment. It tends only to inflame the situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para11"><a name="stpa_124">Without giving a long history lesson, Kosovo to the Serbs and Serbia is rather like&#151;some would say&#151;Jerusalem is to Israel, but that would get us into a whole different ball game. In terms of England&#151;I could think of somewhere in Scotland, but I shall stick to England if it is all right with you, Mr. Weir&#151;it would be like Canterbury and Kent, having lost their English majority population in 300 or 400 years&#039; time, becoming an independent area, with spiritual parts of the nation&#039;s soul such as Canterbury cathedral and the site of the battle of Hastings being taken away. I say that because we have to understand that the final resolution of the situation will be extremely delicate, to say the least.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para12"><a name="stpa_125">The Serb minority in Kosovo are deeply concerned about what is happening to their heritage. Orthodox churches, monasteries and cemeteries are being destroyed. It is tragic; I have seen pictures of 15th and 16th century places that I visited 20 years ago that have been burnt down and destroyed in the terrible, religious and nationalistic fury that has taken place. I have grave concerns that the perpetrators of those actions have not been caught. KFOR is seemingly powerless&#151;although it represents the best diplomatic way to prevent a lot of what is happening&#151;and that only stokes the fires.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para13"><a name="stpa_126">If we do not have a fair and equitable solution, we will only make more problems for ourselves. We do not need a history lesson to remember what happened in Germany after the first world war, when there were feelings of injustice at the peace settlement. History is littered with such examples. Whatever might happen in the immediate aftermath, if we are not careful we will leave an open sore, so I urge the British Government and all the others to tread very carefully. They should not try to get rid of what is a very difficult situation. I do not think that the west helped by its intervention, but that is in the past and I am trying to move on. However, we have to be very careful; I have already given a couple of examples of how deep rooted the nationalism is.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para14"><a name="stpa_127">If we are not careful, we shall store up more problems for ourselves, so I urge the British Government to ensure that the discussions going on are not prejudged. Statements should not come out that seem to favour one side or the other. Because there are precious few in this Parliament who understand the situation and it is sometimes difficult to be non-partisan on the matter, I hope that the Foreign Office will send a few MPs who do not know anything about the area, and are thus neutral and fresh to the subject, to talk to people in Belgrade, Pristina, Skopje and Tirana, in order to find out exactly what people think.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para15"><a name="stpa_128">I have one final point, which will not have escaped the Foreign Office. If Kosovo became an independent state&#151;I do not question whether that is right or wrong, or whether such a state is viable&#151;a precedent for all sorts of other places will be set. President Putin already indicated earlier this year that the status of places such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the Caucasus area 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 95WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
might have to be reviewed. Countries such as Macedonia, which are working incredibly hard and have done almost everything asked of them, are nervous because the boundaries have not been entirely defined. The Albanian Foreign Minister said recently that he could not guarantee that borders are fully defined. I do not know whether he has rowed back from that, or whether it was a misquote. I do not want to stir up the situation any more.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para16"><a name="stpa_129">However, a whole load of problems are involved. In that area, we have Republika Srpska and what has gone on in Bosnia. If we start interfering with the boundaries, we shall open up an incredible problem, and return to both the problems of recent history and those that have existed for a longer time. I want to hear what the Minister says, so I conclude my remarks there.
</p>


<a name="time_8">
<a name="60322h02_time1"><h5>11.17 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60322h02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Douglas Alexander) </b> : I would like to congratulate the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) on securing this important debate and I commend him on his evident longstanding commitment to, and understanding of, the region. Indeed, although I am not in complete agreement with his points he raised, I have no doubt that our debates in this place are enriched by the sort of depth of knowledge and understanding exhibited during today&#039;s debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para17"><a name="stpa_130">As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, there have been a number of recent, significant events that have affected the countries of the western Balkans, from the beginning of the process to determine Kosovo&#039;s final status, to the death of Milosevic, to the remarkable agreement in Bosnia on the first changes to their constitution since the end of the war in 1995. The latter is in part the legacy of Lord Ashdown, who departed Bosnia as high representative in January this year, and his tireless efforts to transform Bosnia into a functioning state with the prospects of EU and NATO integration within reach. I hope that we can find common accord in paying tribute to the efforts of Lord Ashdown and his successes in recent years in Bosnia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para18"><a name="stpa_131">Before moving on to some of the substantive points raised, I shall first deal with the issue of the British Association for Central and Eastern Europe, which was put to me directly by the hon. Gentleman at the beginning of his speech. I am very familiar with the subject, having had correspondence from BACEE on several occasions, not least from its chairman, Lord Radice, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that we support the continuing work of BACEE in this part of the world. Indeed, by a coincidence of timing, I understand that officials from the Foreign Office are briefing members of BACEE as we speak.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para19"><a name="stpa_132">On the point of funding put to me by the hon. Gentleman, there will be a significant alteration to BACEE&#039;s funding in the years to come, but for the record, I emphasise that that in no way diminishes the importance of the work that BACEE can do through securing other income streams in the future, and that situation is not unique to BACEE. Other organisations that previously were directly funded through a block grant from the Foreign Office continue to do important work while the Foreign Office reallocates resources according to its strategic priorities. There is an ongoing dialogue between the Foreign Office and BACEE which 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 96WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I hope will continue as BACEE makes the important transition to being a different kind of organisation, but one that will be equally capable of meeting the important needs of that part of the world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para20"><a name="stpa_133">As the hon. Gentleman said at the conclusion of his remarks, we have limited time. Therefore, I shall not attempt to cover all the issues affecting the western Balkans in the time available today. Instead, I would like to concentrate on the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised: Kosovo and Montenegro, and the death of Milosevic and the wider impact on the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para21"><a name="stpa_134">To set the context for this discussion, 2005 was an extremely successful year for United Kingdom policy in the Balkans. A key objective of our European Union presidency was to ensure that the whole region embedded its relationship with the EU. Under our presidency in the second half of last year, the EU opened accession negotiations with Croatia on 3 October and declared Macedonia a candidate for membership of the EU. Bosnia and Serbia and Montenegro started negotiations for stabilisation and association agreements, and the Kosovo final status talks were launched in November.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para22"><a name="stpa_135">Even more extraordinarily, after a full 10 years of failure by the Bosnian and Serbian authorities to transfer any war criminals to the tribunal, 22 indictees were delivered to The Hague in 2005, although Mladic and Karadzic, the two architects of Bosnia&#039;s policy of ethnic cleansing, remain at large. UK leadership in the contact group, the United Nations, NATO and the EU was vital to those achievements, as was the prominent role played by our diplomatic posts in the region&#151;a group of individuals and institutions to whom I am happy to pay tribute this morning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para23"><a name="stpa_136">The process to determine Kosovo&#039;s final status as envisaged in UN Security Council resolution 1244 which ended the war in 1999 is now under way. This was one of the key issues in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s remarks. Martti Ahtisaari, the UN status envoy, is leading the process, and he enjoys the Government&#039;s fullest support. Settlement of Kosovo&#039;s status is one of the last pieces of unfinished business resulting from the violent break-up of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The other is the tribunal, which I shall discuss in a moment. Any settlement must be sustainable and fair, and provide effective guarantees for Kosovo&#039;s minority communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para24"><a name="stpa_137">The contact group remains strongly engaged in the final status discussions. The statement issued by the contact group Foreign Ministers at a meeting in London on 31 January injected renewed political support for Martti Ahtisaari. It made it clear that all possible efforts should be made to achieve a negotiated settlement in 2006. We will spare no effort to work towards that goal. However, such a settlement must take into account the views of the people of Kosovo, the overwhelming majority of which favour independence from Serbia and Montenegro. That reality cannot be ignored. The past disastrous policies in Serbia lie at the heart of the problems that we confront in Kosovo now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60322h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Randall </b> : I am interested in what the Minister is saying, and I do not want to stop him in mid-flow unnecessarily. What process is there to gauge the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 97WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
opinion of those inhabitants of Kosovo who now live outside its boundaries? I am thinking of the refugees and internally displaced persons who live in Serbia and, to some extent, in Montenegro.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60322h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Alexander </b> : I had the opportunity to travel to Kosovo in September last year, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that internally displaced people feature prominently in the wider discussions that are taking place not just in Kosovo but beyond it. I would be happy to write to him and set out in some detail the process for the final status talks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para25"><a name="stpa_138">Let me return to the earlier substantive point that was made in respect of the remarks of the political director in the Foreign Office, and the UK policy towards Kosovo&#039;s final status. The UK continues to believe that independence is an option to be considered. Indeed, some commentators argue that it is the only option that can bring long-term peace and security to the region. However, the UK also believes that any settlement must actively promote multi-ethnicity in Kosovo, provide a safe and secure environment for all Kosovo&#039;s minorities, particularly the Kosovar Serbs, and promote reconciliation in the region. We believe that that kind of settlement can be made to work for the benefit of all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para26"><a name="stpa_139">In 2006, political leaders in Pristina and Belgrade have a genuine opportunity to reinforce the European perspective to which they ultimately aspire. For too long, the legacies of the past have hindered the prospects for stability and security in the western Balkans. Political courage and vision will be necessary to move the region forward, but the UK stands ready to support politicians who lead the effort. We are at an important stage in the final status process. The recent pronouncements of the contact group make clear the importance of continuing to make progress on the final status discussions, and I remain optimistic that, through that process, we can find a way forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para27"><a name="stpa_140">Another key issue is the death of Milosevic and the wider implications for the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Milosevic&#039;s death is a blow to regional reconciliation, to the tribunal and to international justice. His trial was key to helping the region to understand and come to terms with the tragic events of the 1990s. With his death, the victims of the Balkan wars have been robbed of the chance to see him finally face justice. Now, more than ever, Serbia must deliver on their commitments to arrest Mladic and Karadzic.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60322h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Randall </b> : I am interested in what the Minister is saying. If, as the Minister says, the death of Milosevic has robbed people of an opportunity, why did The Hague refuse proper medical attention for Mr. Milosevic? Presumably, that has not helped them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"><a name="60322h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Alexander </b> : What certainly does not help the debate is some of the speculation that has followed the death of Milosevic. I believe that the hon. Gentleman 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 98WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
will understand if I am cautious in my remarks. I assure him that Milosevic&#039;s health was monitored carefully by the tribunal. Milosevic received medical treatment at The Hague, and we are confident that the tribunal&#039;s decision was taken on the basis of medical evidence. I will write to the hon. Gentleman and place in the Library a copy of my letter, which will set out the UK Government&#039;s understanding of the treatment that was received. It ill serves the interests of reconciliation in the region if rumours take the place of truth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para28"><a name="stpa_141">We have full confidence in the work of the tribunal. It has tried 61 cases to date, and a similar number are still in the pipeline. The tribunal is independent and has judges from a variety of countries. Cases are brought and judged on the basis of evidence, and have been bought against all ethnic groups in the region. The President announced a judicial inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Milosevic, the results of which will be known in due course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para29"><a name="stpa_142">The UK wants a strategic partnership with Serbia, but first Serbia needs to understand that there is no short cut to EU or NATO membership. Serbia must meet its obligations to the tribunal, notably by delivering Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic to The Hague, and adopt a constructive approach to Kosovo, Bosnia and a potentially independent Montenegro. I hope that the death of Milosevic will unlock Serbia&#039;s self-imposed isolation by helping it to come to terms with the past and to look forward to a future within the wider European community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para30"><a name="stpa_143">I recognise that Serbia has made real progress&#151;after all, it was through public demonstrations that Milosevic fell from power&#151;but Serbia&#039;s politicians now must lead their people by charting a political vision that will ultimately lead to integration into Euro-Atlantic structures. We remain ready to help the Serbian Government and people attain those goals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para31"><a name="stpa_144">On Montenegro, we are well served by outstanding diplomats in the Foreign Office, but I fear that I am able to shed little light on the Eurovision song contest, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The referendum on Montenegro&#039;s independence from Serbia is scheduled for 21 May. We welcome the agreement that was reached between the Government and the Opposition in Montenegro on the standards for the referendum, in particular in respect of the 55 per cent. qualified majority needed for Montenegro to become an independent state. We commend the work of High Representative Javier Solana and his personal envoy, Miroslav Lajcak, who played a key role in helping to broker that important agreement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h02_para32"><a name="stpa_145">It is too early to say what might follow or how an independent Montenegro would develop, but its behaviour during and beyond the referendum process would naturally affect the international community&#039;s stance&#151;

<p><a name="st_34"><a name="60322h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mike Weir  </b> (in the Chair): I should say before we start that there are three clocks in this room, all showing different time. For the sake of clarity, we are working from the digital clock.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"><a name="60322h03_spnew1"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies  (Ogmore)</b>  (Lab): I am glad to have secured this debate on an important subject that has caused a lot of consternation in all our constituencies. There are two possible ways to approach the debate. One is to harangue the Minister endlessly, in the hope that constant haranguing for an hour and a half will beat him into a political pulp. The other is to try to seek explanation and genuinely pose questions&#151;I have more questions today than answers. Pursuing the second approach is in the interests of all our constituents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para0"><a name="stpa_146">I know that the Minister will respond better to the latter approach, as long as he is allowed the time to respond. I followed with interest the previous debate on a similar subject only recently, in which, because of the number of passionate speeches, the Minister had only nine minutes at the end to wind up. Within that nine minutes he took 15 interventions and as such we did not learn a great deal. I want to hear the fullest possible answers for my constituents and do not want to miss this vital opportunity. As such, I shall tailor my comments and have regard to the interventions that I take.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para1"><a name="stpa_147">The title of this debate focuses on Post Office card accounts and benefits, but the issue is far bigger and further reaching than that. The fundamental issue is financial inclusion. How do we ensure that everybody in our society&#151;the elderly, the carers, those with mental or physical health challenges, the physically and socially isolated, those who are vulnerable to loan sharks and doorstep bully-boys and others whom we represent, even when others look away&#151;is included and not financially isolated, when others can gain the rewards of rising prosperity? This debate is about financial inclusion and fairness&#151;it is as simple as that.

<a name="60322h03_para2"><a name="stpa_148">Let me set out the backdrop to this debate on POCAs and why they have become so integral to financial inclusion. I shall speak of my constituency; others will speak of theirs. In the eyes of the Post Office my constituency is overwhelmingly rural. It consists in part of narrow strip settlements in former coal mining valleys. Only one of the many post offices in my constituency, which borders the M4, is deemed urban. All the communities in my constituency, under the definition of rural post offices, have fewer than 10,000 inhabitants. I therefore make no excuses for focusing on rural post offices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para3"><a name="stpa_149">There are now 8,000 rural post offices in the United Kingdom, but only 1,500 run at a profit. A network that the Post Office originally established as a cost-effective system of branch sub-post offices, typically running alongside small shops, has over decades been overtaken by trends towards car ownership, supermarket growth and centralised shopping. As we all know, there has been a commensurate decline in the vitality of village centres, as measured by the range and profitability of shops.

Gentleman concentrating on rural post offices. The urban areas also have problems and feel that they are going to suffer a quadruple whammy. First, they are not given the rural protection that rural post offices receive. Secondly, they do not receive the POCA amount for each transaction. Thirdly, the money that POCA would have produced to be spent in the shop will not be there. Fourthly, and most importantly&#151;this was put to me strongly by an urban sub-postmaster in his 60s just a few days ago&#151;the value of the business is often the lump sum for a postmaster&#039;s retirement, but that will be hit significantly. The Minister is a decent and able man and does not deserve to be harassed, but I hope that he will respond to that.

<p>
<a name="60322h03_para4"><a name="stpa_150">A submission from one of my postmasters shows the concern over the issue. He is a very good postmaster in the Garw valley, which is a settlement of around 5,500 people in a long, narrow strip, with one road in and the same road back out&#151;it does not go anywhere else. People either live or work in the valley; they do not go through it to get anywhere. However, there is a lively town centre and we are struggling to keep hold of that. That postmaster wrote to me:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;Since the POCA was introduced I have seen quite a drop in Benefit Claimants using the Post Office. Under the old book system we would pay out, on average, &#163;76,000 per week and now it is &#163;45,000. We used to be paid on the Volume and Value of book payments made but now it is only on the Value. This is a drop of roughly 34 per cent. in income terms per month.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para5"><a name="stpa_151">Before I continue, I should say that that postmaster is very good and has done a lot. He works the post office alongside a shop, which is bright and energetic. He has been fully part of the modernisation approach, but he is struggling. He continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;My overall annual income from the Post Office has seen a reduction of about 30 per cent. from what I was earning when I first started. But overheads have increased even though I now employ only 3 staff. (It used to be 7). The takings from the shop just cover staff wages and therefore we gain no income from it. That on top of the Post Office salary reduction means that we just stumble from one month to the next . . . one other thing&quot;&#151;</p>

Friend to the extent that part of my intention in this debate is to focus on something that has not been greatly focused on, which is not only the need to revitalise and find a full sign-up with other banks&#151;not just with the basic bank account, but other alternatives&#151;but the idea that our post offices should have a future as a vital high street presence in all our small communities.

I am in the fortunate position of having three different accounts. I have to make my own decision&#151;I cannot say for my constituents&#151;but I would be pulling away from the banks that did not support my post office.

Gentleman made the important point that this debate has to be about the customer. We should also recognise that it has to be about choice. More than 4 million customers took out a card account, fighting to overcome the Government&#039;s hurdles and resisting a lot of pressure not to do so. Surely the Government should now at least recognise that customer choice, and keep the card account available for those people and keep post offices open so that they can use it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"><a name="60322h03_spnew7"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : As the debate goes on I hope that I shall make clear my personal idea of where the Post Office should be going, focusing on the customer as well as the post office. The hon. Gentleman will remember, as many of us do, the immense reluctance of many people to move to the POCA. However, the POCA has served a useful purpose. I brought a delegation to the House to lobby the Minister&#039;s predecessor, because of the concerns about losing the pension books, moving to the electronic system and so on. Actually, experience of the POCA has proved that it has a point. The point of the POCA is that it is simple: money in, money out. People cannot go into overdraft and they do not face the dangers of a wider mechanism.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para9"><a name="stpa_155">However, there are disadvantages with POCA and that is why I want us to move away, but to a Post Office product&#151;to a POCA plus, say. Let us find something that does not involve just the high street banks offering the accounts, but a development of the POCA that will allow direct debit. While I can save on average around &#163;230 a year by paying my gas and heating combined bills and other bills by direct debit, the most vulnerable in our communities&#151;the ones who can least afford not to make those savings&#151;are currently in POCAs and precluded from doing so.

&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 103WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
November or October, Tricia Jenkins, the National President of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, members of which I met when preparing for this debate, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;POca does indeed have a limited life. When it finishes, we hope to convert existing POca customers into using another POL&quot;&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;service. It could be that because POca customers are used to banking, they might be prepared to switch to a bank account. And since we can offer a banking service, we would like to think we can keep those customers. So it is &#039;all change&#039; in 2010, but it will not necessarily be all bad news.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para18"><a name="stpa_164">I am worried about timing and planning and whether we will have appropriate products in place so that if people migrate from, or are migrated out of, POCAs there are suitable products for them to use that will retain the vitality of and footfall within post offices.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"><a name="60322h03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Bob Blizzard  (Waveney)</b>  (Lab): My hon. Friend is right about timing. Customers might have been reassured that they have until 2010 to move from a POCA to something else, but I wonder whether any of my hon. Friends&#039; constituents have received a letter that some of mine have received, which simply says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;Those people who can use a bank . . . account should have their Incapacity Benefit paid into it, rather than into a Post Office card account . . . now is the time to make arrangements to pay your Incapacity Benefit into a bank (or building society) account.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para19"><a name="stpa_165">That letter caused huge distress to my constituent, who thought that they had to move now. When they rang the number on the form, as they were requested to, they were even more distressed to be told, &quot;You have to have a bank account; trot along to your nearest bank.&quot; My constituent lives five miles from a bank and has multiple sclerosis. As a result of that kind of thing, people are concluding that the DWP does not mean what it says. If that is not the case, the Minister is being let down by some of the staff in his office.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60322h03_spnew13"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I have not received any such letters directly from customers, but that is because I am not in one of the pilot areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para20"><a name="stpa_166">I have made this point about timing to the Minister before. I accept that there is a case for developing beyond the POCA&#151;it is in the interests of our constituents, particularly the most vulnerable ones, to do that&#151;but those products need to be there as we do it. There is a crucial time issue, not to do with 2010 per se, but earlier than that, so that people have time to change. It is also to do with 2008, which is when we consider the issue of the social network payment again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para21"><a name="stpa_167">To their credit, the Government have worked hard, with the European Union, to ensure that funding for rural support is extended to 2008. That is excellent, but we must then have another tranche of funding, which we will have to discuss with our European colleagues because of competition regulations and so on. At the moment, we are looking at 2008. That gives us a short window in which the Government, the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry, the DWP, Post Office Ltd, the NFSP and the banks should sit down and get in place a range of products that will genuinely address issues of financial exclusion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para22"><a name="stpa_168">Having said all that, let us not forget the commercial realities of sub-post office branches, and that post offices   are independent businesses, not public sector

organisations and employees. To the Government&#039;s credit, in 2003 they recognised the huge social value of post offices to many rural communities and rightly introduced the SNP&#151;not the Scottish National party but the social network payment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para23"><a name="stpa_169">The SNP initially allocated &#163;150 million a year to support the rural post office network in recognition of its inherent social value. That has now been extended to 2008 after negotiations. The SNP provides for three elements, including the annual fixed pay of around 6,000 sub-postmasters in rural post offices&#151;those that would not be commercially viable&#151;and the development of new economic approaches to providing services in rural areas. I shall return to that issue later if I have time, but it does not look as though I will.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para24"><a name="stpa_170">The adoption of the policy that there should be no avoidable closures means that the number of rural branches has been relatively stable in the past four years. Roughly 10 per cent. of branches have exchanged hands&#151;I have seen them do so in my own patch in the four years since I have been an MP&#151;but the closure rate is only 2 per cent. There is a lot of flux and movement, but we are keeping branches open, partly through community involvement and, certainly in my area, partly through a proactive stance from Post Office Ltd, Postcomm and others, to ensure that if one branch closes, another opens down the street. That is important.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para25"><a name="stpa_171">When he responds, will the Minister talk about the long-term future of the no-avoidable-closures programme? In this transition period, it is vital that while we try to find a new future for some post offices, we do not trip over one thing, lose that policy, and see hundreds of post offices close before we get the new lifelines in place. The sudden panic is to do with the pilots. Will the Minister address that issue in his response? I genuinely want to know the purpose of the pilots and, more importantly, what will happen as a result of them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para26"><a name="stpa_172">I keep returning to the issue of the timing. If the pilots are meant to show the best mechanisms to migrate people when we have the products in place, that is fine, but they have caused a lot of worry. I acknowledge what hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard), have already said. If we intend to rush towards the pilots tomorrow and if they were to be rushed out in the Garw, in Ogmore Vale and in Gilfach Goch and Maesteg, it would be a nightmare because of the pattern of banking. Let me explain why.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para27"><a name="stpa_173">In my constituency&#151;I do not think that it is untypical&#151;there has been a pattern of bank closures over many years. They have gone in a certain order, which is fairly typical. One of the last to go from Ogmore Vale, which has a population of 7,500 and is a narrow strip valley, was HSBC, a bank that I bank with. It was the last to pull out and so it spent the year before, when the other banks were closing, marketing aggressively. It said, &quot;We are the last bank in town, so come and bank with us. We are the world&#039;s local bank.&quot; Last year, it shut its doors and went. There is no other bank in the whole valley system.

HSBC went, people transferred to the Post Office or to the one remaining other centre, the Halifax building society. Two weeks ago, the Halifax shut its doors. Neither organisation is fully signed up to the banking systems in the post office.

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60322h03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Christopher Fraser  (South-West Norfolk)</b>  (Con): I agree wholeheartedly with what the hon. Gentleman has said about access to facilities, and I support his concept of a POCA plus. However, does he agree that one of the biggest problems that elderly people have, particularly with remote banking, is that it is inherently difficult to open a bank account and manage it remotely across a wireless telephone system? Older people, particularly in constituencies such as mine and that of the hon. Gentleman, find that difficult to undertake. The simplicity of POCA and POCA plus is what they are looking for as a consequence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60322h03_spnew15"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : I would agree to the extent that undoubtedly those who have never had bank accounts before encounter difficulties with not only remote banking but normal banking. Citizens Advice has highlighted that, and I thank it for its briefing. I have the executive summary with me, rather than the 60-page briefing. The Minister might want to respond to that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para29"><a name="stpa_175">Citizens Advice is not against a successor to POCA. It is not against basic bank accounts. However, it recommends that all banks should review their existing basic bank accounts against several principles. There should be no use of credit scoring, because credit scoring is not a disincentive but a roadblock to some constituents when it comes to bank accounts. We tell them that if they want to move to the Post Office they should use a basic bank account, but credit rating makes that immensely difficult. Accounts should be opened on the spot, provided that the customer has acceptable forms of identification. One of the big problems with people who are not used to bank accounts is that, unlike us, they are not used to wandering in with two or three forms of identification. They might not even have the forms of identification that we take for granted. I recommend the briefing to hon. Members, because it gives the issues about banks and financial exclusion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para30"><a name="stpa_176">Twenty-six banks&#151;I have been told 25, but there are 26 on my list&#151;are currently signed up to the Post Office. Perhaps one has joined in the past few days. They provide 26 basic bank accounts. The interesting thing about basic bank accounts, from my understanding and my discussions with regional executive members of the NFSP, is that they can give some of those features like a POCA. However, if we consider facilities such as a balance inquiry, which is something that we take for granted when we are managing our money, Barclays, Cahoot, Barclays cash card account and HSBC do not offer that option.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para31"><a name="stpa_177">Let us consider those that offer cash accounts, where one can pay money in as well as take it out. If we are genuine about financial inclusion, we should try to say to people that we do not want to give them unsatisfactory products and for them to be inundated with banks offering everything under the sun, but that we do want them, if they are able and willing, to be able to take advantage of the accounts.

<a name="60322h03_para32"><a name="stpa_178">Only 13 of those 26 accounts allow cash to be paid in. It is a disgrace. Nationwide building society, Abbey, Bank of Scotland Easycash, Barclays, First Trust bank, Halifax Easycash, HSBC, Nationwide FlexAccount, NatWest, Northern bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster bank and Yorkshire bank&#151;none is signed up in the full way that they should be to keeping the Post Office going. If they were, it would mean that a person could go into a post office and not only take their benefits out or have them paid in but, when they wanted to, take that further.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"><a name="60322h03_spnew16"><b> Mr. Eric Illsley  (Barnsley, Central)</b>  (Lab): Is that not the crux of the whole debate? I know that my hon. Friend is speaking about financial inclusion, but we are faced with a situation where some of the major banks that have been referred to simply do not want to involve themselves. My hon. Friend talks about POCA plus being the next product; POCA plus would obviously be as close as it can get to a normal bank account, but the normal banks do not want to take part. There is a wider debate about competition in the financial services industry and whether the big banks want to be bothered with all such accounts.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60322h03_spnew17"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : I agree with my hon. Friend. I imagine, and I do not think that it is a futile hope, that post offices have a good future. However, it will only be achieved if we have full sign-up. That should come not only from the Government. The Government are trying, and pushing hard, but perhaps the Minister, along with his Treasury colleagues and the DTI, should be putting more pressure on the banks. I am more than happy to sign up here and now to a cross-party campaign to try to put pressure on the banks to sign up fully. When the banks withdraw from our communities, that gives a golden opportunity for our post offices, but not at the moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para33"><a name="stpa_179">Surely some of the profits made in the banking system could be put in to provide the basics, such as keeping the vitality of the high street in Pontycymer, so that shopkeepers can go in and out&#151;bring money in and keep that going so that the vulnerable and those who need access to money at the drop of a hat can have a free cashpoint and so on. Although we hear the arguments about the commercial imperatives of the banks withdrawing, there is no excuse for banks to stay away from the remaining outlet in many communities, which is the post office. Anything that the Minister, the Treasury, the DTI and we can do should be done to put pressure on the banks to play ball more fully than they are.

I know that the Minister is genuine in his attempts to do that, but I urge him and the DTI to look not only at POCAs but at financial inclusion, to see how we can bang the heads of the various partner agencies together and work out what things will look like in a couple of years.

</p>


<a name="time_11">

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="60322h03_spnew20"><b> Mr. Alan Reid  (Argyll and Bute)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) on securing the debate and on the excellent way in which he presented his case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para43"><a name="stpa_189">Post offices are important in many of our communities, particularly rural communities and deprived urban areas. Such communities often lack big businesses, and the hon. Gentleman mentioned banks. The post office is very important and is often the core of the community. In villages, it will contain the sole shop or be surrounded by one or two other shops. The money that it pays out to pensioners and those collecting their benefits plays an important role in sustaining the post office shop or the shops round about. Post offices therefore play an important role in the community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para44"><a name="stpa_190">We must find a post office-based solution, not a bank-based solution. If we have a bank-based solution, customers will gradually be drawn away from post offices to the banks, with the post offices gradually losing business. Even though people might theoretically be able to collect their money from some bank accounts at the post office, the loss of business will mean that there is no post office. It is therefore important that we retain post offices and continue with POCA or an improved form of POCA that offers a post office-based solution. People have chosen to use the post office and had to fight their way through the customer conversion centre. Millions of them have put up a big fight to get their Post Office card account.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para45"><a name="stpa_191">I want to engage constructively with the Government, but it is difficult to do so when the Minister with responsibility for post offices refers to them as &quot;inefficient physical structures&quot;. It has also been difficult to engage with the Government because of the secrecy and the cover-up of the past few years. There has been a secret conspiracy and a deliberate cover-up within the Government in an effort to take people away from post offices. If Government policy remains unchanged&#151;I make no bones about this, and Adam Crozier of the Post Office has made this clear&#151;10,000 post offices will close, leaving only 4,000 in the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para46"><a name="stpa_192">The Speaker forced the Government to release their secret agreement with the Post Office, and I shall quote a couple of items from it. The first states that the Post Office
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;shall not, and shall procure that the PO Personnel and the Post Office Agent shall not, market or procure the generation of Publicity or Marketing for the POCA&quot;.</p>

<p>
<a name="60322h03_para47"><a name="stpa_193">Post Office agents include sub-postmasters, so sub-postmasters are not allowed to market the Post Office card account to their customers&#151;that is what the Government and the Post Office have decided. The secret agreement also states:

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para49"><a name="stpa_195">I tabled a question to the Minister to ask him about two issues. The first part of the question asked,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;when Parliament was first informed that . . . the Government&#039;s contract with the Post Office to pay pensions and benefits into Post Office card accounts lasted until 2010.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para50"><a name="stpa_196">He answered by quoting <i>Hansard </i>from 4 February 2005, which was two years after the card account started. The other part of the question related to when the Government announced to Parliament that they
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;did not intend to renew this contract with the Post Office when it expired in 2010.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>13 March 2006; Vol. 443, c. 1849W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para51"><a name="stpa_197">However, the Minister failed to answer that part of the question. It therefore appears that, until the last month or so, the Government never announced to Parliament that there was no intention to renew the contract in 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para52"><a name="stpa_198">I want to enter into constructive engagement and to hear what the Minister sees happening after 2010. With all these pilot schemes, the Government&#039;s present approach is moving people away from the Post Office now. The Government have obviously realised that the Post Office card account comes to an end in 2010. We cannot have a big bang in 2010, so there must be movement before then. With all these pilot schemes, the Government are moving people to the banks now. Why are the Government and the Post Office not working on producing an improved form of POCA for after 2010? All that they seem to be doing is moving people to the banks. The letters that they send people simply tell them that they must move to the banks and that they must phone up and give the Government bank account details.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para53"><a name="stpa_199">The Government seem to be going down the track of moving people away from the Post Office, and the loss of custom will lead to the closure of post offices. The only legal protection for post offices is in the Royal Mail&#039;s universal service obligation, which states that
</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;in all postcode areas&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para55"><a name="stpa_201">postcode area means the initial two letters of the postcode. That means that large tracts of the country will not need to be within 10 km of a post office. That is particularly the case in a postcode area such as mine&#151;the PA postcode&#151;where the vast bulk of residents are in the urban areas of Renfrewshire and Inverclyde, with my rural area added on. If the proposed policy is implemented, only a handful of post offices would be left in my constituency of the 100 or so that are there now. I therefore appeal to the Government to engage positively with pensions groups, sub-postmasters and other parties, to keep the Post Office card account for the moment and to produce a post office-based solution after 2010.

I take his point that there seems to be a policy of running down the post office network, but I disagree that that is somewhat secret&#151;it has been painfully obvious to everybody that the future of the sub-post office network is under threat.

<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 110WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para56"><a name="stpa_202">This is an important debate, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) on raising the issue once again, because the Minister needs time to explain the Government&#039;s position. I will therefore keep my remarks very brief. The debate is important because it relates to issues such as financial inclusion and the future of the sub-post office network. It raises questions such as whether the big banks are involved or want to be involved, whether there is over-provision in the financial services sector and whether the major banks simply do not want to be bothered with this type of account and would point to what my hon. Friend calls POCA plus as being like a normal bank account and say that people can now have mainstream bank accounts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para57"><a name="stpa_203">At the end of the day, however, the reason for the POCA was to maintain the post office network. Once we look towards mainstream bank accounts&#151;current accounts with major banks&#151;and moving away from POCA or POCA plus, there is no reason to have that facility in post offices. Once we remove the POCA, the sub-post office will die on its feet because of the lack of income, unless there is something to do with the finances of which we are not aware. What does the Post Office get out of this system and what does it cost the Government? When will we obtain the figures so that we can see for ourselves what the juxtaposition is?
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"><a name="60322h03_spnew22"><b> Mr. Blizzard </b> : In the context of what my hon. Friend is saying, one of the sub-postmistresses in my constituency said that it would make a huge difference if more banks had the LINK mechanism and if all the banks with the LINK mechanism signed up with the Post Office. At the moment, Nationwide is there&#151;good for Nationwide. Why are the others not there?
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"><a name="60322h03_spnew23"><b> Mr. Illsley </b> : That is a fair point and it is part of the debate about financial services. An automated teller machine near my home is in the local garage, so when I fill my car with petrol, I can withdraw money. I need not go near a post office&#151;or a bank, come to that. If the post office closes but the garage is still there&#151;the chances are that garages will outlive post offices&#151;people will be able to use that ATM, which does not charge for my account. That poses a threat to the sub-post office. Much of the argument is about the future of the sub-post office network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para58"><a name="stpa_204">I wanted to speak in the debate because I have received more than 40 letters this week about one sub-post office in what is an urban constituency, because the sub-postmaster has told the customers that the Government&#039;s withdrawal of the POCA from 2010 could pose a threat to the post office, and the customers have reacted. I cannot recall receiving so many letters in such a short time about one issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore talks about the Post Office and takes a romantic view. I am talking about people who have put pen to paper because they have a beef about the future of their post office. To many people, the future of the network is hugely important.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"><a name="60322h03_spnew24"><b> Chris Bryant  (Rhondda)</b>  (Lab): Is not the central point the fact that somehow or other the Government must ensure that after 2010 everyone can still withdraw their money, whether it is pension money or whatever, from a post office, not principally to keep post offices 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

going but because that should be their basic right? The Government should have given people that guarantee. We hope that, whether or not it is called the Post Office card account, there will be that guarantee for everyone, whether they live in a rural constituency, a poor constituency or a semi-rural one such as mine.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"><a name="60322h03_spnew25"><b> Mr. Illsley </b> : I agree, but whether we have a right to a sub-post office network is debatable. There is a school of thought that says that the Government are not committed to that network and would be quite happy to see it wither on the vine, the way things are going. However, something may be being negotiated between the Post Office and the Government so that there can be a future for what my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore calls POCA plus, which will slot in between the post offices and the banking network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para59"><a name="stpa_205">I return to the question of what a sub-postmaster gets from someone coming into his post office and using a high street bank card. Can sub-postmasters draw an income from that? If they can, what are sub-postmasters complaining about? Let us give everyone a bank account and let them go into the post office and use it as a branch of their bank.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"><a name="60322h03_spnew26"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : One of the interesting discussions that I had with a Welsh executive member of the National Federation of Subpostmasters in Wales was on that very point. He pointed out that, with POCA, a person gets 15p for every &#163;100 transaction. They have to have &#163;100. However, for a banking transaction, regardless of its size, someone gets on average 13.5p. The average transaction involves about &#163;50, so we are talking about 27p per &#163;100. To return to what my hon. Friend was saying, the issue is the wider level of support. If it is not POCA, what will keep those post office branches going?
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"><a name="60322h03_spnew27"><b> Mr. Illsley </b> : Some revealing facts are coming out about the amount of money that post offices and banks get and whether we can achieve something in the middle. As we know, all manner of new banking products are introduced every day. There is huge competition in the banking sector. I am referring to direct debit banking, internet banking and so on. People are obviously sat in a room somewhere designing new products even as we speak, moving away from POCA plus towards accounts with all the bells and whistles to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore referred. The caravan is moving on in terms of what is available in the financial services sector. My hon. Friend made the good point that the profits made by high street banks these days are incredibly high&#151;more than &#163;1 billion for each bank that declares profits. Why are we talking about profits such as that and yet high street banks are not coming into this system? We are arguing for people who do not have a basic bank account.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para60"><a name="stpa_206">I come to the question whether the POCA was meant to be permanent or temporary. I could not recall anyone saying when we debated the system initially that it would be temporary. I can see the point in including people in financial services and migrating them from the POCA to a mainstream bank account; that is about financial inclusion. However, I do not recall the argument that the POCA was to be temporary. The Government said in response to the Trade and Industry 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 112WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Committee that the contract would last until 2010. I think they said that it was too early to speculate beyond that point. They did not say that the system would end in 2010 and they would not renew it. The fact that it will be ended so soon has caused a lot of concern.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para61"><a name="stpa_207">I take the Minister&#039;s point that, for 25 per cent. of the delivery of Government benefits, this system takes up 80 per cent. of the cost. It looks as though the Government set up the system in 2003 and have since realised that it is costing a hell of a lot of money for a small number of customers, hence they need to get out of it pretty quickly. It looks as though the Government are getting out of it sooner than 2010, given the pilots and the fact that people are being encouraged to move away from the account. The pilot schemes involving migration are causing the problem. The POCA is closed to new entrants; 35,000 individuals with Post Office card accounts have been told to open a bank account; and 2,500 accounts have simply been closed. Those are the reports that have reached me. It looks as though the Government are intent on closing the contract down even before 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para62"><a name="stpa_208">It would be interesting to hear from the Minister whether the cost to the Government is a factor in the midst of all this. It is important that we debate the sub-post office network, but an hour and a half in Westminster Hall does not do the subject justice. The Government should consider allowing extra time to debate the sub-post office network, perhaps on the Floor of the House, because it is a serious issue. The Government should also end the uncertainty and either agree to extend the contract for a couple of years beyond 2010 or make a statement of certainty on what will happen, so that people with the accounts know what will happen and we can advise our constituents for the future.

I congratulate the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) on securing the debate and on his speech. I, too, have received a postbag on this issue. Some of it has been prompted by the fact that post offices in my constituency are being closed or are potentially being closed and replaced by a van, which I am sure will provide a good service for the few hours during which it is available, but which in global terms will reduce the service available from local sub-post offices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para63"><a name="stpa_209">My constituents make two points when they write to me. Initially, they are concerned that the Post Office card account will probably disappear, but they also make a slightly more subtle point: they are concerned about the lack of consistency and security, particularly for those who are older or have a disability. That is a particular issue in my constituency and those of many hon. Members present who represent rural areas, where there are a higher than average percentage of older people, of people with disabilities and certainly of people who are financially excluded because of their income or employment record.

mine, reflect a deeper concern about the viability of post office shop businesses in his constituency? Does he recognise the character of one of my village post offices, Llanrhystud, where 130 Post Office card transactions take place each week? The viability of the shop associated with that business will be very much under threat if the uncertainty continues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60322h03_spnew30"><b> Hywel Williams </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point, and I will refer to that issue now rather than later, as I had intended. There are great potential effects on local sub-post offices, and that is in contrast to the great efforts made in areas such as mine to support local shops. In my constituency a village co-op was set up specifically to buy the local post office-shop. The huge effort that went into that may now apparently be rewarded by a severe blow to the income of that business. We certainly must have concerns about footfall and the amount of other business attracted to shops by the Post Office card account facility. As has been noted by other hon. Members, the Prime Minister has said that he wants the network to thrive, and that wish is shared by all of us. However, given the points made by me and other hon. Members, how can it thrive?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para64"><a name="stpa_210">I finish on a point that another hon. Member made about the service to the individual customer. There is a certain amount of pressure on card users to take advantage of a bank account. People in some parts of my constituency would say bitterly, &quot;What bank account?&quot; When one looks at deeply rural areas&#151;some of my constituents have to travel eight or even 15 miles to access their bank accounts&#151;one has to be sceptical to say the least.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para65"><a name="stpa_211">I refer hon. Members to the report of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. In the previous Parliament, I had the opportunity to be a special adviser for its investigation into financial exclusion. One need only look at the response at the time of the large clearing blanks to the closure of branches, to which the hon. Member for Ogmore referred. I will give a particular example that Welsh Members will relish: a bank in the Rhondda was closed and the alternative service offered was in Pontypridd. That is but 3 miles away as the crow flies, but as the bus or train travels, it is a day&#039;s expedition to get to the nearest bank. That was the level of understanding demonstrated at the time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60322h03_spnew31"><b> Chris Bryant </b> : As the hon. Gentleman mentioned my constituency, I thought it incumbent on me to comment. I am not particularly sure which part of the Rhondda he thinks is 3 miles from Pontypridd, but large parts of it are 12 miles away from it. One recent closure was in Treherbert, and that was very disturbing. Does the hon. Gentleman not think it ironic&#151;worse than ironic, in fact&#151;that many of the banks show no great interest in many such communities when it comes to providing banking services, except when they want to lend money to people? Then they are quite happy to provide them regularly&#151;almost daily&#151;with yet another free, pre-arranged, pre-guaranteed credit card, pre-guaranteed loan, or with credit card cheques? There is a great deal of hypocrisy going on with some of the banks.

That sort of account exists in many European countries and is very successful there, and I have no idea why we cannot replicate that in the UK.

<a name="60322h03_time4"><h5>3.25 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60322h03_spnew33"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b>  (LD): I am aware of the need for brevity, and following the excellent contributions of the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), who secured the debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid), and the hon. Members for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) and for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams), I wish to make just three brief points.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para67"><a name="stpa_213">First, it is clear to me that we all have to accept that, although we feel strongly about the issue and have communities who have depended on post offices for many years, any decisions on the future of Post Office Ltd and our post offices cannot be made purely on the basis of sentimentality, and we cannot plan the future of those services purely on that basis. However, we need to make sure that the decisions are made on the basis of giving Post Office customers genuine choice, not a lack of choice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para68"><a name="stpa_214">Many of us who followed the offer of a variety of methods of collecting pensions and other benefits feel that despite what the Government have said, a lot of the choices that we believe should be available to customers have been closed, denied or at least made extremely difficult. Large and significant obstacles were put in the way of customers, both in terms of the information put out in Government leaflets, and the complexity of the forms that people needed to complete to open a Post Office card account. For other reasons, those opportunities have been significantly restricted. Despite those obstacles, and the obstacle course that the Government have put in the way, the fact is that a larger number of people&#151;4.7 million of them&#151;opened Post Office card accounts than the Government anticipated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para69"><a name="stpa_215">Secondly, the Minister needs to address the issue of the honesty with which the Government are managing the next stage of the future of the Post Office card account, and their decision to close options beyond 2010. As I said earlier, I received a letter&#151;sadly, the date on my copy is too faint, but I will provide it later&#151;this week from the Minister. He says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;It was designed as a stepping stone to help people who had not used a bank account before get used to banking before moving on to an account offering more features. The Post Office card account contract runs up to 2010. There was never any expectation that we should provide funding beyond that date and there is no case for doing so.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para70"><a name="stpa_216">Earlier, I also referred to another letter, signed by both the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. I shall quote from page 4 of that letter, which was circulated to all hon. Members, and I shall do so in full, to be fair. It says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;New banking services and the introduction of the Post Office card account are central to the future of the Post Office.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 115WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para71"><a name="stpa_217">If it is central to the future of the Post Office, why is that option being closed down? Nothing in that five or six-page letter referred to the closure of the card account.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60322h03_spnew34"><b> Tim Farron  (Westmorland and Lonsdale)</b>  (LD): I have 50 post offices in my constituency. The largest single cause of closure of post offices is people reaching retirement and not being able to sell on their business. Would my hon. Friend agree that it is the uncertainty created by the lack of clarity over the future of the POCA, and indeed of the rural post office network grant, that causes those people not to be able to sell on?
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"><a name="60322h03_spnew35"><b> Andrew George </b> : I agree with my hon. Friend, and I hope that the Minister has taken that point on board and will consider it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para72"><a name="stpa_218">The third and final point that I wish to make is simply that the uncertainty is putting the most vulnerable in society at the mercy of the banks. I have taken up a large number of cases on behalf of constituents, and am also aware of other cases on which the Office of Fair Trading ruled in July. Some bank account customers find themselves with unauthorised&#151;or, indeed, authorised&#151;overdrafts with charges that the OFT has found against. It asked the high street banks to regularise and make more transparent their opaque charging mechanism, particularly for people on very low incomes, the people we are talking about when we talk about Post Office card account users. Given that those banks were given three months to respond and they have still not come up with any conclusion at all at this stage, I hope that the Minister accepts that, with this measure, he is throwing the most vulnerable in society at the mercy of an unacceptable situation.
</p>


<a name="time_15">
<a name="60322h03_time5"><h5>3.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_70"><a name="60322h03_spnew36"><b> Danny Alexander  (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) on securing this debate and on his eloquent opening contribution. I strongly echo the remarks made by the hon. Members for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis), that although a debate in Westminster Hall is important, it does not give enough time to debate this matter in full. Reiterating a point made in a previous debate, we should have some Government time in the main Chamber to debate this matter more fully.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para73"><a name="stpa_219">Hon. Members have been right to say that the news that the account was temporary came as a shock to many people. As the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) said, it was a well-kept secret by Ministers during the crucial period when the card account was being rolled out. In a letter sent on 21 February this year, the DWP told one correspondent that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">&quot;drawing attention to the end of the Post Office card account contract may have been seen in a negative light by critics. Therefore we made the decision not to refer to it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para74"><a name="stpa_220">That could not be more explicit. That is cynical spin and manipulation of an important issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para75"><a name="stpa_221">Of course, a vast number of people are affected by this change. Some 4.7 million have opened Post Office card accounts and 6,500 make use of them every week in my constituency. Why have they proved so popular? Simply because they are based in the post office, an institution for which people have a great deal of trust and respect and which is simple to use.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 116WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para76"><a name="stpa_222">The card account contract, as it has been said, was worth more than &#163;1 billion over its term to post offices and without that income many of them could be forced to close. As Adam Crozier, the chief executive of the Royal Mail, has made clear up to 10,000 closures could be caused by the end of the Post Office card account and the removal of the social network payment, to which the hon. Member for Ogmore referred. Rural areas such as the Highlands, and deprived urban areas with high concentrations of benefit recipients, would be worst affected if that were to take place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para77"><a name="stpa_223">I should be interested to know from the Minister whether the approach to this is based on joined-up Government. We hear rhetoric about supporting post offices, but Departments seem to act contrarily. Have the Government made any estimate of how many post offices they would expect to close if the Post Office card account is withdrawn?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para78"><a name="stpa_224">The pilots, which have already been mentioned, are over, thank goodness, but not without considerable distress being caused to some of the people affected, as has been said. In one case that I have been informed of, a letter was sent informing the person that their pension would be switched to a bank account, without their consent, three days after the letter was received. No wonder the Government&#039;s approach to this matter has been seen in the poorest light possible so far.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para79"><a name="stpa_225">Given that the one of the main reasons for the popularity of the card account is that it is post office-based, surely it would have been better to allow the Post Office to develop its POCA product for 2010 onwards and included that option in the pilots. The risk is the Government will come back from the pilots and say, &quot;Ah yes, people are quite happy to switch from the POCA to a bank account, so there&#039;s no need to worry,&quot; especially because people in pilots were not informed of their right to keep a Post Office card account. I am concerned that the pilots are a hanging jury for the POCA, a test specifically set up for the Post Office to fail in order to justify cutting the support provided to post offices for receiving benefits and pensions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para80"><a name="stpa_226">Will the Minister commit today to making public the results of the evaluation of the pilot schemes in detail? Will he explain in his response the use that he intends to make of the pilots? Are there any plans for any further pilot schemes to be conducted? If so, have the Government learned the lessons from the lack of consultation on the pilots and the hostile reaction that they generated among many people?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para81"><a name="stpa_227">If the Government are still determined to abandon the Post Office card account and its nearly five million users, how will its phasing out be conducted, if they wish to honour the contract in full? That point has been made by other hon. Members. Will people who do not already have other arrangements in place simply have their Post Office card account closed and payments cancelled overnight in 2010, or, in order to satisfy the need to end the contract in 2010, will the accounts be withdrawn before that? What is the plan for phasing out the card account, if it is not to be continued?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para82"><a name="stpa_228">I concur with remarks made by other hon. Members in this debate. Why not build on the success of the Post Office card account, rather than remove it? After all, it has proved to be popular and attracted nearly five million users. What efforts have the Government made 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 117WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to work with the Post Office to develop and enhance the Post Office card account, perhaps in line with the POCA plus, as the hon. Member for Ogmore suggested, and perhaps by adding features to the card account in future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para83"><a name="stpa_229">It is worth pointing out, as the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) said in regard to debt, that one feature that most puts people off having a bank account, especially elderly people, is the idea of an overdraft and setting up a direct debit and running into debt. Of course, the banks make money by people getting into debt and paying interest, which is perhaps why the banks have shown less interest in this product. That will be a major concern, before adding too many new features to the Post Office card account plus.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para84"><a name="stpa_230">Adding features would allow customers to stay with the Post Office, which they trust, maintain vital income for post offices, so the services can continue to be provided in rural communities and allow customers to develop their use of banking-type services. If that happened, the nearly 5 million current card account users would not all have to go through the disruption and upset of changing accounts and there would be a smooth transition between the card account and the card account plus, rather than the Government saying to people, &quot;This ends now and you&#039;re going to have to make a choice about where you go from here&quot;, is a much better way to proceed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para85"><a name="stpa_231">Is not the offer of using a bank account at the post office a pretty hollow one, given that, as the Citizens Advice says, 60 per cent. of personal bank accounts are not accessible at the Post Office at the moment, including, for example, the Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS  and HSBC do not allow access to their main bank accounts at post offices? In that sense, as the hon. Member for Ogmore said, Post Office card accounts are good for financial inclusion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para86"><a name="stpa_232">Is not the real risk of abandoning the Post Office card account, rather than developing it, that, as Citizens Advice says,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;a new class of unbanked people&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para87"><a name="stpa_233">will be created? It is worth noting that 700,000 people currently still receive their benefits or pensions directly by giro payment. Is not the risk that that number could balloon even further, if the card account is ended without a suitable post office-based replacement being put in place well in advance?
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"><a name="60322h03_spnew37"><b> Willie Rennie  (Dunfermline and West Fife)</b>  (LD): I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. In Dunfermline and West Fife, we have 18 rural post offices, many of which are under threat, including some in former mining communities, like Blairhall and Oakley. However, a lot of the post offices are failing to invest, because of the uncertainty about the future. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Minister should address this uncertainty?
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"><a name="60322h03_spnew38"><b> Danny Alexander </b> : I am grateful for that intervention. I certainly agree that the Minister should do that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para88"><a name="stpa_234">In conclusion, I urge the Government to think through more clearly the impact on benefit claimants and pensioners of the change&#151;abandoning the Post Office card account&#151;and the impact on post offices. I urge the Minister to look seriously at the option of a

&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 118WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
seamless continuation, with an enhanced Post Office card account after 2010, rather than a disruptive process of ending the card account and asking people to go hither and thither into bank accounts. That would be good for customers and post offices. Most of all, I urge him to be upfront and straightforward about the process, rather than repeating the serial deception that we now know took place when the card account was introduced.

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="60322h03_spnew39"><b> Mr. David Ruffley  (Bury St. Edmunds)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), not just on securing this debate, but on a thoughtfully forensic contribution, which I think we all appreciated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para89"><a name="stpa_235">This is an important issue that will not go away. More than 350 signatories in this House have put their names to two early-day motions, marking out clear dissatisfaction with how the Department has handled this issue. The payment of benefits through POCAs is vital to any serious analysis of the future of the post office network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para90"><a name="stpa_236">Since the last POCA debate on 15 February, a rather important letter has been circulated to some hon. Members from the managing director of Post Office Ltd., Mr. Alan Cook, and I should like to read into the record some important points made by him
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">&quot;We were both surprised and disappointed to learn the Department for Work and Pensions had decided not to support the POCA after March 2010 . . . we were well aware, of course, that the contract&#151;like any other&#151;had an end date. But we expected all along that the contract would either be renewed or the POCA would be replaced with a similar product and would generate equivalent income for sub-postmasters and the network.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">We are also disappointed that the DWP has launched a series of pilot schemes to test ways of moving existing customers away from the POCA to other payment channels for receipt of their pensions and benefits, as well as not making the POCA available as a payment option to some new customers. The effect is to begin now a rundown of the POCA before the Post Office has had time to develop and introduce an alternative product.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para91"><a name="stpa_237">That has been the thrust of many Members&#039; arguments today. The letter goes on:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">&quot;The withdrawal of the POCA would mean that after 2010, less than 10 per cent. of the network&#039;s revenue would come from Government departments, in contrast to the position a decade ago when the majority of business transacted in our branches was Government business.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para92"><a name="stpa_238">Mr. Cook concludes:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">&quot;The Post Office network, which makes a loss of some &#163;2 million a week on its operations, currently derives &#163;200 million of revenue a year from the use of the card&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para93"><a name="stpa_239">The managing director himself has given us some understanding of the massive contribution made by the POCA to the turnover of sub-post offices. That, I suggest, is revenue that they can ill afford to lose.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para94"><a name="stpa_240">That letter leads me to the conclusion that Ministers have been guilty of at least leading on senior Post Office management for years. Ministers have created a sense of uncertainty among customers, many of whom, as we have heard, are old and vulnerable. Although Ministers have had plenty of opportunity to do so, they have not made clear what will replace the POCA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para95"><a name="stpa_241">What about the consumer and the customer? We all know that a key factor in people&#039;s decisions to opt for the POCA instead of a basic bank account has been the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 119WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
ability to withdraw benefit payments over the counter at the post office without any hassle. We know the problems with basic bank accounts. The hon. Member for Ogmore described in some detail that of 26 basic bank account products, about half had serious restrictions in respect of balance inquiries and the rest. The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) pointed out what we all know: a lot of banks are really not that interested in basic products. They will not extend a suite of options to users of basic bank accounts, even assuming that such accounts could be accessed at the sub-post office, whether in a village or an urban area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para96"><a name="stpa_242">In effect, Ministers are trying to kill off the POCA well before 2010. Without any real consultation, they have imposed three pilot schemes. We have heard about the unhappy situation of someone in the constituency of the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard), in my county of Suffolk, who was put to trouble by the letter he received as a result of being on one of those schemes. I shall not rehearse the details of the scheme, but one fact is key. I asked the Minister in respect of the POCA about when the three pilot schemes would be completed. I asked him
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">&quot;what plans he has to increase the number of people covered by these schemes.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para97"><a name="stpa_243">The Minister, who is here today, replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;The pilots.. will be concluded by mid-March. When they are completed we will evaluate the results and discuss the findings with the Post Office and other key stakeholders. I have no plans to increase the number of customers covered.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>; 14 March 2006, vol. 443, col. 2164W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para98"><a name="stpa_244">It seems from that answer that he is not going to do any more pilots, and that this will be the last word on test driving new ways of migrating people from the POCA to basic accounts. However, nowhere in anything the Minister has said today or in any parliamentary answer that I have seen is there any clue about when an announcement will be made about an alternative to the POCA, how much that would cost, what functionality it would have and what kind of revenues it would be likely to deliver to the sub-postmaster network that so desperately needs something like the POCA, never mind to the customers who want a replacement card.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para99"><a name="stpa_245">When the pilots have been properly evaluated, will the Minister have a public discussion, not just one with the Post Office behind closed doors? Will he publish all the results in respect of where he thinks the pilot leads us in the development and delivery of an alternative to the POCA, if that is what he has in mind? I also seek an assurance that he will not be doing any more piloting&#151;that he will get on with it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para100"><a name="stpa_246">The interim nature of the card has come as a surprise to a lot of us in the past few months; the cat has been let rather belatedly out of the bag. Will the Minister end the worry and concern caused to sub-postmasters and users of the POCA, and tell us today what will replace the POCA and when? If he cannot tell us today, will he tell us why not?

debate and on his excellent and thoughtful speech. The debate has been good, but will be a wee bit better if I can make a comprehensive response to all the points made by hon. Members. I say up front that I shall be rather less generous in giving way than last time. I want to give the reassurances that almost every hon. Member who has spoken has asked for, and I want to answer the questions that they have raised; I hope that that will be borne in mind as I proceed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para101"><a name="stpa_247">For the most part, the debate has rightly focused on the future. Now that the Post Office card account has been running for three years, we see that it fulfils the interim purpose for which it was designed&#151;namely, providing a very basic form of account for collecting benefit payments via a post office. It has been taken up by those who did not have any form of bank account, as well as by others who do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para102"><a name="stpa_248">However, three years into its operation, we can also see its significant limitations. That, too, has been broadly expected. Let me remind hon. Members of the preamble to the card account contract between the Post Office and the Government. I make no apology for repeating it; it is extremely important. The contract states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">&quot;Under the Government&#039;s present policy to combat social exclusion and in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government and minimise fraud, Benefits recipients will receive Benefits by Direct Credit. A POCA will complement the range of Bank Accounts available to customers; in particular, to promote a service to those who do not have or cannot otherwise obtain a Bank Account.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">The POCA is intended to be an interim step for Account Holders who will be encouraged by both Parties to migrate to Bank Accounts which provide services and opportunities not available through the POCA.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para103"><a name="stpa_249">To fulfil the undertaking in that contract, we, with Post Office Ltd, need to start to plan the range of products to be available from 2010, based on customers&#039; actual behaviour and requirements. That is the context into which the pilots fit; without doing the piloting work, we shall not know how to proceed with that migration in advance of 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para104"><a name="stpa_250">Let me reassure hon. Members who raised points, which I have been interested to hear, about the pilots. The pilots were discussed with the Post Office before they were commenced. The Post Office saw the letters that we sent out to customers in the pilots and raised no objections to them. As has been indicated already, the pilots have concluded; they finished on 10 March. We are now analysing their results. We shall discuss the results with the Post Office and, yes, I shall be more than happy to put those results into the public domain and report later to Parliament on them.

<p><a name="st_78"><a name="60322h03_spnew43"><b> Mr. Plaskitt </b> : No, no one has been misled about this matter. It was explicit in the contract right from the outset. Statements were made way back in 2003 at the launch&#151;Labour Members referred to this in terms of the Select Committee&#151;to the effect that it was too early to comment about what would succeed the POCA. In 2003, of course that was right, because it was just beginning its life. It has four more years to run and will last until 2010. That is why now is an appropriate time to start thinking about what will succeed it.

It is currently being piloted in Scotland. Some customers could be equally well served by a bank account that they can use at the Post Office. That would still generate income and footfall for the sub-postmaster. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore pointed out, if there is a larger switch from card account to post office-accessible bank account, the revenue stream for sub-postmasters might be higher than it is under a POCA. The migration is particularly important for them as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para106"><a name="stpa_252">Clearly, some people will still need a product like a POCA because they cannot manage, or perhaps do not wish to have, a bank account. Even in that area, we could do more for financial inclusion if the replacement products were better targeted on the unbanked and perhaps offered some services that the POCA does not, such as the ability to pay in cash and cheques. None of that will happen overnight. The POCA still has several years to run, but the responsible thing to do now is to start planning for the world of 2010 and beyond. That is exactly what we, and the Post Office, should be doing, and are doing; it is what we are jointly contracted to do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para107"><a name="stpa_253">There is no doubt that the post office network faces real challenges. We want to work with the Post Office to help it meet those challenge and seize the opportunities available to it. The world of financial services has changed dramatically in the past decade alone and is continuing to evolve. The expectations of customers and the way that they want to do their business have changed enormously and will continue to change. There is a trend towards a cashless society, including the increased use of direct debit, the internet and e-mail, which means that we also need to respond to the service requirements of increasingly sophisticated customers in a changing world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para108"><a name="stpa_254">Technological and other improvements are opening up completely new ways of doing business and leading to a further transformation in lifestyles and customer preferences. As hon. Members have said in this debate, that has already had a very significant impact on the Post Office. Post offices are no longer places where people just cash their benefits or pensions; they buy lottery tickets, insurance and foreign currency, top up their mobile phones and take out loans in post offices. Responding to that, the Post Office continues to develop and actively promote new products, in competition with other providers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para109"><a name="stpa_255">The challenge for the Post Office is to provide a range of high-quality services that people want to use, and to do so in the context of that rapidly evolving customer base, and in the context of a crowded field of financial service providers. We would like every Department for

Work and Pensions customer who has a POCA to continue to do their banking at the Post Office if that is what they want.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para110"><a name="stpa_256">We want to work with the Post Office to plan how we can best manage the change and ensure that we are delivering services that will match evolving customer demand. The Government&#039;s commitment to the Post Office&#151;every single one of us understands its importance in our communities&#151;is clearly confirmed by our record of support. We have invested more than &#163;2 billion since 1999 to help the Post Office develop its services and have made available &#163;750 million to support the rural network, as a result of which the rate of rural closures has slowed dramatically.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para111"><a name="stpa_257">The Government have also provided &#163;500 million to help computerise the entire network, which enables the Post Office to tap into new markets and open up its counters to those 20 million bank customers. I understand why in the context of this debate there is a heavy concentration on the 4 million or so POCA users. We should bear in mind, as the Post Office should, that 20 million bank customers have accounts that are potentially accessible at post offices. That is an even bigger market to go after. Many of those customers are probably unaware that their bank account could be accessed through a post office. That represents a campaign to be taken up by the Post Office in addition to the current issue about the POCA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para112"><a name="stpa_258">The Government want a post office network that can prosper on the basis of today and tomorrow&#039;s needs.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"><a name="60322h03_spnew44"><b> Mr. Blizzard </b> : Will the Minister say how many of the 4 million POCA customers were involved in the pilots? Were those involved spread across the whole country or were they concentrated in certain areas?
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"><a name="60322h03_spnew45"><b> Mr. Plaskitt </b> : Some 30,000 POCA customers were involved in the pilots; geographically, they were spread across the entire country. I wanted to let my hon. Friend come back in on this matter, because I wanted specifically to reply to the point he made in an earlier intervention. He talked about the way in which a constituent was spoken to by an official. As far as I am concerned, that should not have happened and I am grateful that he has drawn my attention to the matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para113"><a name="stpa_259">The Post Office is already developing new banking and savings products that will be suitable for some existing POCA customers. In addition, appropriate products must be in place for vulnerable customers when the POCA contract ends in 2010. We will work with Post Office Ltd to ensure that such accounts are available. The Post Office&#039;s own research shows that POCA customers are far from a homogenous group. They range from some vulnerable groups to those who do not depend on their pension or child benefit but who still let large balances build up in their card accounts, despite the fact that they pay no interest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para114"><a name="stpa_260">It is likely, therefore, that as we look to 2010 and beyond there will be a range of accounts. For some people, using an existing bank account might well be the right answer. Most of the big banks offer basic bank accounts, as has been mentioned, which are very similar in their day-to-day operation to a POCA, and all with post office accessibility.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para115"><a name="stpa_261">I have explained how the Government support the Post Office. I have also tried to stress that this debate is not taking place against a static background. If the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 123WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Post Office stands still in the range of financial products that it offers, it will be left behind. If the Government and the Post Office work together to honour the contract to which we were joint signatories in 2003 and to develop further products, that would be the correct response. If we do not do so, it will pitch post offices into a far worse position in 2010, than if we were to start working now in anticipation of the contract&#039;s expiry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para116"><a name="stpa_262">I repeat that there is opportunity for the Post Office. That has not just been recognised by me, as a Minister in the DWP, but by Tricia Jenkins, who is the National President of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. At its conference last year, she said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">&quot;POCA does indeed have a limited life. When it finishes, we hope to convert existing POCA customers into using another Post Office Ltd service . . . and, since we&quot;&#151;</p>

<p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60">&quot;can offer a banking service, we would like to think we can keep those customers. So it is &#039;all change&#039; in 2010, but it will not necessarily be . . . bad news.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para118"><a name="stpa_264">Undue pessimism and scare stories suggesting that, as a consequence of the current POCA contract ending in 2010, thousands of post offices will close and that customers will no longer be able to collect their benefit or pension at the post office, are not only totally misleading but, by spreading unfounded fears, are not in the Post Office&#039;s interests. We want to work with the Post Office and in the best interests of our joint customers, but it is important that the Post Office makes rapid progress in developing its own new products so that they are in place, and established, when customers need them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h03_para119"><a name="stpa_265">We are ending the Government funding for the POCA in March 2010, as was always planned. People will still be able to collect their benefit or pension at the post office, as was always promised. If customers continue to use post offices, that will help them to stay open. Crucial to achieving all of that is having the right products in place at the right time. That is why we are working with the Post office to bring that about.

<a name="60322h04_head0"><h3 align=center>MOD Llangennech</h3>
<a name="time_18">
<a name="60322h04_time0"><h5>4 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60322h04_spnew0"><b> Nia Griffith  (Llanelli)</b>  (Lab): I have asked for this debate because there is still a good deal of confusion about exactly what is happening at MOD Llangennech, and staff at Llangennech have a number of concerns.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para0"><a name="stpa_266">First, we need to understand that there are several different sections at Llangennech: forms and publications, commodity management; forms and publications, storage and distribution; civilian records; the print facility; and timber and metals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para1"><a name="stpa_267">We then need to understand what has happened so far. In the process of the future defence supply chain initiative, two private consortia&#151;BAE Systems and DML&#151;bid for the parts of the defence supply chain and lost against a bid from the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency, or DSDA. DSDA therefore retained the work, but, as part of the bid, it planned on outsourcing &quot;non-core&quot; activity. Most of Llangennech&#039;s work is non-core as, in the main, the centre stores, distributes and commodity-manages paper. The forms and publications section employs the largest number of staff&#151;it employs the majority of the staff at Llangennech.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para2"><a name="stpa_268">As part of the FDSCI process, bids were originally put in for this work by consortia such as BAE and partners. It was won by an in-house bid that proposed closing the Llangennech site and transferring the work to other Ministry of Defence sites. As part of the bid, DSDA also planned on outsourcing non-core activity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para3"><a name="stpa_269">The MOD has enabling contracts with the private sector&#151;with Astron to carry out print tasks, and with TNT for records storage. The print contract is being re-let and has been extended to include forms and publications storage, including the commodity management thereof. Astron has in the past done single tasks for the MOD. It now appears that, by means of an extended contract, it is being given the opportunity to take over the work of the print unit. That is happening without any formal bidding procedure. Furthermore, Astron is also now being given the opportunity to take over the forms and publications section. Again, that is being done by means of an extended contract.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para4"><a name="stpa_270">The Minister has stated that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;our consideration will examine the cost-effectiveness of retaining the work at Llangennech&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para5"><a name="stpa_271">If the work is now being given to the private company Astron&#151;rather than just being kept in-house&#151;the work force at Llangennech would like to know if they could also put in a bid to do the work. To create a level playing field, it is not sufficient that the charges Astron is proposing for the work should be compared with the existing costs at Llangennech. The work force should have the opportunity to look into potential savings and then put together a professional, competitive bid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para6"><a name="stpa_272">In the original bidding process, the bidders&#151;BAE and DML&#151;headed up consortia which included distribution companies. Realistically, they had to be consortia in order to provide the full coverage of the service. Astron is being given the work as a single company. It subcontracts its work. However, it is unclear whether Astron is either able or entitled to undertake the distribution of the MOD&#039;s printed 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 125WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
matter. The MOD&#039;s in-house distribution network covers all parts of the globe. Moreover, the distribution element was included in the bidding process under the FDSCI. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify whether the cost to the MOD of the work carried out by Astron includes distribution to all theatres&#151;the Falklands, Afghanistan, and the middle east. As the Minister will be aware, initial plans by Westland to undertake distribution were hastily abandoned when it realised the scale, the complexity, the cost and the legal difficulties of distributing to destinations such as foreign embassies. Given that for legal reasons&#151;customs law&#151;Westland was unable to distribute outside the UK, I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify whether Astron is in a position to undertake distribution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para7"><a name="stpa_273">A further issue arises: by handing the work over to one firm with no competitive bidding procedure, is the MOD really getting value for money? What happens if one of the unsuccessful bidders, such as BAE, complains that the work is now being given to a private company that did not bid for it in the first place? Although both DML and BAE lost out on the FDSCI, both Astron and TNT&#151;but especially Astron&#151;stand to benefit from its outcome without having to bid directly. It is difficult to see how DSDA can win an in-house bid on the one hand, thereby demonstrating value for money, and yet not represent the value for money option in terms of forms and publications storage, commodity management, print and the storage of civilian records. How can DSDA store other material more cheaply than the private sector and yet not the material stored at Llangennech?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para8"><a name="stpa_274">The process may well be perfectly legal, but it still does not seem to be very transparent. Effectively, DSDA, with an in-house bid, is giving work to a private company without any bidding process. What the staff at Llangennech are saying is this: &quot;As the work is now going out to private tender, we would like the opportunity to bid for it; we would like to know exactly what the specification is, and we would like to use our expertise to put in a bid that will offer value for money to the MOD.&quot; Staff at Llangennech are more than willing to look into ways to effect cost savings and to put together a competitive bid. The staff at Llangennech have already been directly involved in making their work more efficient. They have been piloting the use of IT, which, with proper support services provided by skilled personnel, could lead to further savings for the MOD. This is going out to the private sector. It is not therefore contributing to the consolidation of services at Bicester or Donnington, which was one reason given for the move to close Llangennech.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para9"><a name="stpa_275">On the print unit, past experience does not suggest that a private company would be any cheaper than an in-house bid from Llangennech. For example, I understand that Astron charged &#163;800,000 for an initial distribution&#151;an initial distribution without the differentiated follow-up of items, equalling less than 1 per cent. of the total inventory. It may be that, in an initial contract with a private provider, the MOD does not want the full capacity of the current print unit at Llangennech, which has recently enlarged to cope with the extra work from Keynsham, notably the production of defence instruction notices.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 126WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para10"><a name="stpa_276">The MOD may only want a specified volume of work as a core contract, with the option to buy in extra. The print unit in Llangennech needs to know that if it is to work out a comparable business plan; it needs to know what the core volume of work is and have some indication as to the likelihood of additional work. It has a service that could be marketed commercially to make up for any shortfall in the work coming from the MOD, but it needs time to draw up a business plan and do the necessary marketing, if it is to retain its current capacity through bringing in work from sources other than a potential MOD contract. Currently staffing levels at the print unit have been inflated by the appointment last August of five extra temporary staff to cover the work brought over from Keynsham. Just calculating the current cost of the print unit with the price that a private company produces to a specification is not comparing like with like.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para11"><a name="stpa_277">To ensure that the MOD, and ultimately the taxpayer, is getting the best value for money, if the intention is to outsource the print unit work, then it would be foolish not to look at an in-house bid from Llangennech, as that bid could provide the best value for money. Otherwise, the MOD would be missing a bargain, and the taxpayer would be paying the price.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para12"><a name="stpa_278">Nine staff work in civilian records. It appears that DSDA intends to put that work out to contract to TNT, despite the fact that it was out of the scope of the FDSCI. There is a precedent in outsourcing here, as TNT has had a contract for outsourcing military records. Staff at Llangennech need to know if civilian records are being outsourced, and they need to know what the specification is&#151;whether the same level of service is required as the current levels provide, or whether the MOD is looking for a slimmed down service with less access to records. What is unacceptable to staff at Llangennech, and should be unacceptable to the taxpayer, is to find that the work has just been given to a private company with no transparency about what that company bid for, and no opportunity for any other company or the staff themselves to bid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para13"><a name="stpa_279">As we understand it, the classified section would not be a candidate for privatisation, for reasons of national security. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para14"><a name="stpa_280">The timbers and metals section takes up a large proportion of the ground space at Llangennech; it is what many people think of when they think of Llangennech. However, the actual number of employees in the section&#151;16&#151;is a small proportion of the total work force. There seem to be some very confused messages about what exactly is happening to this section. There seems to be a lot of coming and going. It has just been announced that all air metals from Stafford are to be moved to Llangennech. However, if Llangennech is to close, how long will they be staying there? Is that the best use of taxpayers&#039; money? Propellers left Llangennech the other day and went to Bicester, but when they arrived at Bicester there was no room so they had to go to Donnington.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para15"><a name="stpa_281">There is a unique lifting capacity at Llangennech: what might be called a very large crane. I understand that the plan is to move it to a shed at Bicester. It will fit into the shed, but only as long as it does not try to lift anything. Quite how useful that will be, I do not know. The former chief executive of DSDA had high hopes for 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 127WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the 20-ton crane at ABRO, Donnington. However, it was announced today that ABRO is to continue for another 4 years, so it will need to keep its crane for its work. That means that the only heavy-lift facility defence storage has left is at Llangennech, where there is a 40-ton crane and a 20-ton crane. Staff would like to be reassured that a thorough assessment has been made of the capacity at the various sites and that there is a clear comprehensive plan for all the storage needed. We do not want to see propellers whizzing around the country only to find, like some surreal, but expensive game of musical chairs, that there is no space left for a propeller at the end.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para16"><a name="stpa_282">I understand that consideration has been given to opening up the mothballed site B at Bicester. Opening up a site that has not been used for some time will obviously be costly with regard to health and safety, in ensuring that all appliances are working properly and in terms of maintenance, such as minor repairs. The issue is whether that provides the best value for money when we have a working site in Llangennech.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para17"><a name="stpa_283">I would like to thank the Minister for his assurances about support for staff and their families in the event of closure at Llangennech. There may be some staff whose age and personal circumstances mean that they would be very interested in finishing and taking severance pay. However, for many the severance pay, although it might initially look tempting, would be no substitute for a regular income. What would be really galling would be to see the Ministry of Defence paying large sums of money to the private sector for the work currently done at Llangennech, when the staff know that they could have provided the same service or a better service more cheaply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para18"><a name="stpa_284">The staff would have a strong vested interest in ensuring that the work is done superbly well in order to keep the contracts for the future because they would have written the bids themselves, and because their private companies would have been formed specifically to do MOD work. A private company for which an MOD contract was just one small section of its operation might have much less motivation in ensuring that the job was done well. It might end up subcontracting the work with little quality control, with possible embarrassing consequences for the MOD.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para19"><a name="stpa_285">If the MOD decides to reduce the Llangennech site to a trailer drop point and get rid of the land, serious consideration should be given to what price the land would fetch. Would it not be better for the MOD to sell off land in parts of southern England where it would fetch a much better price and help to alleviate the shortage of brownfield sites available for much-needed housing? Perhaps the MOD would prefer to rent out the space at Llangennech, but the income generated would be limited. There is already a large amount of warehousing space only a few hundred yards away from Llangennech that has been lying empty for ages. If the MOD is to provide the taxpayer with value for money, it makes better sense to rent out facilities for income generation in southern England where the returns are much greater.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para20"><a name="stpa_286">In an ideal world, we would not need to go through the upheaval of change and there are many who would prefer not to be talking about privatising our defence supply chain. However, given that change is necessary and that the chosen way forward involves outsourcing, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 128WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to ensure that we get value for money for the MOD and the taxpayer, the existing work force should be given every opportunity to compete on a level playing field for the work. That is the only way that we can ensure fair play for all concerned: the work force, the MOD and the taxpayer.

<a name="60322h04_para21"><a name="stpa_287">A number of my constituents are also employed at MOD Llangennech. When Llangennech representatives invited me to visit the site, I walked round it and met the people on the ground, and I was enormously impressed by the dedication of staff and what they told me. The people there said exactly what my hon. Friend said in the last few minutes: the proposal to transfer the various sections of work out of Llangennech is wrong, because we will end up with work being done less efficiently, less effectively and probably at far greater cost.

<a name="60322h04_para22"><a name="stpa_288">The people at Llangennech and the units of the armed forces that they serve&#151;their customers, if you like&#151;have not been involved in or even properly consulted about the proposal. That is just plain wrong. We should remember that Llangennech has an excellent performance record throughout its sections. It has led the way in employment of information technology, as my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli mentioned. It has a wealth of staff expertise that the MOD really should not be prepared to lose. It has always been extremely economical to run and in 2003 it was the only site to meet its financial targets for three consecutive years. My hon. Friend is right: there is a compelling case in economic and organisational terms to allow the staff to bid for the work that they already do so well. There is also a case on the basis of natural justice.

Our servicemen are among the best equipped and supported in the world and the measures and programmes that the Government have put in place will ensure that they remain so in the future. One such measure is the future defence supply chain initiative, which was launched in 2002 with the aim of assessing a range of options for managing and operating the defence supply chain to reduce costs of ownership, while maintaining or improving service levels and enhancing operational capability.

That option was chosen as it offered the best balance between delivering improved logistic support to operations and achieving better value for money for taxpayers. The solution, together with the improvements that are being introduced across the supply chain, including monitoring and tracking the movements of military supplies, will result in the United Kingdom having a world-class military supply chain, dedicated to ensuring that the support provided to soldiers, sailors and aircrew operating on the front line is second to none, which must be our prime objective.

Overall, implementation of the initiative is expected to make savings of over &#163;50 million per year by 2010 and more than &#163;441 million over the next 10 years. As my hon. Friends will recognise, those are precious resources that we need to free up for use elsewhere.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para26"><a name="stpa_292">Under the &quot;do different&quot; proposal, three storage and distribution centres are expected to close: Stafford by 2007, Llangennech by mid-2008 and Longtown by mid-2009. There will be further streamlining at other establishments. In addition, the defence regional distribution centres, including the one at Llangennech, will convert to trailer drop points by 2009&#150;10. That means that when goods arrive at the distribution centres, they will no longer be unloaded and placed in a warehouse. Instead the trailer body will be removed and swapped to another trailer before being transported to its final destination, which will minimise double handling in the majority of cases, improve transit times and result in a more effective use of MOD&#039;s estate and vehicles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para27"><a name="stpa_293">The closure at Llangennech alone will bring savings of more than &#163;5 million per annum, and closure will affect all of the activities carried out at Llangennech. I can confirm that a project team has been assembled to look into the print, storage and distribution of forms, civilian personnel records, metal stockholding and wood, bar and tube cutting activities. The project team will look at outsourcing the functions, or moving the business to an alternative DSDA site or another MOD department. It is not true, as I believe has been rumoured, that decisions have already been taken to outsource those services. The review process is at a comparatively early stage. Indeed, detailed planning and reporting dates have yet to be agreed. I can assure my hon. Friends that the trade unions are being given every opportunity to participate in that work. My hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli has made a number of proposals for involving the trade unions in more detail, and possibly involving them in the future operation of the site. Those proposals, if put to us, will be considered. We are considering all issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para28"><a name="stpa_294">The value for money issue is crucial to us, and there will be full consultation with the trade unions. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

will keep all interested parties informed. Should my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli seek a meeting to develop any of her arguments with him directly, I have no doubt that having read the <i>Hansard </i>record of today&#039;s proceedings, he would agree to meet her.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para29"><a name="stpa_295">Turning back to the implications of the future defence supply chain initiative, I fully understand the consequences of those changes for the future employment of MOD staff. The decision to move to the implementation of that important initiative is in no way a reflection of the contribution that the work force in the supply chain have made. I know that there is some uncertainty among them, but I also acknowledge the loyal and dedicated service our people have given to the Ministry of Defence over the years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para30"><a name="stpa_296">In overall terms, the new supply chain organisation will require around 2,000 fewer posts, the majority of which are occupied by civilians. We estimate that about half those reductions will be achieved through natural wastage and the majority of the remainder will come through voluntary early release. Some compulsory redundancies will be necessary, but the intention is to keep them to a minimum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para31"><a name="stpa_297">There may be some opportunities for staff to transfer to other MOD sites or other Departments. A staff preference exercise will be undertaken and the MOD will liaise with Jobcentre Plus in the lead up to the closure. Team Wales has done fantastic work in circumstances like those that we face at Llangennech. The trades unions were kept fully informed and consulted throughout the planning phase of the future defence supply chain initiative, and they continue to be involved during its implementation. We would want that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para32"><a name="stpa_298">Looking more specifically at Llangennech, as the rundown progresses there will be a gradual transfer of inventory and stock within existing sites, with a corresponding gradual reduction in staff numbers. It is anticipated that natural wastage will account for some reductions, and there may be opportunities for relocation to other MOD sites. However, some redundancies will be unavoidable. At present the number is estimated to be 120 from both the defence storage and distribution centre and the defence regional distribution centre.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para33"><a name="stpa_299">The MOD outplacement service will be available to support staff and spouses affected by the reductions at the site, offering support with relocation, financial advice and preparation for alternative employment. Training will be available to assist staff with transition to life in the private sector, and the services of the MOD welfare organisation will be available also to help staff with their personal circumstances. Redundancy payments and pension entitlements will be in accordance with the civil service compensation scheme and the principal civil service pension schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para34"><a name="stpa_300">It has been decided that the transformation can be achieved by the DSDA remaining an Executive agency, but with a revised framework document. That document will give the appropriate freedoms and delegations to the agency&#039;s management team, allowing it to complete the transformation plan. In the third year, &quot;Do Different&quot; will be reviewed, as the plan is to have completed the bulk of the transformation by that point.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 131WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para35"><a name="stpa_301">Changes will include reinforcing the senior management team. In addition the DSDA work force will receive significant amounts of training with the subsequent multi-skilling, providing greater flexibility and effectiveness. With improvements in processing, such as selecting for destination from the warehouse, much less double handling and, hence, fewer process costs will be incurred.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para36"><a name="stpa_302">I want to pay tribute to the contribution that the staff at Llangennech have made and continue to make to the work of their agency and to defence. These are very difficult, trying and uncertain times for them, and I fully recognise the very powerful case argued by my hon. Friends the Members for Llanelli and for Gower in defence of the work force. My hon. Friends are doing what is perfectly proper, and they championed their constituents in an exemplary way. However, I must emphasise once more that the changes taking place at Llangennech are in no way a commentary on the expertise or effectiveness of the staff. They have been fantastic. I should like to underline the fact that we are doing all we can to support them at this time when their future is uncertain.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para37"><a name="stpa_303">It is always a difficult decision to implement staff reductions and site closures. But we must do what is right for defence as a whole, and we remain convinced that the implementation of future defence supply chain initiatives, and the benefits that they will bring, are firmly in the national interest. Having said that, I shall certainly read the <i>Hansard </i>record of today&#039;s proceedings and take into account the comments of my hon. Friends. I have no doubt that if they were to seek a meeting with our right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, he would meet them to explore the issues that they have raised and, perhaps, give them further reassurance that, as we take the agenda forward, we are trying to involve everybody&#151;the trade unions in particular&#151;in discussions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h04_para38"><a name="stpa_304">It is not an easy time for us, and it is certainly not an easy time for the people involved. I fully appreciate that. However, I want my hon. Friends to know that we shall do everything possible to make this difficult decision effective in the interests of defence, while being sensitive to its consequences for the people whom my hon. Friends have represented so well this afternoon.

<a name="time_21">
<a name="60322h05_time0"><h5>4.26 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_84"><a name="60322h05_spnew0"><b> Danny Alexander  (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)</b>  (LD): It is a pleasure to return to the Chamber so soon after the last occasion on which the Minister and I were here. I hope that this debate will allow me to speak a little more slowly, because I have more time this time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para0"><a name="stpa_305">I am grateful for being granted this debate about the important issue of my constituent Holly Mackintosh. It is an opportunity to raise an unfair situation that affects a constituent through the operation of the Child Support Agency enforcement process. Although I have been an MP for less than a year, I have had the opportunity to discuss this case with colleagues and it seems to be unique. It is causing distress to my constituent, with whom I have had several discussions about it, and it is also damaging the welfare of her eight-year-old daughter. It raises issues about natural justice, to which I shall return.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para1"><a name="stpa_306">It may be helpful if I set out the circumstances of the case. Holly Mackintosh is of good character. She is a very hard-working mother, struggling to make ends meet to support her family. She has a daughter&#151;Joanna, who is now eight years old&#151;with her former partner, Mr. Neil Hampson. They purchased a house in Harbour street in Nairn in October 1995. In 2002, they separated and Mr. Hampson stopped residing at the Harbour street residence. Up to then, Mrs. Mackintosh had paid all mortgage repayments and the deposit on the house. She has the documents to confirm that, and she has been in correspondence with the CSA about that matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para2"><a name="stpa_307">In April 2003, an inhibition order was registered on the house by the CSA, as Mr. Hampson was in arrears to the CSA for &#163;25,890 of maintenance payments. They were owed to his ex-wife, Mrs. Macpherson, for the two sons that he had from that relationship.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para3"><a name="stpa_308">In 2004, the title of the property was transferred solely to Mrs. Mackintosh. That should have been done earlier, since it merely formalised the position that had obtained since their separation in 2002. It was only after the process was complete that she learned that an inhibition order was in place. At the time of separation, several issues were at play which caused the delay, not least the shortage of cash for paying lawyers bills and so on. Indeed, as part of the agreement to transfer the property to her name, she also took sole responsibility for the &#163;247 of monthly repayments on a joint loan that she and Mr. Hampson had taken to help repay debts that he owed to the Inland Revenue. That was done, as it were, in lieu of buying out his share of the property; although given that she had paid both the deposit and the mortgage repayments throughout the time that they owned the property, any interest that he had in it was not financial, but purely on paper.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para4"><a name="stpa_309">Miss Mackintosh has now been served with a disposition order seeking to maintain the CSA&#039;s claim on part of the value of the property to recover Mr. Hampson&#039;s maintenance arrears. His arrears now stand at &#163;55,093, according to a phone call that my office made to the CSA MP hotline today. The inhibition order seeks to recover the &#163;25,890, plus legal costs.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 133WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para5"><a name="stpa_310">The case gets more complicated. In January 2005, Miss Mackintosh submitted a claim to the CSA to recover maintenance payments from Mr. Hampson&#151;the same man&#151;for their daughter. The Government try to encourage private agreements between partners before going to the CSA, but a private agreement that he made with Miss Mackintosh at the time of their separation in 2002 to pay &#163;20 a week had not been honoured. As I discovered from a call to the CSA MP hotline today, Miss Mackintosh&#039;s claim has still not even been assessed, more than a year after it was first    made. She delayed the claim, perhaps quite understandably given what has happened since, because she simply had no faith in the CSA process. Any MP will know that that perception is by no means unique among our constituents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para6"><a name="stpa_311">To complicate matters further, Mr. Hampson recently left the United Kingdom and moved to New Zealand. Notice of the disposition order has not been served on Mr. Hampson, because he is resident overseas&#151;for the moment, at least. That adds a further complication to the CSA&#039;s quite legitimate work to recover maintenance from Mr. Hampson.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para7"><a name="stpa_312">The situation has had a quite devastating impact on my constituent, Holly Mackintosh. As she wrote in letter to the chairman of the CSA shortly before she contacted me:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62">&quot;I have a very hectic life and the situation you have put me in is causing serious distress. I am employed by British Airways as cabin crew. I have two daughters aged 16 and 7 years. I am a single parent and have always provided for my children and honoured my bills. I thought the CSA were in place to protect women like myself, but now I find my home in jeopardy, everything I&#039;ve worked for being in vain and yet again being responsible for my ex partner&#039;s debt.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para8"><a name="stpa_313">The situation impacts not only on Miss Mackintosh, but on her daughters&#151;her elder daughter, whom she will be supporting as a student, and her eight-year-old daughter from her previous relationship with Mr. Hampson. When the CSA&#039;s enforcement action lets the absent parent off scot-free after he has left the country and damages the welfare of a child for whom the CSA has failed to collect maintenance, something has gone very wrong indeed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para9"><a name="stpa_314">I undertook correspondence with the CSA following a parliamentary question that I tabled on its use of inhibition orders. The deputy chief executive of the CSA wrote to me on 22 July 2005:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63">&quot;As a bill of inhibition is registered against an individual, we are unable to provide any figures as to whether the individual&#039;s property is owned partially, or wholly, by another party. However, it follows that a bill of inhibition registered against a non-resident parent whose home is wholly owned by another party would be ineffective.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para10"><a name="stpa_315">In a subsequent letter he clarified that his comment would not apply to Miss Mackintosh&#039;s case, as the inhibition order was in place before she took full possession of the property. I have explained the circumstances under which that took place. In all justice, she should be considered the complete owner of the property throughout.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para11"><a name="stpa_316">However, given that Miss Mackintosh separated from Mr. Hampson in 2002, a year before the inhibition order was registered, it was only an accident of timing 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 134WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that has left her in her current position. It is understandable, given the circumstances of the breakdown of the relationship, that other matters would have been a priority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para12"><a name="stpa_317">It is not for me simply to come here and set out the facts of the case; I am interested in the Minister&#039;s view on it. There are several matters that he might consider in relation to it. I appreciate that my constituent will have the Minister&#039;s sympathy, but one or two things could be done in addition to giving sympathy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para13"><a name="stpa_318">Section 42 of the Child Support Act 1991 makes allowances for special cases to be addressed. Subsection (1) states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">&quot;The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that in prescribed circumstances a case is to be treated as a special case for the purposes of this Act.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para14"><a name="stpa_319">Subsection (2) states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65">&quot;Those regulations may, for example, provide for the following to be special cases&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para15"><a name="stpa_320">Subsection (2)(d) gives one such special case:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">&quot;a person is an absent parent in relation to more than one child and the other parent of . . . those children is not the same person&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para16"><a name="stpa_321">This case is so unusual that I urge the Minister to consider using that power in relation to this case. It would be unfair of me to expect him to respond to that now. I do not expect him to promise to use it, as I understand that the matter requires some investigation and consideration, but I ask for his assurance that he will consider the case closely and thoroughly investigate the possibility of using that power. Assuming that he is willing to do that&#151;I look forward to his response&#151;I would be grateful if he kept me informed. He may certainly call on me to provide whatever assistance he requires to ensure that he has all the necessary information regarding the situation faced by Holly Mackintosh.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para17"><a name="stpa_322">The Minister might be able to help in another way. I hope that he will clarify this point. The Secretary of State is named as the pursuer of the inhibition order. Is the Secretary of State required by the Act to take that form of enforcement action or does he have discretion to use that power? If the latter is the case, I request that he should proceed by other means and remove the inhibition order on Holly Mackintosh&#039;s home.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para18"><a name="stpa_323">Now that there is a review going on of the CSA and the broader question of its reform&#151;the Minister and I have debated that issue in previous circumstances, and I do not intend to go into that debate now&#151;the Secretary of State has suggested that a substantial amount of the debt owed to the CSA will inevitably have to be written off. I understand the reasons for that, given the broader debate on reform of the CSA, but if that is to be the case, the most unfair debt and unjust consequences, such as those faced by Holly Mackintosh, should be amongst the first to be addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para19"><a name="stpa_324">Having said that, I want to make it clear that it is neither my intention nor that of Holly Mackintosh that Mr. Hampson should escape his maintenance liabilities or his responsibilities. Indeed, the main purpose of the whole debate on the CSA and its reform is to make it more effective in dealing with absent parents and making them live up to their responsibilities and pay out for their children. My purpose is to ensure fairness for Holly Mackintosh and, most importantly, her daughter.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 135WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para20"><a name="stpa_325">If the inhibition order can be removed, Holly Mackintosh and I&#151;and, I am sure, the Minister&#151;would like Mr. Hampson to be vigorously pursued to pay his debts and discharge his responsibilities. That option might be harder for the CSA, but expecting the mother of a child to pay the debts of the absent father seems to me exactly the opposite of what the Child Support Agency was set up to do. It goes against justice in this case, against the spirit of the legislation and, indeed, against the spirit of what Parliament would wish to do to see the reformed CSA, or whatever may follow it, continue in its work. I would be grateful for the Minister&#039;s response and, I hope, persistence in seeking a fairer outcome for Holly Mackintosh.
</p>


<a name="time_22">
<a name="60322h05_time1"><h5>4.40 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_85"><a name="60322h05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. James Plaskitt) </b> : Mr. Weir, it is a pleasure to appear before you a second time this afternoon and to continue to debate with the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander). I congratulate him on securing this debate on a subject of obvious importance to his constituent, who is fortunate to have such an assiduous local Member who will pursue her case to such a degree and bring it to the attention of Ministers in the House of Commons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para21"><a name="stpa_326">The agency has fully briefed me on the particular case, which is indeed very complex, as the hon. Gentleman has rightly set out this afternoon. I am more than happy to discuss it with him, but I am sure that he will appreciate that I am subject to some constraints on how far I can go. I also welcome the opportunity to debate child support issues more broadly, and to draw on the problems that Holly&#039;s case illustrates and to discuss, in the context of that, how we plan to take further steps towards improving the agency&#039;s operation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para22"><a name="stpa_327">As the case illustrates, the CSA often finds itself trying to deal with the complex and changeable personal circumstances of its clients&#151;both parents with care and non-resident parents. In some cases, such as this one, we have to strike a balance between the competing needs of children from two or more families, which can be quite difficult. Ms Mackintosh is rightly concerned about making sure that her ex-partner meets his financial responsibility to her family. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman emphasised that point. She is also caught up in the consequences of her ex-partner not meeting his responsibilities to his children from a previous relationship.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para23"><a name="stpa_328">Ms Mackintosh&#039;s ex-partner had children from a previous relationship but failed to pay the maintenance for those children that had been assessed by the CSA. The agency attempted to recover the money owed and eventually, as part of the enforcement action, a bill of inhibition was gained against any property that her ex-partner owned, including the property he jointly owned with Ms Mackintosh. A bill of inhibition stops the future sale or transfer of any heritable property. Heritable property includes houses, garages, business premises and land. The non-resident parent cannot sell or transfer the heritable property until they pay the debt.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para24"><a name="stpa_329">Such a method of collecting debt is not exclusive to the agency. Many other financial institutions used the method to ensure that people meet their obligations. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 136WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The measure is clearly not the first that anyone would use to recover outstanding debts but it is an important tool in getting people finally to face up to what they owe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para25"><a name="stpa_330">As the hon. Gentleman anticipated, I do have sympathy with Ms Mackintosh as the bill of inhibition on the property where she lives does not relate to anything she has done wrong. I believe that Ms Mackintosh contacted the agency through her solicitors both before and after the transfer of the property into her sole name to ask if the bill of inhibition could be removed. On both occasions she was informed that the bill of inhibition would still stand. Our legal advice was clear: transferring the property was against the terms of the bill of inhibition. So, even though she has my sympathy, I believe that the agency took the only realistic action. We have to balance the interests of Ms Mackintosh with those of the children of the earlier relationship.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para26"><a name="stpa_331">The reason we use a bill of inhibition in Scotland, or a charging order in England and Wales, is to recover money that is owed for child support. Non-resident parents, such as Ms Mackintosh&#039;s ex-partner, should not be allowed to avoid their responsibilities to their children simply by transferring assets to someone else. If we allowed that, it would be even more difficult for the CSA to collect money owed and, consequently, even less money would be provided to support children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para27"><a name="stpa_332">The hon. Gentleman may want me to deal with the section 42 points. I am coming to those. In my view, the agency is not doing anything wrong in this case. It is using the same methods as other financial institutions in trying to recover an outstanding debt.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para28"><a name="stpa_333">The hon. Gentleman referred to section 42 of the Child Support Act 1991, which allows the Secretary of State to make regulations in prescribed circumstances for special cases. That section applies to cases in which a non-resident parent has more than one child and those children live in different households, so I can understand why the hon. Gentleman was interested in it. However, section 42 is used in the ongoing assessment of child maintenance payments&#151;that is, when there are concurrent claims for maintenance. Therefore, the section would not apply to arrears of maintenance built up by Ms Mackintosh&#039;s ex-partner before he was living with her. Section 42 would be used only to assess the ongoing maintenance entitlements of Ms Mackintosh&#039;s children and those of her ex-partner&#039;s former family.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para29"><a name="stpa_334">I understand that Ms Mackintosh has a child support application of her own outstanding and that there has been delay in getting that assessment under way. I believe that the delay is due to the fact that it links with existing claims in respect of Mr. Hampson and his former wife. Added to that is the question of jurisdiction, because the non-resident parent is located in New Zealand. Furthermore, no address is held by the agency for Mr. Hampson, who has failed to provide more details despite express requests made to him before his relocation to New Zealand.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"><a name="60322h05_spnew1"><b> Danny Alexander </b> : Clearly, this is a very unusual and distressing case, but I am disappointed by what the Minister said about section 42 and by his analysis&#151;perhaps he will address this point later&#151;of Mr. Hampson&#039;s interest in the property, given the evidence that Ms Mackintosh has provided that she 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2006 : Column 137WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
paid the mortgage payments throughout and that she paid the deposit on the property. There was a time difference between her separation from Mr. Hampson and the change in ownership. It seems to me that she is being made to pay an incredibly high price for what is perhaps only a relatively small oversight.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para30"><a name="stpa_335">When I last spoke to Miss Mackintosh, she put it something like this. What is the point of someone such as her continuing to work and to try to bring up and support their children when the system that is supposed to protect them lets them down? Would she not be better off going on to benefits and allowing the state to support her?
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"><a name="60322h05_spnew2"><b> Mr. Plaskitt </b> : As I tried to say to the hon. Gentleman earlier, this is a question of striking a very difficult balance. As he acknowledged, it would be inappropriate for either him or me in any way to condone an attempt by a non-resident parent to evade, in this case, his responsibilities to support his children from a previous relationship simply because he had the device for transferring ownership of an asset. That is why the agency has taken the action that it has.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para31"><a name="stpa_336">I shall give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking. I have already looked at the scope in section 42 for doing something exceptional in these circumstances to see whether we can help his constituent. The conclusion that I have reached to date is that section 42 does not offer us such a route, for the reasons that I set out. However, I do undertake to have a further look at it in the light of what he has said this afternoon and to write to him. I do not want to offer false hope, however. I am simply saying that I am more than prepared to study the potential for opportunity under section 42. I am not making any promises, but I certainly undertake to look at it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para32"><a name="stpa_337">In respect of the point that the hon. Gentleman now raises, the critical issue is the ownership of the property and not, alas, who bore responsibility for meeting any particular costs associated with that property. The critical question is ownership; that is what was transferred, and that transfer was in conflict with the bill of inhibition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para33"><a name="stpa_338">I understand that the agency is considering the permanence of the non-resident parent&#039;s absence from the United Kingdom. If he is found to be no longer habitually resident in the United Kingdom, he is outside the jurisdiction of the Child Support Agency. However, there are still arrangements in place to help Ms Mackintosh recover maintenance payments. Reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders are international claims for family maintenance, handled by UK courts. The UK has arrangements with more than 100 countries and territories&#151;including New Zealand, where we understand the non-resident parent lives&#151;to allow a person living in one jurisdiction to claim maintenance from an ex-partner living in the other.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para34"><a name="stpa_339">If, as in the case before us, there is no existing Scottish court order for maintenance, a solicitor can help to prepare the appropriate papers for a provisional order. Those papers are then forwarded through the courts group to the appropriate foreign country to begin the recovery of maintenance. If Ms Mackintosh has not

already taken up that option and wishes to find out more, she should contact her local sheriff clerk&#039;s office or courts group. Details of that process are also available on the Scottish Executive&#039;s website. There is a broadly similar process for England and Wales, which is managed by the Department for Constitutional Affairs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para35"><a name="stpa_340">Enforcing maintenance has always been a crucial issue in child support. Although it is true that the real problem is parents not facing up to their responsibilities, I would not attempt to claim that the agency has always been the most effective organisation in securing debt. The question is what should be done to improve the situation. As I said yesterday in a similar Westminster Hall debate, last year we asked the new chief executive of the agency, Stephen Geraghty, to conduct a root-and-branch review of the agency&#039;s operations. From his findings, we concluded that the current system was incapable of delivering the outcomes that we all desire from the Child Support Agency. The problems are not just with how the agency operates but with the policy and legislative framework that is supposed to support it. Therefore, we have also asked Sir David Henshaw to consider a complete redesign of the whole child support system. The terms of reference for his redesign have been drawn as widely as possible to allow all options for reform to be fully considered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para36"><a name="stpa_341">I know that hon. Gentleman&#039;s party has also put forward its own proposals for a child support system, and that Sir David Henshaw has met the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws). However, I am bound to say that I have not seen anything in the Liberal Democrats&#039; proposals that would have made any difference to the case that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey raised today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para37"><a name="stpa_342">Some have said that by asking for a redesign we are just putting off taking any action, and so children are continuing to suffer from a poorly performing agency. That would only be a fair criticism if it were true, but it is not. Mr. Geraghty&#039;s review identified a number of areas where improvements could be made in the short and medium term. That formed the basis of our operational improvement plan, which sets out how the agency&#039;s performance will be improved over the next three years. The &#163;90 million investment for the next three years will support the recruitment and deployment of more staff to processing work and, particularly, enforcement. Over the period of the plan, we will quadruple the number of staff dedicated to enforcement activity from 500 to 2,000. We aim to increase levels of compliance from 65 per cent. to 80 per cent. by March 2009.

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="60322h05_spnew3"><b> Danny Alexander </b> : I appreciate that the Minister wishes to move on to make more general points about Child Support Agency reform, and indeed to make some partisan remarks about the Liberal Democrat position on the subject, but that is not a debate that I particularly wish to get into today. The nub of his response to my constituent&#039;s inquiry is effectively that the transfer of ownership was a device on the part of the non-resident parent to avoid his responsibility. I think that I have made it quite clear that my understanding, from my contact with my constituent, is that it was not such a device; it was, as it were, a tidying-up exercise from a

separation that occurred much earlier. To argue that my constituent is trying to get round the rules on behalf of the non-resident parent is not right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60322h05_spnew4"><b> Mr. Plaskitt </b> : The hon. Gentleman is entitled to interpret private decisions taken by his constituent and her former partner and will receive their interpretation of the situation. It is not for me to get involved in that. What I have to do&#151;and what the agency has to do&#151;is consider the facts of ownership and operate, as we must, in the interests of collecting maintenance owed to children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para38"><a name="stpa_343">In that context, the agency is bound to look at a non-resident parent&#039;s assets and what may or may not have happened to them. It will not want to accept a situation where assets are transferred, for whatever reason, when that has the effect of taking them beyond the reach of the agency and removing their value in circumstances where they could contribute towards a debt owed to children. That is and always has been the dominant factor; it is enshrined in the original legislation that brought the agency about and I am sure that that would be the principle objective of any successor organisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para39"><a name="stpa_344">I recall, from reading the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party&#039;s document on this matter, that it too enshrines as a founding principle that the purpose is to pursue maintenance for children. It is in that context that the current law is drafted and why the agency has taken the decisions in respect of his constituents&#039; case. Having said that, I am more than willing, once again, to look at all

the existing powers that we have at our disposal, and options for discretion, to see if we can do anything differently in this case. I will write to the hon. Gentleman about that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para40"><a name="stpa_345">Returning to how we are trying to solve problems in the longer term, such as the ones that this case illustrates, we will also be considering the use of data from credit reference agencies and HM Revenue and Customs. In addition to the &#163;90 million investment that I have already mentioned, a further &#163;30 million will be invested in using private debt collection agencies to recover the &#163;100 million of historic debt over the three years of the plan. Work has already begun on introducing these improvements and this will continue while Sir David is producing his redesign.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60322h05_para41"><a name="stpa_346">In conclusion, I believe that we all continue to support the original objectives of the Child Support Agency to make sure that parents who did not live with their children still face up to their responsibilities to support them. As we have often said, relationships may end, but responsibilities do not.

<p>
<a name="60322h05_para42"><a name="stpa_347">Although I understand that Miss Mackintosh finds herself in an unenviable situation, I think that the actions of the agency in this case have been correct. The ultimate aim must be to make sure that non-resident parents cannot avoid paying the money that they owe to their children.
