 This is the first time that I have had the pleasure of being in this forum when you have been in the Chair, Sir John. I have seen you in the Chair in other forums, and it is a pleasure to serve under you today. This is also the first opportunity that I have had officially to congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his new position as the Minister with responsibility for disabled people, and to welcome him to that. I know about, and endorse, his commitment to the subject, and I shall say more about that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para2"><a name="09022649000008">I thank all those organisations and individuals who were summoned to provide evidence to the inquiry. Select Committees often forget the enormous burden that we place on people, particularly the voluntary sector, when requiring them to put together evidence to submit to us, and it is right to put that on the record. I particularly thank the Princess Royal Trust for Carers. We were fortunate to visit its carers&#146; centre in Harrogate, which was an incredibly moving experience, especially our session with carers, one of whom was 17. We must remember that the number of child carers in this country is significant, and that involves considerable issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para3"><a name="09022649000009">I broadly thank the Government for their response to our report, but my hon. Friend will not be surprised that I take issue with some of it. I understand that today the National Audit Office published a report on carers, but I have not been able to obtain a copy&#151;I do not know whether he is hiding them. Therefore, I am not sure what it says, but I am sure that it is constructive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para4"><a name="09022649000010">I want to speak about three things: carer&#146;s allowance, information and advice, and employment and training for carers. My colleagues will also want to contribute to the debate. There are 4.5 million carers in this country, and it is estimated that they save the economy about &#163;87 billion, so they are significant. As life expectancy increases, that number will increase significantly. It is hoped that medical advances, such as stem cell research, will ultimately provide cures for diseases such as Parkinson&#146;s and Alzheimer&#146;s, but as people live into their 80s and 90s, other issues will come to the fore&#151;for example, osteoporosis. Our unsung army of carers will increase. That and social care are the two biggest issues facing the Government for years to come.</p>

Committee did not recommend a change to those rules, but what must change is the three-page letter that goes to pensioners telling them that they are entitled to the allowance.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that, and anticipated that he would. We have drafted a new letter and will ensure that all Select Committee members receive it before it is piloted. I shall be grateful for their comments, including on whether they think it is fit for purpose. I have read the evidence and the current letter is not fit for purpose because it does not do its job. I shall value the Committee&#146;s feedback.</p>

 Never let it be said that the power of Select Committees cannot move mountains, even if it is only a change in the drafting of a letter. I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s promise, because the letter has caused great and unnecessary consternation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para6"><a name="09022649000014">The Government said in their response that carer&#146;s allowance is not income replacement or a wage for caring. They went on to say that they are not willing at the moment to consider carer&#146;s allowance outside the general review of benefits. If it is not a benefit and not a wage, why not review it separately? The promise of a review in 2011, perhaps later, with final implementation around 2018, and linking it to the chimera of a single working age benefit, which we are a million miles from getting, is extremely disappointing, to put it mildly.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="09022649000015"><a name="90226h0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="09022649000217"><b>Mrs. Joan Humble (Blackpool, North and Fleetwood) (Lab):</b>
 My hon. Friend is making an excellent point. The Government have said that they do not want piecemeal reform, but aspects of the system within which the carer&#146;s allowance works could be altered with no impact on the debate about a future single working age benefit. For example, those on the minimum wage receive an increase in that minimum wage in the autumn, and carer&#146;s allowance is uprated in April-May, so workers who receive carer&#146;s allowance sometimes find that they must stop work or reduce their hours or they will lose their entitlement to the allowance. That could be examined separately.</p>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="09022649000016"><a name="90226h0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="09022649000218"><b>Mr. Rooney:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes an extremely intelligent point. There needs to be some alignment of the change in carer&#146;s allowance with the change in the minimum wage, because 50p or 60p can have an unbelievably extraordinary impact on people. I think we all agree, whatever our other positions, that carers live their lives under pressure and can do without needless administrative hurdles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para7"><a name="09022649000017">Some of the announcements in December were piecemeal reforms. The Government made the bold announcement that income support will be abolished&#151;I pay tribute to the Minister&#146;s absolute commitment that carers will not be moved on to jobseeker&#146;s allowance, and I know the effort that he put into that&#151;but that was immediately qualified with the statement that income support will not be abolished while claimants are receiving it. That could take 25 years.</p>

a clearly identifiable group, and the Government are saying that they will not be in the benefits system because carer&#146;s allowance is not recognised as a benefit or a wage. Therefore, why can that group not be dealt with specifically? The problem has been around since 1948 and the establishment of the welfare state, but the original invalid care allowance was introduced only 15 or 20 years ago. Progress has been far too slow for the army of people who deserve better and to have attention focused on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para9"><a name="09022649000019">The concept of a single working age benefit is linked to simplification, for which people have been crying out for 30 or 40 years. That is an ideal, but as soon as implementation is considered, all sorts of obstacles and hurdles arise. I do not see there being a single working age benefit in my lifetime, and I hope to live to be much older than I am now. We need to consider that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para10"><a name="09022649000020">Last June, the Government published their 10-year vision for carers, &#147;Carers at the heart of 21st-century families and communities&#148;, which states that</p>
<a name="90226h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09022649000196"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;carers will be supported so that they are not forced into financial hardship by their caring role&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para11"><a name="09022649000021">That is an extremely bold commitment. If we implement it tomorrow, we will make 4.5 million people very happy. As yet, however, there is no measure of how, when, where or whether that will be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para12"><a name="09022649000022">Another important issue raised in our report involves two particular groups of people. One is carers who care for more than one severely disabled person and who still receive only one carer&#146;s allowance. The second is people who are caring for two or more individuals who do not qualify for middle or higher rate disability living allowance care, although that is an equivalent care burden to having one person to care for who is getting the middle or higher rate. The carer&#146;s allowance system does not recognise a situation in which two or more disabled people do not qualify for that rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para13"><a name="09022649000023">We have a moral duty&#151;an obligation&#151;to the 4.5 million carers to set out a timetable for reform of carer&#146;s allowance and for milestones along the way against which whichever Government we have can be measured.

 I am listening carefully to the Chairman of the Select Committee&#146;s excellent speech. Does he agree that in some ways we are going backwards? Our report made the point that if we uprate the benefit in October and the threshold for earnings in the spring, we are pushing people off benefit for six months in a very disruptive way, but the Government&#146;s response seems to have been, &#147;Oh well, we&#146;ll just freeze the threshold.&#148; This year, the threshold has been frozen at &#163;95 and there has been no increase at all.

couple of weeks before Christmas, my wife broke her leg, and for about six weeks I was a carer. I was not a very good one and I was not a full-time one&#151;I am glad she is not here&#151;but it did get me thinking about all the different situations that I have had in my own life when I have been a carer. People think that that is their duty, and let us not forget that it is largely women who do this work. People take on the role without any knowledge, advice or information coming to them about what is available for carers, however meagre that might be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para15"><a name="09022649000027">The Committee visited the carers&#146; centre in Harrogate run by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers. It has a number of centres around the country; I forget exactly how many. It may not be the only way to do it, but that centre was an outstanding example of a one-stop shop where people could obtain all the information that they could possibly need on all aspects of caring and what was available. How many carers have no idea about their entitlement to respite care? Such care is a lifeline for carers. It enables them to take a weekend off without feeling guilty. Lots of money is being put into respite care and lots of social services departments have got pots of money, as have some primary care trusts, but it is not advertised and carers are left unaware of it. We need to do much better on the provision of information and advice. We recommended a network of centres, perhaps on the model employed by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, although we are not too fussy; if a different model works, let us use that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para16"><a name="09022649000028">&#147;Putting People First&#148;, which I think is a Department for Communities and Local Government publication, committed local and national Government to making significant progress by 2011 to ensure that all areas have both carer support and a</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para17"><a name="09022649000029">That is fine in so far as it goes, but there is no penalty on local government and local health services if they do not provide it. I know that there is a great argument about centralisation, devolution and whether things are ring-fenced or not, but I do not know any arm of local or central Government that disagrees that those services need to be provided, so why not have a mechanism to ensure that that is happening?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para18"><a name="09022649000030">A separate issue is that social care and health are devolved in Scotland, but there is a UK benefits system. There is a tension in that respect which no one seems to have resolved. There are issues about devolved education as well, in relation to young carers. The system in Scotland is different from that in England, but a universal benefits system is laid on top of that. I know that, generally, there are cordial relations between central Government and the devolved Administrations, but at the end of the day the devolved Administrations can say, &#147;Go away. We&#146;re not doing it.&#148; There is universal carer&#146;s allowance, with all the conditions attached to it, but in different parts of the UK the support networks behind it have different rules and regulations. That was not properly addressed in the Government response to our report. I hope that we will hear more about it today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para19"><a name="09022649000031">My final point concerns employment and training issues for carers. On average, carers act as carers for eight years. Most carers are in the 35 to 55 age group&#151;what one might call the prime earning years. Either they come out of the job market entirely or they work part time but have to forgo promotion and advancement and  <br>

turn down training opportunities. That is a major impediment to their earning power at the time, but it also translates to poverty in retirement, because at the peak earning time when normally people would start putting extra money into pensions and so on, their employment ability is reduced and their capacity for income is reduced</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para20"><a name="09022649000032">Let us not forget that 250,000 carers are retired. We heard one case of a widow of 71 who was a carer for her mother, who was 90-odd, and 51-year-old twin sons, who were severely disabled. She receives the carer&#146;s credit attached to her pension credit&#151;&#163;27 a week. Had she been a bit younger, she would have received only the single &#163;50 a week carer&#146;s allowance. It will be increasingly common for people in retirement to be caring for adult children as well as parents. However, we do not seem to have recognised that, in the circumstances that I have described, carers&#146; incomes are significantly reduced and their employment opportunities are reduced. Some of the rules and regulations that relate to education and training were designed for a different era and a different cohort of claimants, and they positively work against carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para21"><a name="09022649000033">Professor Paul Gregg got it absolutely right in his review, which he delivered just before Christmas. He came up with the concept of a progression to work group. That refers to people who at some future point will want to work but currently are not required to look for work or be subject to the normal JSA conditions. A channel of communication is needed so that we can say to carers, &#147;You can opt in if you want to. These are the options and opportunities that are available, but it is not mandatory.&#148; We need a line of communication if we are to bridge that gap. The gap is an average of eight years, with people not being in employment and missing training and other opportunities as a result. We need to find other ways of telling them about what is available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para22"><a name="09022649000034">We also need to look seriously at the restrictions of the benefit system on those in training. I am not talking about the universal abolition of the 16-hour rule or the 21-hour rule. It is a clearly identified group for which we can write a special prescription. We do it often enough, but we need to use a bit more imagination. As I said, the exclusion of those on income support from claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance is a distinct group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para23"><a name="09022649000035">The carer&#146;s time has come. It is not good enough to keep the debate going. Carers have been consulted to death. We do not need any more consultation. The message is clear; the prescription is clear. The only reason why there has not been more progress is that it is a silent group. There is no trade union marching for the carers. There is no army of fancy lawyers&#151;I apologise to hon. Members for mentioning this&#151;seeking fee income from representing them. Carers sit and suffer in silence. Regrettably, groups that sit and suffer in silence tend to be ignored by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para24"><a name="09022649000036">I think back a couple of years and 100,000 people losing their pensions when their companies went into administration. It took a while, but in the end the Government came up with a package worth &#163;8 billion. That was to satisfy 100,000 people. Last year, the ombudsman&#146;s report into Equitable Life was finally published. The Government responded, and at some point a package will be put together to compensate those affected. Why? It was because, over the years, they made a lot of noise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="90226h0001.htm_para28"><a name="09022649000041">The report outlines very well the problems faced  by carers. I draw the attention of hon. Members to paragraph 35, which gives a good summary of the human cost of caring. Exactly what carers have to go through was best brought out in one of the first e-mails that I received on the subject, which came from a carer in my constituency. The carer&#146;s story was also told in the pages of my local paper, the <i>Henley</i><i>Standard</i>. It is the story of a garden designer who, following the death of his mother-in-law, has had to care for his wife, who suffers from bipolar disorder. He has had to do so for some four years.</p>

If I had become a member of the Committee earlier, I would have wanted to make one slight addition to the report. It does not quite bring out the particular impact on carers who live in rural constituencies such as mine. In these locations the isolation is greater, the transport links are poorer, and caring usually involves additional costs.</p>

Gateway Accounts Bill, that the Government intend to make those in receipt of carer&#146;s allowance eligible to open a saving gateway account&#151;a small gesture of help to those carers who can meet the savings requirements, but a welcome one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para1"><a name="09022649000046">One of the key things required&#151;the report brings this out extremely well&#151;is a simplification of the benefits system as a whole, but particularly in relation to carers. The system is too complex, and it does not necessarily ensure that the money goes to the right place. Perhaps the Minister will say more about the plans to simplify benefits and the application process, and to provide a timetable for such simplification. In doing so, I hope that he will take the opportunity to clarify how services for carers and those for whom they care will be joined up more at national and local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para2"><a name="09022649000047">The Minister and I are both members of the Public Bill Committee that is considering the Welfare Reform Bill, which has heard about the unintended consequences of delegating personal budgets. A gentleman decided to give his carer respite by buying him tickets to a football match&#151;an action that was pilloried in the national press as a waste of money. There was much speculation as to whether people thought that the money was wasted because of the team that the carer supported or simply thought that it was not value for money. However, we all agreed that it was a perfect example of how money should be spent, and that it was a good way of joining up services, as it can give the sort of respite that carers need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para3"><a name="09022649000048">There is huge scope for taking the pressure off carers. I echo the points made by the hon. Member for Bradford, North on the question of information. I very much support those actions that can be taken now to increase access to information and advice for carers. It is not acceptable that the take-up of benefit is so bad that, according to Carers UK, &#163;740 million goes unclaimed each year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para4"><a name="09022649000049">One recommendation that I particularly endorse is that the right to request flexible working should be extended to carers to enable them to manage career and caring. I do not know whether that would have helped my constituent, but it would take the pressure off many carers&#151;pressure that can lead to health problems for them and feelings of guilt for those being cared for. The wife of my constituent summed it up when she said:</p>
<a name="90226h0002.htm_brev0"><a name="09022649000199"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I feel awful that my illness is the reason my husband cannot work.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para5"><a name="09022649000050">That is a telling point, showing that caring affects not only the carer but the person being cared for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para6"><a name="09022649000051">I note that Jobcentre Plus is examining the most effective ways of supporting carers to go into training. We need to know when the examination will stop and proposals will be made. That is particularly relevant today, as the National Audit Office has published its report, &#147;Supporting Carers to Care&#148;. It makes three relevant points. The first is that Jobcentre Plus services should not be regarded as being well suited to carers&#146; needs. That seems to be a comment made by Jobcentre Plus staff rather than those outside. The second point is that not all interested carers make use of Jobcentre Plus, and the third is that there are gaps in the Jobcentre Plus management information on support for carers. Those are some key, relevant points.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a series of excellent points. Does he share my great disappointment in the Government&#146;s reaction to the Committee&#146;s proposal to give carers the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job, instead of having to wait for 26 weeks? In their response, the Government said that they were opposed to introducing that right from day one, because the 26-week period is required to build a relationship of trust between employer and employee. Does he share my view that, after 26 weeks, if the carer is under pressure, and has had to leave work early, there will be no relationship of trust? In fact, the chances are that the carer will have found it impossible to last 26 weeks and, therefore, to get to the point at which they are eligible to request flexible working.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I agree that, given the sort of pressures that carers are under, which have been illustrated already, there is unlikely to be a relationship of trust after 26 weeks. In fact, there is likely to be a relationship of suspicion and uncertainty. I am disappointed, therefore, that flexible working will not be a right earlier.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir John. As a member of the Select Committee, I should say that although the report might look like a mighty tome, it is very readable, and I recommend that any Member who has not read it do so, because it contains some useful information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para8"><a name="09022649000056">The evidence that we heard from many organisations and individuals proved hugely useful to us, but the report has also been useful to them. The Chairman of the Select Committee, in his opening speech, quite rightly set us a challenge. We here are the voice of carers, and the evidence in the report gives voice to their concerns. It is our responsibility to champion their needs, and the report provides a huge wealth of evidence to help the Government to respond to the challenge that we have set.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para9"><a name="09022649000057">We started the report by defining who carers are, because much ignorance still surrounds that point. The majority of carers are women, but, as the statistics in the report show, over the age of 70 the majority are men. The men in this Chamber, therefore, should be looking to the future too. As they grow older, they, too, could become carers&#151;I heard the Chairman&#146;s remarks about his caring responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para10"><a name="09022649000058">Our report also makes the point that many do not see themselves as carers with a capital &#147;C&#148;&#151;they are family, friends and neighbours, and are doing what they think is right, because of which they do not seek advice about available help. We need to remind them that no matter what their role or their hours of caring, they should find out what additional support is available. Our report itemises that support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para11"><a name="09022649000059">The report raises another important issue. Too few people understand the importance of the role of the Department for Work and Pensions with regard to carers. If asked, many members of the public and carers would talk about the need for support from health and social services, because they provide the help&#151;either by coming directly into their homes or through respite care in hospitals, day centres and residential care&#151;but for the majority of carers, if they have any dealings with a Department, it is likely to be the DWP, whether through benefits and pensions, support in obtaining employment, support when they are in work or through the carer&#146;s allowance. The DWP plays a key role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para12"><a name="09022649000060">On page 19 in paragraph 37, the report outlines the strategic approach that the DWP should take to support carers. Some of our recommendations are fairly obvious, such as supporting adults and children financially&#151;too many children take on caring responsibilities without telling anyone, because they do not want their school friends and other family members and friends to know. They, too, need support. However, one of the key recommendations concerning the role of the DWP is for a joined-up, cross-governmental approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para13"><a name="09022649000061">The DWP needs to work with the Department of Health. I was pleased, therefore, that we received evidence not only from many organisations supporting or representing carers, but from the then disabilities Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire), and the then social services Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis). They understood the importance of working together and were very positive about the role that they should have across Departments. They were speaking at a time when the Government had only recently announced their cross-departmental carers strategy. Interestingly, that strategy did not include benefits, which is why the report is so key&#151;it fills a gap in the strategy. Carers wanted to know how much money and what support they could get from the DWP, and we made recommendations concerning that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para14"><a name="09022649000062">I would like to pick up on some of the comments that our Chairman made about the importance of information, advice and guidance. We received evidence of how carers do not know who to go to&#151;sometimes they go to point A without being told what point B can offer them. The report discusses the importance of a joined-up approach. We welcome the Government&#146;s commitment to providing</p>
<a name="90226h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="09022649000200"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;every carer with the opportunity to access comprehensive information when they need to&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para15"><a name="09022649000063">We asked when and how, and also commented on the information and services helpline for carers that the Department of Health has set up. However, there is still a gap. Saga&#146;s submission recommended that the Government consider an equivalent to NHS Direct&#151;a &#147;Carers Direct&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para16"><a name="09022649000064">Our report mentions the importance of carers&#146; centres as a focus for care and advice. As our Chairman said, we have recommended that carers&#146; centres be put on a much firmer footing. The Government response said that that is the responsibility of local authorities and the agencies with which they work. Interestingly, the Local Government Association agrees with the Government&#146;s response to our comments, which surprises me, because one problem for local authorities is that they are not in a position to offer ongoing funding to  <br>

carers&#146; centres. That support tends to be piecemeal and for one, two or three years at a time or for specific initiatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para17"><a name="09022649000065">Furthermore, there are problems for carers&#146; centres that cover more than one local authority. The centre in Harrogate, for example, covers three local authorities and the same number of primary care trusts. It is extremely difficult to organise and bid for finance from several different bodies.</p>

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="09022649000066"><a name="90226h0002.htm_spnew3"><a name="09022649000225"><b>Mr. Rooney:</b>
 Just to update my hon. Friend and other members of the Committee, I should say that since we visited the centre in Harrogate at the end of December, it has lost a third of its funding&#151;that is how precarious the situation is.</p>

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="09022649000067"><a name="90226h0002.htm_spnew4"><a name="09022649000226"><b>Mrs. Humble:</b>
 My Chairman makes an excellent point. When we visited Harrogate, we saw how enthusiastic the workers there were. Sadly, their enthusiasm was diminished by the amount of paperwork that they had to do; they were constantly putting in applications for funding to a variety of organisations instead of being out there helping the carers they were meant to help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para18"><a name="09022649000068">We really need to look at a national strategy to provide some underpinning, basic funding. Yes, carers&#146; centres can apply to different organisations and do fundraising, but if they do not know that there is ongoing, underpinning funding to enable them to continue their work, they will spend far too much time fundraising and too little doing the good work that they should be doing to support carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para19"><a name="09022649000069">On advice and guidance, the Committee noticed that the Department of Health White Paper &#147;Our health, our care, our say&#148; talked about introducing an information prescription. That is useful, but, again, it illustrates the fact that different Departments are coming up with information themselves instead of looking at how all this information, advice and guidance can be collated to give a single focus to people who do not know where to go for information. I hope that the Minister will look carefully at our recommendations on information, advice and guidance, and at ways of simplifying the procedures so that carers can know where to go and can get the advice that they want from across Departments and local authority services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para20"><a name="09022649000070">In my constituency, we have a carers&#146; centre, which is part of the Princess Royal Trust network for carers. It serves Blackpool, as the unitary authority, and one primary care trust. That makes life a lot easier for the centre, but, even so, I meet people who still do not know that we have our own carers&#146; centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para21"><a name="09022649000071">The Committee also looked carefully at the design of carers&#146; benefits, but, sadly, we found them wanting. Carers and those they care for can access an array of benefits, including disability living allowance, incapacity benefit, carer&#146;s allowance, housing benefit and attendance allowance. Despite that, we received a lot of evidence showing that many carers find it difficult to cope, given the benefit to which they are entitled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para22"><a name="09022649000072">The Government did not accept that point in their response, but they accepted that we need to look at how carers&#146; benefits are framed. They said that the</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para23"><a name="09022649000073">The Committee&#146;s key recommendation on carer&#146;s allowance was that we should differentiate between carer support allowance, which we said should be paid at the same rate as jobseeker&#146;s allowance, and the caring costs payment for carers who have special and intensive caring responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para24"><a name="09022649000074">I welcome many aspects of the Government&#146;s response, but saying that we should not address the reform of carer&#146;s allowance piecemeal does not properly recognise how carer&#146;s allowance stands outside the array of other benefits. The Government could and should look at carer&#146;s allowance before they come up with a comprehensive strategy for a single working-age benefit. As our Chairman said, we could be waiting for years for a single working-age benefit, and carers cannot afford to wait years. Some things can be done now.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making some very good points, and the distinction that she has brought out is important, as is the detail, but may I take her back to the part of the Government&#146;s response, which she mentioned? Before acknowledging that there needed to be a distinction between carers&#146; different needs and circumstances, it said that the DWP did not accept that the general support provided to help with caring was inadequate. Basically, therefore, the Government&#146;s position is that support for carers is not inadequate. Is that not contrary to all sorts of information that we received when we did our report and that has come up in this debate?</p>

 My Select Committee colleague makes a good point. We had a wealth of evidence about financial pressures&#151;I use the words &#147;wealth&#148; and &#147;financial pressures&#148; in the same sentence, but they would not be part of the same sentence for carers; indeed, carers told us that they struggled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para26"><a name="09022649000078">One problem for the Committee and, indeed, the Government is that Ministers have not really made up their mind what carer&#146;s allowance is supposed to be. If they accepted our recommendation and linked carer&#146;s allowance to jobseeker&#146;s allowance&#151;in the carer support allowance that we recommend&#151;that would bring in various of the rules and restrictions that apply to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. The Government do not see carer&#146;s allowance as an income-replacement benefit, so there are all the rules about the number of hours that individuals need to care for someone and the amount that they can get from work. There is a contradiction there, because if someone is caring for 35 hours a week, there are few hours left for them to go out and work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para27"><a name="09022649000079">We have to go back to first principles. What is carer&#146;s allowance for? Is it an income-replacement benefit for somebody who spends most of their time at home looking after one or more individuals? If so, it should be increased and our recommendation should be accepted. If our recommendation was accepted, it would have consequences for earning rules and all the other complexities attached to the existing carer&#146;s allowance. It would also affect the 21-hour rule for education, which the Committee mentioned. Do the Government want the imposition of  <br>

that rule to disadvantage young carers in particular, who want to go into education and training and then into the workplace? The rule is there because of other elements in the benefits system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para28"><a name="09022649000080">We need to be clear why we are paying carers the money, but we are not, so we are not moving ahead. Again, the Government could look at the issue separately from their overall review of the benefits system; it could be a discrete part of the DWP&#146;s examination of benefits simplification.</p>

 I follow the hon. Lady&#146;s logic. Does she agree that the Government are teasing carers? On the one hand they say, &#147;We will look at your position in the context of a single working-age benefit and you may get an income replacement benefit from us.&#148; On the other, they say, &#147;Oh no, we do not think that an income replacement benefit is right for carers.&#148; Are the Government not trailing their coat for sympathy from the carers without actually doing anything?</p>

 That point is recognition of how difficult the problems are. When the Government announced last year&#146;s carers&#146; strategy, which was a good document that included extra money for carers, they did not mention benefits because that is a complex issue. We have been muddling along with the same benefits system for a long time. Do the Government want to do something radical? Do carers want us to do something radical? Carers are happy with the existing system so there is a challenge for us all, including carers and their representatives, to look at how the system can be improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para29"><a name="09022649000083">As a distinguished member of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) is aware that we had a lot of evidence to support our recommendation of a two-tier benefit. We certainly had a lot of evidence to support increasing the benefit because of the financial pressures on carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="90226h0002.htm_para30"><a name="09022649000084">I will say a few words about carers who work. When we talk about carers, the assumption is that most carers stay at home and look after the cared-for person. In fact, many carers are in work. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers provided some good evidence on the experiences of its members. The &#163;95 a week limit causes problems because Jobcentre Plus regularly contacts the union&#146;s members whose wages are approaching &#163;95 to ensure that they have not reached that level. Its members have to submit proof of their earnings. If their wages increase, perhaps after being on the minimum wage, they may lose their carer&#146;s allowance. There are different earnings rules for carers claiming carer&#146;s allowance and those claiming other means-tested benefits, which causes confusion. There are also obstacles to carers engaging in voluntary work.</p>

Those staff have a difficult job. We expect them to know about and be sympathetic to everything about every individual who goes to see them. It is not always easy to recognise that somebody is a carer, especially if the person does not say, &#147;I am a carer.&#148; We know that people do not always say that.</p>

Jobcentre Plus staff should be aware that such individuals may have been out of the job market for a long time and not have the skills, education or confidence to enter the world of work.

That area is not the Minister&#146;s responsibility, but we included those comments because the social care system cannot be divorced from benefits and work issues. He must work with colleagues in other Departments, especially those with responsibility for health and social care, to produce comprehensive packages. Good things are happening in the realm of social care such as the development of individual budgets, direct payments and the personalisation of services for people with disabilities. Carers should be part of that. Where money goes in, the social care sector is changing, as are the services available for people with disabilities and elderly people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para2"><a name="09022649000088">Those changes will impact on the evidence that the Select Committee received on issues such as care vouchers. Some employers give their staff vouchers so that employees who are carers can purchase social  care support. That benefits the worker and the employer. Those developments are taking place at the same time as the move in social care away from providing services directly to social care recipients to giving  them the money to buy their own care. On the one hand, social care vouchers are suggested; on the other, there is an entirely different mechanism for providing social care.</p>

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="09022649000089"><a name="90226h0003.htm_spnew0"><a name="09022649000231"><b>Mr. Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne) (Con):</b>
 Does the hon. Lady share my disappointment that the suggestion was not taken up that care vouchers be piloted among those who work at the Department?</p>

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="09022649000090"><a name="90226h0003.htm_spnew1"><a name="09022649000232"><b>Mrs. Humble:</b>
 I do share that disappointment. There would be value in piloting the scheme to see how it works. Some organisations already run the scheme and want alterations to how it is offered. Pilots would give an opportunity to see how the scheme can marry with the changes that occur in social care as the personalisation agenda is pushed forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para3"><a name="09022649000091">In the future, vouchers may be unnecessary.  However, they may be a short-term response while the  personalisation agenda and individualised budgets are pushed further. That area should be explored further in the social services Green Paper that is soon to be issued by the Government. Again, I say to the Minister that the Department must be aware of the changes that are being introduced in social services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para4"><a name="09022649000092">Finally, I am proud to be a member of the Select Committee that produced such an excellent report. We should not just give up now that we have had the Government response. Our message to the Government is that we will not go away, this issue will not go away and carers will not go away. As the Select Committee Chairman said, we are here to give carers a voice.</p>

 We have heard two comprehensive speeches, and I do not intend to repeat the points that have been made. I echo the comment made by the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) that this is a substantive report and it has been well received. As a member of the Select Committee who went to most of the sessions, if not all, I am proud of it. It is a good report and a tribute to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para5"><a name="09022649000094">On benefit simplification, as I said the other day in the debate on the uprating statement, we are in a ridiculous situation. There are so many income replacement benefits and they are uprated in so many different ways&#151;in line with the Rossi index, the retail prices index and the consumer prices index. There is a case for looking seriously at a single, straightforward, working-age benefit. That may be simply unaffordable in the current circumstances. However there is a duty on us as a country to look again at this extremely complicated system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para6"><a name="09022649000095">I find the Government&#146;s response to our suggestion that the carer&#146;s allowance should be overhauled rather odd. It is inconsistent to say on the one hand that the carer&#146;s allowance is not a wage for caring and is not intended to provide compensation for the costs of caring, and, on the other, that the White Paper &#147;Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future&#148; confirms the Department&#146;s intention to explore whether a single working-age benefit is the correct approach for carers. If the Department feels that there is a case for a single working-age benefit that includes a carer&#146;s allowance, then Ministers should say so. It is wrong to say that the carer&#146;s allowance should not be an income replacement benefit and then say that they will explore the subject in the context of our review of a single working-age benefit. I may be misunderstanding the Minister&#146;s intentions. I know that he cares about this issue, but it seems to me that carers are being given a bit of a tease. They are being told, &#147;We are going to look at this allowance in the context of income replacement&#148;, when the Government have no intention of doing that. If I am wrong about that, then no doubt the Minister will tell us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para7"><a name="09022649000096">If we consider pensions, once a person gets to retirement age and pension credit, they get their income replacement&#151;their pension income replacement&#151;and an additional payment if they are a carer. What our report suggests is that we should have something that is consistent with that for people of working age&#151;or at least that we should review that. Why is the Minister saying that we should have to put that off and treat it as part of the single working-age benefit review when that is some years away? One wonders whether one can hear the rustling of that longer grass, and whether this is not a question of Ministers kicking the matter into the medium term in the face of quite a lot of public concern about a group that does so much for our society and gets so little for it. I should be grateful to hear the Minister&#146;s thoughts on benefit simplification and whether he is serious about looking again at whether it should be an income replacement benefit with an addition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para8"><a name="09022649000097">We were very impressed when we went to the Harrogate centre. Carers know where to go because there is a sign saying &#147;Carers Centre&#148;, and that is always a good start. If carers go in there, they find deeply experienced  <br>

people who know about carers and their benefits and what is on offer. The staff know their stuff and provide good advice. We met carers who had been helped by the centre. In large parts of the country, there is nothing as simple as that. Will the Minister become a strong advocate for a simpler, better system in which carers can get the help that they need?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para9"><a name="09022649000098">In Australia, we were very impressed&#151;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.]</i> The Minister laughs, but I was impressed by the respite that was on offer. In Australia, there is a clear recognition that if someone is a carer and they want to work, they may need respite. Carers can reach a point at which they cannot go on. In Australia, they can ring up and get immediate respite help. Moreover, some schemes exist that enable people to take a break. They can go with the person for whom they care, or on their own to recharge their batteries. I thought that that was excellent. I should be grateful to hear something from the Government about respite. Is it on the agenda? It was not mentioned in the strategy document, but it is very important to somebody who is caring.</p>

 May I say something before the hon. Gentleman leaves this issue of a network of carer centres up and down the country, which is something that I strongly support? The Government said that while they gave grants to carers&#146; organisations, including those that ran carers&#146; centres, it was for councils and their partners to ensure that there was appropriate local support. Is that not kicking the prospect of achieving a full network into the long grass? What about those local authorities that do not provide such a service? A lot of local authorities complain that they have not had a grant from the Government to do so and that such centres are a low priority for them. That is why we will not get a national network. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Government must get their hands dirty to ensure that there is one?</p>

<p><a name="st_24"><a name="09022649000100"><a name="90226h0003.htm_spnew4"><a name="09022649000235"><b>Mr. Heald:</b>
 I agree with how our Chairman, the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney), put it. There are lots of different pockets of money, all of which are no doubt being used to help carers, but there is not a strong enough network and a clear enough brand to help carers in the way that they need. The joy of the Harrogate centre is that it is just there, bold as brass. A sign says &#147;Carers Centre&#148; so we knew where to go and that was that. There is a lot to be said for something that is more solid in the way of branding and for strengthening of the network. I am not sure whether that would require extra budget. It may be a question of pulling together the money, getting the branding right and making a simpler statement and a stronger network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para10"><a name="09022649000101">I welcome the national helpline and the website, but feel that we should consider improving arrangements for employment and study. I notice that the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills is setting up an adult advancement and careers service in the autumn. Hopefully, that will have some focus on carers. However, how does trying to encourage carers to take work and support them in work fit in with the 21-hour rule that says that someone can train or study only for a limited period? If the Government are so keen on skills&#151;I certainly am and we know about the Freud report&#151;what is the sense of continuing with such a limiting rule? Why have the Government frozen the amount that a person  <br>

can earn while receiving carer&#146;s allowance? We suggested that the system should be simplified so that the uprating and the threshold go up at the same time. The Government&#146;s response was to freeze the threshold and give no help at all. I support what has already been said about this report, and hope that the Minister will answer those questions.</p>

 I should like to extend my thanks to the members of the Work and Pensions Committee for producing a thoughtful and good report. Like the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble), I think that this is a good piece of work, and I am very proud to be part of the Committee that has produced it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para11"><a name="09022649000103">Our Chairman has said that carers are the silent group, the group that nobody listens to. All of us feel that we have played a small part in giving voice to carers. They are people who work seven days a week, 24 hours a day caring for a relative, friend or next door neighbour. I wonder why such people are so silent and why we do not hear their voices very often. I think it is because a lot of our attention is concentrated on the recipients of the care. The Chairman said that he was a carer for a short time over Christmas when his wife broke her leg. I bet she got lots of cards saying, &#147;Get well soon&#148; and, &#147;I hope you will soon be up and about&#148;. I am sure that she got the odd bunch of flowers&#151;her husband is shaking his head&#151;visitors, and lots of tea and sympathy because she had broken her leg. I also bet that the Chairman, her husband, did not get any of those things. I am fairly sure that he did not get a card saying, &#147;Good luck on your role as a carer&#148; or, &#147;I hope things work out well for you.&#148; I am also fairly sure that no one knocked on the door and said to him, &#147;You go and have a break, we&#146;ll look after your wife for you&#148;&#151;I know that they would not tell him to go down to the pub, because he is teetotal. The tea and sympathy and concern are generally for the person who needs care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para12"><a name="09022649000104">I speak from personal experience. I have often been the recipient of care, mostly when I was younger, from my parents. I must say that I gave them a pretty hard life. When a person is going through a lot of pain and misery, and is finding life difficult, they take it out on the people who are closest to them&#151;their nearest and dearest. They are the ones who are asked by, say, a child with a disability, &#147;Why can&#146;t I be normal?&#148; or &#147;Why can&#146;t you take my pain away?&#148; Parents get that kind of pressure, and they are also the carers. They have a double burden. They have the burden of caring and of doing the state&#146;s job&#151;often, they do not want the state to be involved. Many people, particularly those who care for older people, do not want their relative to be in a residential or old folks&#146; home; they want to keep them at home. At the same time, particularly if the person who is being cared for can be difficult or has behavioural problems as a result of their disability or illness, or due to mental illness, they often have the burden of being the butt of the anger of the person for whom they are trying to care. However, they do not walk away. They stay, day in day out, year in year out. That is why it is important for Committees such as the Work and Pensions Committee to take their plight seriously, and for the Government to do likewise. Without those carers, the whole care system would collapse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para13"><a name="09022649000105">I think that carers save the Government &#163;87 billion a year. I do not think that any of us are advocating that carers should relinquish their role. They assume their responsibilities, willingly in some cases and reluctantly in others, because they think that they can probably provide far better care than could ever be provided by a state system, no matter how good. Carers are the silent group, as the Chairman of the Committee said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para14"><a name="09022649000106">I am following other speakers, and I am not sure what bits of our report to talk about&#151;a lot has already been covered. However, individual stories often tell us more than anything else. The hon. Member for Henley (John Howell) used his speech to highlight individual cases, and I will do the same. More than anything, individual cases illustrate what difficulties and problems can arise. The biggest single thing that the Government can get right for carers is respite. Perhaps we do not give enough attention to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para15"><a name="09022649000107">We are lucky in Aberdeen because we have a carers&#146; centre. Last year, when we were producing the report, I was amazed by how many carers I met&#151;I have been meeting a lot of carers in the past week in my constituency, and I will come to why they have been knocking on my door. The Committee met a lot of carers. We visited Harrogate, and I went to my carers&#146; centre to talk to people. They raised the issue of young carers, who are often forgotten. In some cases, people&#146;s whole young lives are affected by their caring role. Any aspirations and ability to go into further or higher education, for example, are curtailed because they care for their parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para16"><a name="09022649000108">We met some children in Harrogate whose homes were dysfunctional because a parent was a drug addict. Those individuals can lead enormously unsettled lives. I remember vividly one of the people who worked at the centre in Harrogate saying that parents who had mental health problems&#151;they might be manic depressives&#151;often caused the most difficulty. She said that a child could adapt remarkably well if their life was dreadful all the time; they simply learned that that was the norm and to cope. However, some mental health illnesses mean that the parent is up and down, and there are huge differences between manic and depressive phases. The children of those parents find life the most difficult. Things can be great if the parent is in a manic phase and there is lots of energy going around, but the children do not know how long the phase will last or when it will end and the whole family will tumble back into depression. That can be difficult to cope with. That is why respite for young carers was talked about when I visited the Aberdeen centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para17"><a name="09022649000109">As part of national carers week in December last year, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran) and I ran a carers surgery so that people could come to see us&#151;he did it in the morning and I did it in the afternoon. The enormous range of carers who came in that day was interesting, from the man who had reluctantly allowed his wife, who suffered from Alzheimer&#146;s, to go into a care home, to the mother whose daughter was at a special school but reaching the transition period, who felt that there was nowhere to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para18"><a name="09022649000110">I should explain the situation in Aberdeen as it relates to the latter case. Aberdeen city council has a fairly major problem with its finances. Last year, it had a &#163;50 million deficit. It took the decision that children who were at special schools could no longer stay on in school to age 19, a provision that had existed for some  <br>

time. If people attended a special school, the school leaving age was effectively 19, and the six months before was used as preparation for transition. The decision was taken, presumably to save money, that those people would have to leave school at 18, like everyone else. It was taken arbitrarily, and with no proper discussion. The mother who came to see me thought her daughter had six months in which to prepare and get ready for adult life and move from children&#146;s to adult services, but was told that her place at school was going to be withdrawn, and there was nothing in its place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para19"><a name="09022649000111">She was not alone. Other constituents have come to see me with exactly the same problem. I thought that I was being very successful as an MP, because I seemed to win every case I took up with the local council. It would back down, saying, &#147;They&#146;re not going to have to leave school at 18, they can continue.&#148; However, I found out only last week that it was not down to my success as an MP; the local council found that people had nowhere to go, and the preparation had not been done, so people had to go back to their school. Imagine the upset that that caused in the family. We are still in that position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para20"><a name="09022649000112">Another constituent, Margaret Hodder, got in touch with me last week. Her daughter is 18, and she has autism and bipolar disorder. The daughter will be leaving school in the summer, but Margaret does not know what will happen to her, because the council is not providing the appropriate support. Part of the problem&#151;this is why I have seen a lot of carers in the last week&#151;is that, due to budget constraints on the council, decisions are being taken that affect the care and respite that parents will get.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para21"><a name="09022649000113">The council has two day centres&#151;Rosehill and Burnside&#151;to provide respite for a range of people. However, one of them is to close&#151;I believe I heard two days ago that it is probably Burnside. Some 190 people go to the two day centres, but the council wants to cut it down to 100. It is going to get rid of some people. It said that over-65s did not qualify, so they will not go to the day centre, which is fine. It will get rid of others by reassessing people under new criteria. They will go because they will not be severely disabled enough. However, a large number of people will be left without the day centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para22"><a name="09022649000114">Today&#146;s <i>Press and Journal</i>, the paper for north-east Scotland, tells the story of a mother, Aileen Hutchison, whose 31-year-old daughter Susan has cerebral palsy. I must declare an interest; Aileen was in my class at school, so her story is all the more poignant. What she said sums up why we wrote the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para23"><a name="09022649000115">She went to a meeting to find out what was going to happen. At the moment, her daughter attends the Rosehill day centre five days a week and is thriving. Aileen says in the paper that the council</p>

When it was pointed out to them that this decision does not only affect the service users but their families too, they didn&#146;t even respond.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="90226h0003.htm_para24"><a name="09022649000116">That goes back to what I said originally. We often think of the service users or the people needing care, but in the impact studies that must be done under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, we forget to factor in carers&#146; needs as well. The Committee Chairman said that carers were entitled to respite. The carers in Aberdeen do not think that they are entitled to respite; they are losing what respite they had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para0"><a name="09022649000117">I have described the picture for those leaving school and looking for help, but carers and constituents have come to me from the other end. They are elderly parents whose children are perhaps in their 40s. Because people are living longer, people well into their 70s may end up caring for children in their 40s. One mother phoned me last summer, before the Rosehill closure was an issue. Her daughter goes to Rosehill. She had been told, again in an arbitrary way, that her 43-year-old daughter&#146;s day care was to be cut by one day. She was in tears on the phone, saying, &#147;How can I manage? I can only manage her over the weekend because five days a week she goes to her day care. What happens when she can only go four days a week?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para1"><a name="09022649000118">Such are the individual stories that illustrate why the Government have to get it right. We must also get it right in services for older people. There is a huge job of work to be done by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The way we behave towards older people with disabilities, particularly learning disabilities&#151;I hope that this is happening only in Aberdeen&#151;is nothing short of a diminution of their human rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para2"><a name="09022649000119">Another decision by the council in Aberdeen is to move everyone over 65 into older people&#146;s services. The result is that adults with learning disabilities who have turned 65 are now being reassessed. If they are in supported accommodation, they are being told that it is too expensive and that they will have to go to an old folks&#146; home. The only reason they have to move is that they have turned 65 and they have learning disabilities. Their relatives have been knocking on my door in the past week. I was quite horrified. I honestly thought that I had got it wrong. I wrote to the chief executive of the council expecting an immediate rebuttal saying, &#147;No, we&#146;re not doing that. Of course we wouldn&#146;t dream of doing that.&#148; It has not come. Instead, the lead councillor on social work has accused me of scaremongering in the press, saying, &#147;Actually, we&#146;re just going to assess them, and then we&#146;ll decide from there where they&#146;re going to live.&#148; Those people are living in a home situation where relatives may be caring for them, and they are being told where they must live. It is appalling. I was horrified, and I have got increasingly angry as the week has gone on since I found that out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para3"><a name="09022649000120">Those things are happening in Aberdeen, where we thought we were getting better. If it is happening now, the situation may be happening elsewhere, in other local authorities that are finding that their money is being cut. It is difficult to get to the bottom of where the money is coming from. Some of it comes from Westminster and some of it from the Department for Work and Pensions in the form of benefits to both the cared-for and the carers, but in other areas it may come from the local council. It is difficult and confusing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para4"><a name="09022649000121">I hope that we can behave better in the 21st-century world. We are a rich country. We should be valuing our disabled people. A measure of how civilised we are is how we treat the most vulnerable, and part of the package of those most vulnerable people is their carers. How we treat the carers in our society should also be a measure of how civilised we are.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Sir John. I preface my remarks by saying that I feel something of an interloper at this debate, as I did not serve on the Select Committee that wrote the report. None the less, on reading it, I was impressed. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney), and all those who participated in the process, on producing the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para5"><a name="09022649000123">My attention was drawn to one particular conclusion:</p>
<a name="90226h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="09022649000203"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Protect the interests of young carers, ensuring that in caring for family members they are not disadvantaged in accessing opportunities for education, training and employment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para6"><a name="09022649000124">I turned to the Government response to see whether I could find a specific reply to that conclusion. Reading the range of responses, I could identify some that might be relevant to it, but try as I might, I could not find anything that directly satisfied me that the Government are addressing it as a specific problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para7"><a name="09022649000125">I felt, therefore, that I would like to make some remarks based on my personal experience in my local authority of the specific problems faced by young carers on top of the better-known problems experienced by carers as a whole. A number of hon. Members referred to carers as a silent group, deprived of effective advocacy. There is a lot of truth in that. Young carers are even more silent and less able to advocate their cause than carers as a whole, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p><a name="st_27"><a name="09022649000126"><a name="90226h0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="09022649000238"><b>Mrs. Humble:</b>
 I am sure that my hon. Friend is well aware that one reason why young carers are a silent group is that they hide the fact that they are carers. It is not that it does not occur to them that they are carers, as it does not occur to many adults. They often know that they are carers, but they do not want their school friends to know. They are often bullied at school if it is found out that they are carers. They do not want their teachers to know. They do not want anybody to know, and so they hide it. We need to reassure them that they can come forward and be helped.</p>

<p><a name="st_28"><a name="09022649000127"><a name="90226h0004.htm_spnew2"><a name="09022649000239"><b>Mr. Bailey:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. I was going to come to the difficulties of identifying young carers. As well as the problem that she mentioned, it is even more frightening that some young carers will not divulge that they are carers for fear that if the nature of their parents&#146; handicaps is revealed, they will be taken into care and removed from their family situation, which to their young minds is a powerful disincentive to revealing how much support they give their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para8"><a name="09022649000128">My local authority is relatively lucky in having a very able carers&#146; organisation. Most unusually, it has an organisation specific to young carers. Ably led by director Tracey Smith and a team of employees and volunteers, it provides services for young carers. I know that other areas have similar organisations, some of which are dealt with in the overall remit of carers&#146; groups&#151;Harrogate has been mentioned as an example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para9"><a name="09022649000129">The figures quoted in the report are frightening, particularly those acknowledging that in the 2001 census, 165,000 young people were carrying out carers&#146; duties. The report also gives the statistic that 1 per cent. of the population are affected. When researching my own  <br>

statistics, I found that an independent organisation has estimated that there are more than 2,000 potential young carers in my local authority area of Sandwell, from a population of 3,000 young people in that educational group. Although 2,000 young people might not be a huge proportion of the total number of carers, if one thinks of that figure as a proportion, it is a significant section. The educational opportunities that are lost to those young people as a result of their caring duties are a considerable handicap to them and could jeopardise their life prospects for many years. Those lost opportunities are also a drag on educational improvement statistics in the local area. There is a pressing moral need to enhance the life prospects of those young people by giving them appropriate support.</p>

 I apologise for arriving late. I have been speaking in the Chamber about a Welsh Assembly Government legislative competence order on carers. Does my hon. Friend agree that we ought to recognise the excellent work that Crossroads does for carers, particularly at the local level? It works closely with local education authorities to assist young carers and help them through problems such as bullying. May I place on record the thanks of the all-party group for carers to the Select Committee for its tremendous report? At yesterday&#146;s all-party group meeting, I was asked to come along today to place that thanks on the record and to say that we look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="09022649000131"><a name="90226h0004.htm_spnew4"><a name="09022649000241"><b>Mr. Bailey:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, and join him in thanking Crossroads and recognising its work. I also recognise his contribution to promoting the cause of carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para10"><a name="09022649000132">I note that my local authority is probably better off than many others because it has its own organisation that is dedicated to helping young carers. However, it deals with only 155 such carers, and there are estimated to be 2,000 in Sandwell, so if my area is relatively well off, it is frightening to think what the situation could be in other parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para11"><a name="09022649000133">I said that I would talk about the difficulties of identifying carers, and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) rightly outlined a number of reasons why young people are unwilling to come forward and acknowledge that they are carers. However, there are mechanisms and organisations that should enable us to identify young carers. It has been suggested to me that GPs are well placed to identify families in which a parent has some disability or health problem and to be able to say, from their knowledge of that family, from where that parent is getting support. In most cases, it will be from the children in the family. I am informed that GPs have an obligation to keep a register of carers, but they do not seem to be obliged to use that register for any other purpose. That is a suitable area for investigation and recommendation on ensuring that the information that GPs hold can be passed on to an appropriate body that would enable young carers to get support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para12"><a name="09022649000134">Similarly, teachers will often notice that young people are not staying on for after-school activities, are not doing homework, or are showing signs of sleeplessness or other symptoms of a lifestyle that is distracting them from basic educational involvement.

Carers, in my area, gives training sessions with schools, but that is not obligatory, and I wonder how many other areas have similar training sessions. That could also be considered as a way of assisting with identification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para13"><a name="09022649000135">My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) mentioned the needs of young carers. What is coming back to me is that carers need recognition of their caring role, which gives them a certain status and sense of responsibility that should be acknowledged by society. Rather than being some sort of stigma, it is a mark of credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para14"><a name="09022649000136">My hon. Friend also mentioned respite care, which is essential to young people who have to deal not only with the pressures of full-time education, but with the very difficult pressure of what is often a problematic home situation. Those young people are also often deprived of peer group support and the social interaction, perhaps of playing with others, that would be normal for a person of their age. They are socially isolated, but have a higher level of responsibility than one would normally expect a young person of their age to bear. Having respite, being able to go to an organisation where they can meet others in the same situation, and perhaps getting a holiday somewhere, when they would never otherwise have a holiday, is essential to the well-being of those young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para15"><a name="09022649000137">Education was highlighted in the report. Many young carers lose out either because they cannot attend school as often as they should or because they cannot participate in the full range of activities at school. Some of them find it difficult to get to school because, unlike many young people with parents who take them to schools, they have no transport. That is a significant issue for young people with caring responsibilities. Likewise, they have no grant income to deal with any special needs that they might have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para16"><a name="09022649000138">Those problems are specific to this age group, and, unless they are resolved, they will undermine both the Government&#146;s investment in the wider education system and the futures of a significant proportion of our young people today. I asked my local young carers&#146; association which single thing, if anything, would help them to highlight their specific problems within the vast range of problems that carers have, and would help them to promote solutions, and the first thing that was put to me was that young carers need a dedicated national organisation. That is not to criticise the excellent Children&#146;s Trust or the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, which do a good job in taking on board young carers&#146; issues. However, a specific range of needs is covered by local government, education departments, the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions, none of which, unfortunately, has ownership of those matters. In those circumstances, it is crucial to have a dedicated organisation looking at Departments and tying policies together that will deal with young peoples&#146; problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para17"><a name="09022649000139">Although I recognise that not all my remarks might be in the Minister&#146;s specific remit, I hope that he will take them away and feed them into the forthcoming Green Paper on health and social care, so that the matter can be seriously considered and measures implemented to promote the interests of this specific group. In doing so, I commend the section in the report on the trip to Australia, which mentions Australian respite and information services. Australia seems to  <br>

have a much better developed process for identifying and assisting young people with these responsibilities than us. It is important that the Government look at that particular model to see how it could be replicated to deal with the problems we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para18"><a name="09022649000140">The needs of this particular group have been consistently under-recognised. The provisions to deal with those needs have been, at best, patchy and, at worst, non-existent. Dealing with the problem would provide enormous potential benefits both for the family life and the educational opportunities of the young people concerned. There are also, of course, benefits to the community at large arising from young people having a more fulfilled life and being better able to develop skills and contribute to the community. Although not all of the specific points I have made might be within the Minister&#146;s remit, I ask him to take them away and pursue them with other Departments, so that we can at last change the life prospects of what we know is a minimum of 165,000 young people in this country.</p>

 As a member of the Work and Pensions Committee, I am pleased to be associated with this good report, which makes some important recommendations to assist the lives of carers. I pay tribute to all those who have spoken in the debate, including my Committee colleagues. The speeches have been excellent and some very relevant points have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para19"><a name="09022649000142">I want to draw attention to only two issues in the report. The first is the recommendation for a national network of carers&#146; centres, which is an idea we saw in Australia and brought back. It would enable there to be a co-ordinated approach to helping carers, including providing information, advice, guidance and signposting to other specific organisations that can help carers&#151;for example, local organisations or those dealing with services, benefits and other sorts of support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para20"><a name="09022649000143">People have said that there are carers&#146; centres here&#151;there is one in Harrogate that we saw&#151;but I do not have one in my constituency. There are many parts of London that do not have a carers&#146; centre, which is also the case for rural areas across the country. The provision of carers&#146; centres needs to be better co-ordinated and formalised because it is an important way to get information about respite, for example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para21"><a name="09022649000144">In &#147;Putting People First: a Shared Vision and Commitment to the Transformation of Adult Social Care&#148;, the Government said that by 2011 they will commit local government and national Government to making significant progress towards ensuring that all areas have &#147;carer support&#148; and a</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para22"><a name="09022649000145">That sounds good, but what does it mean in practice? I have written in the margin of my notes that social services would say that they are providing carer support. Alternatively, it might be the citizens advice bureau down the road or in the next borough. Frankly, that is not a national network of carer support. We know from  <br>

history that the advice that citizens advice bureaux give can be patchy because they are busy with all sorts of other things as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para23"><a name="09022649000146">It is not good enough for the Government to say that this is down to local government. To be fair to local government, we have had a briefing from the association of local authorities, or one of those local government bodies, which says, &#147;We&#146;re strapped for cash and we can&#146;t really provide all that we would like to in that way.&#148; Many local authorities will not provide such services and do not see them as a priority&#151;perhaps they are old-fashioned.</p>

<p><a name="st_32"><a name="09022649000148"><a name="90226h0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="09022649000243"><b>Miss Begg:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right. If a local authority does not consider such services a priority, we get the situation that we have in Aberdeen, where services did exist, but they were easy targets when there were budget constraints and the local authority was trying to save money.</p>

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="09022649000149"><a name="90226h0004.htm_spnew7"><a name="09022649000244"><b>Harry Cohen:</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, which I fully agree with. Similar examples in my area give me concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para24"><a name="09022649000150">Direction from the Government is needed to deal with the problem. They must say, &#147;We want a national network of centres and we are prepared to will the means to do it.&#148; As part of willing the means, the Government must provide the core funding for such centres&#151;for example, the one in Harrogate. Children&#146;s centres provide an example of how that could be done. One of the big things that the Government have done, which is excellent, is provide a children&#146;s centre in every constituency. I fully praise the Government for that; it is tremendous. However, they willed the means and said, &#147;We want it.&#148; They put the money in, worked with local authorities and got it. That is brilliant and the Government should do the same for carers. The Government&#146;s current attitude, which is reflected in their response, is a do-nothing attitude, and that it should be left to social services and the local authorities. That is not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para25"><a name="09022649000151">The second point that I want to make is about the general support for carers. When I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble), I mentioned the astonishing fact that the Government have basically said that they do not accept that the general level of support for carers is too low. Will the Minister specifically address that? Do the Government think that the general level of support for carers is not too low? I am interested to hear his response, because we know that at &#163;50.55 the carer&#146;s allowance is the lowest earnings replacement allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para26"><a name="09022649000152">Thoughts run through my mind of the recent programme, &#147;Rab C. Nesbitt&#148;, which is probably one of the funniest programmes on television. The MP in the programme says, &#147;I can go and live off that,&#148; and is taken down the pub in Glasgow, or wherever it is, and he spends all his money there. Could the Minister live off &#163;50.55&#151;let alone care for someone as well? I do not think so, otherwise I would say that he should go to live with Rab Nesbitt and try it, but I will not make that particular suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para27"><a name="09022649000153">The Government make two points. They identify that the issue of carer&#146;s benefit will be a priority from 2011. That is too long to wait. Where is the plan now? The other fallback argument is complexity. The issue of a carer&#146;s allowance is complex, which has been brought  <br>

out in today&#146;s speeches. Is the carer&#146;s allowance an income replacement? What should we do for carers who are in work? What should we do for full-time carers? We might need different approaches, but the current figure is too low for all those people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para28"><a name="09022649000154">A further point is that pensioners who are carers get quite a poor deal in the current system. They think that they will get some extra cash when they take on caring duties, but they do not. Some people suddenly find that they are caring for a second person. When I was on the &#147;Politics Show&#148;, I spoke to a splendid woman who was caring for her husband, who had had a stroke. Suddenly, she had to care for her son as well, and she told me that there was not a penny of extra support in such circumstances. I do not think that that is fair, either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="90226h0004.htm_para29"><a name="09022649000155">My last point is based on a briefing that we received from the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society, which includes a worrying point that I ask the Minister to address. The briefing states:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para8"><a name="09022649000165">Something that will live with me for a long time is the visit to Harrogate, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney), our Chairman, and during which we heard from carers of all ages. We heard about the challenges for older carers and the situation that they face. Many of them do not see themselves as carers&#151;they are simply caring for their spouse, their loved one. They do not even see that they have a caring role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para9"><a name="09022649000166">And then, of course, we had that inspiring meeting with the young carers. We heard from incredible young people who have spent most of&#151;in some cases, almost all&#151;their childhood looking after a parent. We heard about their experiences and how they coped. That, too, has been touched on by other hon. Members. Caring has taken those young people away from the normal, everyday things that children would and should take for granted, if they are able to do so. I found that particularly powerful. Because we were listening to the voices of carers and were driven by the experiences of carers up and down the country, we made proposals that I am proud to associate myself with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para10"><a name="09022649000167">The bigger picture, of course, is that we want to move on to changing the position of carers in this country. I am sure that the Minister is listening carefully to everything that we have to say and I know that the Government took the report seriously. As our Chairman said, carers are an incredibly precious resource in our society, which is what we need to consider as we move forward on policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para11"><a name="09022649000168">Carers are individuals who contribute to society. Our Select Committee Chairman gave that extraordinary &#163;87 billion figure as the amount that they save the public purse every year. That is astonishing. To be honest, I cannot imagine such a figure. It is enormous, but, to put it in context, it is more than the annual spend on the entire national health service. I find that hard to take in, but it shows exactly what carers are doing, not just for their family members and loved ones, be they spouses or parents, but for our society and country. It is time that we recognised that. Instead of thinking, &#147;What benefits can we give them?&#148;, we should ask, &#147;How do we recognise them and their contribution?&#148;</p>

That really has to change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para13"><a name="09022649000170">Another thing that we found as part of our inquiry was that we are far behind some other countries. Select Committees can and do look at examples of best practice from all over the world and at the systems of nations that are ahead of us. We are ahead of many nations on many things, and I hope that they are looking to us to see how they can improve things, but we found examples from other countries&#151;I believe most of us on the Committee would say from Western Australia in particular&#151;that are, frankly, miles ahead of what we are doing in relation to not just the money given to carers to recognise their contribution, but signposting and support. Other countries really are a long way ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para14"><a name="09022649000171">There are examples in this country of where we are doing things very well, such as what we saw in Harrogate.</p>

 One of the other things that we discovered in Australia is that they are much more imaginative in devising activities for people and in giving carers respite. The one that sticks in my mind is the men sheds; I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman remembers that. Perhaps he will explain how they worked, particularly for men with Alzheimer&#146;s. They had a shed to go to&#151;that is what men do&#151;and there was a women&#146;s equivalent. It was so imaginative, so simple and so effective.</p>

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="09022649000173"><a name="90226h0005.htm_spnew2"><a name="09022649000247"><b>Greg Mulholland:</b>
 I warmly thank the hon. Lady for that important example, which shows that meeting people and seeing what they are doing can influence a report and, we hope, policy. We all agree that things must change. The Government do, too, having just published the carers&#146; strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para15"><a name="09022649000174">Of the main issues in the Committee&#146;s report, we must take the financial one first. Our frustration is that the Government have taken it last. There are positive aspects to the carers&#146; strategy, but until there is an adequate system of financial recompense for carers, which recognises their contribution, the many other measures, although very valuable, will simply not change the lives of carers as we have said they must.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para16"><a name="09022649000175">The Committee Chairman and other Members have mentioned the double whammy: caring costs a considerable amount of money for the carer and the family, but carers often have to give up work, too, so caring costs more and they lose their source of income. Some costs of intensive&#151;perhaps round-the-clock&#151;care have not been considered, and, piled on top of that, often there are additional services that, frankly, are essentials, not luxuries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para17"><a name="09022649000176">Some carers find themselves in a desperate situation, and, as I have seen with constituents, there are other things, too, such as the extra transport costs of going to hospital and higher bills for heating if the condition of the person being cared for requires it. That is the situation for the Pinders, my constituents. Mrs. Pinder cares for her son, Matthew, who has complex needs and is susceptible to the cold. That is why I have separately campaigned for severely disabled people to receive the winter fuel allowance. Many additional costs can be associated with the carer and the person being cared for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para18"><a name="09022649000177">Carer&#146;s allowance, the only benefit for carers, is &#163;50 a week and is simply not adequate. Everyone who has spoken has said that we cannot wait until 2011, and, although I acknowledge that these are important changes to complex benefits, carers cannot wait and the issue must be dealt with much more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para19"><a name="09022649000178">Carers UK conducted a recent survey of the situation and found that almost three quarters&#151;74 per cent.&#151;struggle to pay essential bills, which in turn are going up. Some 32 per cent. of carers paying rent or a mortgage could not afford to pay it at all. Perhaps the most shocking finding was that 52 per cent. of carers, which is more than half, are cutting down on what they spend on food, just to make ends meet. That is entirely untenable and unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="09022649000179"><a name="90226h0005.htm_spnew3"><a name="09022649000248"><b>Mr. Heald:</b>
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the May 2008 Populus poll for Saga, which found that less than 1 per cent. felt the current carer&#146;s allowance was appropriate, gives a pretty good impression of how bad the situation is?</p>

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="09022649000180"><a name="90226h0005.htm_spnew4"><a name="09022649000249"><b>Greg Mulholland:</b>
 That is another powerful example, and I thank the hon. Gentleman, my Committee colleague, for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para20"><a name="09022649000181">There are also powerful disincentives. The Government and the Committee have focused on enabling people to work or to stay in work, but the reality is that to qualify for the allowance one cannot earn more than &#163;95 in paid employment. With all the extra costs and burdens, that is not sensible. It means that many carers cannot work for a little bit when they want to, even though that could save the state money while enabling them to get by more easily. Again, that must change, and change now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para21"><a name="09022649000182">The Committee Chairman and others mentioned the issue of complexity. Of all the evidence we heard, the most extraordinary, for many of us, was the nonsense of older carers going through the process of claiming carer&#146;s benefits and being told that they were eligible, but then being told that they could not have them because of overlapping benefits. We found that hard to understand; we found it hard even to believe that it was happening, with computers pumping letters out to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para22"><a name="09022649000183">Let us not forget the emotional effects, either. All the carers and carers&#146; organisations that we spoke to said that the complexity puts people off applying for even those limited benefits, which they and the person for whom they care so desperately need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para23"><a name="09022649000184">I must echo what the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) said. I have already said that, looking to the future, the simplification of the overall benefits system is a positive thing, but, with a united voice, the Committee wants strongly to convey the message that the situation of carers must be changed and simplified now; it cannot wait for the wider picture. We believe that it is perfectly possible to simplify the situation so that they receive more adequate benefits and move away from the nonsense and the disincentives. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para24"><a name="09022649000185">As well as addressing the overlapping benefits issue that older carers face, any examination and reform of the benefit system must consider the 21-hour study rule, which one Member has already mentioned, because we  <br>

must remember the emotional well-being of carers. We heard very powerfully in Harrogate and on other visits about how it is so important for carers&#151;who are themselves isolated and often stuck at home, except when they go to the shops for essentials&#151;to study. At the moment, they cannot, but it is good for them and, once their caring ends, it supplies them with potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para25"><a name="09022649000186">The system pays no attention to what happens after caring stops, and, for older people, the sad reality is that many carers outlive those for whom they care. What happens then, when, perhaps for many years, the carer&#146;s life has meant caring for that loved one? What happens after that? Unless we provide more support, allowing people to study, train and focus on getting a job after caring has ended, we will not have done a joined-up job.</p>

<p><a name="st_39"><a name="09022649000187"><a name="90226h0005.htm_spnew5"><a name="09022649000250"><b>Harry Cohen:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about training, and he is quite right that training and facilities should be available at the end of caring. Does he agree that the state&#151;the NHS, care homes and social care policy making&#151;is missing a trick? Although some people will have had enough of caring, others will have learned skills that they want to take into other productive work&#151;in care homes and in the NHS. Should we not look at that aspect, too?</p>

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="09022649000188"><a name="90226h0005.htm_spnew6"><a name="09022649000251"><b>Greg Mulholland:</b>
 Absolutely. I thank the hon. Gentleman for that excellent point. That idea came directly from speaking to people who had obviously turned into wonderful carers and, as well as having the potential to become professional carers, they could advise and train other people. He is right: they are a resource that should be tapped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para26"><a name="09022649000189">The hon. Gentleman made another excellent point on a matter of real concern: the Welfare Reform Bill&#146;s plans to remove the adult dependency increases for those in receipt of carer&#146;s allowance. The regulatory impact assessment already recognises that the measure will mean a reduction in income for some carers, as he said. I ask the Minister to address that today, given the thrust of the carers&#146; strategy and what the Government are trying to do. They must deal with it swiftly, because it is appalling for a Government change to come in now that will mean a drop in income for some carers, particularly when bills are rising and the cost of heating and the cost of living are going up. That will send out all the wrong messages. I ask the Minister and the Government to consider that a priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para27"><a name="09022649000190">It is important always to remember that we on the Committee do not just have a scrutiny role. We also come up with useful suggestions. Our suggestion for a two-tier system, as we heard from the Committee Chair and other Committee members, is sensible, intelligent, workable and, most importantly, just. I hope that the Minister will reconsider. This is one of the most fundamental recommendations that we made. The carer&#146;s allowance should be replaced with a two-tier system: a carer&#146;s support allowance&#151;paid at the same rate as jobseeker&#146;s allowance, with an opportunity to earn a modest, sensible amount in paid employment&#151;and what the Committee calls the caring costs payment, which would be available to all carers in intensive caring roles and payable to those over the state pension age to compensate for the additional costs of caring. To some extent, that is based on the model in Western Australia,  <br>

but it is a sensible, workable solution that could be introduced soon. I ask the Minister to give us his thoughts on that today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para28"><a name="09022649000191">I conclude by reminding all hon. Members, but particularly Ministers who have responsibility, that we must not fall into the trap of seeing this issue as just for the Department for Work and Pensions. Of course, as the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood said, people forget that the role of carers comes under that Department, but the impact and importance of carers are clearly much wider. There is a health role, too, for example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para29"><a name="09022649000192">The impact of improving the lives of carers can have a huge impact on a number of issues. We have heard about young carers and what they do. Just consider the educational disadvantage that a lack of support for young carers can mean in respect of their lives and earning potential and for their children in future. Child poverty is affected by this issue. Everyone realises that pensioner poverty is an issue&#151;the Committee is about to go into a report on it&#151;but child poverty can be affected by a just settlement for carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para30"><a name="09022649000193">On pensioner poverty, which will be a focus for the Committee, we should look again at the changing demographics and the rising numbers of people who need caring for, which will mean even more carers, as other hon. Members have said. We face a &#163;6 billion shortfall&#151;we bandy that figure around&#151;and we need a solution for that as quickly as is reasonably possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para31"><a name="09022649000194">I thank my colleagues and friends on the Select Committee; I am proud of the work that we did. I feel that by listening to carers and allowing their voice to be heard, we were able to produce a strong report that gives the Government the opportunity to advance some workable, sensible, just solutions that could transform the place of carers in the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para32"><a name="09022649000195">I hope that the Minister continues in the direction that the Government appear to be taking with the carers&#146; strategy, which contains some positive things. As he knows, we have warmly welcomed the access to information and so on, but can we seriously look at a just financial settlement for carers, as well as those other positive things, and can we do it soon, because carers simply cannot wait?</p>

It is impossible to say with total accuracy how many informal carers there are in the UK at this moment&#151;one estimate is around   <br>

6 million&#151;but one thing we know for sure is that that figure will rise as people live longer and the demographics change in the next few decades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para34"><a name="09022663000003">One reads a great deal in the papers about the so-called sandwich generation, of which I regard myself as a member: people who are looking after both children and elderly parents. Only the other day, there was a report on the number of such carers who are drawing down from their own pension pots to look after their own parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para35"><a name="09022663000004">As the Committee&#146;s report rightly mentions, based on the Leeds university study, carers save the Treasury an estimated &#163;87 billion a year, which, as has been pointed out, is a sum greater than the entire annual budget for the national health service. Unfortunately, not a lot of that money is passed on to the carers themselves. The report says that caring has a considerable impact on carers&#146; incomes. We have heard all sorts of evidence to that effect this afternoon. Research by Carers UK found that carers lose out on about &#163;11,000 a year as a result of either giving up work, reducing their hours or taking a junior position. This loss of income is hardly replaced by the &#163;53 a week, from April, that they will get in carer&#146;s allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para36"><a name="09022663000005">Astonishingly, the Government do not know the current take-up rate for carer&#146;s allowance. The latest report&#151;I mean &#147;latest&#148;, because it only appeared in the early hours of this morning&#151;from the National Audit Office states that estimating the take-up rate is incredibly complex because it is based on the take-up rates of other benefits. We have heard something about that from other hon. Members. However, according to the Department&#146;s own longitudinal study, of the 882,800 carers entitled to carer&#146;s allowance in May 2008 only 480,730 claimed it. That is the equivalent of &#163;740 million in carers&#146; benefits going unclaimed in a single year. It is remarkable that the Government&#146;s own carers strategy failed to address directly this rather obvious problem with the benefits system, given the amount of invaluable service that carers give not just to those they care for, but to the state and the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="90226h0005.htm_para37"><a name="09022663000006">As we have seen, the eligibility criteria for carer&#146;s allowance are complicated. A carer must provide service for over 35 hours a week to a person receiving a qualifying disability benefit. Such strict criteria leave little room for manoeuvre. As has been said several times, carers who care for more than one individual for less than 35 hours a week each cannot receive carer&#146;s allowance. Age Concern and Help the Aged rightly pointed out in their joint briefing note:</p>

level of take-up.

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="09022663000013"><a name="90226h0006.htm_spnew0"><a name="09022663000088"><b>Mr. Heald:</b>
 My hon. Friend is making an important point about the future. The bill for benefits for those who care for disabled people will go up a good deal. I hesitate to mention Australia in the light of his earlier comment, but the approach there is that everything possible should be done to help carers to work if they want to. That relieves the state of part of the burden, and at the same time it is what carers want. Is that not something that needs to be given much more attention? Training, opportunities to work and so on are win-win.</p>

 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s further reference to Australia. He has obviously been hacking into my computer, because I was about to deal with some of his very good points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para6"><a name="09022663000015">Our welfare to work proposals will also help those carers who are out of work but are able to enter employment by giving them help and support so that they can return to work as soon as possible. Carers who are already out of work need help in different ways. We heard a couple of times about the strange rule of 21 hours a week for education and training, and surely Ministers should examine that urgently. The Government should encourage training, as my hon. Friend said, so that carers&#146; skills do not become rusty or out of date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para7"><a name="09022663000016">The Conservative party&#146;s welfare reform package is being spearheaded by my about-to-be noble Friend David Freud and includes proposals to help carers who are out of work to re-enter the work force by giving them help and support. When they are in flexible, carer-friendly work, a Conservative Government will help them to stay in work by ensuring the swift roll-out of individual budgets and direct payments. That will mean that instead of being fitted into a one-size-fits-all benefits system, carers will get the help that they need and want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para8"><a name="09022663000017">Comments have been made about care vouchers, and I have received briefing from Employers for Carers. Responsible, good employers, such as John Lewis, see that as the way forward, and it would be useful if the Minister said something about that. The press release of Employers for Carers says that back in August 2008, the Select Committee recommended not only that the Government carry out a full cost-benefit analysis of the care voucher model, but that the Department pilots the scheme for its employees. I thought that I had the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)&#151;Fleetwood is where the tram stops&#151;on board, and I do not see why that cannot be considered seriously, because Ministers can control that directly.</p>

Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) and, I am sure, others rightly referred to help and advice. We all know how important advice is, and in its briefing Age Concern and Help the Aged said that there should be a cross-Government strategy for the delivery and funding of information and advice, which would meet the needs of carers and others. That chimes in with the briefing from the Local Government Association, which says that good-quality information and advice are the first things that people with care and support need and their carers want. I am sure that that is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para10"><a name="09022663000019">Many aspects of local government are having problems with cutbacks that have to be made because of lack of Government funding. In some parts of the country, advice services are one of the first areas to fall to the axe. In its Fair Care campaign, the Local Government Association set out the main problems and said that the system is underfunded, unfair and unclear. It went on to say that because of the tight financial environment in which they operate, councils now have little alternative but to tighten their eligibility criteria, raise charges and reduce services. How true that is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para11"><a name="09022663000020">The current economic climate does not help. On page 20 of the Select Committee&#146;s report, it says that it was right to place these issues in the broader context of child poverty and pensioner poverty. The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) touched on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para12"><a name="09022663000021">The hon. Members for Bradford, North and for West Bromwich, West referred to child carers, who are a huge and often hidden problem. We know that there is an existing and growing problem with pensioner poverty. The official figures show that about 2.5 million now live in official poverty, and many are teetering on the edge simply because their savings&#151;they did the right thing all their lives, as the politicians told them to, and put money aside while they were working to supplement their income in retirement&#151;are bringing them a zero return. If that were not bad enough, to add insult to injury, when some of the benefits are calculated, it is assumed that they are receiving 10 per cent. on some of  <br>

 I am grateful for that sedentary intervention. Whatever it was, I do not think that interest rates in the real world were zero. That is my point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para13"><a name="09022663000024">I join the Committee, whose members get on hugely well with one another&#151;I am waiting for the drinks trolley to come around and to wander down memory lane&#151;in welcoming recent pension reforms that will do more to ensure that carers, the overwhelming majority of whom are women, have a better chance of qualifying for a full state pension. On page 59 of its report, the Committee attaches some faith to the new system of personal accounts to help carers with unstable working patterns to build up a pension pot, but many of them are precisely the sort who may be caught in the trap between means-tested benefits and personal accounts. That issue is still far from being resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para14"><a name="09022663000025">Pressure has built up on carers as people must delay selling their homes to fund long-term care&#151;that is clearly a huge problem at the moment&#151;or as those who have sold their homes still cannot afford long-term care because interest rates have fallen to about zero. Without unpaid carers, local social services departments would be overwhelmed by the needs of disabled and chronically ill people. The Select Committee report shows graphically that the Government&#146;s strategy on carers is woefully inadequate in tackling this growing problem. A key concern is the failure to tackle the postcode lottery for services, as well as the need to improve public recognition of the key role that carers play in society. In addition, there are no hard commitments on tax and benefits in the Government&#146;s proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para15"><a name="09022663000026">We are all united in our deep appreciation of the role of carers in society. I can assure the House that the treatment of carers will be a major priority for an incoming Conservative Government. However, I would not wish to raise false hopes. The amount of practical help that we will be able to give, at least in the immediate term, will have to be within the inevitable constraints of the economic situation that we inherit from the current Government. We will have tough decisions to make, but we certainly will not forget the needs of carers.</p>

 I thank the Select Committee for and congratulate it on the report, which is a well informed piece of work. The dedication required to produce it has been reflected in the comments made during the debate.

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para21"><a name="09022663000033">What strikes me about today&#146;s debate is that it is important for us to understand the complex needs of carers, because they are not a homogenous group. At one level, people are in a state of depression and there is a feeling of burden and isolation. That is without doubt something that people experience not just in Australia, but in the United Kingdom today. The 4 million or so carers referred to by the Chairman of the Select Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney), are not a homogenous group. People have complex needs and are a variable group. Indeed, the Chairman told us that he was a carer for a short period for Mrs. Rooney&#151;a lady whom I know well. She is a very patient lady, as those who know the Chairman will understand.</p>

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="09022663000034"><a name="90226h0006.htm_spnew4"><a name="09022663000093"><b>Mr. Waterson:</b>

 Indeed so. The Chairman talked about the contribution that the voluntary sector has made. He referred to the Princess Royal Trust, and Carers UK was also mentioned. I have met representatives of both organisations, and not just in the comfort of my lofty Whitehall office; I have also attended conferences. I can assure hon. Members that going to the Carers UK members conference and doing a question-and-answer session is good for one&#146;s health, because it brings  one into close contact with the people whom the Committee met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para22"><a name="09022663000036">One of my first jobs before coming to this place was as a care assistant. I have undertaken many of the tasks that carers do. Those tasks need not be referred to in detail in this debate, but I can assure hon. Members that I have been at the coal face. The difference&#151;it would be right of people to bring this up&#151;is that I left the establishment where I worked when I finished my shift. There is no end to the shift for carers, as the Government are acutely aware.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para23"><a name="09022663000037">As some hon. Members said, it is important to consider the context not just of other Departments, but of other services that are provided. For a carer or someone being cared for, the NHS is crucial. Does it not impact on someone&#146;s health if they have to wait more than 18 months for an operation? Absolutely. Does it not impact on someone&#146;s health if they have to wait up to two years for an operation? Absolutely. Does that happen now? All hon. Members will know from their constituencies that it does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para24"><a name="09022663000038">We have met our target of 18 weeks or less.

people. The party that I represent in government is very proud of that and I am sure that we are all pleased, because all our constituents benefit, and carers and people being cared for benefit in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para25"><a name="09022663000039">Comments were made about the benefits system, and reference was made to the care and support system. The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) talked about the ageing society. That is without doubt one of the big social policy issues that we have to grasp and find solutions to. There are competing demands and, yes, the situation is difficult. Gladly, we had the debate on pensions, and the House reached some consensus  on it. I will be one of the first people working to the  age of 66 to make the contributions, which is fine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para26"><a name="09022663000040">There is the carer&#146;s allowance, and hon. Members have referred to the fact that people would prefer that it be increased. Should it continue to be universal? Should it be targeted as we grow older? The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) talked about a financial black hole caused by the ageing society, and also about eligibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para27"><a name="09022663000041">All those factors impact on carers and the people for whom they care, so we will publish the care and support Green Paper. From that, we need a wide debate about priorities, quality, affordability and whether measures are universal or targeted. Those are difficult issues for us. Just as we had the pensions debate&#151;it took us a while, but we got there&#151;we have to have a wide-ranging debate on this issue. It is important that we have that debate and bring people with us, so that they understand the complexities and difficult decisions. Carers are very much part of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para28"><a name="09022663000042">I hope that we can arrive at consensus in the same way that we did on pensions. If we do not take that approach, we will propose something and there will be resistance to the change, as there was to some welfare benefit reforms in the past. We need to deal with benefits reform and care and support in tandem as we proceed with this important reform.</p>

 I am not able to give my hon. Friend a timetable. He knows that the care and support programme is coming up soon. We have signalled the way forward by giving a commitment on certain dates, but as I said about the NHS, we need to consider in a wider context the reform of services in relation to benefits and how that can affect carers and those for whom they care.</p>

It is reasonable to point out that it was increased two years ago from &#163;50; we wanted to give a significant uplift in order to assist people and provide some certainty. It could be argued that there should be a taper, but that would introduce more complexity. Universally, Members have said that carers have told them&#151;they have told me, too&#151;that they do not like complexity. We will keep that under review, but there is not a simple solution. If we do not have what I might   <br>

call the cliff face, we must have a taper; but with the taper comes more complexity. Again, carers have told the Committee and me that they do not want that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para30"><a name="09022663000048">My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North asked whether carers who did not meet the conditions of the progression to work group, rightly referred to in the report, would be able voluntarily to enter that group in order to be assisted back to work. The answer is yes. I hope that that also answers the questions about assisting people into employment asked by the hon. Member for Eastbourne.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para31"><a name="09022663000049">A number of hon. Members referred to the provision of carer centres. Special grants have been awarded to carers organisations, including those that run carers&#146; centres, to enable them to develop capacity. However, it is for councils and their partners to ensure an appropriate level of provision. We will do our bit, but local government needs to do its part as well. Do services vary from one authority to another? Yes, they do. That reflects the priorities of those elected to serve their local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para32"><a name="09022663000050">The report also refers to how to empower individuals. I have been taking part in the Committee stage of the Welfare Reform Bill today, and we are introducing the right to control benefits, some provided through social care and some through the Department, such as access to work. Indeed, there will be benefits also under the Health Bill, with tailored individual budgets. We will pilot those measures, working in partnership with carers&#146; groups, disabled people&#146;s groups and local authorities, in order to find out what works. It is important to establish what works. If we do not have pilots&#151;some have suggested that we should not&#151;we shall have to roll out different budgets together. If it falls over, people&#146;s anxieties will be raised, and we will lose the opportunity to introduce the necessary reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para33"><a name="09022663000051">We have been asked what steps are being taken to ensure that carers undertaking part-time work do not lose their entitlement to carer&#146;s allowance as a result of the minimum wage. I hope that what I said earlier about the disregard will help. We will keep the matter under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para34"><a name="09022663000052">The hon. Member for Henley (John Howell) gave us examples from his constituency. He rightly mentioned the need to develop services in rural communities and to have individualised budgets. That will bring some tension without an economy of scale. Although we will have pilots for the benefits reforms that I referred to, it is important to consider rural areas; previously, I was Minister with responsibility for rural affairs, and I know that the hon. Gentleman was right to bring the problems in such areas to our attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para35"><a name="09022663000053">I am encouraged that Conservative Members now support flexible working policies. There was a time when they set their face against people having time off for family matters. They have reformed, and that is welcome. We have to strike a balance between the needs of business and the needs of individuals, but if someone is already in work when they acquire their caring responsibilities, they will be pre-qualified to request flexibility. Again, it is an important piece of legislation that assists people in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="90226h0006.htm_para36"><a name="09022663000054">The Coleman judgment was mentioned. We are considering the appropriate legislation in order to deal with that concern. That will be forthcoming soon.</p>

I regret that no fee will be involved, as we have to prioritise expenditure, but I am sure that they will give us their comments on a pro bono basis. We are attempting to improve. We are providing a new service, and the carers&#146; support helpline will go live from April. We are putting about &#163;2 million into it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="90226h0007.htm_para3"><a name="09022663000060">Another service that I wanted to bring to the attention of the Committee&#151;a little indulgence, Sir John&#151;is the Tell Us Once pilots that we instigated, particularly for the bereaved. Earlier, we heard that if the cared-for person dies, carers may find themselves, in that bereaved state, having to deal with various agencies. We have been piloting a scheme with a number of authorities whereby people can attend a council centre and tell only one person once, and that person will take care of all their national and local benefits. The work has been done in partnership between the Department for Work and Pensions and local authorities. I have met the staff members who have been operating that service, and they were so enthusiastic about it. The feedback that they have received from customers has been really positive. I hope that we can roll that out; people such as carers will benefit from that service.</p>

Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood referred to USDAW, members of which I met at a conference last year. I spoke with carers, many of whom want to work. Indeed, half of those carers not in work say that they want to enter paid employment, and we will develop services through Jobcentre Plus to provide support for them. We always need to improve the knowledge base of our Jobcentre Plus staff,  <br>

who, as has been said today, must acquire a range of different skills. The hon. Member for Henley raised that point, and I recall him talking, in the main Chamber, about when he visited the Jobcentre Plus office in his constituency. He praised the staff in that office. At the moment, they are working very hard, given the current economic situation. However, we intend to develop services for carers, so that we can understand their needs and help them to find employment, because that is what they want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="90226h0007.htm_para5"><a name="09022663000062">We do not want to pilot care vouchers, because we do not think that it is the best use of resources. They would be very poorly targeted and regressive, so we do not intend to do that, either nationally or in the Department. That returns us to the point about the carer&#146;s allowance and universality versus targeted benefits. The hon. Member for Eastbourne talked about resources, and we must make such decisions. However attractive some employers think that vouchers would be for their staff, we do not want to use them ourselves.</p>

 I am not especially in favour of care vouchers&#151;there are all sorts of issues there&#151;but there is a strange contradiction between the Government&#146;s attitude towards care vouchers for adults who need care and care vouchers for children. Tax advantages are available for workplace provision of child care, but not of adult care. Does the Minister not find that a contradiction?</p>

 We must consider the infrastructure, as well as how we apply the benefits. A move towards vouchers, given the time and cost implications, and the apparatus that would need to be put in place, would not produce a situation more desirable than that resulting from the reforms to the benefits system that we want. The analogy with child care vouchers is also imperfect, because children are rarely financially independent with an income source, whereas generally adults needing care have some financial resources at their disposal, as well as state-provided care or benefits, which I referred to earlier. The circumstances, therefore, are different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="90226h0007.htm_para6"><a name="09022663000065">Our ambition is to move to a single benefit. I have referred to remarks about putting this matter in the context of care and support. Having listened to carers, we decided not to move carers on to jobseeker&#146;s allowance, as we had originally proposed in the Green Paper. Carers told me in no uncertain terms at the Carers UK conference that they thought it would be an insult to do so&#151;actually, there were a few expletives&#151;so we are not going to do that. We do want more simplification, but we need to consult on that and take people with us before we introduce our proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="90226h0007.htm_para7"><a name="09022663000066">The personal account given by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) provided an insight into what it is like to be cared for. She also told us how her parents had to endure some of her less than reasonable moments&#151;not that she is like that now. She rightly pointed out the need to support young carers, and talked about the difficulties faced by families often in a chaotic situation. She talked about parents who might be drug dependent. Albeit only in England, we are introducing support for families as part of the aiming higher for disabled children initiative. We have invested &#163;370 million to support, and increase the number  <br>

of, short breaks for parents caring for a disabled child, which I am sure will make an enormous difference to the lives of many families. It is for her to talk to the Scottish Government to see whether they can match that. I shall not respond in detail to her point about Aberdeen council, but obviously she is no fan of that particular local authority and some of its decisions.</p>

Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey) spoke eloquently about the need to improve services for young carers, as did a number of others&#151;I am pleased that the service in Sandwell is there. He talked about the question that he put to young carers in his constituency and about a national organisation. He asked me to pass on those points, which certainly I shall. However, we need to recognise that the Prime Minister has set up a cross-cutting body to look at carers that will take account of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="90226h0007.htm_para9"><a name="09022663000068">My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) was his usual direct self and invited me to go and live with Rab Nesbitt&#151;if he does not mind, I shall decline the offer. However, I shall provide him with a note on the point that he raised on behalf of the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society. I can provide him with the details that will allay his concerns. He also mentioned someone who had suffered a stroke, which brings me back to one of my original points. NHS stroke services have improved vastly in recent years. I am sure that that goes for his patch as much as mine. That will have lowered the dependency of some on carers as well as the requirements of carers.</p>
