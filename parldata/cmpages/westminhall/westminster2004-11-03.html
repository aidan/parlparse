<p><a name="st_0"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Mr. Watson.]</i>



</p>



<a name="time_0">
<a name="41103h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41103h01_spnew0"><b> Norman Baker  (Lewes)</b>  (LD): In light of the events of the past 24 hours, this debate is nothing if not topical. I&nbsp;have been up for most of the night, as I imagine have other hon. Members, so I assure the Minister that if I&nbsp;nod off during his reply it will not be a reflection on his speech. The most important thing is that I do not nod off during my own speech. Given the potential result of the election, I am suffering from not only sleep deprivation but a hangover. I do not know whether Ohio has been declared formally, but it seems as though President Bush has won a second term.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para0"><a name="stpa_0">On the positive side, the elections were an important victory for democracy. There was a very good turnout; there seem to have been no allegations of corrupt practices or glitches in the procedures; and, given the popular vote, President Bush seems to have won a clear mandate. It must be good for America and, indeed, for the world that there is clarity in the result and that there has been no dispute as there was last time. However, the victory is not greatly welcomed outside the United States. When I was at the United States embassy last night with other hon. Members, I found it interesting that there were loud cheers and applause when Kerry won a state but stony silence when George Bush did so&#151;among not only the Britons but many Americans.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para1"><a name="stpa_1">On 15 October, <i>The Guardian</i> published a poll that showed that the 10 or 15 countries that had been canvassed throughout the world wanted John Kerry to win, not George Bush. The only exception was Israel, perhaps for obvious reasons. Of those polled in the United Kingdom, 22 per cent. wanted a President Bush victory and 50 per cent. wanted a John Kerry victory. Among those countries that are physically closest to the United States, including Canada and Mexico, even fewer wanted a President Bush victory than the 22 per cent. in the UK. The figure in Canada was 20 per cent., but I think that it was even less in Mexico, so there will not be wild celebrations throughout the world as a result of last night&#039;s victory for President Bush. It is incumbent on the American Administration to reflect on that and to consider how they wish to engage with the world. It is also incumbent on us in this country and on other allies of the United States to consider how we should now engage with the US.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para2"><a name="stpa_2">Undoubtedly, damage has been done to the traditionally good relations between the UK and the US as a consequence of the policies pursued by the Bush Administration. It is clear from the information to which I have referred that Bush is not well regarded, but&nbsp;when people were asked in the same poll whether they had a favourable or unfavourable opinion of Americans, it emerged that each country polled had a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 62WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
favourable opinion. People can clearly distinguish between their view of their relations with the United States and Americans in general, and their view of the Administration who have been in office for the past four years, and who now look like being in power for a further four years. The poll showed that 62 per cent. of UK residents were favourable towards the Americans, while 21 per cent. had an unfavourable opinion. It is interesting that the UK had one of the lowest positive percentages, although 62 per cent. is still a significant figure.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para3"><a name="stpa_3">Before I come to where that result leaves US-UK relations, it is worth my referring to a further question asked in the poll in <i>The Guardian</i>. Individuals in different countries were asked:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Does the US wield excessive influence on international affairs?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para4"><a name="stpa_4">All countries said yes. The percentage of people who agreed was the highest in all the countries polled. In this country, 73 per cent. of people agreed with that statement, while only 17 per cent. dissented from it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para5"><a name="stpa_5">Has the way in which we have developed our relationship with the United States since 1945 been good for this country? Should we have done anything different? Should we do anything different now, particularly in light of the new four-year Bush Administration and the Republican majority in the Senate and in Congress?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para6"><a name="stpa_6">I cannot help thinking that the UK may have made a strategic miscalculation immediately after the second world war by appearing to try to retain some sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;superpower status. Still enamoured of Yalta, we thought that we were one of the big three along with Russia and America, rather than recognising that the sands of time were running out for our status as a world power, and that our future lay, as did that of France and Germany, in being a major European power. We still wield considerable influence in the world and are still, I&nbsp;hope, a force for good, but we are not of the same status as the US or Russia. We tried to retain a world status in line with that of those two superpowers for too long; that damaged our relations with Europe and, in some regards, with the US.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para7"><a name="stpa_7">We have been hesitant about our European role since the second world war. This country is still more hostile to the concept of the European Union than other European countries are. That is a failure of successive Governments to explain to the British people the realpolitik of where we are and what our role might sensibly be in the real world. A consequence for UK-US relations is that the policy of successive Governments has been to try to be best buddy to the US, not only to shore up our global position but potentially to give us advantages. That policy is followed by this Government, too.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para8"><a name="stpa_8">As the United States has grown in its size, global influence, gross domestic product and what it can deliver in the world, it has lost competitors, most notably the Soviet Union. The United Kingdom, however, has diminished in relative importance since 1945. Obviously, the empire has gone, and so have other things. The so-called special relationship seems to have become less and less important to the United States, but paradoxically it is in some ways more and more important to the United Kingdom. We seem to have to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 63WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
give more and more to keep the US interested. That is a cul-de-sac that it would be dangerous to go down. It is time to review our relations with the US in light of the balance of power in the world and the relative strengths of individual countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para9"><a name="stpa_9">We have an unequal relationship, made even less equal by the fact that the US is now the sole superpower, and by the philosophy and approach of President Bush&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his Administration. Unlike previous US Administrations, the Bush Administration have been openly dismissive of the need for consensus in the world and of the views of the rest of the world. By implication, they are also more dismissive of the views of the United Kingdom. That manifests itself in several ways.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para10"><a name="stpa_10">I was sorry to hear of the situation that arose at Abu&nbsp;Ghraib prison in Iraq, which was clearly a flouting of accepted international behaviour. That was regrettable, and in my view the US has not been sufficiently apologetic for that. There is also the issue of Guantanamo Bay, a no-man&#039;s land deliberately set up to hold people without fair trial and without recourse to the normal avenues of justice. People there are not prisoners of war or charged with criminal offences, but are held indefinitely. Of course, to this day there are four Britons held at Guantanamo Bay. Five have been released, it is true, but when they were eventually released it seemed that the reasons why they were held in the first place were less than clear. Certainly, there was no clamour on this side of the Atlantic to press charges against those individuals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para11"><a name="stpa_11">As I say, four UK citizens are still being held, so I&nbsp;welcome the fact that the US Supreme Court recently issued a judgment criticising that situation. Still, we seem to make little progress on the matter. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) said on 25 June:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;The British government should now consider taking legal action in the United States to compel the return of its citizens.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para12"><a name="stpa_12">I have seen no evidence that that is happening.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para13"><a name="stpa_13">The line from the Foreign Office appears to have been unchanged for some time. In June, I asked the Foreign Secretary what steps he intended to take to ensure that British nationals held at Guantanamo Bay were subject to a fair trial or released, and what time scale he had set. The answer given by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), on 5 July was:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;Discussions between the British and US Governments on the situation of the four British detainees at Guantanamo Bay are continuing. The Government will continue to seek to resolve their position. No timescale has been set for this.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5 July 2004; Vol. 423, c. 549W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para14"><a name="stpa_14">That seems an extraordinarily weak response to a serious situation involving British citizens. I doubt whether the British Government would have been so laid back and relaxed had those British nationals been held by another state.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para15"><a name="stpa_15">I do not understand why the British Government have not been more forceful in demanding a regularisation of that position. The answer, I think, is that they do not want to upset the Americans, with whom relations are very important, and that they are not prepared to push the case, even when they have a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 64WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
clearly legitimate case and there is a disagreement on philosophy between them and the US. I happen to think that the Government&#039;s response on many such issues is inherently sound; the trouble is that they will not press&nbsp;them, and give way time and again. That is why I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say that we need to examine the so-called special relationship and why I think that we are now paying too high a price to stay best buddy of President George W.&nbsp;Bush.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para16"><a name="stpa_16">There is also the issue of the prisoners held on death&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;row. I refer particularly to the work done by my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr.&nbsp;Carmichael) on behalf of Kenny Richey. It is intolerable that such a situation should be allowed to drag on indefinitely. I should like to have seen the British Government make a greater effort to resolve that and other similar situations. We have not done ourselves or the US any favours by keeping quiet in public about such matters. The US is now showing a disregard&#151;I do not want to say contempt; that may be a bit strong&#151;for the international rule of law, which it did so much to establish in the post-war era. It was instrumental in creating the international institutions and has done a lot of good for the world as a consequence. It is now dismissing or ignoring those institutions, including on many occasions, I am sorry to say, the United Nations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para17"><a name="stpa_17">We do not seem to have a special relationship when it comes to our prisoners on death row or our people at Guantanamo Bay. The operation of the Extradition Act 2003 is similar in that it gives the United States the power to extradite UK citizens to the US, but does not reciprocate that right to the UK. I am honestly baffled: why are we signing one-sided treaties with the United States that disadvantage us? I hope that the Minister will respond to that. It does not make any sense. We have never had a clear answer to that question, and I hope that we will get one today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para18"><a name="stpa_18">One consequence of the treaty&#151;I have to be very careful about what I say, because I am aware of the legal situation&#151;is that three individuals face extradition to Texas for alleged fraud, involving activities that allegedly took place in London against a British bank. That is of particular concern to me, because one of the individuals, Gary Mulgrew, owns a business&#151;the Allen and Joy building company&#151;which is based in my constituency in Lewes. There is genuine concern among the company&#039;s employees that if the extradition goes ahead, Mr. Mulgrew, who is key to the business, will be perforce out of the country for at least two years, even if charges are subsequently dropped or he is found innocent of them&#151;if they are laid against him in that way. As a consequence, the jobs of 21 people and 40 to 50 subcontractors in my constituency will be at risk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para19"><a name="stpa_19">As I understand it, the Extradition Act was meant to be about not fraud but terrorism. If the allegation involves fraud, a British bank and something that allegedly happened in London, why, if there is evidence to justify the charges, cannot a trial take place in the UK? Why might there be an extradition to Texas? That is another example of the British Government responding weakly to an important matter involving UK citizens.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para20"><a name="stpa_20">The Government&#039;s stance on the middle east is entirely right. The Prime Minister has recognised the need not only for Israel to be secure in its own boundaries but for a viable Palestinian state. Both those 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 65WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
things are correct. To his credit, he also recognised very early on that to deal with terrorism and the instability in the middle east it was necessary to make important progress on the Israel-Palestine situation. He understands that and has said so, as has the Foreign Secretary. I do not doubt that the Foreign Office is quite sound on that matter. However, when President Bush suddenly changes policy, having been lobbied by Ariel Sharon, the Prime Minister, rather than saying, &quot;I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t agree with that&quot;, goes meekly along with the new arrangements and the tearing up of US foreign policy after 20 or 30 years&#039; history. The Prime Minister, who was not consulted on that change, simply goes along with it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para21"><a name="stpa_21">It is important that we stand up for what we believe in, and being good friends to a country does not mean always agreeing with them; it can mean being critical friends. The rest of the world expects us to be critical friends. We are led to believe that behind the scenes the Prime Minister influences the United States, talks to President Bush and, by being supportive in public, can achieve progress in private. I am prepared to accept that that is a possible way forward and might, in some ways, be a sensible diplomatic strategy, but it is not without risk&#151;for example, if we end up tied into Iraq, contrary to public opinion and, possibly, international law.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para22"><a name="stpa_22">I would be happier with that strategy if clear benefits could be demonstrated, but I have yet to see any. We have ended up in&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq in an unfavourable situation, the middle east peace plan is falling apart, and in the examples I have given involving British citizens we have not seen the British Government making substantial progress&#151;not even on the release of prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. There is now something coming down the track to do with missile defence.
</p>






<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41103h01_spnew1"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b>  (LD): Here in the 51st state of the United States of America, many of us are surprised that the Bush campaign refrain, &quot;Four more years&quot;, is missing the preface, &quot;Can we cope with another?&quot; Does my hon. Friend agree that four more years of this rather simplistic cowboys versus Indians and good guys versus bad guys foreign policy will act as an effective recruiting sergeant for psychopathic terrorist organisations? If we have four more years of &quot;God bless America to do what the hell it likes&quot; policy, we will have four more years of global warming, four more years of US corporate supremacy over hopes of finding a resolution to world poverty&#151;

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41103h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b>  (Mr. Edward O&#039;Hara): Order. The hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to catch my eye for a speech.
</p>






<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41103h01_spnew3"><b> Norman Baker </b> : I know where my hon. Friend was going and I agree with him to this extent: I do not think that it is possible to defeat terrorism solely by military means. Terrorism has to be dealt with as a battle for hearts and minds, by persuading friendly nations to come on board in that fight, by respecting international law and conventions and by isolating those who wish to challenge those laws and conventions. The present policy will not achieve the outcome that President Bush 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 66WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
wishes. He needs to change policy to bring on board other countries which would be and are sympathetic to his aims, and certainly were so after 9/11.
</p>






<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41103h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gary Streeter  (South-West Devon)</b>  (Con): I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s speech. Does he think that President Bush picked a fight with global terrorists and invited 9/11 to happen, and does he think that we can negotiate with these people peacefully and reach some kind of settlement? Is not the war against global terror a particularly unusual war, in that it must be won by military means ?
</p>






<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41103h01_spnew5"><b> Norman Baker </b> : Of course President Bush did not invite 9/11. The terrorists operating in al-Qaeda seem to be a different sort and not open to negotiation. However, President Bush can and should persuade others who are not so fanatical to understand the need to challenge al-Qaeda. He can do far more, for example, to bring Arab countries on board and involve them in the fight against terrorism, but at the moment he is alienating them by his treatment of the Palestinians. The Prime Minister understands that, and that is why he is trying to get the middle east peace process back on the road and why President Bush is wrong not to do so. He can do a lot more to isolate the terrorists than he is doing already.
</p>






<p><a name="st_7"><a name="41103h01_spnew6"><b> Andrew George </b> : Does my hon. Friend agree that one failing of the United States is its inability to establish a proper international accord? Does he share my concern that the United Nations has had its priorities and agenda deflected by the United States wishing effectively to go it alone if it cannot get its own way?
</p>






<p><a name="st_8"><a name="41103h01_spnew7"><b> Norman Baker </b> : The United Nations is a very important part of the international jigsaw, which all of us would do well to respect and enhance. After asking several times when vetoes had been exercised by permanent members of the Security Council, I received a parliamentary answer. The last time that we exercised our veto alone was against Rhodesia, as it was then known, in the early 1970s. France and China have hardly ever exercised their vetoes, and Russia&#039;s veto has petered out over the past 10 years. Nearly every single veto&#151;and there have been about 100&#151;has been exercised by the United States. If I can find the relevant parliamentary question in the notes in front of me, I will refer to the exact figures later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para23"><a name="stpa_23">We have a close defence relationship with the United States, and I am not one who says that we should not have that. However, given the apparent weakness of the British Government when dealing with the US, questions naturally arise about the purpose of our engagement with the US, the use of Royal Air Force bases, and whether what is proposed openly or behind the scenes for missile defence is in this country&#039;s interest.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para24"><a name="stpa_24">We have a series of RAF bases that are RAF in name only. On 13 June 2000, I asked the Defence Secretary

<p>



<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 67WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para26"><a name="stpa_26">We have RAF bases that are simply US bases. We ought to be more open and honest with the British people about the engagement process with the United States and the use of the bases, and we should provide an explanation of how that process is in the British national interest.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para27"><a name="stpa_27">Rather than the Government smuggling through the possible deployment of missiles, whether at Menwith Hill, Fylingdales or anywhere else in the United Kingdom, with little debate and no opportunity for comment in Parliament, let alone the wider world, why&nbsp;do they not explain their intentions, thinking and long-term strategy and sell the idea? By behaving surreptitiously and not being up front about those matters, I am afraid that the conclusion is that there is something to hide. That is a matter for the British Government, but it is also a sign of their weakness when dealing with the United States Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para28"><a name="stpa_28">I have mentioned that the present US Government show a disregard for world opinion, which is regrettable. Nowhere is that stronger than on environmental matters. The Minister will be aware that in a statement earlier this year, the Government&#039;s chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, mentioned that in his view climate change represents the biggest threat to the planet, and that it was&#151;to paraphrase him&#151;bigger even than terrorism.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para29"><a name="stpa_29">The Prime Minister has said that he recognises the great need to deal with climate change. He has said how important it is and that he intends to make climate change and Africa the centrepiece of his work during the European Union and G8 presidencies. I will welcome that if he carries it through. I hope that he does so, but he weakened his case by applying to the EU last week for increases in carbon emissions under the emissions trading scheme.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para30"><a name="stpa_30">Be that as it may, the Prime Minister says that he wants to raise the issue in the EU and the G8. If he thinks that it is an important issue and he agrees with his chief scientific adviser that it is more important than terrorism&#151;let us say for the sake of argument that it is as important as terrorism&#151;I presume that he has raised it with President Bush. He has met him many times, he presumably has his ear and he has certainly been to summits with him, but nothing has happened in America with the President and his Administration. The only conclusions are that either the Prime Minister is being disingenuous and telling us that he has raised the matter with the United States when he has not done so, or&#151;this is much more likely&#151;he has raised the issue with the United States and it has paid no attention whatever to his views. That underlines how weak the Government&#039;s influence is over the American Administration. The Prime Minister has given the Americans what they want in Iraq. He has gone along with things and been their best buddy, but he has not got much in return. That is my criticism of UK foreign policy with the United States.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para31"><a name="stpa_31">The Prime Minister has got nothing on climate change. Just about the first thing that President Bush did on coming to office was to abrogate President Clinton&#039;s wish to adhere to the Kyoto treaty. President Bush even suggests that climate change is not happening. He must 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 68WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
be one of the few people in the world still to hold that view. In the meantime, the United States, which accounts for 4 per cent. of the world&#039;s population, is responsible for 25 per cent. of carbon emissions. That is an intolerable position and it is consistently getting worse.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para32"><a name="stpa_32">There is no evidence that President Bush or the American Administration are going to do very much to tackle the situation, but they need to do so. That is not a criticism of the United States, because many states are taking action. In California, both Republicans and Democrats are doing good work&#151;including Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has converted to green politics. A lot of good work is going on and there is investment&#151;some of which President Bush has started, to be fair to him&#151;in the hydrogen economy. However, while the US Administration are in denial about climate change, progress will not be made. The way things are going on climate change, we cannot afford another four years not simply of inactivity but of increasing US emissions. We need to act.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para33"><a name="stpa_33">I am bound to say that President Bush has displayed a total disregard for the environment in any case. He has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repealed several hundred laws and regulations protecting clean air and water, wilderness, and national parks and wetlands, as well as walking away from Kyoto. He has reneged on a pledge to cut power plant carbon dioxide emissions. He has launched his so-called clear skies initiative, under which 48 million extra tonnes of air pollutants will be released each year over US communities. He has also launched a so-called healthy forests initiative, which will increase logging&#151;that is Newspeak if ever I heard it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para34"><a name="stpa_34">President Bush has modified the Clean Air Act to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow power plants to upgrade without installing new&nbsp;anti-pollution equipment. Thankfully, the Appeal Court blocked that. He has announced logging plans for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rainforest in Alaska. He has postponed by several years the deadline by which coal-burning power plants must cut mercury emissions. He has proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act 1973 to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow wildlife collectors to import endangered species. President Bush is by all measurements&#151;this is recognised independently in the US, as well&#151;the worst US President in living memory in terms of protecting the environment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para35"><a name="stpa_35">It is not America generally; it is President Bush and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his Administration. For example, Bill Ford, the chairman and chief executive of the second biggest US car maker, says that he would support higher fuel taxes in exchange for incentives to promote energy-efficient vehicles. So, there is some movement in the US, even in the car industry, but it is not reflected in the Administration, which is a great pity.

What the Americans do

is key for the rest of us, because they are such big polluters and America is such a big country with such a large population. I hope that the Prime Minister will take that forward and that his first action this morning will be to ring up President Bush and say, &quot;George, congratulations on winning the election. Now, can we talk about climate change?&quot; It would be great if that were the first thing that he said, but I doubt very much that it will be.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para38"><a name="stpa_38">One of the reasons why the Americans and President Bush objected to Kyoto&#151;in addition to the potential impact on the US domestic economy&#151;was that 80 per cent. of the world was exempted from compliance. I&nbsp;understand why the Americans object on the basis of exemptions and I suggest that the Prime Minister consider the Liberal Democrat policy of contraction and convergence, which seeks global agreement on reducing carbon emissions and recognises that that reduction must be spread fairly across all countries, including developing countries. If we pursued that line, which is not only environmentally sensible but might be of interest to the United States, it might overcome one of their two objections.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para39"><a name="stpa_39">Such one-sidedness leads me to question the relationship between the UK and the US. We have much in common and have good relations. Many of us, including me, have spent time in the US and enjoyed and learned from it. I was in New York when I was 24. I think that anyone who is 23 or 24 should spend some time in New York. Being in the US is an important part of individual development. We learn much from the US and take a great deal from it. Nothing that I have said is a criticism of the United States as a country. <i>[Laughter.]</i> No, it is a criticism of the US Administration. It is important that that point is made.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para40"><a name="stpa_40">I also criticise successive British Governments for pretending that there is a special relationship; that relationship has withered away. The Prime Minister has tried to be a bridge between the United States and the European Union, but because of the weakness of our position with the US, he has concentrated on one end of the bridge to the exclusion of the other. There is not much evidence of the pursuance of the EU end, and the danger is that the bridge will fall into the water and that the Prime Minister will end up drowning as a consequence. That is not something that I want to happen&#151;it is not in the interests of this country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para41"><a name="stpa_41">I shall finish by quoting the former Minister, David Clark. He was a very good Minister and the only one to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been sacked for trying to implement the Government&#039;s manifesto, by introducing what the Government thought was a too radical right to freedom of information. In an article in <i>The Guardian </i>earlier this month, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;By putting fidelity to the &#039;special relationship&#039; first, we can only weaken Europe&#039;s collective voice and encourage America&#039;s unilateralist impulse, further souring transatlantic relations and leaving us exposed&#151;the choice we have always attempted to avoid. The truth is that if we want a durable transatlantic partnership that works in the common interests of Europe and America, it will only become possible if Britain is prepared to abandon the illusion of &#039;specialness&#039; in relations with America and give priority to the objective of forging a common European approach. This is not primarily a matter of treaties and institutions; it is much more a question of mindset.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="41103h01_para42"><a name="stpa_42">Reinforcing the point that I made about our weak position with the US and the tendency to offer more than we ought, David Clark also said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;It is entirely likely that Blair, in moments of private reflection, understands that he made an enormous mistake in selling his support to George Bush so cheaply.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para43"><a name="stpa_43">I hope that the Prime Minister has realised that that was a mistake and that he will take corrective action in the second Bush term. Our present method of engagement with the US does not help the US or the world, and most of all it does not help us. There is a way forward, but it requires a change of policy from the Government.

<a name="41103h01_time1"><h5>10.3 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41103h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Michael Moore  (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</b>  (LD): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) on securing the debate and on the typically forthright manner in which he put his case. Under normal circumstances, one might say that it was uncanny timing to secure the debate this morning. Unfortunately, the lack of other participants makes it appear that right hon. and hon. Members prefer to celebrate or commiserate about the election, rather than come here to pontificate on it. Perhaps we will have another opportunity, when more of our colleagues will contribute to what is one of the most important foreign policy issues that faces us.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para44"><a name="stpa_44">There is still some uncertainty about the outcome of the US election, although that may end while we are here. Clearly, the protagonists in the presidential election have different world views, but they will undoubtedly face the same challenges. If Mr. Kerry were to win&#151;I&nbsp;appreciate that that now seems unlikely&#151;we might look forward to a more internationalist approach to foreign policy, but he would face serious constraints, some of America&#039;s making and others that reflect the challenges in this new world order. If, as is now almost certain, President Bush wins a second term, we must hope that, in the tradition of second-term presidents, he will focus on solutions to some of the most pressing international problems. Regardless of the outcome, we must do our best to be optimistic that the new American presidential term will offer us an opportunity to develop our relationship with the United States and tackle the fearsome difficulties that face us all.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para45"><a name="stpa_45">We regularly debate in the House and elsewhere the nature of our relationship with the United States, and how special it is or is not. Whatever one&#039;s opinion, the relationship is undeniably unique and strong, but it is not without strains. Its strength is founded on our economic and trading relationship, which is one of the most important that the UK enjoys. There are still extremely close defensive and security ties between the two countries, and underpinning the relationship are the&nbsp;historic links of families, the shared experiences of the world wars and much else besides, which keep the two countries close.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para46"><a name="stpa_46">Undoubtedly the balance has shifted with the end of the cold war and more recently with the new realities after 9/11. In the absence of the Soviet Union and the communist threat that went with it, the glue that bound us together has loosened. The US has parallel interests in the Americas and Asia that alter the balance of its outlook. The United Kingdom and Europe are less

dependent on the United States for security, and increasingly are its competitors in the new globalised economy. In the aftermath of 9/11, we all have a new perspective on what has become a fractured world of new, complex threats with which we are only just getting to grips.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para47"><a name="stpa_47">Whatever the strains, the world needs the United States and Europe to bind together. I strongly believe that the UK has the most important role in facilitating that. As my hon. Friend has remarked, the Prime Minister has often characterised Britain&#039;s position as the bridge between Europe and America. I join my hon. Friend in urging that the Prime Minister and Foreign Office Ministers pay as much attention to both ends of that, so that we can make the most of our unique position in the world. That will be at its height in 2005, with the G8 and European Union presidencies, which will give our position added strength. Britain should be positioned as a committed European country, able to bring together the different parties and not necessarily having to make a choice between Europe and America.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para48"><a name="stpa_48">My hon. Friend has raised some important issues such as Guantanamo Bay, missile defence and the extradition treaty between the UK and the United States, on which I hope that the Minister will have the chance to respond in detail in due course. Those are hugely significant issues that sour our relationship with&nbsp;the United States, and I hope that we will have a constructive reply on them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para49"><a name="stpa_49">One of the most significant issues on which my hon. Friend touched was the environment. As his analysis set out, perhaps on that we have an awful lot more work to do in recognising the scale of the issue facing the whole world and in persuading the Americans, particularly if we are to have President Bush again, that they must play a part. We are pleased that the Kyoto protocol is now to be implemented&#151;it has been long overdue&#151;but, without American participation, there is a huge gap in its effectiveness. We must ensure that we engage with America in that process as a matter of urgency. Whether or not it is the first remark that the Prime Minister makes to the President when they call each other&#151;I&nbsp;suspect that if he calls him this morning, he will get a rather short answer&#151;I hope that it is one of the first issues that the Prime Minister will seek to raise with him.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para50"><a name="stpa_50">My hon. Friend touched only briefly on the situation in Iraq, which is one of the most sensitive issues between our two countries. Sadly, that has become more and more precarious, and we wait with some trepidation to see what might happen in Falluja in the coming days and weeks. Whatever one&#039;s view, it is increasingly obvious that the safety of everyone in that country is more and more at risk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para51"><a name="stpa_51">I do not want to rehearse all the issues in the Chamber again, but the Liberal Democrats remain deeply concerned about this country&#039;s engagement in Iraq and the prospects of developing a realistic and early exit strategy. We all want the elections next January and the year after to succeed, but we must be realistic about the difficulties, which seem to be intensifying rather than ebbing away.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para52"><a name="stpa_52">The latest deployment of United Kingdom troops offers us the prospect of mission creep in Britain&#039;s contribution to the coalition efforts, and it is still

<br>&nbsp;<br>
uncertain what will happen once the Black Watch return and other British troops have to be deployed in their place. I hope that the Minister will expand further on explanations given to the House about the long-term exit strategy. We believe that, unless we make it clear to those in Iraq, whether they are terrorists, or the ordinary people of Iraq seeking democratically to go about their business and to make their life, that there is the prospect of a phased withdrawal of coalition forces that is tied to key events such as the elections, there is little prospect of genuine Iraqi sovereignty being passed to the people of Iraq.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para53"><a name="stpa_53">My hon. Friend spent some time discussing the difficulties in the middle east, which must also be an early priority for the new presidential term. The quartet&#039;s activities in the past year have been subsumed into the American election timetable. That is a basic reflection of the realities. The United States is by far the most important of the parties in the quartet, but it is important that Britain, in its role in the European Union and as a key member of the United Nations Security Council, ensures that the road map is given new impetus and offers the Palestinians a realistic prospect of realising their dream of a viable separate state. We all want Israel and Palestine to live in peace and side by side in viable separate states. We now need the international political will to achieve that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para54"><a name="stpa_54">International terrorism, whether or not the middle east and Iraq are the key drivers of its growth, is one of the most worrying and misunderstood threats to the world as a whole. None of us can be experts on it and offer a simple solution. I accept what the Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter), said in an intervention about our being duty-bound to tackle international terrorism militarily where necessary, but we must recognise the need to tackle the underlying causes that give rise to it, which either President Kerry or President Bush will be uniquely placed to do.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para55"><a name="stpa_55">We should not, however, lose sight of nuclear proliferation, which is a separate issue that has sometimes been lost in the grander debates. In the aftermath of the cold war, there is a danger of becoming increasingly complacent about the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation. We are acutely aware of the situation in North Korea, we are all very anxious about what is happening in Iran, and it goes without saying that we do not want international terrorists to obtain nuclear weapons. However, we in the international community must sharpen up our act on that score. In a recent debate in this Chamber, I characterised the situation with regard to Iran as the Europeans having too many carrots and not enough sticks and the Americans operating in the opposite way. We must bring about convergence between the American and European approaches to tackling Iran and we must hope that, by succeeding there, we will offer the prospect of a reduced risk of proliferation in other parts of the world.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41103h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Moore </b> : I spoke in shorthand to a degree. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the debate that we had on Iran in this very Room a couple of weeks ago. He may have been present at it in a silent capacity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para56"><a name="stpa_56">My criticism is that, although the European Union has offered the prospect of alternatives for Iran to supply a civil nuclear programme, it has not been clear-cut enough about the economic sanctions that would kick in were Iran not to proceed with that programme. My view of the American position is that it has been too willing to see an early reference to the Security Council on Iran without offering the country a way out through developments. The EU and the Government are to be commended for working with France and Germany to develop our position on Iran. However, Europe has offered too many carrots and not enough sticks, and the United States vice versa. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman and I will continue to have a difference of opinion on the matter, but I hope that I have been able to clarify what I think.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para57"><a name="stpa_57">Many of the different problems come together in the United Nations. In recent times, that has been the location of fraught battles involving the United States, Britain and other allies. Not least because of Britain&#039;s role in the G8, I hope that we will have an opportunity to revisit the way in which America relates to other countries within the UN. We will have a crucial test in a few weeks when the Secretary-General&#039;s high-level panel produces its report on the development of reform in the UN. That will go to the heart of the debate about what legitimises interventions in other countries. It is important that our Government and the Americans engage in the debate that comes out of that report at the earliest opportunity and at the most senior levels. We must recognise that in this fraught world the strength of the UN is a key to maintaining peace.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para58"><a name="stpa_58">The United Kingdom&#039;s historic ties with America&#151;our shared interests and the common threats we face&#151;make the relationship between the two countries strong and unique. Irrespective of the outcome of the presidential contest, we have new opportunities to work with the United States to tackle the serious challenges facing the world. Instinctively, we always seek to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, but we must not lose our ability to be constructively critical or to strike out in a different direction when our interests diverge. The biggest challenge facing our Government is to persuade the American Administration to re-engage with Europe and to broaden the base of its international diplomacy and engagement. With the imminent presidency of the G8 and the later presidency of the EU, the timing has rarely been better.

<a name="41103h01_para59"><a name="stpa_59">I think that we can now say that President Bush will win the election. I may be the only person in the Chamber today to do so, but I welcome that. It is a good result and I welcome the fact that the Republican party&#151;our sister party&#151;has strengthened its position in the Senate and Congress. I imagine that the Minister has mixed feelings about the outcome, but I believe that it is strong and positive. I welcome the fact that President Bush seems to have won the popular vote by more than 3 million and that there was a high turnout. Let us hope that we have a high turnout here on 5 May 2005, which we all know will be the date of the next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;general election in this country, despite the smokescreens last weekend. It is good news for America that it has apparently delivered a decisive outcome.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para60"><a name="stpa_60">I recognise that the BBC will be in mourning about the result, as will many colleagues. Some people love to criticise America. The hon. Member for Lewes did so&#151;although he made some important points about the environment and other issues&#151;in the general thrust of his comments about the Bush Administration and, by implication, America and its role in the world in recent years. I caution those who love to criticise America&#151;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall make some specific criticisms in a moment. The&nbsp;world would be a very different and much more dangerous place if America&#039;s present President or a future President decided to take their bat and ball home and to exercise a more isolationist policy. I do not think that that would be in the interests of the world. It would be an alarming state of affairs, so let us be more positive in welcoming America&#039;s contribution to the world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para61"><a name="stpa_61">When we were approaching the run-up to the most recent war in Iraq, the Prime Minister said in the House of Commons&#151;it must be true, because he said it&#151;that the military might of the USA was the equivalent of the&nbsp;combined military might of the next 27 strongest countries in the world put together. I sometimes reflect on that. It is no wonder that America is the world&#039;s only hyperpower. Never before has one country dominated global events in such a way. I believe that 25 per cent. of the global economy is generated in the United States; it is truly a hyperpower and we must work with it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para62"><a name="stpa_62">I admire George Bush and believe that he has strong values. I prefer political leaders to have a strong sense of direction and values rather than to be all men for all seasons. I admire his leadership, but there is one reason in particular for celebrating his victory: a second-term US President has a much stronger chance of effective intervention in the middle east peace process than a first-term President, whether Democrat or Republican. If there is just one matter on which we need to see progress in the next few months it is the middle east peace process. We need to bring the parties together, to get them talking again and to reach some sort of settlement.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para63"><a name="stpa_63">The middle east peace process is unusual because the&nbsp;contours of a settlement are clear to all sides. It is important to get the parties together, to make them talk and to thrash out the detail. I welcome the commitment that the Prime Minister expressed at the Labour party&nbsp;conference to re-engage with the issue after the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presidential election. A second-term American President and a re-engaged British Prime Minister are a welcome recipe, because there are no issues more important in the world today than resolving that conflict. If we are to resolve or diminish the underlying causes of the war against terror, the most important 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 75WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
thing that we can do, apart from taking a gradual approach and attacking global poverty, is to resolve the running sore of the middle east conflict.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para64"><a name="stpa_64">It seems that everyone in this country loves to attack America, and I have done my share of that in the past. I often think of a conversation that I had with a Syrian business man in Syria when sitting under a star-filled sky in a beautiful part of the world enjoying a wonderful meal together. I asked the sort of question one asks at about 11 o&#039;clock at night when the conversation is beginning to dry up. I asked him what he thought was the best country in the world. He was a widely travelled man and I thought that he might say Syria or Lebanon or another country in that region. He thought for a while and then said, &quot;Without a shadow of a doubt, the United States of America.&quot; That answer surprised me somewhat and I asked him why he had said that. He said, &quot;Because the one thing about the US of A is that people there have freedom, and what I would give for that sort of freedom in this country and throughout many parts of the middle east and the rest of the world.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para65"><a name="stpa_65">When we attack the United States, we should sometimes remind ourselves that the US is the land of the free. In many other parts of the world&#151;in most African countries, in China, in many central Asian countries and in Latin American countries&#151;people would be very pleased to swap living standards and their level of freedom for those enjoyed by Americans. We must not lose sight of that important point.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para66"><a name="stpa_66">If one considers the role that America has played in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;global events in the past 50 years, one must admit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that, although many mistakes have been made, America has largely been a force for good. The American intervention in world war two helped us to win the war on tyranny. The cold war was a long and difficult process, but in the end, the war against communism was won. I wonder where we would be today if the war against communism had been lost and Russia and the Soviet Union, not the west, had become the dominant world power. Where would this country be today? Would we be having this debate? Would we be having any debates at all?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para67"><a name="stpa_67">We are now engaged in a war against terror, and we want to ensure that that war is won. I absolutely agree with the hon. Members for Lewes and for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale that the war against terror cannot be won by military means alone and that we must deal with the underlying causes. I accept that we must engage in the middle east peace process and tackle global poverty and the alienation felt by many, but we seem to be dealing with a group of people who do not have a political agenda and whose intentions are to create terror and chaos in the west and to bring it down. That must be dealt with militarily.

<a name="41103h01_para68"><a name="stpa_68">I am unashamedly pro-American. I am an Atlanticist, and I rejoice in the special relationship. How could I not be, when I represent a city from which the Mayflower set out in the 1660s and helped to found the land of the free? I was pleased when the Prime Minister said in the run-up to the Iraq debate that for him our special relationship was an article of faith. I know that that did not go down too well in his own party, but I, too, believe

in the special relationship. One of the most important planks of UK foreign policy is that we stand shoulder to shoulder with our American cousins and friends.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para69"><a name="stpa_69">That policy does not, however, mean that we are the poodle of Bush or of any other President. It does not mean that when the American President says, &quot;Jump,&quot; we say, &quot;How high?&quot; It does mean that we should be a candid friend. During those 18 glorious years of Conservative rule in this country recently, when we enjoyed a special relationship with American Presidents of different colours, there were many times when we were critical of them and influenced American opinion. I could go into detail, but I do not want to do that now. I want to give the Minister plenty of time to respond to this debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para70"><a name="stpa_70">I sometimes think that our special relationship may have become a little lop-sided. Our support for the Iraqi war was very welcome indeed, bearing in mind that British involvement took engagement in the war from being solely American to one involving a coalition. Other countries were involved, but without us, one could not claim that there was a coalition. It is therefore important to President Bush that we were there alongside him. The deal appears to have been that we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would have a new initiative on the middle east peace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process&#151;a fair exchange. The road map was announced, which was very welcome, but there was not the follow-through that we would have liked. We should have insisted that a special envoy be put in place in Jerusalem to see that matter through, with the full authority of the American President. That did not happen. We have a second chance now, and I very much hope that it will be taken.

<a name="41103h01_para71"><a name="stpa_71">There may well be a surge of confidence among Republicans, having won the popular vote fairly decisively&#151;at least, there may be when we finally add up all the numbers. In the next few weeks, we must think through some very sensitive global issues, not least Iran and North Korea, which need to be resolved. We do not, however, want any American President, especially President Bush, to reach for hobnailed boots in which to stamp all over those situations. The UK can and must be a voice of reason to temper that sort of American confidence. There are some things that America does so well, but cultural sensitivity, peacekeeping and sensitive diplomacy are not necessarily the first things that come to mind when one lists the qualities of our American friends.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para72"><a name="stpa_72">I have been critical about other issues in the past. I&nbsp;agree that the Guantanamo Bay policy was bad; there have been human rights abuses and it has been a public relations disaster. I wish it were otherwise, and even now I hope that the American President will change that policy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para73"><a name="stpa_73">Not long ago in this very Chamber we had a debate about the treatment of UK citizens by United States immigration officials. Some UK nationals have been handcuffed and manacled in United States airports simply because, for example, they did not have the right visa. That is an overreaction, and we would do well to ensure that the special relationship is a two-way street. We must ensure that that kind of abuse is ended. The Minister might want to comment on that.

Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale that we have to see things through in Iraq; there is no plan B. We must ensure that the January elections take place; we must commit sufficient resources to make that happen. The hon. Gentleman talks about an early disengagement plan; I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would like that, too. However, the most important thing is to get the job done. We must see Iraq through to a period of democracy and prosperity. We must face down the insurgents, many of whom have come from other countries. We must also see the war on terror through; there must be no let-up on that. I mentioned Iran and North Korea; these issues need to be grappled with in the coming months.

<a name="41103h01_para75"><a name="stpa_75">I had a meeting with the British Council recently, in which I was informed that within a few years the majority of American middle management will be of Hispanic rather than Anglo-Saxon extraction. The gathering momentum of that change in the United States may lead to a change in the nature of our special relationship, which is largely cultural, historical and relational. Therefore, there are issues that we will need to address if we are to manage the relationship well over the coming years. However, I believe that the special relationship is crucial to our country&#039;s foreign policy, and that in it we can have the best of both worlds. We&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can have a close working relationship with our American cousins and full engagement with our EU partners, and we can make our own unique contribution to the world, bearing in mind those two relationships. The United Kingdom&#039;s special contribution is to promote democracy and good governance and to be at the forefront of the attack on global poverty. We are no longer a superpower, but we have a unique role and we must play it to the full.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="41103h01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Trade and Investment  (Mr. Douglas Alexander) </b> : I join the hon. Members for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) and for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) in congratulating the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) on securing this debate, on this day of all days, on the United Kingdom&#039;s relationship with the United States. It is a huge topic, and many Members of Parliament&#151;not just those who are present in this Room&#151;have a view on at least one or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two aspects of the special relationship. Although disagreements have emerged, there has also been some common ground, not least between the Front-Bench spokesmen. I welcome the opportunity to present the Government&#039;s view on the relationship as a whole, and I will seek to address at least some of the specific issues that have been raised in this wide-ranging debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para76"><a name="stpa_76">In some parts of the United States, the polls closed only a few hours ago. Tempting though it is to be the first Government voice to speak on the outcome of that election, it would be injudicious of me to do so, not least because I imagine that more senior Government figures than me will be making comments. Therefore, I trust that hon. Members will understand if I resist saying anything about the outcome; it would be speculation at this point&#151;at least it was when we entered the Room. Needless to say, the United Kingdom will work closely with whoever wins, to ensure that our partnership remains a positive influence on the global stage.

<br>

<p>
<a name="41103h01_para77"><a name="stpa_77">Britain&#039;s relationship with the United States is, and will remain, the most important of our bilateral ties. We share common values, as the hon. Member for South-West Devon acknowledged, and those values outweigh our differences on particular issues. The United States is crucial to the achievement of the UK&#039;s international strategic priorities; I will develop that point in my response to the remarks of the hon. Member for Lewes. Both countries believe in freedom and security for all and will continue to work together to combat global terrorism. We also want the global divisions between the haves and have-nots to be narrowed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para78"><a name="stpa_78">As well as our shared values, we have other close ties. Our two countries are each other&#039;s largest foreign investors, supporting millions of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Given my ministerial responsibilities for trade, that is a matter of direct concern to me. The US-UK trade relationship is worth &#163;60 billion a year, of which half originates in the UK and half in the US. In areas as diverse as science and technology, health, urban redevelopment and law&#151;issues that we did not cover today&#151;our experts exchange best practice knowledge to improve the quality of life for us all and for future generations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para79"><a name="stpa_79">With the greatest respect, I hope that the hon. Member for Lewes will forgive me for saying that the proposition of being lectured by a Liberal Democrat on what it requires to stand up for what one believes in is at least curious. To balance that, I should say that the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, made a far more measured and insightful contribution to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debate; there is a fair amount of common ground between us.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para80"><a name="stpa_80">If I interpreted the hon. Member for Lewes correctly, his fundamental argument on a range of issues is that the USA&#039;s taking a different position to the UK is somehow in and of itself evidence of the failure of British foreign policy. He seemed to be saying that if there is any disagreement, there cannot be any influence on the international stage. I urge him to consider an alternative proposition. Just like the UK, the US develops policies on the basis of its national interest. The challenge for our international relations is to strengthen our influence, recognising that of course there will be disagreements between even the strongest friends. From time to time, all true friends argue and debate with each other the merits of their respective standpoints. It is not always constructive to do so publicly, but it is healthy to admit any differences.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para81"><a name="stpa_81">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Kyoto. The UK&#039;s objective, as regards Kyoto and other issues mentioned, is to work with the United States to find mutually agreeable solutions. We will continue to do so, both bilaterally and by working with the United States in multilateral institutions. Of course, we will encourage the US to play a leading role in strengthening those institutions in years to come, as we share common values on our view of the global community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para82"><a name="stpa_82">The hon. Gentleman&#039;s speech ranged widely, from the latest polls in <i>The Guardian </i>to the historic Yalta summit. Personally, I had greater sympathy with the more generous acknowledgement of the hon. Member for South-West Devon of the US&#039;s contribution to the cold war and to securing victory in the second world war.

<p>
<a name="41103h01_para83"><a name="stpa_83">I fear that the hon. Member for Lewes inadvertently made an error by suggesting that the David Clark from <i>The Guardian</i> whom he quoted was the former Cabinet Office Minister, Lord Clark of Windermere. I suspect rather that he is David Clark, former special adviser, who writes somewhat more frequently on foreign affairs than the other. I say that with feeling, because David Clark and I are friends. We were contemporaries at Edinburgh university, and if my memory serves me correctly, notwithstanding his membership of the Edinburgh University Labour club, he had been a member of the Young Liberals in the borders of Scotland, so perhaps he is returning from whence he came.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para84"><a name="stpa_84">Let me deal with some of the more substantive points raised. On the Extradition Act 2003, on which the Home Office leads for the Government, I am of course willing to raise the matter identified by the hon. Gentleman with my colleagues in the Home Office. In relation to the death penalty, it might be helpful to set out the position. There are 38 states in the US that still have the death penalty on their statute books, as well as the US federal and military courts. We have repeatedly made clear our opposition to the death penalty, and regularly engage on the subject with US authorities, particularly when a British citizen is involved.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para85"><a name="stpa_85">The UK opposes the death penalty in all circumstances. Capital punishment has no place in a modern democratic society in the view of this Government. Along with EU partners, we make regular representations to the United States, urging it to abolish the death penalty. The United States Government are in no doubt about our views, and we shall continue expressing our opposition to that practice at every opportunity.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para86"><a name="stpa_86">On Guantanamo Bay and the detainees, we have long&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expressed our reservations about the military commissions, and the US Government suspended all legal proceedings against them at our request soon after two UK detainees were designated in July 2003. After a lengthy series of discussions with the United States, led by our Attorney-General, the Government concluded that the military commissions process would not provide sufficient guarantee of a fair trial according to international standards, so we requested that the nine detainees be returned to the UK. Further discussions at official level explored whether there was any prospect of providing an alternative trial process to the military commissions envisaged, but it has not proved possible to reach agreement.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para87"><a name="stpa_87">Five of the detainees have been returned, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged. Following a visit by officials to Washington in late May, the Prime Minister repeated our request that the remaining four detainees be returned to the United Kingdom. I respectfully suggest that no Government have done as much for their nationals detained at Guantanamo Bay or looked after the welfare of their nationals better than the United Kingdom. We have visited our people more often and&nbsp;have worked harder to resolve the position of the British detainees. We have held more frequent and higher-level talks with the United States Government than any other Government and, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, we have successfully secured the return 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
of five British detainees. We will continue to request at the highest levels the return of the remaining four detainees. Our discussions with the United States continue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para88"><a name="stpa_88">I turn to the broad issue that in many ways underpinned the speeches of the hon. Members for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and for South-West Devon&#151;the centrality and importance of the middle east peace process, not least in light of the anticipated results that were referred to earlier. The middle east peace process remains one of the UK&#039;s highest foreign policy priorities. As was acknowledged by the hon. Member for South-West Devon, the Prime Minister, speaking at the Labour party conference in September, reiterated the depth of his personal commitment to the middle east peace process and pledged to make progress on resolving the conflict a personal priority.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para89"><a name="stpa_89">The United States engagement on the middle east peace process remains critical. We continue to work with the United States and other quartet members to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find avenues for progress and ways in which to inject&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new momentum into the peace process, in inevitably difficult and complex circumstances. We remain committed to helping the parties to implement the road map and to achieve a comprehensive and just settlement. The Prime Minister firmly believes that the road map is the right way forward. The US has made it clear that it agrees. We intend to do all that we can to see it implemented in the months and years ahead.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para90"><a name="stpa_90">Prime Minister Sharon&#039;s plan to withdraw all settlements from Gaza and some from the west bank is a real opportunity for progress given that, frankly, little progress has been made for many months. We hope to&nbsp;see a withdrawal as soon and as fully as possible. On&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26 October, the Knesset voted in favour of disengagement and that was a welcome step towards that goal. Over the coming weeks, we hope to see the parties preparing for disengagement and co-ordinating their efforts. The key will be to see the plan implemented with both sides working to make it a success and taking full advantage of the opportunity to inject forward momentum into the road map process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para91"><a name="stpa_91">We and the United States, along with the rest of the international community, have a vital role to play in consultation with the parties, in preparing the ground for withdrawal and in doing all that we can to make it a success, both for Israel and the Palestinians. It is essential that the quartet leads the international community&#039;s involvement. At the same time, the quartet and the parties need to keep their eyes on the bigger objective: negotiations on a final settlement to the conflict. The recent quartet statement of 22 September set out a balanced and constructive way forward. We are supporting the Palestinian Authority in their efforts to improve the security situation in the Gaza strip and the west bank. We believe that that will benefit both sides. Candidly, of course much more work still needs to be done, but we have been encouraged by the possibility of making further progress in the months ahead.
</p>






<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41103h01_spnew12"><b> Norman Baker </b> : Will the Minister confirm that the British Government remain opposed to the construction of the wall on Palestinian territory? Will he also confirm that the Government are asking the United States to put pressure on Israel to discontinue its construction?

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41103h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Alexander </b> : The position of the British Government remains unchanged in respect of the barrier, not least in respect of its location on what has previously been Palestinian territory. We have made clear our views directly to the Israelis about that. The matter has formed the basis of discussions between ourselves, the Americans and the other quartet partners, as part of the much wider discussions to which I have referred.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para92"><a name="stpa_92">The issue of climate change is close to the heart of the hon. Member for Lewes and he has much expertise on it. As he acknowledged, the United States is the world&#039;s biggest contributor to climate change. It is therefore essential that, as a country, it is involved fully in global efforts. We remain confident that future international action will include the United States.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para93"><a name="stpa_93">From the Prime Minister down&#151;he has particular views on what should be at least the second few words that he says to the President, if the situation turns out as he envisages&#151;and through the work of Ministers and officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of Science and Technology, the United Kingdom is working hard to convince policy makers in the United States that their main fear that reducing emissions will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harm economic growth is groundless. The United Kingdom has shown that. The UK economy grew by 36&nbsp;per cent. between 1990 and 2002, while greenhouse gas emissions fell by about 15 per cent.; but some still clearly need persuading of that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para94"><a name="stpa_94">The United States Government&#039;s position against Kyoto is a matter of record. In 1997, the US Senate&#151;notwithstanding the changes to the Senate that seem to be emerging this morning&#151;voted 95 to zero in favour of a resolution that stated that it would refuse to ratify such a treaty. I doubt that time has shifted the numbers radically, and in light of the observations on the composition of the new Senate, there may not have been significant change overnight on that matter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para95"><a name="stpa_95">It is essential to ensure that the United States is fully engaged in international discussions on how to advance beyond Kyoto. Of course, the United States remains a signatory to the United Nations convention on climate

<br>&nbsp;<br>
change, and regardless of the outcome of the elections we will continue to press the United States to re-engage with international efforts to tackle the matter. After all, a change in the Administration will not cause an overnight change on emissions policy.

<p>
<a name="41103h01_para96"><a name="stpa_96">The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale raised specifically the matter of Iraq, and I&nbsp;will seek to respond to his question on withdrawal. As&nbsp;the Foreign Secretary made clear in the House on 10&nbsp;September 2003:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;We do not want to stay, nor will we stay, in Iraq for a moment longer than is necessary.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 10 September 2003; Vol. 410, c. 403.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para97"><a name="stpa_97">Our task is to help the Iraqi people rapidly build a nation from the ashes of Saddam&#039;s dictatorship. We are&nbsp;doing all we can to help that happen, together with the United States and our allies in the coalition, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process is well under way. The Iraqi Interim Government are committed to holding elections in January, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, and they are on track to meet that deadline.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para98"><a name="stpa_98">Iraqis want elections. The hon. Member for South-West Devon spoke eloquently of the importance of freedom, and we are convinced that the Iraqi people share the ambition for free, democratic elections. That is borne out by all the recent opinion polls and discussion in Iraq. We believe that we are working towards that January deadline for elections.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h01_para99"><a name="stpa_99">This debate could go on for a long time. It not only underlines the breadth and depth of our relationship with the United States but frankly acknowledges that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we disagree on certain issues, notwithstanding the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enduring strength of that relationship. Today&#039;s debate&#151;given its timing&#151;will not be the last word on the issues raised, and I suspect that it will not be the last word spoken in the House today on the subject. However, I assure the Chamber that we in the Government will seek to work with the next Administration, of whatever hue, as we advance together our national interests on the international stage.

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="41103h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ian Liddell-Grainger  (Bridgwater)</b>  (Con): I am grateful to be able to speak on rural schools. I do not want to change the heading, but &quot;Rural Schools (Somerset)&quot; might be the more obvious title.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para0"><a name="stpa_100">Today is not the first time that I have been fortunate enough to secure a debate on this important subject. The Minister and I have faced each other in this Chamber on rather too many occasions. It is almost becoming a habit, but I do not make any apology for that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para1"><a name="stpa_101">The vast majority of my constituency is incredibly rural. Some of those areas have enormous rural deprivation, far beyond that in Scotland and probably in most of Wales. Unfortunately, because trade is seasonal, unemployment rates are high. Rural poverty, which is not the same as what is understood more generally by poverty, is more commonplace than most people realise. Unfortunately, crime in rural areas is slowly but inexorably creeping up. That is not because there are not the police; it is because people realise that it is easy to come out of Bristol, commit a crime and go back up the M5 to Bristol. It is a problem that the chief constable, Mr. Steve Pilkington, has endeavoured to resolve over the past few years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para2"><a name="stpa_102">I fear that the business of educating young people in such places is often overlooked at the top. It is terribly easy to see just the pretty side of school life. We have an idyllic view of school. Perhaps we are thinking back to&nbsp;when we were young. We imagine the little villages, the quaint old school buildings, the magnificent surrounding countryside and, as we work in London, the fresh air&#151;unless anyone was at the American embassy last night, where there was more fresh air than could be believed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para3"><a name="stpa_103">The problem of education in rural areas such as Exmoor and West Somerset runs incredibly deep and has done for 20 to 30 years. It often seems to be bypassed by policy makers of all persuasions&#151;it does not matter of which Government or party. That is why I am raising the subject again. Unfortunately, nothing has materially changed since I held my previous debate on the subject. Indeed, there is a danger that some of the problems that we are facing may be getting worse.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para4"><a name="stpa_104">I would like to cover three specific concerns. The first is the recruitment and retention of teachers in rural areas&#151;the Minister is well aware of that. The second is the enormous financial burden of school transport. I&nbsp;suspect that that is a problem faced by every rural county, or any urban authority that has to bus children in. I would loosely say that the third is the role of the education authority, but what I am trying to narrow it down to is the way in which the authority deals with special needs and statementing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para5"><a name="stpa_105">I want to paint a picture of a school career from a child&#039;s perspective&#151;I seem to have to go back a long time to remember that. It is rather a frightening journey to contemplate. It starts with the friendly local first school, which sometimes has fewer than 30 pupils. We know the problems that that can cause. A few years down the line, the child goes to one of the three middle schools, which are much bigger and, unfortunately, by virtue of that, much further away.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 84WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para6"><a name="stpa_106">Alternatively, there are two&#151;or in my case, five&#151;excellent community colleges, which are miles apart and have upwards of 1,200 young pupils each. There is only one community college in the whole of West Somerset. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am told&#151;the Minister will probably bear this out&#151;that you can fit London into that area. There are four community colleges in Bridgwater.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para7"><a name="stpa_107">In a few years, a child in West Somerset will become, dare I say it, in London terms, a baggy-eyed commuter. They will be plucked from a tiny village school and bunged on a bus. Sometimes, the daily journey equals the amount of time spent studying. A child from Dulverton, which is not in my constituency but in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Flook), who unfortunately cannot be present, will be on a bus for over an hour to get to the community college. An enormous distance is involved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para8"><a name="stpa_108">For a Member of Parliament who represents an urban area, such as the Minister, the situation is sometimes difficult to comprehend, because urban seats are much smaller. At the end of a typical week of schooling, I look at the eyes of some of the children in my constituency: they look tired and I believe that they are tired. Apart from the first few happy years, when the school is just down the road, children leave home early to catch a bus that meanders along winding roads for mile after trying mile. If a person lives in a hamlet on Exmoor, in the Somerset Levels or in the Quantocks and their destination is the West Somerset community schools&#151;Blake, Haygrove, East Bridgwater or Chilton Trinity technology college&#151;they have to be out of bed by half- past six and on the bus by just after seven o&#039;clock in the morning. They will probably not get home until after five.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para9"><a name="stpa_109">The cost of daily transportation beggars belief. It always staggers me. I will come on to the details of that later. By the time that the Minister gets to his desk each morning, many of the children in my constituency will have been on the road for two hours. While he sips his steamy latte, although I do not know whether he drinks latte, they get bounced and swung through the lanes of Bridgwater in West Somerset; I suppose that a latte would have become a cappuccino by then. The school day in London lasts five hours. The school day in West Somerset and Bridgwater can last nine hours, simply because of distance. Children going to the two specialist schools in my constituency, Elmwood and Penrose, need a lot of care, but may be travelling for longer because they may be brought from without the county. As the Minister has kindly said, those two schools are marvellous.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para10"><a name="stpa_110">The Minister may care to think back to the much trumpeted launch of the Government rural White Paper, which set out to fix the standards of life in rural constituencies such as mine. The idea was to have rural proofing in every aspect of Government business, and that included education. The Minister will not be able to answer this, but what happened to that White Paper, its ideas and ideals? Come to think of it, what happened to the money that we thought was going to come with it? I&nbsp;cannot answer that question. We have a problem, because one cannot expect local education authorities in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 85WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
rural areas to meet the idealistic aspirations of rural proofing without a great big fat wad of the folding stuff to make it happen.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para11"><a name="stpa_111">Money, or the lack of it, is one of the abiding problems for teacher recruitment and retention in areas such as mine. There is an excellent TV advert campaign for teacher recruitment. I do not know who did it, but it is very good. It shows the rest of us leaving our heads at home when we go to work. The people shown who use their heads are those who teach.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para12"><a name="stpa_112">That is the ideal, but I am afraid that the truth is different. Sometimes, teachers who use their heads think long and hard before coming to work in very rural areas such as Sedgemoor in West Somerset. It is a beautiful place. I recommend it to the Minister if he has not been. As he knows, it has excellent schools. However, housing and transport are a problem. Very big money is needed to buy anything but the humblest home on Exmoor and&nbsp;in the Quantocks. On the level of pay, it is more expensive to live in West Somerset than in London. That is a frightening statistic on what it costs to live in my area. Prices are slowing&#151;the economy is changing a little&#151;but they are still too high for almost everybody, including teachers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para13"><a name="stpa_113">In many cases, that means that teachers, like children, end up clocking more and more hours every day getting to school because they cannot afford to live near the schools where they teach. That is simply because of the price. They may have to commute from Bridgwater to West Somerset or from Taunton. They are forced to live where they can, and the one abiding thing is that that is always miles away.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para14"><a name="stpa_114">There are three vacancies at the West Somerset community college. It is looking for a top-notch music and art teacher, a lunchtime supervisor and a very good technician to keep its IT equipment in order. The Minister will remember that the college got technology status through the Government&#039;s kindness. Such jobs are very worth while, but the people best qualified to apply may be based on the other side of the county, or possibly beyond it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para15"><a name="stpa_115">I hope that those vacancies and all others will be filled&#151;and quickly. However, I am disturbed by the rapid turnover of teachers in our schools. I do not have a ready answer to the fundamental problems and I am not sure that the Minister has. We as a nation need to address that fundamental question. I know one thing&#151;money talks. I also know that without money there will always be recruitment and retention problems. The Minister will realise that the national figure underlines that point. For every 100 students who complete their courses and become teachers, 68 drop out of the profession for ever within three years. That is not a good statistic&#151;two thirds gone. I do not know what can be done about it. Those figures are from the Minister&#039;s Department.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para16"><a name="stpa_116">If rural proofing means anything, it should mean financing a palpably higher level of education. There should be an allowance to help to attract the best teachers. That is a difficult concept. There should be more generous financial arrangements to help to pay for those long grim bus journeys to school.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para17"><a name="stpa_117">A few weeks ago, the Minister announced that the Government&#039;s proposal for a new, green, safe, healthy school transport policy&#151;after being at the American

<br>&nbsp;<br>
embassy all night, that is a tongue-twister&#151;would become legislation as soon as time allowed, despite severe criticism of the Government&#039;s ideas from the Select Committee on Education and Skills. I suggest that the Committee keeps pushing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para18"><a name="stpa_118">The proposal involves, for the first time, means-testing. There would be no guarantee of a free bus ride if someone lives far from school. Under the Government&#039;s plans, it will be a question of how much mum and dad own. When suggesting means-testing, will the Minister please bear in mind the rural areas where we do not have that level of support? However, I am less concerned with means-testing than I am with the ethos of the School Transport Bill.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para19"><a name="stpa_119">In a press statement a couple of weeks ago, the Minister admitted that the Government spend &#163;500&nbsp;million on school transport every year. I get the impression that he would prefer to spend a lot less. I&nbsp;expect that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would prefer to spend a lot less. I get the distinct impression that the Bill is being drawn up from an urban perspective rather than a rural one. I am happy to take the Minister&#039;s views on that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para20"><a name="stpa_120">The Minister claimed that 40 per cent. of primary school pupils and 20 per cent. of secondary school pupils are driven to school by car and that most of those journeys are less than two miles. The implication is that those journeys are unnecessary. In urban areas, I could not agree more.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para21"><a name="stpa_121">I wonder whether the Minister would like to come to West Somerset to see some of the problems that we face in rural areas. I am sure that he would be welcomed. For us, the school bus run is not a luxury but a necessity. We have no choice but to take the bus&#151;the distances are long and the journey is difficult. If the Bill includes a threat to the essential financing of school transport, the Minister will realise that people such as me who represent rural constituencies will have to oppose the Bill. We cannot see the benefits for rural areas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para22"><a name="stpa_122">I will try to persuade the Minister to treat Somerset and other rural areas more generously with a view to the problems that we face. That leads me to the role of the education authority and Somerset county council. There are several issues on which I invite the Minister to comment if he can. The first is potentially controversial. I refer to the needs of children with special needs. For those children, statements are made in order to trigger a statutory protest and to obtain classroom help. There is a widespread feeling in my constituency that the county issues statements on children too late. Learning and behavioural problems are identified early, but those children are only officially statemented after much of the damage has been done to the children&#039;s well-being, growth and inclusion in the class.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para23"><a name="stpa_123">I will not identify specific schools, although I have had incidents in which head teachers and parents have come to me. I ask the Minister whether he will, through his Department, inquire whether that is a problem in the county. Somerset county council will obviously deny that there is a problem and I understand why, because statementing is always difficult. It costs a lot of money and one is never sure that one has done the right thing.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 87WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para24"><a name="stpa_124">Yet again, the problem boils down to money. Special needs children cost money and Somerset just does not have that money. In February, as part of the national report of Somerset&#039;s lifelong learning portfolio holder, the following statement was made:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;Unfortunately we are still not receiving even the national average of funding for our pupils, this year being undervalued by some &#163;19 million&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para25"><a name="stpa_125">It seems that Somerset has lost out in the horse-trading between the Minister&#039;s Department and the local authorities. I suspect that we were all too naive to realise that arguing for money was all about horse-trading. We come from a rural area. That is why I am in the Chamber again, badgering the Minister, banging the drum for action, blowing the trumpet for rural schools and boasting about the place in which I live, work and was educated. Somerset needs the help of the Minister, and I hope that he can reply to that.

</p>



<a name="time_6">
<a name="41103h02_time1"><h5>11.15 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_18"><a name="41103h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Mr. Stephen Twigg) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger) on securing this debate. It enables us to continue our public discussion of some of the important issues that relate to education in rural areas, rural schools in general and schools in his Somerset constituency in particular.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para26"><a name="stpa_126">It is timely that we meet today, because this afternoon I will have a regular meeting with the rural schools group. I meet a group of head teachers and people from relevant Government agencies and Departments to discuss some of the challenges that face schools in rural areas. I concur with what the hon. Gentleman says about those challenges and some of the differences between a constituency such as his and one such as mine. Some of the challenges that he faces, in the recruitment and retention of high-quality staff, for example, are in some ways similar to those faced in an urban constituency, but, as he clearly set out, some challenges are different and very particular. He is right to say that important work must be done to deal with them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para27"><a name="stpa_127">I will comment on the substantive item on which the hon. Gentleman closed&#151;special educational needs. I&nbsp;agree with what he said about the special schools in his&nbsp;constituency, Penrose school and Elmwood school. I&nbsp;understand that they are working towards possible amalgamation, that that issue will be addressed locally and that Somerset more broadly is conducting a review&nbsp;of its special educational needs provision. Special educational needs is an important area. In our emphasis on high educational standards and inclusion, schools, whether rural or urban, must personalise their teaching and learning to the needs of the individual child.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para28"><a name="stpa_128">Special schools will continue to play an important role in promoting high standards, personalised learning and inclusion. It is difficult to go beyond that statement with respect to Somerset&#039;s own review of special educational needs provision, other than to say that it is important that any review engages local people, including parents, pupils, Members of Parliament and the wider community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para29"><a name="stpa_129">The hon. Gentleman perfectly reasonably quoted some local authority statistics about local authority funding and the implications for special educational 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
needs, and he related them to the challenge of recruitment and retention. We have touched on that in previous debates, initiated both by him and by other hon. Members representing constituencies in his county. He knows that we encountered some difficulties last year when we made fundamental changes to the school funding system. For this year and the coming three years, we have sought to bring about stability in the funding system, which has been generally welcomed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para30"><a name="stpa_130">The rural schools group has had many discussions about the new system. As the hon. Gentleman set out, one senses that rural schools feel it is not right for them, that they welcome the extra stability that we have brought in, but that they want us to return to the debate for the longer term. In the five-year strategy for children and learners that the Secretary of State for Education and Skills published shortly before the summer recess, we made it clear that, although in the short to medium term our priority was to provide schools with the stability and predictability that they had not had in recent years, particularly via three-year budgets, we accepted that there was still a debate about the formula, to which we shall return.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para31"><a name="stpa_131">The purpose of the changes made to the funding formula is to have a system whereby children in identical circumstances in any part of the country are treated identically. That is what we sought to achieve with that basic level of funding per pupil, wherever the pupil might be.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para32"><a name="stpa_132">We then have a number of factors for additional costs. As the hon. Gentleman and I discussed before coming into the Chamber, for a large county, the additional costs will vary between different parts of the county and I recognise that that is part of the picture for Exmoor and West Somerset. That puts a duty on us to get the national formula right, but also on the local authority to look at its local funding formula for schools. If the costs of recruitment and retention in one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part of the county are significantly higher than in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another part, it is the local education authority&#039;s responsibility, when it devises its local funding formula, to ensure that it is flexible enough for school budgets to meet the higher costs. The responsibility is shared. The school has its budget and must use it to great effect, the&nbsp;local authority has a responsibility to divide the money in a way that is equitable and meets the different needs of schools and communities, and we have a responsibility to ensure that the overall capital pot of money that is available to schools is right.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para33"><a name="stpa_133">The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised if I use this opportunity to refer to some of the increases in spending that have occurred since 1997. In Somerset, the real-terms increase in expenditure on recurrent funding is &#163;840 per pupil and there has been a significant increase in capital investment in schools. Hon. Members on both sides of the House will agree that there is a decades-long need to improve buildings and equipment in schools. That improvement for Somerset local education authority has been an increase from just below &#163;4 million in 1997&#150;98 to an allocation last year of just below &#163;20 million. That is a significant improvement and the money is desperately needed to ensure that children in the different communities in Somerset have the opportunities that, as he rightly reminded the Chamber, they have the right to receive from their schools.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 89WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para34"><a name="stpa_134">The broad issue of the financial context clearly underpins many of the questions raised by the hon. Gentleman today about special educational needs, as well as the recruitment and retention of high-quality staff. He said that he did not have all the answers on recruitment and retention and I am happy to say that I&nbsp;do not have all the answers either. We need to learn from what works in different parts of the country. Schools have some flexibility, for example, to attract teachers into shortage subjects, and we will look at some of the possibilities. I undertake to write to him on that specific aspect to set out some of the options that might be available to schools that are suffering some of the recruitment and retention dilemmas and challenges that he set out clearly in his speech.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para35"><a name="stpa_135">School transport is a fundamental challenge in all schools and, for obvious reasons, it is a particularly significant challenge in sparsely populated rural areas. Last week, the School Transport Bill had its Second Reading and it goes into Committee next week, when we shall have the opportunity to explore some of the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised, as well as some of the issues that were raised on Second Reading.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para36"><a name="stpa_136">The hon. Gentleman correctly said that expenditure on school transport was around &#163;500 million, which is a significant amount. I want to put it on record that I certainly do not come to the School Transport Bill with an agenda of seeking to cut that spending. My agenda is to try use that money more effectively to ensure that school transport is more widely available for students from all backgrounds. That is the central purpose of the Bill. It is an enabling Bill, which will enable a local authority, if it wishes, to pilot an alternative method of providing school transport. An authority that does not want to introduce a pilot will not be made to do so and will be able to remain within the terms of existing legislation, which goes back to the Education Act 1944.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para37"><a name="stpa_137">It struck me during the debate last week that for some authorities the flexibility and options provided in the Bill may not be that helpful because, typically, students who use the school bus travel distances that are substantially longer than the two or three miles that are provided as the statutory walking distance in existing legislation. I am aware of that, and the School Transport Bill is only one aspect of a broader approach to promoting sustainable travel to school.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para38"><a name="stpa_138">We certainly want a reduction in car use generally. Clearly, the better the quality and reliability of school buses, the less likely it is that parents in rural, semi-rural, suburban or urban areas will resort to using their car. The issues around safety and reliability that were explored on Second Reading will be considered in more detail as the Bill goes through Committee stage and on Report.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para39"><a name="stpa_139">I emphasise that the School Transport Bill has strong cross-party support in local government. Expressions of interest have come from authorities led by each of the three main political parties, from authorities that have 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 90WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
no overall control and from independents in local government. In his speech on Second Reading last week, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills made it clear that we would issue a series of stipulations before we agreed to any proposed measures to change the existing set-up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para40"><a name="stpa_140">I am fully aware that charging and means-testing are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contentious. We shall explore those issues in Committee, but I wish to use this opportunity to reaffirm that the Bill is not a cost-cutting measure but a measure to promote more effective spending of what is presently spent and to promote sustainable travel from home to school.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para41"><a name="stpa_141">It is important to note that the Bill does not redistribute money from rural to urban areas. I recognise that the transport requirements of rural areas and schools are different from and typically greater than those of suburban or urban areas. There is no suggestion that a predominantly rural authority will have any less money to spend on school transport as a consequence of the Bill, or that an urban or suburban authority will have any more. The Bill is about how authorities allocate and spend money in their own school budgets.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para42"><a name="stpa_142">In my remaining two minutes, I wish to discuss an issue that the hon. Gentleman did not raise but which I know is of concern to him and to colleagues of all parties. Falling primary school roll numbers are a particular challenge in rural areas. Clearly, it is important that local government gets that right. Closing schools is only one option if primary school roll numbers are falling. Wherever practicable&#151;I accept that it is not always practicable&#151;we must consider other options as well, such as whether, instead of closing, smaller schools might become extended schools and use their spare capacity for other purposes. The five-year strategy sets out some options.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para43"><a name="stpa_143">Federations are groups of schools that work together in formal and structured ways, sometimes under the provisions of the Education Act 2002. Federations are being considered in the discussions in Somerset, including for Penrose school and Elmwood school, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I encourage the innovation that the governors and heads of those schools are demonstrating by considering federations. The children&#039;s trusts that form part of the Children Bill that received Third Reading this week also offer potential to explore options for different uses of existing school buildings.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h02_para44"><a name="stpa_144">I am resolute in my support for rural schools. The Government recognise the differences between the type of school in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency and the type of school in urban constituencies such as mine. I am confident that he and others will continue this important dialogue and ensure that we have further opportunities for such debates.

<a name="time_8">
<a name="41103h03_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_20"><a name="41103h03_spnew0"><b> Ms Joan Walley  (Stoke-on-Trent, North)</b>  (Lab): I am pleased to have secured this most important debate on the services of the Department for Work and Pensions throughout Staffordshire and in north Staffordshire in particular.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para0"><a name="stpa_145">I am a little disappointed, although I understand entirely, that the Minister for Work, who has direct responsibility for these services, cannot be with us today, but I should say from the outset how important it is that the Under-Secretary of State for Work and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond) is in the Chamber. I know of his longstanding involvement with the Low Pay Unit and how much he has been concerned with combating poverty throughout his working life. I also know that he has worked very closely with Mr. Hugh Edwards, who is now the chairman of the Burslem Regeneration Company, which is tasked with regeneration of the Burslem area. I am sure that the Minister will be conversant with the issues that we will discuss this afternoon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para1"><a name="stpa_146">I ask the Minister to listen to our concerns and to take genuine account of them. I do not suggest for a moment that he has a script from his Department this afternoon, but if he does, I ask him not to stick to it entirely but to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand that north Staffordshire MPs care passionately about the area that they represent. We want the Government to modernise and to hold every penny to account, but by the same token we want to hold the Government to account in the way in which they administer their services on our behalf.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para2"><a name="stpa_147">We should consider the matter in the round. I hope that the Minister will arrange a follow-up meeting to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today&#039;s debate in Westminster Hall to address in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some detail the particular concerns surrounding Burslem jobcentre, and that in the light of that careful reconsideration, we might find a more appropriate way of delivering the Department for Work and Pensions services that are so important to my constituents and people in the Burslem area in particular.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para3"><a name="stpa_148">I am aware that this is a very broad issue, which relates to the services provided by the Department throughout north Staffordshire, and that other colleagues wish to pursue the matter in more detail. It is important that the targets set for the Department are met and that services are delivered so that work is promoted as the best form of welfare for people of working age while the position of those in greatest need is protected. It is also important that the Government require the Department to combat poverty and to promote security and independence in retirement for today&#039;s and tomorrow&#039;s pensioners. That, of course, involves customers receiving a high quality service in every region. All I am asking is that we receive that high quality service in north Staffordshire and in Burslem in particular.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para4"><a name="stpa_149">I shall talk briefly about pension services, which are part of the wider agenda.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 92WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>






<p><a name="st_21"><a name="41103h03_spnew1"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone)</b>  (Con): I am listening carefully to the hon. Lady. Does she accept that the closure of the Stone and Cheadle jobcentres has caused immense damage to my constituency, and that the idea that they could be substituted by telephone lines or internet websites is simply absurd? I protest vigorously against this.
</p>






<p><a name="st_22"><a name="41103h03_spnew2"><b> Ms Walley </b> : I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern, and I hope that he will have an opportunity in this debate or in further consultations with the Department to set out in more detail the effects that these changes are already having in that part of north Staffordshire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para5"><a name="stpa_150">We have been offered service improvements such as pensioners&#039; surgeries, which have been a closely guarded secret in my area. Not many people know how to access them. Insufficient thought has been given to the front-line services that pensioners in north Staffordshire will require. Will the Minister examine how, under the new order that has been proposed, people will be best served by a processing centre in Wolverhampton. Some of us in north Staffordshire have a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu about such matters. Some years back, I remember arguing strongly that the Post Office should not relocate its sorting office in north Staffordshire to Wolverhampton. That caused us enormous difficulties and I should hate the so-called current rationalisation to result in a similar service, with no easy front-line service and people having to rely on call centres and telephones, not face-to-face contact with a trained and dedicated staff, which often makes the world of difference between receiving the service and not receiving it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para6"><a name="stpa_151">Telephone lines are not necessarily the best way in which to deal with people. They have a part to play, but they are not the only way in which to deliver the service. It bothers me that, in the Department&#039;s new vision, there will be less provision for face-to-face contact.The take-up of benefits is complex. To provide that service requires trained, experienced and dedicated front-line staff. Unless great care is taken in how the changes are brought about in north Staffordshire, we will lose an effective service.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para7"><a name="stpa_152">I wish now to concentrate on the Burslem jobcentre. It is run by highly trained and committed staff and it is very much appreciated by people in the Burslem area. I&nbsp;pay tribute to the Department for Work and Pensions and its civil servants who look after the 34,000 or so people whom the office serves. The area has seen more job losses than most other areas in north Staffordshire, in the west midlands and in the country as a whole. The last remaining Royal Doulton factory is to close with a loss of 500 jobs. There have been job losses at Wedgwood and throughout the Potteries. Yes, we must bring in new jobs&#151;that is part of our common task&#151;but let us not escape the reality that those job losses are affecting people&#039;s lives now.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para8"><a name="stpa_153">Set against that, there are new business developments, but in my area they are about 24 per thousand of population compared with the national average of 40. The area is identified as one of the five areas of deprivation by the Government office for the west midlands, and that is why we have such a proactive agenda for regeneration. On the specific instructions of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 93WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the Secretary of State, the Department of Trade and Industry is making sure that the regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands, is looking at prioritising regeneration, new jobs and new training in the area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para9"><a name="stpa_154">A similar priority is being given to the agenda by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learning and skills council. Within Advantage West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midlands&#039; remit is the North Staffordshire Regeneration Zone and, within that, is the Burslem Regeneration Company, chaired by Hugh Edwards, to which I referred in my opening comments. All such initiatives are in place to deal with people who have lost their jobs and to make sure that investment is made in the area, that we have training and that people are moving from sickness and incapacity into work. It is vital that the Department for Work and Pensions is integrated in all such services.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para10"><a name="stpa_155">We also have Renew North Staffordshire, the housing market renewal pathfinder scheme, and Middleport and Burslem are the top priorities in that initiative. In his visit to Stoke-on-Trent, the Minister for Regeneration and the Regions, my noble Friend Lord Rooker, stressed that, whatever else the housing renewal programme does, it must link to the current economic regeneration in Burslem under the Burslem Regeneration Company project. Given that statement from my noble Friend, I&nbsp;should have thought that, at the least, civil servants at the Department for Work and Pensions would want to work with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para11"><a name="stpa_156">Market renewal means that communities are in a fragile state because they are in transition, as a result of which they will need more support, not less. Surely that should have guided and informed the Department for Work and Pensions in its reconfiguration of services as a result of the modernisation programme. Such support needs to be maintained until such time as the housing renewal programme has been completed. I have other examples of Government support for what we are doing, and when I say &quot;we&quot; I mean all the partners across north Staffordshire who are working together against all the odds to build a better future for Burslem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para12"><a name="stpa_157">Just in case the Minister doubts the work that we are doing, I refer him to letters that I have had from the Department for Work and Pensions and to correspondence that I have received from the Treasury. The most recent letter, dated 3 September, sets out all that the Government are doing to support regeneration in Burslem, and ends with the comment:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;The 2004 spending review revised the Department of Work and Pensions&#039; public service agreement target in order to focus help more effectively on disadvantaged groups and areas&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para13"><a name="stpa_158">That is what the Minister&#039;s Department should be doing for Burslem.

</p>

<a name="41103h03_para15"><a name="stpa_160">is absolutely appalling, and gives us no satisfaction whatever?
</p>






<p><a name="st_24"><a name="41103h03_spnew4"><b> Ms Walley </b> : I must say that it is rather strange to find myself agreeing so much with the hon. Gentleman. I&nbsp;received two letters, one of them early in the summer, that set out the thinking behind the long-term programme. I checked very carefully, as hon. Members would expect, whether Burslem was affected, and the original letter made no mention whatever of Burslem jobcentre closing. Somehow, between that original letter and the final letter that announced that the decision had&nbsp;been made, the fact that the Burslem jobcentre was to close crept in, with no reasoning given and no clear vision of why or how. It is that which I want to highlight today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para16"><a name="stpa_161">I state categorically that I have not been consulted on the 7 September letter&#039;s proposal to include Burslem, and I do not think that other partners delivering the regeneration agenda in north Staffordshire have been consulted either. That might rest on what is meant by &quot;consultation&quot;. It might be that if other partners have had letters telling them that the Burslem office is to close, that is classed as consultation; but I do not count that as consultation, particularly given all the bodies that have been set up by the Government to deliver the most effective agenda.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para17"><a name="stpa_162">I have looked very carefully at the 1999 White Paper &quot;Modernising Government&quot;, and I cannot quarrel with any of its objectives. It mentions better provision and better services, including better services in jobcentres. It&nbsp;talks about the need for joined-up government and integrated government, commits us all to putting pressure on the obstacles to joined-up working through local partnerships, one-stop shops and other means, and commits the Government to area-based programmes. I&nbsp;go along with all those 1999 objectives, and I am sure that the Government are delivering them all in other parts of the country, but it does not seem as if they are in north Staffordshire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para18"><a name="stpa_163">I also go along with the objectives set out in Sir Peter Gershon&#039;s report. When he was addressing an all-party group in the House last night, I made it my business to go along and hear what he had to say on his report, which Ministers are taking very seriously. In that talk, just last night, he said clearly that the objectives of the&nbsp;modernisation programme were to release major resources to front-line services for the period 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08. If that is the objective, it is hard to see how it is to be done in Burslem when the jobcentre there is to be closed. I sincerely bring that to the attention of the Minister.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para19"><a name="stpa_164">There is also an issue, which I will come to later, about time scales. If we are meant to be saving money for the period 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08, is the Minister really sure that that time scale is workable in terms of what is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happening in Burslem? I am committed to the Lyons&nbsp;review and, along with my north Staffordshire colleagues, I have met local partners to see how we can make a sound business case for the relocation of civil service and private sector jobs from the south-east to north Staffordshire&#151;an area in which there are issues because of the number of jobs that we have lost.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para20"><a name="stpa_165">At a constituency meeting only four or five months ago, I remember talking about the importance of the Lyons review and trying to encourage Departments to

relocate. Somebody said to me, &quot;Joan, how can you talk about that when at the same time there is going to be an issue about closing local jobcentres?&quot; We need to consider the matter in a joined-up way and I hope that today&#039;s debate will be an opportunity to do that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para21"><a name="stpa_166">The real problem for us in Burslem is that all the Government&#039;s objectives sound fine, but the reality of the way in which they are being implemented by the Department for Work and Pensions is completely different. It just does not match the vision. I have a series of questions. I hope that the Minister will consider them and that he and his colleagues will get back to me in the coming weeks.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para22"><a name="stpa_167">How can the closure of the Burslem jobcentre office be presented as a done deal? The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) has already raised the issue of consultation. I just do not accept that it should be a done deal. Even at this 11th hour, is there an opportunity for the Minister to look again at what is being proposed? Why was there no mention of the closure in the original paper that went out under the original service delivery plan? If&nbsp;that had flagged up the possibility of closing Burslem jobcentre, I would have wanted early discussions with all the partners to see what could be done and whether, with the knowledge of those of us who are on the ground, rather than civil servants from elsewhere in the west midlands, we could not have come up with a more workable solution. We want the very best service.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para23"><a name="stpa_168">As I have said, according to the original plans the Burslem jobcentre was to stay open. What changed between that service delivery plan and the fait accompli letter of 7 September? Why was there not proper consultation? The Minister will see from dispatches that I was not told about this matter, but nor were those involved with the north Staffordshire regeneration zone or the housing renewal pathfinder given an opportunity to consider the issues raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para24"><a name="stpa_169">Given that the Minister is answerable to Parliament for the service delivery, how can he be satisfied that the so-called estates challenge, which relates to the White Paper, is anything other than a pure cost-cutting exercise with regard to the way in which it has been implemented in north Staffordshire? I understand that a service administered by civil servants in Staffordshire is under pressure to get rid of uneconomic buildings and floor space, and that the state of buildings and access for disabled people may need to be considered and re-examined. If there are opportunities for shared buildings, of course we should go down that route. Those are all material considerations that should have been taken into account.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para25"><a name="stpa_170">However, I wonder just how much of the rationale for the closure of the Burslem jobcentre relates to the rents charged by Land Securities Trillium. Should not the driving factors be about the level of need in the Burslem area? Given that level of need, it makes no sense to have proposals to close the office serving the area. If we look at the figures, it is the area of greatest need. What account has been taken of that? Will the Minister look at the figures? I do not know whether I have the most up-to-date figures. I am sure that he will correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that we are talking about an&nbsp;area with an overall population of about 36,000. In the Burslem area, something like 4,730 people are on

incapacity benefit. Surely those people should be our priority group. Surely they are the people who need front-line face-to-face interviews with trained, dedicated staff to get them into work and to help us create the new investment that we need for the area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para26"><a name="stpa_171">If the Government are as serious as I am about meeting their public service agreement targets, they should be concentrating on the number of people on incapacity benefits. It is difficult enough for constituents to claim and to go through the process of getting into work following incapacity. Some of my constituents find that path so painful and difficult that they prefer staying in poverty to trying to find a way out. It can be difficult from here in Westminster to understand the levels of poverty and need that exist.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para27"><a name="stpa_172">How will the Government deliver their improved services to lone parents, those on new deal, the 18 to 24-year-olds and the over-50s, when they have closed the Burslem jobcentre and people are asked to change the habits of a lifetime by travelling elsewhere? If the Minister has time to visit Stoke-on-Trent, it would be helpful if he did so. We could show him that Stoke-on-Trent is not like most other cities where there is one dedicated city centre; it is a collection of six towns, where people still do not venture outside the area they live in, even if they can afford the bus fares.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para28"><a name="stpa_173">The incapacity benefit load is a big issue in Stoke-on-Trent, and particularly in Burslem. I do not see how the Government can meet their targets for getting people from benefit into work without the specialist help of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobcentre advisers or the support of the local community. This is not the right way to go about getting its support.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para29"><a name="stpa_174">The Minister should look at the time scale of all the work that is under way as a consequence of the North Staffordshire Regeneration Zone&#039;s initiatives. Had that body been properly consulted about the Burslem closure rather than told about it, I suspect that it could have got all the many partners together around the table and looked closely at what has been proposed within the context of the time scales that it is working to.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para30"><a name="stpa_175">There is a need for more support for Burslem, not for less. I will be reminding the Minister for Work at every opportunity that she is responsible for the delivery of the wider objective of full employment in every region over the three years to 2008. I want her to make a good job of that in Burslem. I hope that as a result of this debate we can proceed with a follow-up meeting to look in detail at how we can achieve it collaboratively.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para31"><a name="stpa_176">The modernisation agenda is all very well and good, but I owe it to my constituents to put their needs at the heart of an integrated policy. That has not been done, but there is still time to revisit the matter.

Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley), on securing it. I am surprised that the issues we are discussing have not received greater prominence both in the press and the House. My hon. Friend has done the House in general a service in raising them, because these problems are not confined to north Staffordshire or to her constituency&#151;or even to that of

<br>&nbsp;<br>
the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash); they affect the whole country, as I am sure other contributors to this debate will emphasise.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para32"><a name="stpa_177">My hon. Friend admirably spelled out the particular problems that her constituents will face with the closure of the Burslem jobcentre. Towards the end of her remarks she touched on the strange geography of our city. It is the only non-radial city in the country. It stretches for 13 miles along a valley, and there is no contact into the city centre. Therefore, closures of services in the outlying&#151;the constituent&#151;towns of Stoke-on-Trent always cause problems. We do not have an easily accessible city centre of the kind that on paper perhaps makes sense of closures of commercial or government branch offices because people can get their services by going into that city centre.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para33"><a name="stpa_178">We have particular geographical problems, and my hon. Friend described them very well. She was also particularly impressive when dealing with the inconsistent impact of what the Government and we are&nbsp;trying to do in terms of regeneration in north Staffordshire, so I will not return to those matters. I will not even labour the case that has been put to me by staff working in the Hanley jobcentre about the job losses. They made a powerful, moving case and I was impressed by their dedication. For many staff, working in jobcentres is not simply a way to earn a living; they become involved in the delivery of services and with their clients. For front-line staff in the benefits agencies, there is a large element of vocational work involved, with satisfaction gained from helping vulnerable people get what is rightly theirs. However, although that dedication impressed me, that is not why I want to contribute to this debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para34"><a name="stpa_179">I am concerned about the services that those people provide to my constituents and benefits claimants generally throughout the country, because the changes that the Government are implementing in north Staffordshire and all over the United Kingdom will severely undermine them. The hon. Member for Stone quoted from the letter from a district manager of the Department for Work and Pensions, saying: &quot;This was a positive development.&quot; That is incomprehensible. It is difficult to see how this is a positive development for my constituents, or makes better provision or a better service. My constituents, and claimants all over the country, will find it more difficult to get what is rightfully theirs. They need help and advice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para35"><a name="stpa_180">The Minister had an admirable record in the Low Pay Unit, working with people in poverty, before he was elected to the House. He, of all members of this Government, knows the reality of life for people on low&nbsp;incomes&#151;they have never found the details of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welfare state easy to grasp and are particularly vulnerable to the complexities. Given the many passionate speeches he made to conferences on poverty, he must know why such a large proportion of benefits are unclaimed each year from time immemorial. That problem has been inherent in the welfare state over the past 50 years, and it has nothing to do with this Government or the previous one.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para36"><a name="stpa_181">The complexity of the system means that there is a relatively low take-up and so much unclaimed by the people who need it most, and to whom it would make the greatest difference to the quality of their life. People in desperate need of benefit&#151;lone parents, unemployed

<br>&nbsp;<br>
people and those with disabilities, as my hon. Friend said&#151;are vulnerable and do not have first-class degrees&nbsp;and the ability to understand the fine print of documents. That is why they get ripped off by loan sharks and are vulnerable to almost all problems in life that involve bureaucracy. They, of all people, need help when filling in forms. People working in the Benefits Agency and jobcentres have been providing just that. They hold the hands of people as they go in and they sit down with them, giving advice and ensuring that the form is understandable and correctly filled in. That is essential for the claimant and good for the system, because the form is properly completed and is not returned or junked. That makes for a more efficient delivery of the service, but it is not why it is important; it is important because it is often the only way a person can get what they are rightfully entitled to.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para37"><a name="stpa_182">All Members of Parliament know about such problems from constituents who attend our surgeries. They have probably seen a counsellor and asked for advice first, after which they see us and ask for our advice. They often bring forms to our surgeries to be completed, but I often find that I do not trust myself to help fill them in because I do not understand them. I am the worst person to give advice and would hate to see my constituents leave with their form wrongly completed. I usually say, &quot;Please don&#039;t take it from me. We haven&#039;t got time&quot;&#151;it takes 20 minutes or half an hour to go through a form properly, and many other problems in their lives may be uncovered, revealing their entitlement to other benefits&#151;&quot;and I am not the person to do it. I am just an MP&#151;a generalist and non-expert. Please go to your citizens advice bureau, talk to your social worker, if you have one, and go to the benefits agencies, which will help.&quot; I have been saying that to my constituents for the past 21 years, and I think it is good and sensible advice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para38"><a name="stpa_183">If we Members of Parliament&#151;who have nice degrees and lots of experience, and who are quite articulate and confident with forms&#151;do not trust ourselves to fill in forms for our constituents, how on earth can many of them fill them in? Some deal with the forms amazingly and admirably, but others have always gone into benefits agencies and said, &quot;Please help me fill in this form.&quot; We cannot help them; how on earth will it help when they are told, under the changes, &quot;Get on the phone, or online, and sort it out&quot;? We know from our work as MPs that it is much less satisfactory, both for our constituents and for us, when people ring in with problems than when they sit down with us at our surgeries. Some people are not very confident on the phone, and one cannot pick up on nuances and see where the problems are. If we are trying to help someone with a form that we cannot see, and which is front of him and he is not reading it correctly, we are absolutely lost.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para39"><a name="stpa_184">The idea that the most vulnerable people in desperate need are to be told to ring someone in Birmingham, whom they do not know and who does not know what sort of estate they live on, who will help them through their claim for entitlement is frankly extraordinary. There is no way that can be described as an improvement in service, a modernisation or a positive development. For my constituents, it will be a disaster. They may try that system once or twice, but it is unlikely to lead to a satisfactory outcome, and they will give up. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 99WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
As for telling them to get online, many of my constituents do not have telephones; they certainly do not have computers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para40"><a name="stpa_185">I am hopelessly computer-illiterate. I tried to fill in an application form online, but I kept going round in circles and gave up after a bit. Perhaps I am particularly crass, stupid and old; I have just had my 60th birthday, and by God I felt it when I filled in the form. I wanted to join eBay, and it is apparently simple. Everyone says, &quot;Oh, it&#039;s easy; it&#039;ll take you 10 minutes, and they&#039;ll hold&nbsp;your hand throughout the process,&quot; but after some 25 minutes I gave up and did not join because I could not work out the system. If I cannot work out something as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simple as eBay, which just involves filling in the right&nbsp;details, God help my constituents&#151;forgive my language, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;when they fill in their forms, which are about matters of central importance to them and their income for life.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para41"><a name="stpa_186">I beg the Minister to look into the system again, because it is not right, although it may look fine. As my hon. Friend said, we all want the Government not to be wasteful, and we all want them to modernise where it is sensible, and so on. We have all signed up to that, and it is not a problem, but when it comes to how we help the poorest members of our society obtain access to the benefits that are rightfully theirs, that desire for efficiency and modernisation must surely be tempered with some human understanding of where those people are coming from and what it is realistic to expect from them, in both the short and medium term.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para42"><a name="stpa_187">I fear that the system will lead to considerable poverty and reduction in access. Even if we are talking about only a few tens of thousands of cases a year, it is tens of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousands of the very poorest people in our constituencies who will suffer. I am most upset, as hon. Members can see; I am as upset as my constituents are. I&nbsp;am sure that the scheme makes sense to the Department, which will be able to tell the Treasury that it is using public money very efficiently.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para43"><a name="stpa_188">The idea looks good on paper, and for some people who are more confident than I am about filling in online&nbsp;forms it will undoubtedly work in theory, too. Obviously, some people will make the system work. If they do, and it saves the Government money and is not inconvenient for those people, great; that will perhaps speed things up. But to go over so wholeheartedly to a new system with so few and so basic safety nets is bitterly regrettable. I fear that it is too late for a pilot study, but I ask the Minister to consider quickly conducting some study of how the system will work in practice, whether there will be a fall-off in applications and correctly filled-in applications, how many people will use the internet generally and in particular areas, and what successful conclusions can be drawn from those cases that go online. I would be amazed if such a study did not confirm at least some of the fears that I have tried to express this afternoon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para44"><a name="stpa_189">Perhaps I am underestimating the online skills of my constituents and they would in fact be quite happy to stay at home or try to find somebody online on their estate and not flock to Hanley on expensive buses. If I&nbsp;am patronising them by saying that they will have difficulty with online services, I would be very pleased to be proved wrong. I do not know how much consultation

<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 100WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
there was in advance, but it is not too late for the Minister to conduct a study of how the service is working in practice, talking to those people delivering and receiving it. Perhaps the study will lead to ways of putting in more safety nets to ensure that when people need and want personal services that they have had ever since the welfare state began, those services will continue to be available.

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="41103h03_spnew6"><b> Paul Holmes  (Chesterfield)</b>  (LD): I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) on securing the debate. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) on his able contribution.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para45"><a name="stpa_190">The hon. Gentleman said in his opening comments that he was sure that subsequent speakers would point out that the problems relating to the closure of the Burslem centre are not unique, and indeed they are widespread and national. Through my regular contact with the unemployed workers centre in Chesterfield and&nbsp;its network of smaller offices, particularly in the Derbyshire coalfield, I hear of those problems. In 2003, there were three such closures that mirror exactly the problems in Burslem that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North described in such detail. Offices were closed in New Mills, which is in the High Peak area in the north of Derbyshire, in Bakewell, a west Derbyshire area, and in Eckington, a north-east Derbyshire community, just to the north of my constituency. All closed in 2003 as part of the general centralisation and cost-cutting process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para46"><a name="stpa_191">The example of the Eckington centre particularly mirrors that of Burslem, because it is in a deprived coalfield area that suffered tremendous job losses when the pits were closed down overnight 10 to 12 years ago. It suffered particularly from the closure of the local Renishaw foundry, an issue that the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes) has raised on several occasions in the House.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para47"><a name="stpa_192">Eckington is a regeneration area. As with Burslem and north Staffordshire, it is supposed to receive regeneration support precisely because of the deprivation concentrated there. Yet the local jobcentre that provides such support to people in that area is closed. That means, for example, that residents of Eckington and of the Killamarsh area who went to Eckington, must either go to Sheffield to access services or visit the Chesterfield or Staveley offices in my constituency, the latter being nearer. They have to travel some distance to other areas to access the services that were once provided on their doorstep in the middle of deprived communities.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para48"><a name="stpa_193">Colin Hampton, the organiser at the unemployed workers centre in Chesterfield, has done a certain amount of outreach work and campaigning, and when he has been at the Staveley jobcentre on the edge of my constituency, next to North-East Derbyshire, he has talked to some of the people who must visit it because of the closure of the Eckington office. They have said that they have to walk several miles from Eckington to the jobcentre because they cannot afford the bus fare. The people who are being hit by those closures are among the poorest in society. They are most in need of those services, but have to walk a number of miles to the nearest office to get them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para49"><a name="stpa_194">There is some confusion on this issue. When I visited the Chesterfield Jobcentre Plus office, one member of staff told me, off the record, that staff were allowed to tell claimants in that situation that they could be provided with bus fares, but were not supposed to volunteer the information. Staff could tell the claimant only if they were asked. I am sure that the Minister will reassure me and say that that is not the case and that staff are advised to be proactive.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para50"><a name="stpa_195">There is another possible area of confusion, about which Colin Hampton talked. Perhaps such fares apply not to new claimants but only to existing claimants whose jobcentre has closed and who have had to move further afield, to Sheffield or Staveley, to access services. There is some uncertainty among the people who work at the jobcentre and on the part of someone who works full time at the unemployed workers centre in Chesterfield. Hopefully, the Minister will be able to clarify that.

<p><a name="st_27"><a name="41103h03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b>  (Mr. Edward O&#039;Hara): Order. As has been said, there is a general point to be made, which the hon.

<p><a name="st_28"><a name="41103h03_spnew8"><b> Paul Holmes </b> : Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that I explained why I was making such comparisons. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said that he was sure that subsequent speakers would point out that the problem was nationwide. It is not an isolated one-off. I do not think that the Minister will be able to address the problem completely by talking about one isolated instance, given that the programme is nationwide, with a nationwide pattern.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para51"><a name="stpa_196">The general context for the closure of Burslem jobcentre and others, touched on by the two previous speakers, is the modernisation process, the Gershon efficiency review and the 100,000 civil service job cuts, which heavily hit the Department for Work and Pensions. What is the rationale for such closures? One&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argument is that they will bring the benefits of centralisation and that technology means that we do not need so many outreach stations. As we heard from the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, provision of electronic and internet services will solve some of the problems. Human beings will not be on the doorstep, but people will be able to access electronic machinery, perhaps through local libraries.

<a name="41103h03_para52"><a name="stpa_197">So one argument is that centralisation brings more efficiency and allows money to go into better services, and another relates to the use of electronic processes. There is also the argument that the introduction of better computer services into jobcentres means that a more efficient service can be provided&#151;fewer staff are needed because the computer takes a lot of the strain&#151;and that not so many staff are needed in the central building because more centres are scattered around the country, have economies of scale and do everything electronically.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para53"><a name="stpa_198">However, all that is based on a myth. We have heard a lot of detail, ably explained, about the fact that many people&#151;especially the unemployed, people on benefits and the elderly in Burslem&#151;do not have an easy

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
familiarity with modern technology or easy access to the hardware and software that facilitates it. In jobcentres, the problem is that a lot of the technology on which the streamlining and rationalisation are based has not worked effectively. Not long ago, the Department for Work and Pensions Committee issued a scathing report on the failures of the IT systems that were supposed to introduce more efficiency and that predicated the closure of small centres such as Burslem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para54"><a name="stpa_199">People have to be slightly sceptical and ask whether the 100,000 job cuts&#151;Burslem is just one small cog in that machine&#151;are based on efficiency and the better delivery of services or whether that figure has been chosen because it is nice and round? If the efficiency cuts are based on a proper, rational assessment of where services are overprovided or no longer needed, why does the figure come out at a nice, round 100,000 rather than at 63,000 or 106,000? Is it just a nice, round figure that is good for headlines, like the target of 50 per cent. entry into higher education? That was plucked out of the air as a nice, round figure that is good for media journalists. There seems to be no proper analysis of where the efficiency savings and closures of small, inefficient units in favour of more efficient units elsewhere should take place. If there has been a proper, rational analysis of where such cuts should take place, why is it that some time after announcing 100,000 job cuts the Government still cannot say specifically where many of the closures and job cuts will occur?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para55"><a name="stpa_200">We would not argue that taxpayers&#039; money should be spent on a job that does not actually exist. If the work of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Burslem jobcentre was unnecessary, it would obviously be a gross misuse of taxpayers&#039; money to keep it open. If there were more efficient ways of providing the service, one could not argue against closure, as long as there were not strong downsides resulting from the loss of service. If there is waste of taxpayers&#039; money, fine, that should be reversed and the money should be spent better.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para56"><a name="stpa_201">However, if anything, the Department for Work and Pensions staff provide services to the most vulnerable and needy members of society, as we heard in the Burslem example. Centres such as Burslem serve people on benefits or pensions. They include jobseekers, particularly jobseekers in the most hard-to-place categories and people who need the most help from a personal service rather than a distant, impersonal service over a computer line; disabled people, 1 million of whom say that they want to get into work but have numerous problems to overcome before they can access such a service; older people over 50 who have particular problems getting back into work; and people who are less qualified. If anything, a rational analysis would suggest that, rather than cutting a centre such as Burslem and saving money on staff, more staff with better pay, and more, not fewer, outreach centres are needed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para57"><a name="stpa_202">A parallel is the question about the Pension Service that I asked the Minister in oral questions some time ago. In September, the local Pension Service staff were praised in Parliament for going into the community to visit pensioners at home who were not claiming pension credit, and helping them to access pension credit and many other benefits that they may have been missing out on. Yet some of those staff may lose their jobs in the modernisation and efficiency job cuts. If people who 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 103WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
deliver front-line services lose their jobs, the vulnerable people who benefit from their work will lose out on access to services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para58"><a name="stpa_203">The Department is one of the lowest payers among Government Departments, if not the lowest. I visited a job brokering service in London that is run by Working Links. It pays its personal advisers &#163;21,000, whereas the Department starts their staff on &#163;12,000 to &#163;14,000. Far from cutting a centre such as Burslem and removing the staff completely, such local centres should be kept, and the pay, training and conditions of staff who work under great pressure in delivering key services should be improved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para59"><a name="stpa_204">We must consider the aggressive management style of the Department and the introduction in the centres of performance pay, which has been controversial because of the artificial quotas that determine who qualifies for different levels of pay. We must also consider whether staff training is adequate. A comparable example&#151;again, this is not Burslem&#151;would be some of the unemployed workers centres around the Chesterfield coalfield area. It is reported that, because the small local jobcentres do not have enough staff or their staff are not adequately trained, claimants are sent to unemployed workers centres to ask simple, basic questions about, for example, the new minimum wage or how to access such and such a service.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para60"><a name="stpa_205">To conclude, rational analysis of the Burslem centre and other examples nationwide would show that, far from removing such services, we should be increasing the number of small outreach centres and improving the pay, training and facilities for the staff who work in them. I hope that the Minister will respond to many of those specific points about the loss of services to vulnerable, needy people and to a regeneration area into which the Government are putting extra resources with one hand while removing resources with the other hand. Whether in Burslem in north Staffordshire or in the Derbyshire coalfield, there is a need to improve Department services in general rather than to slash them.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="41103h03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Andrew Tyrie  (Chichester)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) on securing this debate, which has proved very interesting. When I was preparing for it, I was struck by the similarity between the points that are being made in north Staffordshire and the points that are being made to me in Chichester. I will not linger long in discussing Chichester, save to say that I have a two-page letter from a constituent, Mr. Michael Cameron, which is more or less a summary of the points made in the debate. It is important that the Minister takes on board the fact that the concerns that are being addressed in north Staffordshire are concerns of national significance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para61"><a name="stpa_206">I sympathise with the Minister. In this debate, he is responding at a micro-level to the consequences of the rolling-out of the policy to which the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) alluded. That is, of course, the sudden policy completely to reverse the large increase in recruitment into the civil service that has taken place for most of the last seven years and start 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 104WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
shedding civil service jobs at a high rate. The figure of 100,000 job losses was mentioned. The Department for Work and Pensions is scheduled to lose 30,000 jobs. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addition, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North mentioned the Lyons review, which involves the relocation of civil servants and is causing widespread concern in Chichester and many other constituencies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para62"><a name="stpa_207">I referred to the points made by Mr. Cameron. One of them was exactly the same as one of the points made by the hon. Member for Chesterfield. He is understandably concerned about the employment prospects of staff in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobcentres. Will the Minister say how many redundancies there will be in Longton, Staffordshire Moorlands and Leek? He has not yet been asked directly what the number will be, but I am interested to know. How many of those staff will be relocated? Has that been thought through? Are those relocations feasible? While he is at it, perhaps he would send me a letter answering the same questions about Chichester.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para63"><a name="stpa_208">What about the people who use jobcentres? The issue has been raised at some length by a number of hon. Members. Let me address a couple of questions. One is: how far will people be expected to travel under the new regime, with far fewer centres available? I note that a Labour local councillor, Paul Robinson, referring to the Leek jobcentre, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;It is not fair to expect people to have to travel to Hanley or Longton, about &#163;3.50 on the bus, just to sign on for benefits. Those people will be struggling for money as it is.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para64"><a name="stpa_209">I was particularly struck by the comments made by the hon. Gentleman, who pointed out that some people have been told that money is available, but only if specifically asked for and only if the person is alert enough to realise that that protection is available. Is the figure of &#163;3.50 in the right ballpark? Will the Minister confirm whether travel cost assistance is available? Are we mistaken? What about disabled people? They have not been mentioned so far. They are not in a good position to travel long distances for these interviews.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para65"><a name="stpa_210">Will the Minister provide a general clarification on another point? I may be wrong, but as I understand it,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the roll-out of Jobcentre Plus is scheduled to be completed by April 2006. Why is Longton jobcentre not scheduled for closure until 2008? Will its service overlap with the new Jobcentre Plus scheme or is the Jobcentre Plus office deemed to provide an insufficient service on its own? Before coming to the debate, I looked at a map and could not understand the logic of what is proposed for the area. Perhaps I do not know enough about the local area, but the Minister should try to respond to the point that I have touched on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para66"><a name="stpa_211">Many of the other points that I might have made were made by other hon. Members and I shall not repeat them. I conclude by making two general points. First, there is undoubtedly a case for rationalisation. That always causes tension and I sympathise with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) made a crucial point about the internet, citing himself. Some of the rationalisation that we are seeking to undertake may be premature. In 10 or 20 years, a whole generation of people will have learned elementary techniques in modern communication and will be much more able to cope with the sort of rationalisation that is proposed. Is it right to do it now? I am not convinced that it is.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para67"><a name="stpa_212">My second point is even more general. The Minister&#039;s difficulty is a subset of deep tension, which we face in many areas of public policy, between the savings from centralisation&#151;for example, bigger hospitals&#151;and the erosion of a sense of locality and local community, with the decline in the number of post offices, the transport system, the number of local shops and so on. That tension will not go away, but will get worse for all of us. I worry that the Government may not have thought through carefully the implications for local communities, particularly in rural areas and areas that are not close to large conurbations. I do not question the Government&#039;s intentions. What I am concerned about is whether they have thought through carefully enough what they are applying.

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="41103h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr. Chris Pond) </b> : I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms&nbsp;Walley) on securing this important debate and on highlighting some important issues about the provision of Jobcentre Plus services to her constituents. She is known in the House as an energetic and effective campaigner on behalf of her constituents, as was well demonstrated today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para68"><a name="stpa_213">My hon. Friend will acknowledge, as she has done previously, that there has been a significant reduction in the overall level of unemployment in her constituency, as elsewhere in the country, as a result of the new deals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stable macro-economic policy. Overall unemployment at 2.1 per cent. is slightly below the national average and long-term unemployment, especially among young people, has fallen by more than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three quarters. However, that part of north Staffordshire, as my hon. Friend reminded us this afternoon, has been hit hard by manufacturing losses, especially in the ceramics industry. As she said, one of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people who are closely involved in seeking to stem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such losses and to find alternative employment for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people is my good friend, the chair of the Burslem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regeneration Company, Hugh Edwards. Perhaps I should declare an interest, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because he was the chair of the Low Pay Unit of which I was once the director.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para69"><a name="stpa_214">As a Government, we give all the support we can to manufacturing, as hon. Members appreciate, but we cannot wholly protect people from the winds of economic change, which is often global. What we can do and what we should do is help people to adapt to those changes and build on the new opportunities when they arise from the dynamic economy in which we live. That is where the services of Jobcentre Plus come in. The House will know that it combines the former Employment Service and those parts of the former Benefits Agency responsible for paying benefits to people of working age. Bringing two agencies together means not only that we have a more efficient operation but that we can provide better quality services to the people whom we seek to serve. We have strengthened the link between receiving benefits on the one hand and the world of work opportunity and independence on the other.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para70"><a name="stpa_215">I can tell my hon. Friend and others who have contributed to a very useful debate this afternoon that Jobcentre Plus services are not just about office accommodation but about services in the broadest sense, which we can provide in several different and flexible ways. We have heard about service provision by telephone and, in some circumstances, by internet. I&nbsp;take very much to heart the points made in the debate by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) and others that the internet does provide huge opportunities for many people, but that it does not provide access for many others. That is why we also want to ensure that we provide the sort of personal service that people so often need.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para71"><a name="stpa_216">The constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North has a high proportion of people on incapacity benefit. She will know that we are considering through the pathways-to-work pilots new and innovative ways of supporting people on incapacity benefit who want to return to work, as the majority do. I appreciate the points that she and others have made about the difficulties sometimes presented by the need to travel albeit a short distance&#151;in this case, to Hanley&#151;but those on incapacity benefit have always reported to Hanley rather than to Burslem, so this will not be a significant change for them, although we do need to ensure that we consider all the time ways of providing more appropriate services to them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para72"><a name="stpa_217">My hon. Friend asked whether the changes that we have been discussing this afternoon are a fait accompli. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assure her that they are not. They are part of an ongoing consultation, which we have not yet completed, on the configuration of Jobcentre Plus services in her part of north Staffordshire. We want to discuss with her and with other hon. Members who are affected, as well as with all the other stakeholders, new and innovative ways in which we can help people to seek work in her constituency. Those ways include the possibility of enhanced outreach facilities, postal signing where appropriate, and even mobile jobcentre services and home visits for those who need them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para73"><a name="stpa_218">The consultation will therefore not only be about whether Burslem jobcentre should continue but about whether there are other ways in which we can provide even better services to the people whom my hon. Friend represents.
</p>






<p><a name="st_31"><a name="41103h03_spnew10"><b> Paul Holmes </b> : In the context of the consultation on whether Burslem jobcentre should close, which the Minister reassures us is ongoing, does he have a rough idea of what percentage of local jobcentres throughout the country have been kept open following the consultation in the past year or two? I can think of three examples in Derbyshire.
</p>






<p><a name="st_32"><a name="41103h03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Pond </b> : The hon. Gentleman tempts me to stray into a wide range of issues, but given that this is a debate about north Staffordshire, perhaps I should state for the record that when he talked about a reduction of 100,000 members of staff at the Department for Work and Pensions, that was not 100,000 members of staff in north Staffordshire. Some people might believe that it was, given that he raised the issue in this debate.

<p>
<a name="41103h03_para74"><a name="stpa_219">Each decision about the closure, merging or improvement of any of the Jobcentre Plus services is a matter for individual consideration. I therefore cannot tell the hon. Gentleman how many jobcentres remained open throughout the country following the consultation. In any case, that figure would be irrelevant, because it would not show that we had a target to close x percent. of jobcentres.

I do not want the review to be informed by factors such as where most money can be saved, instead of how we can best meet the requirements of people with different benefit needs and who need jobcentre support.
</p>






<p><a name="st_36"><a name="41103h03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Pond </b> : Indeed. If I may, I shall say more about the matter in a moment. My hon. Friend has anticipated some of my comments.

<p>
<a name="41103h03_para78"><a name="stpa_223">Several hon. Members have referred to the consultation process. My hon. Friend was right to say that, when we first looked at the matter in September 2003, it seemed that Burslem should remain open as part of the service delivery plan. She will know that, when we considered the matter again in September 2004, circumstances had changed. A number of factors emerged from that reconsideration. The reconsideration involved extensive consultation with a number of stakeholder organisations. What had happened between those two dates? We looked at the cost of refurbishing the Burslem jobcentre to bring it up to the sort of standard that my hon. Friend would agree her constituents deserve in terms of space, disability access and general state of repair, and that cost was very considerable.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para79"><a name="stpa_224">In the meantime, there was the efficiency challenge that the Department has taken up. That challenge was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not about simply making cuts across the board on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a proportionate basis, as the hon. Member for Chesterfield suggested; it was about discovering how we could best provide the highest quality of service to our customers within the efficiency constraints with which we are faced.

Plus. That taught us a great deal about joining up services and ensuring that we could provide people with a one-stop-shop approach.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para87"><a name="stpa_232">The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) asked how many redundancies we anticipated as a result of the changes in north Staffordshire and Chichester, and whether I would write to him about Chichester. Given that we are currently discussing north Staffordshire, that would be the appropriate way of replying. However, I suspect that the answer in that letter will be very similar to that which I am about to give in relation to north Staffordshire: although it is too early to give specific commitments on redundancies, he will know that we consider redundancy to be only a last resort as part of the process of meeting the efficiency challenge. The process is not about reducing the level of jobs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para88"><a name="stpa_233">The hon. Gentleman will also know that, with Jobcentre Plus, we have been reducing the number of people who fulfil some of the roles that have been sometimes unkindly described as backroom operations. They are fundamental to the work that we do, but many of those tasks can now be carried out with greater efficiency through the use of technology. Having fewer people in that area allows us to put more people on to the front line and to give the face-to-face contact that people really need.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para89"><a name="stpa_234">I was also asked how far we expected people to travel. In the case of the Jobcentre Plus that we are talking about, the cost of travel is a &#163;2 return fare from Tunstall to Hanley, from Endon to Hanley, from Brown Edge to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanley, or from Burslem to Kidsgrove. There is comprehensive guidance on the payment of fares and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am happy to write to the hon. Member for Chesterfield, who raised the issue, to set that out. Essentially, we reimburse fares if a person faces a journey of more than one hour from the office and if we have asked that person to attend for a pre-arranged interview. There are special, more discretionary provisions for people who have particular mobility problems. We do not pay fares for jobseekers to attend their normal fortnightly interviews, but in the case of Burslem we need to discuss, for instance, the possibility of postal signing, where that is appropriate and where it would be difficult for people to make the journey.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para90"><a name="stpa_235">In the context of overall regeneration, my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North is quite right to say that a number of Government agencies are putting in a lot of extra resources and energy. We have heard about Advantage West Midlands, the learning and skills council and the housing renewal programme. She asked for reassurance that Jobcentre Plus and DWP were fully linked up to all those developments. I can tell her that they are. However, we need to recognise that the provision of services, to which we are absolutely committed for her constituents and others, is not just about office accommodation. We want to provide the highest quality of service through whatever mechanism is most appropriate. I hope that she will join our discussion on how we can do that. As I have said, both the Jobcentre Plus district manager and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Work will be happy to meet her to discuss that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h03_para91"><a name="stpa_236">My hon. Friend has served her constituents well this afternoon by raising this matter, and has done us all a service by allowing us to have a useful, important debate on how we ensure that we provide the highest quality

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
service to our constituents, albeit in an environment where the Government have made a commitment to provide those services with greater efficiency. I hope that she and other hon. Members will feel that, as part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consultation process, we can ensure that we continue to drive forward our agendas of giving people opportunities for employment, building a better life for themselves and building on their ambitions and abilities, while doing that in the most efficient and effective way possible.

<a name="time_14">
<a name="41103h04_time0"><h5>3.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_44"><a name="41103h04_spnew0"><b> Tom Cox  (Tooting)</b>  (Lab): I declare my interest in this debate and in Cyprus. I am and have been for many years the chairman of the all-party group on Cyprus, which has members from all the main parties. We have always stated that we support the rights and security of Turkish Cypriots, as we do the Greek Cypriots.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para0"><a name="stpa_237">Since the events of 1974, we in this Parliament have kept alive the issues of Cyprus. To many, the issues that Cyprus has faced since those events could and should have been resolved long ago. For many more, and certainly the people of Cyprus, over the past 30 years, there have been hopes for a solution&#151;not any solution, but an honourable, acceptable settlement that would have seen the rebuilding of trust within the communities and the rebuilding and development of the whole of the island. That, sadly, has not taken place.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para1"><a name="stpa_238">Although the recent efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations were welcome, his proposals, known as the Annan plan, were not acceptable to a large percentage of the Greek Cypriot community. That rejection came as no surprise to many of us. I do not intend to comment on those aspects of the plan that were unacceptable, as we could spend hours discussing what was wrong with the proposals. The fact is that the plan was rejected&#151;in some ways regrettably&#151;because of the issue of Famagusta. That, however, does not mean that we cannot develop proposals for Cyprus and, especially, for the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para2"><a name="stpa_239">One very clear development would open the way to building a future for the whole of Cyprus: the reopening and the redevelopment of the town, and that means the whole town, of Famagusta. It is not a dream. It is the clear wish of the people, be they Turkish Cypriots or Greek Cypriots, whose links are to that town.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para3"><a name="stpa_240">I do not know the extent of the knowledge or involvement of my hon. Friend the Minister who will reply to this debate. As for the co-operation of the two mayors of Famagusta, the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot mayors now meet to discuss their plans, priorities and aspirations for Famagusta&#151;a Famagusta populated by the people of Cyprus. I have with me a letter dated 4 October from the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, giving his full support to the sorts of proposals that I will outline. I have met the president of the Famagusta chamber of commerce, Mr. Andreas Matsis. He will work with Greek and Turkish Cypriots to rebuild Famagusta, as will the chamber of commerce.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para4"><a name="stpa_241">We start with a vital commitment&#151;the willingness and desire of the two communities to work together. Famagusta has, sadly, been a deserted town for the past 30 years. It was once one of the principal towns on Cyprus and many of us believe that it can be again. That is why I sought this debate. In recent weeks, there has been a marked improvement in the relationship between the communities in Cyprus, and I warmly welcome that. The United Kingdom must be seen to support fully what the people of Cyprus now clearly say that they want.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para5"><a name="stpa_242">My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and principal spokespeople from the European Union have all recently said that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 113WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
opportunities for Turkish Cypriots must be developed. I put it to the Minister that no area of Cyprus offers the Turkish Cypriot community a greater chance to do that than Famagusta.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para6"><a name="stpa_243">Famagusta was once one of the most beautiful and popular tourist areas in Cyprus, and some of the most wonderful hotels in the world were there. All that could happen again. It has excellent harbour facilities, which, when updated, would give it one of the most modern and used ports in that area of the Mediterranean. Famagusta could be the site of the export and import of vast quantities of goods to and from Cyprus. As Cyprus is a member of the European Union, trade links with other countries of the European Union and indeed with the other trading countries of the world would certainly be developed. The Cypriot people have great skills in a wide range of professions. In a reopened, redeveloped Famagusta, there would be every opportunity to develop those skills.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para7"><a name="stpa_244">No one would benefit more from such developments than the Turkish Cypriot community. That is to be welcomed, but to many of us the great advantage would be to Cyprus and to its people. It would show them what can be done with real co-operation. As I have said, for some 30 years, much of Famagusta has been deserted. No one can say what the infrastructure of the town is now like, and an in-depth survey of its infrastructure must be a top priority. There are experts who could do that. It would cost money but, in view of recent statements by the European Union, we have a right to look to it for financial support for such a survey, given what can be achieved. Do the Government and the Minister support such a survey?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para8"><a name="stpa_245">I put it to the Minister&#151;I ask for his reply to these proposals&#151;that we should invite the two mayors of Famagusta to London to discuss with them and their officials the proposals and plans for the whole of Famagusta. Otherwise, we could ask the British high commissioner in Cyprus to convene a meeting with the same kind of agenda. Let our country, with its long historic links with Cyprus, show the people of Cyprus that we want to work with them and to support them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para9"><a name="stpa_246">I understand that a large sum of European Union money could already be made available to Cyprus. Will the Minister say whether that is correct? If it is, how will that money be spent? In the Cyprus of today, both Greek and Turkish Cypriots clearly want to co-operate, and they have a joint goal in showing that they will use their skills and knowledge for the benefit of the whole island and its people. I have not talked about the events of the past 30 years, because I look to the future for Cyprus and its people, to what can be done and to what the people want done.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para10"><a name="stpa_247">I am sure that the Minister knows that in September my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis), whom I am delighted to see with us this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afternoon, the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr.&nbsp;Gale) and I spoke to the Foreign Secretary in a friendly meeting, during which we discussed issues concerning Cyprus, many of which I have not mentioned in this debate. The Foreign Secretary has met Mr. Talat to talk about Cyprus. Although there may be a lot of discussion still to take place on some issues, if Mr. Talat wishes to see a Cyprus where Turkish Cypriots are respected and have every opportunity to develop their future and a love of their families, he 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 114WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
should support the proposals that I have outlined today. That is what the Turkish Cypriot mayor of Famagusta wants to see, and he speaks on behalf of his people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para11"><a name="stpa_248">Over the past 30 years, Turkey has had influence in the affairs of northern Cyprus, and now the door to its possible membership of the EU has opened. I hope that the Minister and the Foreign Secretary will make it clear to the Turkish Prime Minister and his fellow Ministers that it is time they listened and supported the wishes of the Turkish Cypriots of Cyprus.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para12"><a name="stpa_249">I have outlined not a dream or a possible hope but a real opportunity for Cyprus and its people&#151;that is what the reopening and redevelopment of Famagusta will mean to them. The title of this debate is &quot;Famagusta (Cyprus)&quot;. That is what I have spoken about and I hope that the Minister&#039;s reply will concentrate on that. Do the British Government support such a proposal? What, if any, would be the legal requirements to start discussions on such a proposal? If we support such a proposal, will we promote it in the EU? Will we enter into discussions, as I have suggested, with Mr. Talat about reopening and developing Famagusta with the two people in the forefront of the proposals&#151;the mayors of Famagusta&#039;s Greek and Turkish Cypriots&#151;and the Turkish Government? I have already said that the President of the Republic of Cyprus fully supports such proposals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para13"><a name="stpa_250">Please do not let us lose this golden opportunity, which will offer so much to Cyprus and its people. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s reply, and I assure him that the people of Cyprus do, too.

</p>

<a name="41103h04_time1"><h5>3.44 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_45"><a name="41103h04_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Denis MacShane) </b> : I&nbsp;congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Tom Cox) on securing this timely debate. He talked about a golden opportunity, and I have stood on the golden sands of the port city of Famagusta, looking at&nbsp;the ghost town of Varosha. That is the correct term&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for an extraordinary, historic geography. I saw a&nbsp;once bustling, beautiful port and seaside resort, its skyscrapers, roads and shops all empty, like a Hollywood ghost town. It is a bizarre, eerie sensation when one thinks of the money, economic activity and pleasure and profit from tourism that could be brought to all the people of Cyprus&#151;Greek-speakers and Turkish-speakers alike. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for securing the debate. I congratulate him sincerely on the comprehensive interventions and tireless work that he has carried out with other colleagues in the House, on both sides of it, who are so committed to securing justice and a peaceful resolution to the Cyprus issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para14"><a name="stpa_251">Ever since independence in 1960, Cyprus has been a cause of great concern to the House of Commons&#151;not just in the last 30 years but in the last 40 and more. I have visited Cyprus on and off for nearly 30 years. I recently had a positive meeting with President Papadopoulos and other colleagues on the Greek Cypriot side. They are the sovereign Government of the Republic of Cyprus. I also met Mr. Talat and Mr. Serdar Denktas, the leaders of the Turkish Cypriot community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para15"><a name="stpa_252">It is sad that the historic port city of Famagusta, a lively town with a bustling university, and the neighbouring suburb of Varosha, which is one of the most beautiful seaside resorts that I have seen, have been pawns in the various abortive attempts to resolve 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 115WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the division of Cyprus. Nothing symbolises the wasted potential of the island so much as the kilometres of shattered and derelict buildings along some of the most idyllic coastline in Europe.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para16"><a name="stpa_253">We are keen to ensure that tens of thousands of former residents of Varosha can return to their properties. I am sure that all hon. Members would like to see Greek and Turkish Cypriots working side by side to return the port of Famagusta to being a thriving Mediterranean port working for the mutual benefit of the whole island&#151;the port, of course, trading with Turkey. As Turkey starts its accession talks for full membership of the EU, we want a normalisation of trade between all the island of Cyprus and the important future European Union member state Turkey.
</p>






<p><a name="st_46"><a name="41103h04_spnew1"><b> Dr. Rudi Vis  (Finchley and Golders Green)</b>  (Lab): On 17 December, a decision will be made about Turkey&#039;s accession negotiations. Is Turkey required to recognise the Republic of Cyprus before then?
</p>






<p><a name="st_47"><a name="41103h04_spnew2"><b> Mr. MacShane </b> : It certainly matters that Turkey and Cyprus normalise their relations, but no one is laying down any new conditions for a clear yes on 17 December as a precursor to Turkey starting its accession talks with the EU. In my talks with President Papadopoulos and other Government leaders of the Republic of Cyprus when I was in Nicosia 10 days ago, I was glad that there was no threat that they would try to stop what will, I&nbsp;hope, be an historic decision that will send a signal to the world that that great country, Turkey, is turning its face firmly towards Europe and that, during the long period of accession negotiations, it wants to meet all the&nbsp;criteria that membership of the European Union requires.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para17"><a name="stpa_254">Before we get to that point, we must welcome the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposal that the Government of the Republic of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyprus made in July regarding Famagusta and Varosha. It is vital to explore every opportunity for movement and any measure that might contribute to a climate of increased trust and confidence between the two communities. Such measures need to be mutually agreed. They must be balanced and realistic and they must take us forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para18"><a name="stpa_255">Under the last version of the Annan plan, the Turkish Cypriots would have been able to operate Famagusta port as part of the Turkish Cypriot state, and Varosha would have been returned to its Greek Cypriot owners. Although I know that the July offer was made in good faith, and I welcome the initiative of Nicosia, it is hard to understand why the Turkish Cypriots should be asked to settle for any less today. That is why I welcome the desire for any move or dialogue. I welcome the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting that the respective leaders of the communities of Famagusta and Varosha should meet to discuss the matter and take it forward. In my meetings with Mr.&nbsp;Papadopoulos and Mr. Talat, I suggested that the two of them should find ways of meeting together or, if they cannot for whatever protocol reasons, they should invite their officials to find places and ways of meeting to discuss how the impasse arising out of the Greek Cypriot rejection of the Annan proposals in April can be taken forward.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para19"><a name="stpa_256">The sort of initiative that my hon. Friend referred to is a positive way forward. Of course, it will need backing and the agreement of leaders at a higher level but, if we can find a means of taking it forward, I will welcome that and I am happy to ask the high commissioner in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicosia to see what he can do to facilitate any such&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meeting. I strongly welcome my hon. Friend&#039;s proposals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para20"><a name="stpa_257">The Government of the Republic of Cyprus must now work with the Turkish Cypriot side to examine how the ideas for Famagusta can be taken forward. The international community has done its best to find a solution. We sent our finest diplomats from New York and London and people from Ankara and Athens have also had something to say, but a vote took place. We are all democratically elected here and we live and die by votes, so we must abide by that decision. That is why I&nbsp;said in Cyprus that we must bring the Cyprus problem back to the people of Cyprus, back to the two communities and back to their elected leaders to meet, to discuss and to find ways forward.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;We want a solution as soon as possible &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We have monuments and a town that needs saving. It has remained untouched for 30 years, if we leave it for another 10 to 20 years it might not be able to be saved.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para21"><a name="stpa_258">Mr. Skordis is a mayor who is unable to live in his own community, but his words are absolutely right.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para22"><a name="stpa_259">In the same article, a young Turkish Cypriot, Mr.&nbsp;Sherer Sever, who flew back from his PhD studies in London to vote yes in the referendum, stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;I voted for a solution, things have got to change. The ghost town is crazy and needs to have something done about it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para23"><a name="stpa_260">I completely agree with what Mr. Sherer Sever&#151;I hope now Dr. Sherer Sever&#151;said.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para24"><a name="stpa_261">I wish that many hon. Members could visit the area, as I did, and see from afar the ghost town of Varosha. They would realise what an affront it is to all European norms and values that it cannot be used for its purpose of allowing people to have very pleasant holidays and of bringing enormous economic benefits to Turkish and Greek Cypriots alike.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para25"><a name="stpa_262">I discussed Varosha, Famagusta and many other issues during an extremely useful visit to Cyprus a little under two weeks ago. Cyprus is a valued friend and partner of the United Kingdom and the European Union. We must work together to promote an open,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dynamic and globally competitive EU. With its unparalleled location, Famagusta has an important role to play as the EU looks to its southern borders for new trading opportunities.

<a name="41103h04_para26"><a name="stpa_263">My hon. Friend the Member for Tooting asked about EU funds. I can report that &#8364;259 million has been allocated to help with the development of northern Cyprus. In my view, some of that money could help to unblock the Famagusta-Varosha problem.

</p>






<p><a name="st_52"><a name="41103h04_spnew5"><b> Mr. MacShane </b> : If I may, I had better finish my speech. The debate is short, despite the Divisions that we had.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para27"><a name="stpa_264">Confidence-building measures are an important step towards achieving that shared vision and any measures that can help to build trade links and reduce the economic gap between the two communities, and between Cyprus and the rest of the world, will make reunification more likely, easier to consolidate and less costly. Trade will increase trust and lay the foundations for co-operation in a reunified Cyprus. I say again that the tourist trade is the obvious breadwinner for that stunningly beautiful island. A widening wealth gap and continued economic division will make a solution much more difficult.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para28"><a name="stpa_265">During my visit, my friends in the Cyprus Government expressed the well-known demands for a new approach from Turkey on a number of issues that prevent Cyprus exercising its full sovereignty on trade and other issues. The British Government understand such concerns&#151;I am grateful to my hon. Friends here and to other hon. Members who draw them to my attention regularly&#151;just as we understand the concerns of our friends in the Turkish Cypriot community that economic development and normal tourism, trade and travel are not on offer to them despite their clear vote in April in favour of the plan, backed by the United Nations and every EU Government, to create a united Cyprus.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para29"><a name="stpa_266">Britain wants to see trade develop in Cyprus on the basis of EU norms, and that means trade in all directions, in all sectors, 360 degrees around the compass. Trade in the EU and all parts of EU member states is open, normal and no longer controlled by Governments or state-linked bodies. Low-cost airlines can land their planes freely in any airport of their choosing in the EU without let or hindrance by

Governments. I hope to see flights to all parts of Cyprus on the basis of commercial viability, not political considerations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para30"><a name="stpa_267">The whole atmosphere would be greatly helped if relations between Ankara and Nicosia could be normalised. It is for the political leaders in those cities to decide whether they can find a means of dialogue, as one sovereign republic to another, to normalise their relations. There is no question of the United Kingdom recognising the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. However, many of my colleagues are asking what practical steps are being taken by all of us as EU member states to meet the &quot;determined&quot; wish of the EU&nbsp;Council of Ministers of 26 April to end the isolation of Turkish Cypriots. That will require a new approach as well.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para31"><a name="stpa_268">As I said earlier, I am glad that my talks in Cyprus confirmed the long-held views of the elected leaders of the Republic of Cyprus that no one should seek to veto Turkey&#039;s application in December. That will be the beginning of a great deal of hard work, over a number of years, for Ankara. Once the negotiations start, another question will arise: when will Ankara and Nicosia move to normalise their relations, as is the case between all EU member states and between those seeking to join the EU, such as the Balkan states and Turkey?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para32"><a name="stpa_269">It is an anomaly that Turkey does not have normal diplomatic relations with one of the 25 EU member states with which it has to negotiate to join the European Union. I hope that that can be solved, although there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no question of its being a precondition. That normalisation should also involve considering the number of troops stationed in Cyprus and the immense amount of money spent by Ankara and the Cyprus Government in Nicosia to maintain troop levels. There are more than two divisions of Turkish troops, and I was informed that &#163;100 million is spent each year. There is a conscription period of more than two years on the Greek Cypriot side. Those are some of the issues that will have to be discussed and resolved soon&#151;the sooner, the better.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h04_para33"><a name="stpa_270">In the meantime, if we could start local, serious discussions on finding a way forward on Famagusta and Varosha, no Government would be more delighted than ours. I&nbsp;am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting for making his distinguished contribution towards finding a solution to this continuing problem.

<p><a name="st_53"><a name="41103h05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate)</b>  (Con): I see this debate not in isolation but as part of Parliament&#039;s role in the continuing unhappy and shaming saga of our country&#039;s treatment of a small group of its subjects and their descendants, namely, the Chagos islanders, who are drawn principally from Diego Garcia, the largest island in the chain.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para0"><a name="stpa_271">I use the term &quot;subjects&quot; advisedly. Although it implies a rather unfashionable view of the relationship between the people and their sovereign, I am entirely clear that my sovereign&#151;in practice, her Government&#151;owes her subjects a profound duty of care. That duty of care is cast as a sacred trust on a sovereign power to promote the welfare and advancement of the people under article 73 of the United Nations charter, but our Government have shamefully and disgracefully honoured it over four decades, and mainly in the breach, in the case of the Chagos islands.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para1"><a name="stpa_272">In coming to an understanding of this issue&#151;embarrassingly late, given my service as a special adviser in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#151;and in raising it on behalf of my constituents, who are now being invited to pay the nation&#039;s price, I am still astonished that a liberal democracy in the early 21st&nbsp;century continues to behave in a shabby manner towards its subjects.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para2"><a name="stpa_273">I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) for his work on the issue and for raising it in the Chamber on 7 July. I also pay tribute to the Father of the House, whose work over four decades on behalf of these unfortunate people is an example to us all.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para3"><a name="stpa_274">My remarks should be seen in the context of the debate on 7 July, which focused on the Orders in Council, promulgated on European and local election day on 10 June, which prevented the right of return to the islands as lawfully established four years earlier in a British court. In pursuing the matter, I am in complete harness with my hon. Friends the Members for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) and for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) in that we all represent council tax payers of the borough of Reigate and Banstead. I am also grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) and for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) for their support, and for the presence in this&nbsp;debate of the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), whose constituents are also affected by the issue and who has been dealing with it for about a year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para4"><a name="stpa_275">My hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey will be pursuing the issue of the Government&#039;s obligation to the council tax payers of Reigate and Banstead in an Adjournment debate tomorrow with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I intend to focus the rest of my remarks on the Government&#039;s obligations to the islanders.
</p>






<p><a name="st_54"><a name="41103h05_spnew1"><b> Sir Paul Beresford  (Mole Valley)</b>  (Con): It would be very useful for the ODPM to provide the Minister with a sincere statement about the plight of these people and the cost to local government.

in conjunction with each other. I do not know whether the Minister will have anything to say on behalf of other Departments when he replies, but I will draw attention in the rest of my remarks to the risks that the Government are running under their current policy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para5"><a name="stpa_276">The only thing to be said for the Government&#039;s position on the Chagos islanders is that it is clear. The Orders in Council were detailed in a written ministerial statement and left no room for doubt. The statement read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;Accordingly, the Government consider that there would be no purpose in commissioning any further study into the feasibility of resettlement; and that it would be impossible for the Government to promote or even permit resettlement to take place. After long and careful consideration, we have therefore decided to legislate to prevent it.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15 June 2004; Vol. 422, c. 33WS.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para6"><a name="stpa_277">The lack of consultation and the way in which the decision was taken and promulgated were outrageous, and I am far from convinced that the decision was correct. Indeed, it was probably practically and morally wrong, but at least it was clear.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para7"><a name="stpa_278">The Chagos islanders, in the Government&#039;s view, are not going home. That leaves 5,500 islanders and their descendants, who live mainly in Mauritius and the Seychelles and who are now entitled to British citizenship and residence, with no practical alternative if they are to extricate themselves from their largely poverty-stricken existence but to come here in increasing numbers. Some 900 passports have been issued so far by the high commissioners in Mauritius and the Seychelles. The Prime Minister was either misleading or misinformed when he told my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell last week that my hon. Friend was exaggerating the number of people who would come. Why does the Prime Minister think that 900 passports have been applied for when these people have perfectly good Mauritian travel documents of their own?

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para8"><a name="stpa_279">Now that the Government have slammed the door on people returning to the Chagos islands, they must prepare for a significant part of the community to come here. A failure to plan will result in the events that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have engulfed the borough of Reigate and Banstead in the past month being repeated a hundredfold. Uncontrolled immigration of those people would be a disaster.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para9"><a name="stpa_280">I am advised that 95 per cent. of the original islanders are illiterate, as are 40 to 50 per cent. of their descendants, because of the way in which the Mauritian education system works. If someone fails to meet the necessary standards at 12, their formal education comes to an end. The vast majority speak not English but a French patois, and even now interpreters are being sought to converse with the 32 islanders with whom the borough of Reigate and Banstead is coping, as classical French speakers are deemed inadequate to interpret the reviews of the islanders&#039; circumstances.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para10"><a name="stpa_281">The first groups of these British citizens have arrived destitute at Gatwick over the past two years. A few have already settled in the area. In the wake of the Orders in Council, we are facing an uncontrolled immigration of penniless and unqualified British citizens to one part of the country. The huge sympathy for their plight, when understood nationally, will almost certainly rapidly turn&nbsp;to anger and resentment as local services are overwhelmed.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 121WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para11"><a name="stpa_282">The islanders are bound to concentrate in one area if immigration is uncontrolled, as they will lack the ability to communicate outside their group. The social problems that they endured in Mauritius will simply be repeated here. This country can and should avoid that. The least that we can do is properly prepare those in the community in Mauritius and the Seychelles who wish to exercise their right to move to the United Kingdom.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para12"><a name="stpa_283">There is an overwhelming case for controlled immigration. I hope that the Minister will urgently consider a properly funded programme, which would teach such people English, equip them with the skills and training to enable them to be part of the United Kingdom work force, and provide services to enable them to identify jobs and homes in the United Kingdom before they leave Mauritius and the Seychelles. Legally, we cannot control their immigration but, practically, we can prepare for those British citizens, now habitually resident in Mauritius, who wish to come to the United Kingdom.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para13"><a name="stpa_284">The Foreign Office is more than capable of administering a suitable programme over several years&#151;that is how long it will take&#151;that will help such people to meet the challenge. It could co-ordinate the resources of the British Council and other Departments in order to do that. I cannot imagine that any teachers sent to the Seychelles or Mauritius on programmes run by the British Council or other Departments will regard it as a punishment posting.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para14"><a name="stpa_285">Also, if the Foreign Office administers such a programme, it will at least go a little way towards making up for its unhappy role in the affair of the Chagos islanders over the past four decades. Failure to make investment in such a programme will not save any money. It will cost far more to provide for education, training, housing and social services in the United Kingdom after an unprepared population arrives. In all probability we would cause further social disaster for an isolated and mistreated people. If we do not deal with the issue now, in years to come we may find that we have forced the islanders to turn to crime to support themselves, and the criminal justice budget will then make a contribution to this sorry saga.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para15"><a name="stpa_286">The Government&#039;s decision to block a return to the islands requires follow-up action now. Telling the local authorities of Crawley, Reigate and Banstead, Surrey and West Sussex that they are on their own could be disastrous. Controlled immigration must be the objective of government policy. As that means discharging our moral obligations generously, we will be doing the right thing for the right reasons. I invite the Government to do so.

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="41103h05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Peter Ainsworth  (East Surrey)</b>  (Con): I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blunt) for the opportunity to make a short contribution to this important debate, and I congratulate him on securing it. As he will know, I intend to return to this issue from a local government perspective tomorrow, and I will return the compliment should he wish to participate in my debate. The issue affects both our local authorities and those of other hon. Members whom he has mentioned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para16"><a name="stpa_287">The Minister is not responsible for local government finance, but I hope that he is sufficiently joined up with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to understand 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 122WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that the decisions taken by his Department about the Chagos islanders have direct consequences for local government in this country. The Orders in Council signed by the Government in June are a key reason why three weeks ago a group of 45 people from Diego Garcia turned up at Gatwick airport. As the Minister will know, the Orders in Council overturned a High Court ruling that the ordinance preventing the return of the islanders to their homeland was unlawful. Effectively, the Government acted to ensure that the islanders could not return to their homeland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para17"><a name="stpa_288">Given that the prospect of returning to destitute conditions in Mauritius lacks, shall we say, appeal, as my hon. Friend and I discovered during our recent visit to Horley in my constituency, where many of the islanders are housed, their decision to come to Britain has a certain logic. As British citizens, they have every right to be here but, thanks to this Government, they have no right to go home. The question is what further rights they have to housing, food and other benefits, and those matters are the subject of a complicated and expensive legal process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para18"><a name="stpa_289">I would be grateful if the Minister could let me know when he responds what discussions, if any, took place between his Department and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister about the likely, indeed inevitable, consequences for local government and local authorities of the decision to issue the Orders in Council. As my hon. Friend pointed out, the treatment of the islanders has been grossly unjust. From the original decision of Harold Wilson&#039;s Government to round them up and evict them, to the shabby decision earlier this year to overturn the High Court ruling, the whole story is a discredit to this country. To that injustice is added another. The cost of keeping the islanders in temporary accommodation is falling exclusively on local council&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tax payers. That is patently unfair. The problem is entirely of the Government&#039;s making and the Government should shoulder responsibility for the consequences of their actions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para19"><a name="stpa_290">My hon. Friend and I will return to the issue tomorrow, as the Minister knows. The short-term solution is in the hands of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, but the long-term solution lies with this Minister&#039;s Department&#151;a just solution that either allows the islanders to return to Diego Garcia, which I&nbsp;admit is unlikely given the Government&#039;s attitude, or, as my hon. Friend has suggested, at least provides them with the skills that they will need in order to make successful new lives in this country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para20"><a name="stpa_291">There have been too many evasions and too many excuses already. We look to the Minister to come forward with a clear and positive initiative that is fair to the islanders and to our constituents.

importance of these issues and the way in which the Government are attempting to work on them across the board.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para21"><a name="stpa_292">I assure the hon. Gentleman that I have every sympathy with the predicament in which he and the Reigate and Banstead borough council find themselves as a result of the arrival of that group of Chagossians in his constituency. His is not the first constituency to see such an arrival. Earlier groups arrived in Crawley, and I have had several meetings with my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) about it. Indeed, I am due to see her early next week to discuss it further.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para22"><a name="stpa_293">There is a debate tomorrow on local government provisions for Diego Garcians in Surrey. Therefore, I&nbsp;intend today to concentrate on the history of the British Indian Ocean Territory and the chain of events that has led to the present situation.

<p><a name="st_58"><a name="41103h05_spnew4"><b> Mr. Andrew Tyrie  (Chichester)</b>  (Con): Given the huge pressure that councils will find themselves under, particularly West Sussex county council, before the Minister leaves that subject, will he give us some idea of his Department&#039;s view in principle on how to handle the extraordinary burden that will be placed on those county councils? How should that be met, and is it acceptable that it should be met entirely by local people?
</p>






<p><a name="st_59"><a name="41103h05_spnew5"><b> Mr. Rammell </b> : The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the best way to resolve the issues is not necessarily by one Department telling another on the Floor of the House what it can and should do. Nevertheless, I can assure him that the Foreign Office is in touch with other Whitehall Departments, including the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health, on this issue. We have also been in contact with West Sussex county council, and that will continue. That is one reason that I am seeing my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley next week.
</p>






<p><a name="st_60"><a name="41103h05_spnew6"><b> Sir Paul Beresford </b> : On the same point, if the Minister is in discussions, he will be able to tell us what his Department is contributing and what the other Departments are contributing. That could make tomorrow&#039;s debate much simpler.

If Opposition Members would like more detailed information on the history of the Chagossians and the British Indian Ocean Territory, I should be happy to be contacted after the debate to arrange for such information to be given. However, I&nbsp;shall now give a brief overview of the situation. The islands of the Chagos archipelago, located in the middle of the Indian ocean, were ceded to Britain by the French in 1814 together with Mauritius, of which the islands were a dependency. Under British rule, the islands, which were populated by copra plantation workers and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 124WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
their dependants, continued to be administered as a dependency of Mauritius. Prior to Mauritius achieving independence in 1968, and with the agreement of the Mauritius Council of Ministers&#151;that is an important point&#151;the islands were detached in 1965 to form&#151;

</p>






<p><a name="st_63"><a name="41103h05_spnew9"><b> Mr. Rammell </b> : Let me finish this sentence. I want to make some progress because I have some important background information to get on the record. The islands were at that stage&#151;
</p>






<p><a name="st_64"><a name="41103h05_spnew10"><b> Mr. Blunt </b> : May I assist the Minister?
</p>






<p><a name="st_65"><a name="41103h05_spnew11"><b> Mr. Rammell </b> : I will finish this point, then I will give way. The islands were detached in 1965 to form part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, which was created to provide for the defence needs of Britain and the United States. The copra plantations were becoming no longer economically viable, and partly for that reason, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;partly because of defence requirements, it was eventually decided that the islanders should be relocated. That was done in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The vast majority of islanders&#151;some 1,200&#151;were relocated in Mauritius, but some went to the Seychelles.
</p>






<p><a name="st_66"><a name="41103h05_spnew12"><b> Mr. Blunt </b> : All of us here are familiar with the background, and I hoped that the Minister could start his reply from a later point. We understand that the Government have made their decision through the Orders in Council. Does he accept that that is a given? The merits of that were discussed in the debate initiated by the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) and I do not want to revisit them now. I instead invite the Minister to address the question of what we do now in the light of that decision.
</p>






<p><a name="st_67"><a name="41103h05_spnew13"><b> Mr. Rammell </b> : With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I&nbsp;was aware that two debates were coming one day after the other, and I spoke to him yesterday to clarify what issues he intended to address. The indication that I then received was that this debate&#151;properly, as it was to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Foreign Office debate&#151;would be about the background, history and rationale for what we have done and that, properly, the issues about local government finance would be addressed in tomorrow&#039;s debate. That is what I am seeking to do.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para24"><a name="stpa_295">Although the hon. Gentleman said that people are aware of the background, some of the interventions suggest that not everyone is fully aware of it. I should like to repeat what I said in this Chamber on 7 July about the measures taken by successive Governments, both Conservative and Labour. That is an important point in respect of the speech by the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth). I heard the references to Harold Wilson and to this Government but I think that he has forgotten the role of past Conservative Governments. <i>[Interruption.] </i>With respect, that is the point that was made, and that is what I am properly responding to.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para25"><a name="stpa_296">The measures taken by successive Governments of the 1960s and 1970s to depopulate the islands did not&#151;to say the least&#151;constitute the finest hour of UK foreign policy. I do not seek to justify what was done in the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 125WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
1960s or the 1970s. On 12 October, the Foreign Secretary indicated in the House that he understood how controversial were the measures taken many decades ago to relocate the Chagossians to Mauritius and the Seychelles.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para26"><a name="stpa_297">The nub of the problem, however, is that, regrettable as those measures may have been, this Government have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deal with the situation as it exists today. The responsibility of the UK Government for what was done&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the 1960s and 1970s has been acknowledged by successive Governments since then, as is demonstrated by the substantial sums in compensation that have already been paid to the Chagossians.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para27"><a name="stpa_298">The issue of compensation is directly relevant to the debate. Compensation was made available on two occasions. At the time of the relocation of the islanders, &#163;650,000&#151;equivalent to almost &#163;5.5 million in today&#039;s terms&#151;was made available to the Mauritius Government specifically to assist with resettlement. Subsequent to that, in 1982, an ex gratia payment of &#163;4&nbsp;million&#151;equivalent to &#163;9 million today&#151;was put into a trust fund for the benefit of the Chagossian community in Mauritius. Furthermore, the Mauritius Government made land available to the value of &#163;1&nbsp;million. At the time, it was agreed by all concerned, including the Chagossians themselves with the benefit of independent legal advice, that the payment was in full and final settlement of all claims against the UK arising out of the Chagossians&#039; transfer to and resettlement in Mauritius, as well as their preclusion from returning to the Chagos islands.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para28"><a name="stpa_299">Those payments amount to more than &#163;14 million in today&#039;s prices. The Chagossians&#039; lawyers advised them that that was a fair and reasonable settlement. In 2002, proceedings in the High Court were initiated in an attempt to secure further compensation, and in October 2003 the High Court dismissed the case in full in a comprehensive judgment. On 22 July this year, the Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal against the judgment.
</p>






<p><a name="st_68"><a name="41103h05_spnew14"><b> Jeremy Corbyn  (Islington, North)</b>  (Lab): I apologise for not being present for the opening speech. I was detained in the main Chamber at the time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para29"><a name="stpa_300">Despite all that the Minister has said, can he not accept that the Chagos islanders have been very badly treated? They have lived, and continue to live, in very poor conditions and great poverty, largely in Mauritius and to some extent in the Seychelles, and there is a moral&nbsp;duty on the British Government to recognise that poverty of people who are British citizens, and to ensure that a new assistance package is agreed with them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para30"><a name="stpa_301">As the Minister knows, a delegation is coming here later this month. It will have the opportunity to meet him, so that he can hear at first hand how awful the lives of many Chagossians have been in Mauritius since they were dumped on the quayside all those years ago.
</p>






<p><a name="st_69"><a name="41103h05_spnew15"><b> Mr. Rammell </b> : As my hon. Friend knows, I respect his conviction and integrity on this issue and the way that he has campaigned on it.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
representations. I have done that with regard to my hon. Friend and, as he knows, I am prepared to meet with representatives of the Chagossian community later this month.


</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para31"><a name="stpa_302">In 2000, the High Court, in judicial review proceedings brought by the Chagossians, held that the&nbsp;provisions of the British Indian Ocean Territory Immigration Ordinance 1971, which prohibited the unauthorised entry of any person into any part of the territory, were invalid in so far as they applied to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chagossians. Accordingly, the ordinance was amended so as to remove the prohibition in respect of the Chagossians, except with regard to entry into Diego Garcia itself. Subsequently, an independent study into the feasibility of resettlement, which had meanwhile been commissioned by the Government, concluded that resettlement of the islands on anything other than a short-term and purely subsistence basis would be highly precarious and would involve expensive underwriting by the British Government for an open-ended period, and probably permanently. That is pertinent to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Reigate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para32"><a name="stpa_303">I emphasise that that study was carried out by experts independent of Government, and because of that&#151;and equally because of the need to ensure and to maintain the availability and effective use of the territory for defence purposes, for which it was created and set aside&nbsp;in accordance with the UK&#039;s treaty obligations&#151;the Government decided, after long and careful consideration, that resettlement could not take place.
</p>






<p><a name="st_70"><a name="41103h05_spnew16"><b> Mr. Blunt </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>






<p><a name="st_71"><a name="41103h05_spnew17"><b> Mr. Rammell </b> : No. I need to respond to the points that have been made. I will give way if there is time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para33"><a name="stpa_304">Accordingly, the Government legislated to restore full immigration control over the whole territory, and that was done in June 2004.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41103h05_para34"><a name="stpa_305">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the manner in which these changes came about and the fact that they were undertaken through Orders in Council. I remind him that that has been the normal way of legislating on the overseas territories under successive Governments.
</p>






<p><a name="st_72"><a name="41103h05_spnew18"><b> Mr. Blunt </b> : All those points are familiar to anyone who read the debate or attended it on 7 July. I&nbsp;understand that the proposals I have made are fresh to the Minister, but all I am seeking from him is an acknowledgement that in the light of the Orders in Council something needs to be done. I understand that that something would have to be the subject of advice from his officials and other Departments.

<a name="41103h05_para35"><a name="stpa_306">The hon. Gentleman has worked in the Foreign Office. Other hon. Members in the Chamber who have been in government will know the legitimate difficulties involved. Specifically in response to some of the points that he made about the low level of literacy among the Chagossian community, there are currently no aid programmes to assist through the Department for

International Development, because Mauritius particularly is a middle-income country and there have been, at today&#039;s prices, substantial elements of compensation. Nevertheless&#151;and without commitment&#151; that issue has not been put to us before and I will consider it.

In addition, most Chagossians retain their status as citizens of the UK and colonies, and the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 gave them the additional status of full British citizens.

Given my responsibilities, and those of the Foreign Office, I do not believe that I can go further in responding to something that is properly a matter for discussion in the debates tomorrow.

<a name="41103h05_para37"><a name="stpa_308">I reiterate that I am not seeking to justify what happened in the 1960s and 1970s. I have said on several occasions that I do not regard that as the finest hour in the conduct of UK foreign policy. However, the fundamental problem faced by this Government was this. It is almost 40 years since the Chagossians last inhabited the islands and, accordingly, given the independent advice on the feasibility and sustainability of the repopulation of the islands, it would not have been responsible for the Government to say, &quot;The repopulation can take place and we will pick up the financial consequences.&quot; Considering the matter in the&nbsp;round, that would be a significant financial liability in the context of our overall contingent financial liabilities for the overseas territories.
