 I am pleased to have this opportunity to debate UK relations with Lebanon and Syria. I applied for the debate because in early January I was a member of the Anglo Arab Organisation&#146;s all-party delegation to Lebanon and Syria. The delegation was led by Lord David Steel and Jacques Santer, the former president of the European Commission, and organised by Mr. Nadhmi Auchi, the president of the Anglo Arab Organisation. The delegation included representatives of the Conservative and Labour parties, a Member of Parliament from Luxembourg and an Irish Senator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para1"><a name="07022751000011">The purpose of the visit was to meet with representatives of the Lebanese and Syrian Governments, and to witness some of the destruction wreaked on Lebanon by the recent Israeli bombardment. Our aim was to become better informed about how the current situation looks from the perspective of people living in Lebanon and Syria. I welcome this debate because it provides an opportunity to report to Parliament on what we learned during the visit, and to press the UK Government to adopt a more balanced and constructive policy towards the middle east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para2"><a name="07022751000012">In Lebanon, we met with the President, the Speaker of the Parliament and the Prime Minister. We also met with many influential thinkers, journalists and representatives of the business community. We travelled to south Beirut and saw the terrible destruction wreaked by the Israeli bombardment on the area of Beirut occupied by Shi&#146;a people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para3"><a name="07022751000013">In all our talks, leading figures were anxious that there should be a compromise in accordance with the constitution of Lebanon over the composition of the Government. Lebanon, which used to be a place of great prosperity, and which attracted visitors from all over the middle east and the world, has suffered badly from Israeli occupation and civil war. It was rebuilding and going forward but now, of course, the Israeli attacks have set it back again. People throughout the country were keen to be able to come together, to start to rebuild and to create better economic opportunities for the many who live in poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para4"><a name="07022751000014">A delegation of parliamentarians from Lebanon is attending this debate. They are extremely welcome, and I am sure that they have a variety of views about the situation in their country. My experience of that visit was that there is widespread criticism and resentment of US and French interference in the internal balance of Lebanese politics, and a deep anxiety that, following the withdrawal of the six-year representatives from the Government, a new Government should be formed that would prevent division and conflict from growing  <br>

in Lebanon. The Prime Minister gave us a firm assurance that a compromise was likely to be reached soon, and I am sorry to note that that undertaking has not been fulfilled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para5"><a name="07022751000015">I ask the Minister to spell out UK policy on that question. Will the UK continue to echo US policy in Lebanon, as it did in its failure to call for an Israeli ceasefire? The US position appeared to be to allow the Israeli bombardment to continue in the hope of weakening Hezbollah. I recognise that the Minister made some careful remarks&#151;when giving evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee, I believe&#151;in which he expressed regret about the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para6"><a name="07022751000016">My view is that the Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon was overdue and welcome. It created a great opportunity for Lebanon to move forward. Obviously, inquiries must continue into the recent assassinations and those who were responsible, but it is wrong and counter-productive for the US and its allies to back Prime Minister Siniora in such a factional and unbalanced way and thus foster further division in Lebanon. I hope that the Minister will say that the UK policy is to support all people in Lebanon in coming together, forming a new Government and rebuilding their country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para7"><a name="07022751000017">From Beirut, we travelled south and saw the systematic and deliberate destruction of bridges throughout the country, and, as we got nearer to the southern border, whole villages that had been systematically targeted. On our journey south, we met with the senior representative of Hezbollah, who pointed out that in the last few days of the conflict, and even after the ceasefire had been negotiated, Israel dropped many cluster bombs which were still causing death and destruction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para8"><a name="07022751000018">In answer to a question from a member of our delegation about his attitude to the existence of Israel, the Hezbollah representative said that all Arab states made it clear in the Beirut declaration of 2002 that they would recognise Israel if it in turn would accept the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders and with east Jerusalem as its capital, and if it would accept some settlement of the right of return question. He said that it was Israel and not the Arab Governments or the Palestinians who were unwilling to make peace. Of course, the Mecca agreement reinforces that possibility. He also made it clear that Hezbollah would not disarm, as its arms were required to prevent further Israeli incursions into Lebanon, but he also spelled out clearly that those arms would never be used in conflict of any kind with Lebanese people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para9"><a name="07022751000019">As we reached the southern border, we saw village after village that had been destroyed, but we noted that some Christian villages had been left completely intact because of careful Israeli targeting. It was clear that there was not widespread blanket bombing but carefully targeted destruction on a large scale. The villages that we visited, where we were greeted with warm and generous hospitality, had been occupied by Israel for many years. The people generally supported and praised those who had resisted Israel&#146;s occupation and forced its withdrawal. Many pointed across the wire between Israel and Lebanon to the Golan heights, which is a Syrian territory that has been occupied by Israel since 1967, and to the land known as the Beka&#146;a  <br>

farms, which is Lebanese territory that is still occupied by Israel and a cause of grievance between the two countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para10"><a name="07022751000020">As I observed the wanton destruction, I again felt deeply ashamed of the refusal of the UK Government to call on Israel to cease its bombardment of Lebanon. I also reflected on the fact that Iraq is, I believe, still paying compensation for the damage that it caused during its invasion of Kuwait a long time ago. Israel has caused massive damage and destruction in Lebanon, but I have heard no one call on it to pay compensation for the destruction of properties and villages, and the infrastructure of the country. That is another example of the double standards in US and UK policy towards the middle east, and a further failure to require Israel to abide by and respect international law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para11"><a name="07022751000021">From south Lebanon, we went to Syria to meet with the President, Foreign Minister, other Ministers and parliamentarians, the British ambassador and many others. The President lived for a long time in the UK. He is a charming and open man who, for a long time, was not going to be President and therefore took on the style of an ordinary western citizen. He is very popular in his country because he does not have a grandiose or fine-living style. He is keen to deliver significant reform in Syria, to open up the country and to improve the economic opportunities of the people, but he made it clear that the situation in the region made that difficult. Shortly after he took over, there was what has been called a &#147;Damascus spring&#148;&#151;a sort of opening up. It is difficult to continue such reforms when there is such bitter division all around and organised extreme Islamist groups in the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para12"><a name="07022751000022">The President stressed that the Syrian regime is secular and takes a tough line against Islamist insurgents, but that it was keen to work with others to help to stabilise the situation in Iraq. He deeply regretted the fact that the UK did not have, as he put it, an independent foreign policy. He said that, before Sir Nigel Sheinwald visited Syria for talks on behalf of our Prime Minister, he had been to Washington and that his view was that the UK could play a much more useful role if it had an independent policy, but sadly it did not and it continued to be a complete echo of US foreign policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para13"><a name="07022751000023">We met, too, the UK ambassador, who pointed out that Syria had accepted large numbers of refugees from Iraq&#151;nearly 1 million&#151;including large numbers of Christians, members of an ancient Christian community that is now largely being displaced, and that refugees in Syria tended to be poorer than those who were admitted to Jordan. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees made a plea for support for displaced people in Iraq and for those who have fled to Syria and Jordan. What has been the response to that appeal and what contribution has the UK made in general and, in particular, to support Syria in hosting large numbers of refugees from Iraq?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para14"><a name="07022751000024">The Syrian Foreign Minister is a veteran of long years of middle east peace negotiations and talks with great authority and clarity about that history. He was consulted by the authors of the Iraq Study Group report and was supportive of its recommendations for  <br>

progress in Iraq and the wider middle east. Will the Minister spell out firmly the UK Government&#146;s attitude to the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group? It set out, in my view, a clear way forward for Iraq that would lead to responsible withdrawal, but which involves giving up the aspiration for permanent long-term bases and for the domination of the country. It set out, too, a way forward for the wider middle east, calling for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in accordance with international law. It recommended asking Syria and Iran to help to stabilise Iraq and pointed out that if Syria is to be asked to co-operate in such a way a settlement is needed on the return of the Golan heights to Syria by Israel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para15"><a name="07022751000025">It was notable that, as reports were filtering out that the Iraq Study Group was likely to recommend that the US took part in much closer talks with Syria and Iran in order to try to help stabilise Iraq, we were told that the Prime Minister was strongly of the view that that was the right policy and that that was the policy that he advocated when he was consulted by the study group. When President Bush put the whole report to one side and failed, it seems, to accept it or to implement its recommendations, the UK voice went quiet. I would be keen to hear from the Minister the view of Her Majesty&#146;s Government on the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. I press him to explain why the UK Government continue to humiliate our country by acting as an echo of US foreign policy rather than adopting an independent and more constructive role.</p>

 First, I want to apologise to the right hon. Lady for being unable to stay for the whole of her debate, as I have to attend a Public Bill Committee on the UK Borders Bill. I would be interested in her comments on the nature of the relationship between Iran and Syria, and in what she was able to glean in Syria about the nature of the relationship between the Syrians, with a secular Government who are quite hostile to Islamists and Islamism, in headline terms, and Iran. Will she reflect on what we ought to do to try perhaps to weaken those links?</p>

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="07022751000027"><a name="70227h0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="07022751000447"><b>Clare Short:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. That is an issue that I should have covered. The President of Syria spelled out clearly that Syria had secular government, while Iran clearly did not, and that they are different kinds of Governments. He said in his analysis of the system in the middle east, &#147;We live in this region. We have to have strong relationships with our neighbours. We nurture a relationship with Iran because it is a neighbour of ours and we would very much like to see a settlement in the whole region.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para16"><a name="07022751000028">Discussion by commentators on the middle east always tries to highlight Syria and Iran as interfering in Iraq and as a destructive influence. The President pointed out that the US, the UK and others came from a long way away, but that the Syrians live in the region and have to have relationships with all the Governments of their region. My view is that the game of divide and rule, and of blaming Iran and Syria for problems in Iraq, is merely about creating scapegoats. It gets us nowhere and prolongs the tension and conflict in the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para17"><a name="07022751000029">I applaud the findings of the Iraq Study Group, which are not written in headline-grabbing terms. The  <br>

focus was on how the US could extricate itself from Iraq, but the report contains a plan for a peaceful settlement for the whole region, including Israel and Palestine. Iran will almost inevitably seek to acquire nuclear weapons. I am well aware that the Government of Iran say that that is not their intention, and that they simply want civil nuclear power, which they are permitted to have under the non-proliferation agreement. However, Iran is in a dangerous region with Israel, with nuclear weapons undoubtedly targeted at Iran. We need only look at what happened with Israel, which pretended that it was getting civil nuclear power when it was going for weaponry and was permitted to do so by the west; the same happened with India and Pakistan. We will not stop that proliferation unless we get a peace settlement in the middle east that includes an agreement that all weapons of mass destruction should be removed from the region. I think that that is the formal policy of the US and the UK, although we hear little about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para18"><a name="07022751000030">The vilification of Iran and separating Iran from Syria should not be the objective of our policy. Our policy should be to support a Government in Lebanon who help the country to come together, to rebuild and to stand against Israeli attempts to manipulate and to divide people in that country. Our policy should be to get Iran and Syria to help to stabilise Iraq and to drive on with a settlement in Israel and Palestine and with an agreement to remove all weapons of mass destruction from the region. I do not think that there is any prospect of that in the short term. However, I do not think that there will be peace until such an agreement is made. I feel pessimistic in the short term about the situation in the middle east, but after this President of the United States ends his period in office, perhaps the next President, whoever that may be, will see the trouble that the United States is in in the region, will look back at the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group and will start to implement them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para19"><a name="07022751000031">I would love our Government, instead of waiting for a change in US foreign policy, to strike out in that direction and to seek to have better relationships with Governments throughout the region, particularly those of Lebanon and Syria. I would love them to build on the Mecca agreement, which has brought to an end the conflict between Hamas and Fatah in Palestine, bring back funding support for the Government of the Palestinians, and work for a proper peace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para20"><a name="07022751000032">We have been told repeatedly that our Prime Minister wants to promote peace between Palestine and Israel before leaving office in a few months&#146; time. We have been told, too, that he wants to negotiate a new treaty to replace Kyoto and to complete the Doha round of trade talks that are meant to improve the trading opportunities of developing countries. It is extraordinary that he should think that he could achieve such a thing in a few months; indeed, it is delusional. However, it seems to me that the Prime Minister and the Government&#151;and whoever takes over from our Prime Minister, and successive Governments&#151;will not be able to contribute to the finding of peace in the middle east if they are not willing to adopt a more independent view; and a good place to start is to review our relations with Lebanon and Syria.</p>

 I am listening carefully to the right hon. Lady&#146;s comments. I know that she was part of a delegation that recently visited Lebanon and Syria. Before she concludes her remarks, will she say whether aid is getting through to the south of Lebanon? I visited the country with a delegation some months ago. It was not getting through then, and a great deal of concern was expressed in the south about who was responsible for that failure. What was her experience more recently?</p>

 I cannot answer my hon. Friend authoritatively, in that I did not do an extensive survey, but comments were made to us. We met some of the United Nations peacekeepers who were deployed down on the border, and people were saying that the only help that they were getting was from Gulf states; they were not aware of help coming from other parts of the world. As I said earlier&#151;I do not know whether he was here at the time&#151;it seems to me that Israel should be compensating the people of Lebanon for the destruction that has been done there. Israel has breached international law, and it should be held to account. It is shameful that no such serious proposition has been put before the international community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para21"><a name="07022751000035">Whether funding is available that is not getting through, or whether it is not properly available, I am not sure, but I noticed that, in the Paris pledging conference for the rebuilding of Lebanon, conditions were imposed about the funding only going through the Prime Minister&#146;s office. It seems to me that that will inflame the divisions, and it will not help anyone in Lebanon. One of my strongest arguments is that all responsible Governments, including ours, should work with everyone in Lebanon to try to bring people together to help to rebuild the country and to end the sort of divisions that have caused so much destruction, rather than supporting one faction within a divided Government who are unable to rebuild the country as their people would wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para22"><a name="07022751000036">As I was saying, I hope that our Government will make it clear that we do not support the divisive and unbalanced policy of the US and France in backing the Lebanese Prime Minister&#146;s office against other parties&#151;parties that need to come together to form a Government to conserve the interests of Lebanon. In the case of Syria, I believe that we should strengthen our relations and challenge the US vilification of Syria and the Syrian regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para24"><a name="07022751000038">My fear is that the Israeli Government have no intention of honouring international law or agreeing a settlement on the 1967 boundaries, with east Jerusalem as the capital of the new Palestinian state, and some sensible negotiation on the right of return. It is clear that Israel is expanding its boundaries, establishing more and more settlements and seeking to confine the Palestinian people to a series of Bantustans that do not constitute a state.</p>

There is no simple short-term answer, because US policy is so skewed.

 I congratulate the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) on securing this important debate. My brief remarks will fall into two sections.

I thought that only big metropolitan areas hosted such delegations, so I am really pleased that the delegation will be coming to the heart of middle England to speak to students in Selby, to visit various industrial sites and to meet local representatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para27"><a name="07022751000042">In my visit to Lebanon, I saw something of the country&#146;s potential. If a lasting peace could be achieved, the economic potential of Lebanon would be almost unbounded. It could once again become a prosperous area of the middle east. However, I shall concentrate first on the early-day motion on Syria that I intend to table later today. The early-day motion will call for talks at a ministerial level between the Syrian Government, the British Government and the Governments of European Union member states. I can think of no better person than my hon. Friend the Minister for the Middle East, with his robust style, to undertake such talks, because they will be challenging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="70227h0001.htm_para28"><a name="07022751000043">The Syrian Government will have to confront various issues. In parliamentary answers to me and others, my hon. Friend has raised the issues of the so-called facilitation networks and of full Syrian co-operation with the investigation into various political assassinations in Lebanon, including the tragic death of its Prime Minister. There is much to challenge Syria, but there are also many opportunities. If we can hold talks and ultimately reach agreement with Libya, with which our relations were, perhaps, even more difficult, I fail to see why we cannot make an effort to normalise relations with Syria, especially because the prize is so great.</p>

My north Yorkshire neighbour, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), the shadow Foreign Secretary, has returned to the issue time and time again, pointing out the recommendation of the Iraq study group that an Iraq international support group should be formed, which would actively enter diplomatic dialogue with Syria.</p>

Friend&#146;s tone in recent weeks. He said in the House last week that there are signs that Syria is prepared to help. That is true; there are signs that Syria would be prepared to open serious talks with Israel, and that Israeli society and Israeli academics would welcome such an approach. However, the feeling is that American pressure is constraining such serious talks.</p>

In the final declaration following that visit, the two parties stressed their determination to work jointly and to do everything to fight and uproot terror. Having spoken to our diplomatic representatives and others in Syria, the general assessment is that there had been a change in attitude in the Syrian regime and that considerable efforts were being made to secure the border and to achieve security co-operation with the Iraqi regime. Like many hon. Members, I have constituents serving in Iraq, and, as we draw down forces over the next few months, we have a responsibility to do everything possible to ensure their continuing safety. Serious talks with the Syrian regime would undoubtedly help that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para2"><a name="07022751000047">As the right hon. Lady has pointed out, Syria is a secular regime with a proud tradition of religious toleration, which is to be welcomed. There is a strong Christian community in Syria. The Damascus spring has been referred to, and there are big human rights issues in Syria that need to be confronted. There are also economic pressures on Syria&#151;for example, the oil industry is in decline. Syria needs to open out once again to the world, but it needs to be encouraged to do so. That is why, later today, I will table a modest motion calling for discussions at a ministerial level to begin between the UK and Syria, perhaps under the umbrella of the European Union. There would be much support for that among American politicians from across the political divide. Such discussions will inevitably happen as the months go by, and we could lead such a process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para3"><a name="07022751000048">Many parts of Syrian culture are rich. It has often been called the cradle of civilisation, and it has a great history. There is much economic and tourism potential in Syria. Whatever level hon. Members are at, we can only do what we can in Parliament. One of my proudest achievements is chairing the all-party beer group&#151;one of the many things that we have in common with Syrian people is a love of beer. I will be organising an event under the auspices of the all-party beer group to highlight the rich tradition of Syrian beer. We will obviously invite the Minister to that event, which will be a small contribution to improving links between our nation and Syria. In the same way that tremendous strides have been made with Libya, I look forward, over the coming years, to similar strides being made in our relations with Syria, so that it can once again play a full part in the international community.</p>

sits on the Independent Benches rather than with the Government. This is a timely debate, because now and over the next few days, we have a high-level delegation from the Lebanon present in this country. I am saddened that no more hon. Members are present this morning as it is certainly an extremely important debate to have at this time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para4"><a name="07022751000050">I had lunch with the delegation yesterday and we talked about the current situation in the Lebanon. The country has many great attributes, which I will not go into, but one of its great misfortunes is that it is afflicted with reflecting the wider conflicts in the middle east. When the delegation was asked what Britain and the international community could do to help resolve the conflict in Lebanon, the inevitable answer was to resolve the wider conflicts in the middle east, which play out incessantly in Lebanon itself. Undoubtedly, proxi-conflicts that have happened in Lebanon have involved one side lining up with the west and the other side lining up with Syria and Iran. It has been impossible to find a sensible and peaceful way forward to reunite the different communities in Lebanon and to ensure that it can have&#151;as it has not had for the last 40 years&#151;a peaceful future leading to improvements in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para5"><a name="07022751000051">Whenever I go to Lebanon, the people speak positively about the confessional system that they employ, but that system has a number of weaknesses in the current circumstances. On the Taif agreements, the disposition of the Lebanese Parliament was evenly split broadly between the pro-western and the pro-Arab communities. It is difficult to see a way in which that could be used to find reconciliation within the country. When I visited the country some months ago, we talked to the different players and blocs in the Parliament. During those discussions, it was clear that everyone understood the necessity to continue a national dialogue, but it has proven almost impossible for that to reap any real results and bring the two sides together. Indeed, one of the consequences of the failure of the national dialogue is conflict on the streets of Lebanon. Although, to the relief of everyone, both sides drew back from an intensification of that conflict, genuine concern was felt among the friends of Lebanon in this country and internationally. It was an extremely difficult situation that called for cool heads and rational discussion to prevent those involved finding themselves on a declining slope towards some of the difficulties that Lebanon has faced in previous years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para6"><a name="07022751000052">A stand-off such as the current one in Lebanon ratchets up tension, and although representatives from both sides have stated that they want everyone to act coolly and sensibly, it has not been possible to chart a way forward. The stand-off involves the Prime Minister on one side and the President on the other, who refuse to engage in dialogue. In addition, the leader of the Parliament refuses to bring the Parliament together to discuss some of the issues that face Lebanon. I agree with the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood that by vocally and publicly supporting one side or the other, the international community does not help resolve the inherent conflicts. There have recently been incidents on the blue line between Israel and Lebanon. A number of atrocities have also recently taken place&#151;particularly the bomb  <br>

on a bus that killed a significant number of people. Such incidents raise concerns among the friends of Lebanon. We need to find and chart a way forward that will begin to find, if not a solution, at least a modus operandi between all sides in the political system to reduce current tensions in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para7"><a name="07022751000053">I will briefly comment on a number of related issues and ask the Minister to respond to some questions, some of which may have already been asked. The implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 is a critical issue that is currently being considered in Lebanon. The resolution provides a framework for a permanent ceasefire and would lead us towards reconciliation not just in Lebanon, but in the wider context. Bringing forces together to try and reduce tension in the wider context would help move things forward in Lebanon. Resolution 1701 is critical to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para8"><a name="07022751000054">Israeli planes are still overflying Lebanese airspace. That is a flagrant breach not only of resolution 1701, but of all international law. Of course, that inflames public opinion in Lebanon, and for no useful purpose, because it is well known that the information that the Israelis claim that they obtain from those overflights can be more accurately determined by other means. Therefore, the question that I ask my hon. Friend the Minister, as I did in the previous debate, is: what action are the Government taking through international channels such as the UN to try to get the Israelis to desist from that practice, which helps no one and continues to inflame the situation between Israel and Lebanon?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para9"><a name="07022751000055">As I have mentioned, there was an incident on, I think, 8 February between Lebanese and Israeli forces at the blue line. Fortunately, UNIFIL&#151;the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon&#151;managed to resolve some of the issues and has put into practice changes that we hope will preclude such an incident happening again, but we need to begin to resolve the existing border dispute, which leads to such incidents. The Shebaa farms is a small area that is of no consequence militarily or economically. The UN has done some work on delineating the area and whom it potentially belongs to, but we need to move that situation forward much more quickly to resolve the border issue and reduce the tensions on both sides. What efforts are the Government making to try to push forward the agenda in relation to the border and particularly Shebaa farms?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para10"><a name="07022751000056">The French President suggested recently that some UN forces may be moved to the Lebanese-Syrian border, rather than deployed in the south of country in relation to the Lebanese-Israeli border. The Syrians look on that as a provocation, and it is not, I suspect, a useful way forward at present. I ask the Minister what discussions are being held as to whether it is appropriate in the circumstances for UN troops to be deployed in that way, as it appears that that will do nothing to improve relations between the Lebanese Government and the Syrian authorities.</p>

 I do not quite understand the question, because my last information was that troops of the Lebanese Government, not UN troops, were deployed along the border. Is my hon. Friend talking about the Syrian border, the Israeli border or both?</p>

 I am talking in this instance about the Syrian border. The BBC reported some days ago that President Chirac had suggested that it was possible that UN forces would be deployed at the Syrian border. I am well aware that Lebanese troops are deployed there, which seems sensible. In the current circumstances, with everyone in this Chamber recognising the need for a dialogue with Syria, to locate UN troops at the border with Syria would be a provocation and would not assist in developing such a dialogue. Therefore, I ask the Minister, if it is possible in international discussions, that we dissuade the French, if they do want to pursue that matter, from pursuing it at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para11"><a name="07022751000059">When I was in Lebanon not so long ago, the problem of cluster bombs was still very significant in the south of the country. Well over 1 million bombs were being painstakingly drawn up and exploded so that normal economic activity could start and people could return to their homes. That is a very slow process. The Government have been giving more money recently, so will the Minister to update us on the support that the United Kingdom has given to eliminating the cluster bomb problem in the south of Lebanon?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para12"><a name="07022751000060">The next issue that I want to consider is UNIFIL, because there have been a number of incidents in recent weeks. Spanish troops were threatened in the south, and when French troops were deployed, the local community&#151;a predominantly Shi&#146;a community&#151;were not best pleased and asked them to leave. The only reason why I raise those two very minor incidents is that the position of UNIFIL and the trust that the Lebanese community has in the role that UNIFIL plays are, in my view, critical to finding a way forward, yet we know that the activities of UNIFIL before the Israeli incursion last summer left it in a difficult position, because it was felt widely in Lebanon that it had not fulfilled its remit. This UNIFIL force has&#151;I will put it as kindly as I can&#151;an ambiguous role in Lebanon. It is critical that UNIFIL begins to fulfil its role, to ensure that the border is protected and that steps can be taken so that there can be some trust and confidence among the people in Lebanon that what happened last summer will not be repeated.</p>

 As I understand it, the UN mission is meant to disarm Hezbollah. It seems to me that that will never be achieved and that Hezbollah will never agree to be disarmed, which brings UN Security Council resolutions into disrepute. I am a passionate supporter of the UN, but if I were Hezbollah I would not agree to disarm, given the history of incursion from Israel. Does that requirement not need to be adjusted? Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that it is a dangerous requirement that puts the UN mission in a very difficult position?</p>

 Yes. I was not thinking particularly of that, although it is part of the mission. I was thinking more of the chapter of the UN charter under which the troops were operating and how much they could intervene in the situation in Lebanon. I do not want to get into which of those is more appropriate, because I am not a military expert. We need clarity on that issue, but to come to the issue of Hezbollah, the project is a long-term one. It would be folly for any attempt to be made currently to disarm Hezbollah. It is clear that  <br>

<notus-date day="27" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>27 Feb 2007 : Column 200WH</b><br>
Hezbollah has the confidence of the people of Lebanon, particularly those living in the south, who are most directly threatened by any possible Israeli action. I was trying to suggest that if UNIFIL could attract the confidence and trust of the people in the south, what has been set out may be possible at some future time. We are aware that Hezbollah is anxious to become a political rather than a military force. The confusion between those two aspects currently impedes its progress, so it has at least a political imperative to move towards being more directly seen in a political role, but we need to build confidence in order for that to be achieved, which I do not think is a particularly short-term project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para13"><a name="07022751000063">The question that I was trying to ask was: what are the UK Government doing to try to ensure that trust and confidence is built in UNIFIL? It now has roughly 10,500 troops. I do not think that it has reached its maximum complement; I think that there are still difficulties in getting other troops to assist in the UNIFIL process. Most importantly, is there an understanding that we need to build trust and confidence, and what steps are we taking to try to achieve that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para14"><a name="07022751000064">I congratulate the Government on the aid and development effort. I am not sure that it is the Minister with us today who is responsible; it may well be the Department for International Development. Whoever is responsible, they need to be congratulated. I know that we gave $45 million at Stockholm, and that we delivered another $115 million at Paris. I understand that we also recently agreed to the figure of $48 million for UN relief, mainly to deal with Palestinian refugees. All that is to be strongly welcomed. I congratulate the Government on being one of the earliest participants in work in the country. We have created a more positive attitude toward the UK as a result of all that effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para15"><a name="07022751000065">I return to an earlier question, and again ask the Minister whether development aid is getting through and making a difference on the ground to the people in the south who have not been able to return to their homes and who are still threatened by cluster bombs. They are dislocated and their economy has been completely disrupted. Are we doing something to reassure them that the international community, particularly in the west, cares about their situation and wants to improve it at this time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para16"><a name="07022751000066">Linked to all that is the Paris III conference. It is conservatively estimated that Lebanon&#146;s economy shrank by between 5 and 6 per cent. of its gross domestic product as a consequence of last summer&#146;s events. We know about the disruptions to the tourism industry, which is of major benefit to the Lebanese people, and to all sorts of economic activity that were a result of Israeli actions, not least the bombing of all the main roads and airports in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para17"><a name="07022751000067">At Paris III, the Lebanese authorities were looking for assistance with their serious debt of $40 billion, which is 158 per cent. of Lebanon&#146;s GDP. Some of that debt was built up as a result of previous conflicts between Lebanon and Israel. The primary need was to get the country through a difficult period and to get its economy on the road again. I understand that there was more than $7 billion at that very successful round&#151;it was much more successful than Paris I or II, perhaps because of the situation in which Lebanon  <br>

now finds itself. Major commitments were made by the Saudi Arabian authorities, the French and various others. However, the terms of the loans that were delivered&#151;I take the right hon. Lady&#146;s point about their being delivered through the office of the Prime Minister&#151;were not much better. To call them soft loans would be saying the most that could be said for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para18"><a name="07022751000068">Considering all the meetings held and travelling to Lebanon done by Foreign Secretaries and Prime Ministers, and all the political commitments and help that we have given to that country to help it through a difficult period, why was not it possible for us to provide some assistance with its economy? If the shrinking of its economy results in an adjustment process, and if there is a sharp rise in unemployment and people in the south become completely dislocated economically, will that not have political ramifications? Is not it critical that we try to ensure that that does not happen?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para19"><a name="07022751000069">My final point is about earlier comments regarding the dialogue with Syria. At the time of our previous debate on the Lebanon, the Government seemed keen to open that dialogue. Indeed, the Prime Minister had said several times that Syria and its position were critical to moving forward with the difficulties and problems of the middle east. I do not see why that has changed, but the tone of our dialogue about Syria has undoubtedly changed, as others have commented. There seems to have been a hardening of attitudes in the UK. That surprises me because the Iraq study group came out clearly and unequivocally in support of the need for a dialogue with the Syrians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para20"><a name="07022751000070">It is not as though the Syrians have not given a very positive response. They suggested that they would be prepared to open a dialogue, and they are talking to the Iraqi authorities. I am one of those who believes that it is currently beyond political capability for the west to speak directly to Iran, both because of the situation there and for other reasons. The Syrians, however, could carry on that dialogue on our behalf, but we need to engage with them to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para21"><a name="07022751000071">I ask the Minister to recognise that the problems in the Lebanon can be solved only if we begin to solve the problems in the wider middle east, and to recognise the centrality of Syria in all sorts of ways that we do not have time to go into. The Prime Minister has said several times, and I agree with him 100 per cent., how important an end to the conflict in the middle east is, not just to the middle east but to the whole world, for reasons of which we are only too well aware. Why are we attempting to freeze out the Syrians? Why are we not entering a dialogue with some energy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para22"><a name="07022751000072">I conclude by reminding the House that we sent a representative to talk informally to the Syrians some time ago. That does not seem to have been followed up in any way, and I urge the Minister to do that at the first opportunity if it has not already been done. I also urge him, on behalf of Lebanon, Syria and the wider middle east, to recognise that this is the way that we can make the difference in the middle east that the Prime Minister keeps talking about.</p>

 As I have less than three minutes, I shall simply ask the Minister two questions, without commenting on them, and comment on one issue. First, will the Minister comment on what Walid Jumblatt, the Druze leader, is reported to have said over the weekend?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para23"><a name="07022751000075">Secondly, I believe that the concept of the mutual recognition of rights has always been and remains the key to solutions in the middle east. Does the Minister agree that the one thing that would make a significant difference regarding Syria and Lebanon would be the release of the two Israeli soldiers in the near future to allow the kind of engagement with Syria and Lebanon that we have been discussing? I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) and others that that remains an essential step forward for there to be peace in the region and the rest of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para24"><a name="07022751000076">The one subject on which I shall comment is the British Council, which is rightly shutting down all its European operations and building operations in the middle east and more widely. Will the Minister provide some clarity on that? Will there be more of the same from the British Council&#151;spreading the English language and artistic work, neither of which I knock&#151;or will Britain&#146;s most recognised export, sport, be a key factor?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para25"><a name="07022751000077">These days, a common image in photographs and footage from any war zone, anywhere in the world, is that of the kids who are caught up in the conflict wearing Beckham and Ronaldo shirts, among others. Many of those shirts may not have been exported directly from the UK or England, but they bear the logos, names and colours of English football teams. That offers an opportunity to engage with people at a low, but ongoing, level. Groups such as the &#147;Kick racism out of Israeli football&#148; campaign&#151;I was privileged to attend its launch in this country&#151;directly challenge anti-Arab racism on Israeli football terraces and in the stands. Those are the sort of initiatives that the British Council could help with in various countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="70227h0002.htm_para26"><a name="07022751000078">Like me, the Minister is a keen mountaineer, and in Wadi Rum in Jordan the British Mountaineering Council is training Jordanians in mountaineering skills so that they can be local mountaineering leaders. What could be more real&#151;rather than simply symbolic&#151;than getting kids from across a divide and linking them by a rope on a mountain where the life of one is reliant on the rope skills of the other? That is not a tongue-in-cheek suggestion; it should be part of what the British Council attempts to do in such countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para0"><a name="07022751000081">We join the international community in calling for Hezbollah to release the soldiers whom they are still holding captive. We condemn Hezbollah on its record of launching rocket attacks on Israeli citizens from under-cover positions in areas occupied by Lebanese civilians. That action was wholly wrong, and it should be recognised as such by all the groups involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para1"><a name="07022751000082">The reaction of Israel in bombing Lebanon was disproportionate and devastating for the people of Lebanon. Last summer&#146;s air strikes damaged, if not destroyed, much of Lebanon&#146;s infrastructure, including roads, water and sewage treatment plants, dams, electrical plants, airports, port facilities, bridges and petrol stations. Civilian casualties were high: 1,200 Lebanese were killed and more than 4,000 were injured, with almost 1 million people&#151;almost a quarter of Lebanon&#146;s population&#151;displaced. Worryingly, the UNHCR reported that 60,000 homes were damaged with 15,000 destroyed and that 900 markets, farms and other commercial buildings were also damaged or destroyed. The damage to civilian infrastructure will take time and money to fix, and it is estimated that that will cost $3.6 billion dollars.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para2"><a name="07022751000083">According to the UN mine action co-ordination centre, 90 per cent. of the cluster bombs used by Israel in this conflict were used between the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 on 11 August and the cessation of hostilities on 14 August, which places another obstacle in the way of reconstruction in Lebanon. As Kofi Annan has said, it will take well over a year to clear the cluster bombs, and until they are disposed of displaced families cannot return to the daily business of agriculture and trade that is so vital to the rejuvenation of Lebanon. I condemn the use of such weapons because, as with land mines, their effect is often devastating to innocent civilians who are caught up in the conflict. Will the Minister respond specifically to those concerns?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para3"><a name="07022751000084">On the Israeli front, the damage caused by the conflict has also been severe. The unacceptable loss of life is a tragic waste. The cost of repairing buildings, including 6,000 damaged homes, has been estimated at $1.1 billion. I am certainly not underestimating the consequences of the conflict for Israel, but as this is a debate on Lebanon and Syria, I will confine my remarks to those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para4"><a name="07022751000085">The UK, the US and other major powers should put pressure on Syria to extricate itself from Lebanese affairs. Its involvement is a serious breach of Security Council resolution 1701, which calls for countries to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon. We should encourage all Lebanon&#146;s neighbours to recognise the spirit of the resolution as well as its literal application. Lebanon cannot become a strong nation if its sovereignty is compromised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para5"><a name="07022751000086">The UK&#146;s role in relation to both Lebanon and Syria, as well as other countries in the middle east, should be one of brokering negotiation.

The demonstrations calling for a national unity Government and the accusations that the Lebanese Prime Minister, Mr. Siniora, by seeking Hezbollah&#146;s disarmament is backing a pro-Israeli and pro-US  <br>

agenda have caused fears of possibly violent clashes between Government and Opposition supporters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para6"><a name="07022751000087">To help to solve those internal disputes, and in the light of yesterday&#146;s news that Hezbollah is rearming in security pockets in southern Lebanon, we urgently need to bring all parties to the table for renewed negotiations for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace settlement on all fronts, including Syria and Lebanon, and a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. That action was called for in the Iraq study group report, and there must be a sustained commitment by both the UK and US for it to take place. Until there are renewed negotiations to establish a peace settlement, conflicts will continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para7"><a name="07022751000088">The report also called for Syria to cease its aid to Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as to Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups. While Syria funds those groups, peace can never be established in the middle east. We must face down extremists on both sides, and the most effective way of achieving that is to ensure that they lose support from countries with a vested interest in the middle east. The UK Government should take a strong stand, and Syria&#146;s compliance should be a priority in any peace settlement discussions. I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para8"><a name="07022751000089">The UK&#146;s relationship with Syria needs to be one of negotiation and involvement. The report from the Iraq study group called for the US to create an Iraq international support group with Iraq and all the states bordering Iraq, including Iran and Syria, as well as other key players. At the moment, Syria could be said to be playing a counter-productive role, because its Government do nothing to stop arms and foreign fighters flowing across the border into Iraq and former Ba&#146;athist leaders finding a safe haven in Syria.</p>

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="07022751000090"><a name="70227h0003.htm_spnew1"><a name="07022751000460"><b>Clare Short:</b>
 The British ambassador briefed us that Syria has made considerable efforts to police that border and to prevent incursions. That should be recorded.</p>

 I am happy to accept that. The right hon. Lady speaks with great authority on these matters, so I stand corrected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para9"><a name="07022751000092">Our Prime Minister supported the US in its comment on 7 December 2006 that before Syria could sit down to negotiate with the US it would have to take certain actions. That approach seems to be unhelpful, because placing demands on Syria that must be met before it reaches the negotiating table ensures that discussions will never take place and that the demands will never be fulfilled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para10"><a name="07022751000093">Negotiations with Syria are the key to stabilising Iraq. The Government must persuade Syria of the merits of closing its borders with Iraq and controlling the flow of weaponry, insurgents and others passing over that border. As the Iraq study group report argued, as well as disincentives, we must provide incentives, such as enhanced diplomatic relations with the US, to encourage it to do so. That proposal is controversial, but without engaging in diplomatic dialogue with those countries with no preconditions, a peaceful conclusion to the Iraq war cannot be reached, and a broader peace initiative in the entire middle east will fail.</p>

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="07022751000094"><a name="70227h0003.htm_spnew3"><a name="07022751000462"><b>Mr. Keith Simpson (Mid-Norfolk) (Con):</b>
 I, too, congratulate the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) on securing the debate. As she has said, the purpose of her debate on UK relations with Lebanon is to report back on her visit there and to seek a more balanced approach to the middle east, as well as urging that UK foreign policy moves away from being an echo of American foreign policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para11"><a name="07022751000095">First, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) has made it clear&#151;indeed, this was echoed in last week&#146;s debate on Iraq in the other place&#151;that there needs to be a more holistic and perhaps slightly more sophisticated UK foreign and security policy towards the middle east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para12"><a name="07022751000096">Secondly, we recognise that regional engagement will have to be reactivated. I never saw the US Iraq study group report as a policy statement; it was more like an   la carte menu, from which one could pick and mix. Although I fully support picking and choosing from it, it will not be easy to get some regional powers to engage positively; indeed, the middle east peace process is littered with attempts by all sides to get them to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para13"><a name="07022751000097">Thirdly, as several hon. Members have said, the emphasis has been very much on the sufferings of the people of Lebanon, and rightly so. As I have said before in such debates, Lebanon looks more and more like the Weimar republic of the 1920s, whose democratic Government large numbers of armed militias, including the Nazis and the Communists, intended to overthrow. However, it would be a grave error not to recognise that direct attacks were made on Israel. No sovereign Government can allow members of their armed forces to be kidnapped without trying to get them back or face sophisticated rocket attacks without thinking of retaliating in some way. We should bear that in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para14"><a name="07022751000098">Let me now turn briefly to UK relations with Syria. As the right hon. Lady has said, the Government are, in many ways, sending mixed messages about the results of their attempts to engage with Syria last year. What actually was the purpose of the visit to Damascus by the Prime Minister&#146;s envoy? What came out of it? Where are we today? Do the Government plan to continue those efforts, or have they been dropped in the face of reported US opposition or Syrian unwillingness? To take up a point made by another hon. Member, do the Government intend to raise such links to ministerial level?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para15"><a name="07022751000099">The Foreign Secretary has said that Syria has</p>
<a name="70227h0003.htm_brev0"><a name="07022751000393"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;expressed a willingness to become more constructively engaged with the Government of Iraq.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 20 February 2006; Vol. 457, c. 135.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para16"><a name="07022751000100">She pointed to the resumption of bilateral contacts between Iraq and Syria as positive progress in that direction, but has Syria expressed any comparable interest in being more constructively engaged with our Government or, indeed, the Government of the United States of America? Although one can criticise the United States for many things, Syrian engagement with the USA is perhaps even more important than Syrian engagement with us.</p>

international conference on Iraq? Would such a conference include regional countries, such as Syria?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para18"><a name="07022751000102">Let me now turn briefly to relations with Lebanon. As other hon. Members have said, it is clear that the confrontation between the Lebanese Government and Hezbollah has reached a critical point, because Hezbollah has withdrawn its Ministers from the Cabinet and is trying to paralyse the Government. Media reports suggest that it is consolidating its grip on southern Lebanon and that it is rearming. In the words of one observer, Lebanon has become</p>
<a name="70227h0003.htm_brev1"><a name="07022751000394"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a nervous country with a dying economy and with no solution in sight&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para21"><a name="07022751000105">The disarmament of Hezbollah will require a strong Lebanese state. What effect is the Lebanese Government&#146;s current paralysis having on efforts to implement Lebanese responsibilities under UN Security Council resolution 1701? What impact have UK efforts to rebuild the Lebanese security forces had on their capability to keep order in the country?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para22"><a name="07022751000106">Finally on this issue, the Minister said in answer to a question that I raised in Foreign Office questions last week that Hezbollah&#146;s fingerprints were all over some of the munitions used against British troops in southern Iraq. Was that statement in fact based on intelligence, or was it perhaps a slip of the Minister&#146;s tongue?</p>

Members have referred to Syria&#146;s long-term presence in Lebanon, and I have two questions on that issue for the Minister. On 7 December 2006, the Foreign Secretary said that the Syrian President had given assurances to the United Nations Secretary-General that</p>
<a name="70227h0003.htm_brev3"><a name="07022751000396"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Syria will undertake all necessary measures to implement this requirement; and that Syria is willing to assist Lebanon in setting up an effective interdiction regime, and where possible to establish joint border patrols with the Lebanese authorities.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7 December 2006; Vol. 450, c.1765-66W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para24"><a name="07022751000108">On 18 December, however, the Government said that the UK continued to be concerned about</p>

 I, too, thank the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) for giving us this opportunity to discuss the United Kingdom&#146;s relationship with Syria and Lebanon. As she told us, she recently visited both countries, so she is well placed to initiate the debate. As she said, the events taking place in both countries have consequences for the whole region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para27"><a name="07022751000112">The Prime Minister&#146;s visit to Lebanon last September&#151;the first by any British Prime Minister&#151;is a signal of how seriously the Government take events there. The Foreign Secretary&#146;s visit to the country last December was her first visit. I myself hope to visit Lebanon again soon; indeed, I would have been there today had the right hon. Member not initiated this debate. I was last there at the height of the terrible conflict in July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para28"><a name="07022751000113">The United Kingdom continues to be concerned by the ongoing political instability in Lebanon and by Syria&#146;s role in it. Since last year&#146;s tragic conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, our approach has been based on UN Security Council resolution 1701, which the Security Council unanimously agreed. Since then, we have supported the democratically elected Government of Lebanon in implementing that resolution and rebuilding the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para29"><a name="07022751000114">To that end, we have provided support to the Government of Lebanon in the form of humanitarian, political, economic and security assistance. My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love), among others, asked about the nature of that support and how we try to ensure that it gets through to the people who need it most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para30"><a name="07022751000115">We have also sent a senior envoy to Damascus in an attempt to reach out to Syria, and to encourage it to play a more constructive role in Lebanon and to face up to its wider responsibilities in the region. I was glad that the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) reminded us that this is a two-way relationship, and we must have evidence of reciprocal moves and of good will on both sides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para31"><a name="07022751000116">We certainly want a healthy, prosperous and peaceful democracy in Lebanon, and we want normalised relations with Syria. That ultimately requires Hezbollah to disarm and to participate in Lebanese politics as a fully democratic political party. We know how difficult that is. We have had long experience of trying to live alongside organisations that are armed to the teeth and that kill people, assuming that they have a God-given right to do that in the middle of a democracy. We had 30 years of Irish republican terrorism and I have some notion of what it must be like to be a politician in Lebanon. We have politicians from Lebanon with us in this country today, who have told me in no uncertain terms of the difficulties of operating in a democracy where a self-appointed alternative Government are prepared to use terrorism to enforce what they believe is their right to dominate politics in parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para32"><a name="07022751000117">My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton asked in particular about UN Security Council resolution 1701 of 11 August 2006, which established both the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah and the long-term framework that we sought for resolving the conflict. Since then, with a few exceptions, the cessation of hostilities has held. We were terribly sorry to hear about the bombed bus, and our condolences go out to the families of those who have suffered, but it has held remarkably over a very difficult period, notwithstanding the points made by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk to the effect that in some respects the situation in Lebanon is deteriorating. The cessation of hostilities has held and we must work to ensure that it holds further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="70227h0003.htm_para33"><a name="07022751000118">Some hon. Members have asked about overflights. I have pressed the Israeli Government many times about them. They are a challenge to the sovereignty of Lebanon and its right to control its airspace. The Israelis in turn ask what anyone else is doing about the smuggling of arms and rockets back across the Syrian border to rearm Hezbollah. We must address such issues. There is a need for confidence-building measures rooted in the reality of the contemporary situation if we are to persuade the Israelis to stop overflights and to persuade the Syrians that they should not be allowing the rearming of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. We could have an entire debate about why the Syrian Government feel that they must be able to pull the lever of Hezbollah whenever they feel like it. Syria has withdrawn its troops. There was huge controversy about the fact that it had lots of intelligence agents left in Lebanon who were pulling strings, paying bribes and helping to murder people. The situation there is very complex, and is certainly not one that can be solved by echoing good-will messages. The negotiations will be difficult and complex.</p>

 On the matter of the detained Israeli soldiers and Lebanon&#146;s request for the return of some of its prisoners, I think that the UN was supposed to be leading negotiations to try to obtain a package of agreement.

Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to be involved. There are ways: he has recently been involved in opening back channels in the terrible conflict in Sri Lanka. There are things that can be done. I am certain&#151;I am sure that the right hon. Lady will agree with me&#151;that it is a full-time job. People cannot be taken away to Geneva and New York every six months in the hope that something can be resolved. The negotiations must be very purposeful, using people with great skills, who know how to go about such things. I hope that the efforts that have been made will be built on, because, as the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) pointed out, the issue is a key one. It is certainly one of the most important of the confidence-building matters that we should be dealing with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para0"><a name="07022751000121">In retrospect, for the 15 members of the UN Security Council to agree on a resolution on the middle east and to establish troop commitments to police it within 31 days was a real achievement. The fact that it happened so quickly should give everyone who is interested in promoting peace and reconciliation in the area cause for some optimism. The UK continues to believe that Security Council resolution 1701 is the best way to resolve Lebanon&#146;s problems. The Government of Lebanon have some important tasks under that resolution. We continue to work with the elected Government and international partners in implementing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para1"><a name="07022751000122">Right hon. and hon. Members have asked what progress has been made since last summer&#146;s conflict. The deployment of 11,000 UN troops is itself an achievement. I remember, as I am sure do colleagues, the view expressed in debates in August and September that nothing would ever happen, because the situation was too difficult for troops to move into. It has been a successful deployment. Those troops have been deployed alongside 8,500 troops from the Lebanese armed forces. We should remember that this is the first time for many years that the Lebanese army has been deployed down to the Israeli border. That is an important fact. Supported by UN peacekeepers, the forces are now delivering security in the south.</p>

Lady did not have time to tell us more, although I should have liked to hear more from her, about the question raised by my hon.

Are they being affected by the curse of corruption in those areas?</p>

 The critical factor is whether people continue to have trust, and to believe that the words and figures used by the international community will be realised on the ground. When I was there, which was some months ago, there was concern. I wanted to find out whether people had completely lost such trust, because if that happens it sets us all back.</p>

 I hope to be able to report directly on that to my hon. Friend and to the House after my visit to the Lebanon, but he is right that it is a key issue. I do not think that there is really a shortage of funding. The Paris III conference pledged $7.6 billion in grants, which is an enormous amount. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood remembers from her days at the Department for International Development that often the great problem is whether there is the capacity to spend the money wisely and to ensure that it reaches those who most need it. That is something on which we need to do a lot of work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para3"><a name="07022751000126">In the few moments left to me, I want to mention that we are providing a significant package of economic assistance to Lebanon, which we set out at the Paris III conference. Some of the numbers have already been mentioned: we shall contribute &#163;58 million to Lebanon in the coming years, in addition to the &#163;23 million that the UK gave last year in humanitarian assistance. That included food, water and shelter, and &#163;2.8 million of the money was committed to clearing unexploded ordnance&#151;</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on what is an important and timely subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para4"><a name="07022751000129">When one talks to most people about their views on Iran outside the current nuclear context, one will hear about an ancient nation with proud traditions, an impressive history of innovation and commerce and a land of scientists and superior artisans in almost every discipline. One will also hear about the great intellectual capacity of the Iranian people and their desire for learning and knowledge. One needs only to look at the Iranian diaspora in the United Kingdom to see how Iranian people benefit communities throughout our country, let alone the rest of the world. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para5"><a name="07022751000130">Here in the capital, the national health service benefits every day from the expertise of Iranian doctors and consultants, and UK universities enjoy the learning and knowledge of esteemed Iranian academics. The contribution of the Iranian people not only to their own well-being, but to that of other nations, whatever their ethnic and religious background, is a contribution of which the Iranian people can be rightly proud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para6"><a name="07022751000131">That is why the nuclear stand-off between the Iranian regime of President Ahmadinejad and the international community is a potential tragedy not only for all those people who might have to suffer the consequences of miscalculation, sliding to war or to precipitous action, but for the Iranian people themselves. The international community&#146;s quarrel is not with the people of Iran&#151;the university student wanting to better themselves, the Iraq-Iran war veteran selling his merchandise in the marketplaces of downtown Tehran or even the imam calling his worshippers to Friday prayers&#151;but with the intransigent and inflexible views of President Ahmadinejad. By seeking to pursue Iran&#146;s reprocessing uranium enrichment programme, he puts Iran on a collision course not only with countries such as the United States, but with allies of Iran such as Russia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para7"><a name="07022751000132">President Ahmadinejad&#146;s apocalyptic rhetoric may excite certain elements of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, but it does not do anything to address the serious economic plight in which many ordinary Iranians find themselves. The President was elected on a popular mandate of wanting to represent ordinary Iranians and to address their economic woes and struggles. Therefore, if he is serious about his commitment, he should spend more time getting Iran&#146;s 3 million unemployed back into work, securing the border with Afghanistan and closing down the opiate trail, setting up drug rehabilitation and education centres for Iran&#146;s 1.5 million drug addicts, treating the tens of thousands of Iranians with HIV and AIDS, building new schools, roads and hospitals and preparing Iran&#146;s cities for future geological earthquakes, not military earthquakes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para8"><a name="07022751000133">Iranians are right to ask why, when their economy is in such a state, President Ahmadinejad is spending billions of dollars on developing long-range ballistic missiles or on sending rockets to space. The people of Iran do not need me to tell them that there is no bread  <br>

on the moon. It is also legitimate for senior army officers to question why ballistic missile programmes grow at the expense of Iran&#146;s ageing and decaying conventional forces, and why the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has a seamless flow of funds, but the army is squeezed out of updating even basic military equipment. Iranian admirals are also right to protest at the President&#146;s private IRGC navy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para9"><a name="07022751000134">It is also right that Iranian MPs should be concerned about recent municipal elections&#151;those MPs who got into power on the back of the President&#146;s claims about wanting to help those who suffer economically. Those Members of Parliament who follow him are right to be concerned about the recent elections.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very powerful case. Will he also acknowledge, however, that in the elections that returned President Ahmadinejad, and in the assembly elections at the same time, the Guardian Council disqualified some 200 candidates from standing&#151;candidates who had been members of the Majlis and tended to be reformist and out of sync with the regime?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. He always does, and he is absolutely right to put that point on the record. However, encouragingly, it emerged from the results that the more moderate candidates who support the former President, President Rafsanjani, also gained seats. My hon. Friend is right none the less: the selection of candidates must be more open and democratic to ensure that there is a real mix of Members of Parliament who represent all views. Further, with parliamentary elections upcoming in 2008, it is right that there should be an internal inquiry about President Ahmadinejad&#146;s rhetoric.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para10"><a name="07022751000137">It is right that Iran&#146;s national bazaar, its business people and business sector, should be worried about the growing and extending influence of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps over the country&#146;s economic affairs. Should&#151;I emphasise &#147;should&#148;&#151;Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania move towards an economic bloc, I think that the Iranian people would be embarrassed. When countries in east Africa move towards trading blocs, concentrating more on the economy than on war, and when Latin American countries do the same, there is no reason why there should not be a future in which economic blocs in the middle east bring similar prosperity and hope to the people of Iran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para11"><a name="07022751000138">It is also puzzling&#151;no doubt more so for the people of Iran&#151;that although crude oil prices have been at a long-term high, the oil boom that should have happened on the back of it in Iran has not. However, there is no reason why a change of course cannot put right an economic missed opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para12"><a name="07022751000139">It is also right that Iran&#146;s learned and esteemed Islamic scholars and clerics should ask why President Ahmadinejad claims to speak to the hidden imam. Even the father of the Iranian revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini, did not lay claim to such divine encounters. In fact, claims of exclusive revelation are also an  <br>

affront to the current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and undermine the very teachings of the Assembly of Experts. Perhaps that is why President Ahmadinejad seeks to place his own clerics on the Assembly of Experts and on the Council of Guardians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para13"><a name="07022751000140">There is a great paradox in the Iranian question: perhaps the greatest threat to Islam and to Iran&#146;s continuation as an Islamic regime is not from external forces, but from internal forces that claim a superior and unique interpretation of Islam. It was Ayatollah Khomeini himself who rightly observed that without the existence of an Islamic state, the existence of Islamic law could be lost.</p>

<p><a name="st_27"><a name="07022751000141"><a name="70227h0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="07022751000472"><b>Mrs. Louise Ellman (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/Co-op):</b>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para14"><a name="07022751000142">Putting that statement together with the President&#146;s statement that he wishes to wipe Israel off the map, and with 50 other such statements from Iran&#146;s leaders in the past year, does the hon. Gentleman think that it could be seen as incitement to genocide?</p>

<p><a name="st_28"><a name="07022751000143"><a name="70227h0004.htm_spnew7"><a name="07022751000473"><b>Mark Pritchard:</b>
 I am grateful for that intervention. However, the hon. Lady will agree that there are levels of rationality. Although the comments that she cites are to be condemned, they have not been as frequent as the comments from President Ahmadinejad. The clerics of Qum should therefore not allow the existence of Iran to be gambled away by a president who fails to understand that the hidden imam should not and cannot be rushed. The pure teachings of Shi&#146;a clerics rightly claim that the hidden imam should not be forced by the hand of a mere mortal. Indeed Iran&#146;s clerics will know, and President Ahmadinejad should know, that Ayatollah Khomeini taught that trying to precipitate the revelation of the hidden imam was sacrilegious. The timing of God&#146;s revelation is in the hands of God himself, not in the hands of an Iranian president. The former supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, was right to outlaw the Hojjatiyeh movement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para15"><a name="07022751000144">Perhaps President Ahmadinejad has embarked on a carefully orchestrated new revolution intended to outdo the old, pure revolution of Ayatollah Khomeini. If so, it is about time for the clerics of Qum and the supreme leader, who has a mandate for life rather than a maximum of two electoral terms, to intervene and ensure that President Ahmadinejad is reined in quickly and that the Islamic faith is protected for future generations in Iran.</p>

 On that point, does the hon.

I agree with what he said about the quality of the Iranian state and its contributions to world life in the past, but does he agree that it should now take seriously its responsibilities to the Baha&#146;is and others?</p>

 I know that the hon. Gentleman has a history of speaking out on behalf of not only the Baha&#146;i faith but minorities in general, and I am grateful for his intervention. He is absolutely right that the Baha&#146;i faith, along with those of Christian denominations and other religious and ethnic groups, should expect protection under the Government of President Ahmadinejad. At present they are not protected, and the president needs to consider that carefully. Later I shall point to a historical example, of which the president might wish to take note and which will address that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para16"><a name="07022751000147">It is not inconceivable for Iran&#146;s nuclear programme to move from the hands of President Ahmadinejad to those of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the comparatively rational figurehead of the supreme leader is an avenue that should be explored within Iran. It is important to note that the international community, including the United States, does not object to Iran having a nuclear programme, but it needs to be a civil nuclear programme. The US and its allies have even offered Iran assistance in developing civil nuclear technology, but Iran has signally refused to entertain that possibility. The Security Council and Germany have been patient. There have been two key United Nations resolutions on the matter, resolution 1696 in August 2006 and, more recently, resolution 1737, but still Iran has failed to comply. Both the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency are right to show frustration with President Ahmadinejad when he refers to UN resolutions as a &#147;piece of torn paper&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para17"><a name="07022751000148">On sanctions, the international community cannot wait for ever for Iran to comply, and I am glad to hear that the talks in London yesterday went well. I am also glad to hear that the Russians are being extremely helpful in trying to convince Iran to change its ways. Perhaps the loudest message that the international community could send at this time would be to mount a blockade of Iran. I refer not to a physical blockade but to a financial one. Colleagues will know that 40 per cent. of Iran&#146;s refined oil is imported. Turning off refining co-operation would be a speedy way to focus Iranian minds on the ill-judged path that President Ahmadinejad is taking. Yes, there would be short-term costs to major international companies and the countries that refine Iran&#146;s oil, but they would be inconsequential compared with the cost of a major military confrontation. A blockade might have the reward of President Ahmadinejad changing his foreign policy. Iran cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.</p>

It is nevertheless a signatory to it, unlike Israel, which has 200 nuclear missile warheads and is not a signatory to any international treaty on the control of nuclear weapons.</p>

 As an old boy of Newport&#146;s grammar school, in my constituency, I would expect the hon. Gentleman to be slightly better informed on the point. The United Kingdom has not threatened to wipe Israel or any other country off the face of the map. I do not agree with his view that Britain is acting ultra vires or outside any legal framework in wanting to replace the current Trident nuclear deterrent. However, Iran is acting outside international law, and I have referred to two UN resolutions in that regard. Diplomacy can work, and I hope that there will be movement as a result of the discussions that were held in London yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para18"><a name="07022751000151">Iran cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons because that would be the perfect platform for oil price volatility, which would undermine every person in every street in every constituency represented here today. Why? Because whenever Iran wanted to increase its oil revenues, it could brandish its nuclear weapon. That threat could be made outside any military context and would be the all-encompassing economic guarantor of Iran&#146;s prosperity. It could cause global economic insecurity. A nuclear Iran would therefore be as much an economic threat as a military one, creating a new type of asymmetric confrontation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para19"><a name="07022751000152">As I said, it is not too late for diplomacy to work, and I hope that President Ahmadinejad or the supreme leader himself will enter into new direct talks with the IAEA and the United Nations without preconditions on either side, including the United States. That might bring a breakthrough. Where there is a political will, a political solution can be found. That has happened with North Korea and there is no reason why the current impasse cannot be overcome. It would not be a climbdown by the president or the Iranian people, but merely a recognition that sometimes history&#146;s great leaders have been unifiers, not dividers, and peacemakers as well as warriors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="70227h0004.htm_para20"><a name="07022751000153">I am a minor student of biblical history from my theological days, and I recall that Cyrus the Great, the charismatic Persian leader and founder of the Persian empire, although he conquered armies and foreign lands, is perhaps best known for his unparalleled statesmanship. Like the two-headed Homa griffin, he was as familiar with making peace as with making war. His peacemaking was seen not as a weakness but as an inherent strength&#151;a strength that allowed him to rule for many years, pursuing a policy of generosity that promoted religious freedom, not repression. He showed tolerance and accepted ethnic diversity. With 40 per cent. of the Iranian people being non-Persian, that would be a good lesson, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) pointed out, for President Ahmadinejad to take on board.</p>

In fact, it was King Cyrus who paid for their return, the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple. Perhaps claims of divinity&#151;there have been a lot of those recently&#151;or partial divinity are more believable when they are attributed by others rather than self-imputed.</p>

if Cyrus were to read the official daily newspaper of Tehran, <i>Kayhan</i>, and see its denunciations of the Baha&#146;is and others, he would feel that this was not the sort of Iran he had tried to create?

Eventually that gave way to the Islamic revolution of 1979. He should be very cautious about direct interference in Iranian affairs, which he appeared to call for throughout his speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para3"><a name="07022751000174">I am not here to defend the human rights record of Iran since 1979, or during the Shah&#146;s period. There are many things going on in Iran that are truly appalling, such as the treatment of religious minorities and trade unionists, and many other issues. All those points should be addressed in a spirit of solidarity with the people who are suffering such human rights abuses. The hon. Gentleman did not acknowledge, however, that there is a widespread unity of opinion among the Iranian exiled community around the world, which is large and diverse. In my constituency, there are Iranian asylum seekers who have sought asylum from every Iranian regime since the late 1950s. Nevertheless, they are, generally speaking, united in their condemnation of the overt and covert threats being made to Iran by the United States and the west, which encourage the belief that somehow or other the west can go to war in Iran and all the problems will be sorted out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para4"><a name="07022751000175">There is no realisation of the two effects that those threats have in Iran. First, they allow Ahmadinejad and his friends to ramp up their power and their wish for strong armament for Iran, and secondly, they frighten the Iranian people very much. Surely it is time to recognise that there is a need for dialogue and peace and a need to cut down the threats against Iran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para5"><a name="07022751000176">The question of Iranian nuclear armament and nuclear power is the kernel of the argument. I shall put my cards on the table: I am not a supporter of nuclear power in any form. It is a dangerous, polluting form of energy generation, but I recognise that it is not illegal under international law for any state to develop its own  <br>

nuclear power. There is no question about it&#151;it is a legal thing to do. If Iran wishes to develop nuclear power, it can do so in much the same way as any other country. I wish that it were not doing that, but it has a right to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para6"><a name="07022751000177">There have been allegations that Iran is also developing nuclear weapons. The evidence has been added up to suggest that it is trying to import centrifuges and enrich uranium, automatically leading to the development of plutonium and then to the development of nuclear weapons. The non-proliferation treaty, to which Iran is a signatory, requires all member states to allow inspections to take place. For the most part, those are pre-notified inspections and, under the voluntary protocol, unnotified inspections. Iran has not resigned from the NPT; it has withdrawn from the additional voluntary protocol, and we need to keep a sense of proportion about that. In its obsession with attacking Iran, the United States forced a vote for the first time ever at the UN International Atomic Energy Authority to bring about a resolution that went to the Security Council, which led to sanctions against Iran. I see that as a build-up, in exactly the same way as we were told an awful lot of nonsense about Iraq&#146;s weapons of mass destruction, to create sufficient hype for an attack against Iran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para7"><a name="07022751000178">Let us think through the consequences of an attack on Iran. If there is a war or if bombing takes place against Iran by the United States, Israel or anybody else, two things will happen. First, if nuclear establishments are bombed, be they for civil nuclear power or anything else, the danger of fallout will be enormous. Europe has still not got over the fallout of Chernobyl in 1985. Secondly, with Iran active on all fronts, the danger that a war will spread across the whole region into Afghanistan and Iraq will be enormous. I caution hon. Members to be a little more careful in their use of language and think through the consequences of the demands that they are making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para8"><a name="07022751000179">We have been through the disasters of the war in Iraq, and we are still going through them. The war continues in Afghanistan&#151;indeed, following yesterday&#146;s statements, Britain&#146;s involvement is likely to be much greater. Surely we need to promote peace and dialogue in the region. As if 500,000 and more Iraqi dead were not enough, goodness knows how many would die if we started a war with Iran. Perhaps we should be promoting a nuclear-free middle east, including Israel, which would involve nuclear disarmament and everybody signing up to the NPT. Going to war in Iran would be catastrophic for the entire region and for us as well. I urge caution and a real process of engagement with Iran in order both to prevent a war from taking place and to do something to support those people who quite reasonably demand human rights and justice in their society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para9"><a name="07022751000181">I was a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation that went to Iran last June&#151;the first such  <br>

delegation for 30 years&#151;which was a real eye-opener. Like all hon. Members present, I am concerned by the escalation towards some form of direct action in Iran, be it by America or other western nations, or a proxy action by Israel. I am also concerned about the recent actions of President Ahmadinejad, such as the provocative rocket launches, his reckless comments about wiping Israel off the map and the holding of the holocaust conference, which brought together a bizarre ragbag, including the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, Jews United Against Zionism and various other oddballs. I am also concerned by the clampdown on students and trade unionists in recent demonstrations, in which, as my hon. Friend said, the cry was, &#147;The people want bread, not the bomb!&#148;, and by the persecution of the Baha&#146;i and other religious minorities. Ahmadinejad has claimed to be against terrorism, yet the street by the British embassy was recently renamed Bobby Sands street. The regime has a poor record on human rights, with the execution of minors, although we found no evidence for the stoning of women for some time when we were there, which is another claim that has been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para10"><a name="07022751000182">The country is also becoming militarised, with an army of 350,000 troops and an air force that is an ideological force, bound to the Islamic revolution and the President himself. I understand why Iran may feel threatened. On one side it has Iraq, and on another side it has Pakistan and Afghanistan, which are all supported by western countries. To the north is Turkey, a member of NATO, and former Soviet states that are increasingly pro-west. One can therefore appreciate the feeling of isolation. However, I should like to make some observations about what we saw there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para11"><a name="07022751000183">Wherever we went, the people in Iran were at pains to point out that they were not the Iranian Government, which is a point that my hon. Friend made. Iran is a young country&#151;26 per cent. of the population are under the age of 15, and are forward looking. They do not look back to the conservatism of the regime that came in back in 1979. They are westernised and highly educated, and 62 per cent. of the student population are women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para12"><a name="07022751000184">Let us remember that Ahmadinejad was in many respects created by the ayatollahs, and has become something of a Frankenstein&#146;s monster. He is a very clever politician and a charismatic figure, but has presided over and contributed towards a bust economy. At a time of record oil prices, we expected to see major capital projects all over the place, but there were none. At a time when oil prices are so high, unemployment is probably well over 20 per cent., realistically speaking. Inflation is well into double figures. Iran is having to import $5 billion worth of refined petrol, and oil production is a third of what it was under the Shah. The Iranian economy is bust, yet as the Chatham House newsletter has pointed out, Ahmadinejad&#146;s budget for last year</p>
<a name="70227h0005.htm_brev1"><a name="07022751000400"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;almost doubled spending on the Coordination Council for the Propagation of Islam, increased that of the Revolutionary Guards by 142 per cent. and raised funding for the Ministry of Welfare by a mere 3.8 per cent. Election campaign promises of large-scale income-redistribution and ending corruption did not materialise. Rather Ahmadinejad gave the Revolutionary Guards an even bigger stake in the economy, awarding them lucrative oil and gas projects.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para13"><a name="07022751000185">The economy is therefore not being helped for the people who need it most of all. There is also a big drug problem, as we have heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para14"><a name="07022751000186">One also needs to understand&#151;as I did not understand before I went there&#151;the cult of the martyr in that country. The Iran-Iraq war, which went on for eight years, still weighs heavily on the consciousness of the people of Iran. Hundreds of thousands were killed or injured, and some still suffer from the effects of poison gas. They harbour some resentment against the west, which provided the Iraqis with the components for the weapons that gave rise to those poisonings. We must remember that the cult of the martyr weighs heavily on the Iranians, but we must not play into the hands of Ahmadinejad. What he needs more than anything is a common enemy. Iran was united against Saddam, but he is no longer the common enemy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para15"><a name="07022751000187">Let us not allow the United States, the United Kingdom or the west to become the common enemy, which could unite the Iranian people behind Ahmadinejad. If military action were taken, it could be counter-productive. Wherever we went in Iran, people asked us why it was that the UK Government seemed to be acting as a poodle of the United States in foreign policy, when this country has a great culture, and a heritage and history of involvement in the middle east, which we could bring to bear in an independent and more benign way than we have up to now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para16"><a name="07022751000188">In conclusion, why do we appear to be rushing headlong into action within Iran? Diplomacy has much further to go. The Iranian economy is bust, and we need to take advantage of that. Sanctions are likely to reinforce the Iranian Government&#146;s isolation from the electorate and build up pressure on Iranian diplomats. There must be a lot more mileage that we can get there. Just 18 months after the election of Ahmadinejad, his party won less than 20 per cent. in recent municipal elections, while the reformists, under Rafsanjani and others, took 70 per cent. of the votes nationwide. Good things are happening. Diplomacy still has a lot further to run. We need to understand what makes the Iranian people tick. We need to side with them and to isolate President Ahmadinejad. Rushing headlong into a bellicose threat of action is not necessarily the right way to achieve that.</p>

 I thank the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) for securing this debate and for allowing some of us to piggyback on to his initiative. Having said that, I disagree with a number of things that he said, which I shall address in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para17"><a name="07022751000190">I reiterate the view that was expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), who reflected the common denominator among Iranian resistance groups in exile. Whatever their differences, they do not want the contemplation of any invasion or military strike against Iran, as is being canvassed by the United States. Those exiles are proud patriots and they love their country. Not only do they not want it invaded or attacked militarily, but they share the view of the majority of hon. Members that  <br>

such a course of action would be counter-productive and exacerbate a worrying situation in an enormously dangerous region, in a fragile world. If nothing else, we should acknowledge that the people in exile, who are suffering the denial of both access to their country and democracy in that land, do not want a military strike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para18"><a name="07022751000191">The situation is grave. The backdrop of this morning&#146;s discussion is the export of terrorism from Tehran&#151;that is generally acknowledged to be a fact; indeed, it is boasted of&#151;and the growing encouragement of suicide brigades to create destruction, mayhem and death in various parts of the region. Iran has snubbed the views of the international community, particularly UNICEF, on how it handles juveniles. Furthermore, human rights abuses continue, whether in respect of a person&#146;s sexual orientation, their religious belief, as has been referred to, or, indeed, whether they are secular. Of course, anybody who wants to create a pluralistic society is clearly unacceptable to the regime. All that comes in addition to its determination to enrich uranium&#151;for military purposes, I believe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para19"><a name="07022751000192">The situation is very threatening. My concern is that the United Kingdom sends mixed messages to Tehran. I acknowledge that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), who went on the IPU delegation, has approached this issue in a very dilatory&#151;diligent, I mean&#151;manner. However, what was dilatory was our letting him go, because such visits send all the wrong signals. I invite him to consider this: we would not send an IPU delegation to Belarus. They are all pretty bad on the league table of rotters, but we would not send a delegation to Belarus, where, for example, there are no executions today, certainly not by the state. Sometimes, we genuflect to some pretty wretched regimes and we are not consistent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para20"><a name="07022751000193">The biggest problem of mixed messages comes from Her Majesty&#146;s Government. The Prime Minister talked robustly two or three months ago at the lord mayor&#146;s banquet. I could read what he said into the record, but time is short. Basically, he made it clear that, as the Prime Minister, he considers that Iran is exporting terror. On other occasions, he has inferred that ordnance and weaponry from Iran, with the regime&#146;s fingerprints on it, are being used against British forces around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para21"><a name="07022751000194">Those are the views of the Prime Minister&#151;pretty strong stuff. Yet I invite this Minister to consider that Ministers&#151;not only him, but others&#151;send different messages. They are much more appeasing. The Leader of the House is one, as is the Home Secretary. They were singing from a different song sheet. We will probably hear more of that this morning in the 15 minutes allocated to the Minister. If nothing else emerges from this debate, there should be a consistent approach by Government spokespersons when they are dealing with Iran, because their utterances are read in Tehran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para22"><a name="07022751000195">The hon. Member for The Wrekin referred to resistance around the world. He referred to the People&#146;s Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran, or PMOI, as a military wing. His view might be different from mine, but it is a matter of fact that the PMOI has not embarked on any military action since 2001. That is recognised by Her Majesty&#146;s Government. So the PMOI is no more a military or terrorist organisation  <br>

than Sinn Fein or the IRA, with whom sensibly&#151;albeit reluctantly&#151;we have had to have dialogue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para23"><a name="07022751000196">The PMOI cannot with any legitimacy be charged with being a military or terrorist organisation. It is simply not true, and the British Government acknowledge that. What is perverse is that the British Government, along with other EU countries, are still resisting taking the organisation off the terror list. They have done that cynically. It is in the public domain that the EU3, which includes the United Kingdom Government, said in November 2004, as an offer to the Tehran regime:</p>
<a name="70227h0005.htm_brev2"><a name="07022751000401"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If Iran complies, we would continue to regard the MEK&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para24"><a name="07022751000197">that is, the PMOI&#151;&#147;as a terrorist organisation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para25"><a name="07022751000198">That is cynical and dishonest and diminishes our case. I should have thought that those of us who are peace loving would want to encourage peaceful resistance as a proud weapon. We know that some of the most effective resisters around the world are people who have abandoned terrorism, often in the face of serious physical attack both at home and abroad. There ought to be rewards for the PMOI and similar groups if and when they abandon their armed action. That is why I ask the British Government to reflect again. When challenged, the hon. Member for The Wrekin overlooked that unfair, unjust and imprudent terror tag. There is an old-fashioned virtue called the rule of law. In that sense, courts are above Governments. They sit in judgment, and the court that has determined the issue says that it is unlawful and unfair for the PMOI to be on the terror list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="70227h0005.htm_para26"><a name="07022751000199">It is time that the British Government reflected. First, they should send much more consistent messages to Tehran, rather than variable ones from different Ministers&#151;the more junior they get, the more variable they are. Secondly, they should stand by the decision of an independent court that has found them to have made a wrong judgment. We should stress that we look to the British Government to do everything that they can to resist armed conflict in that land, but also to find the distinction between appeasement, which has been the pattern so far, and sensible, prudent and robust dialogue.</p>

We ought consistently to make it clear to Iran that the treaty allows it to have access to civilian nuclear energy, but on certain conditions, and that we are looking for behaviour change, not regime change.</p>

recently attended a meeting with a former Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Netanyahu, when he came to address Members of this Parliament. Basically, I believe that the Israelis are trying to soften us up for the possibility of unilateral action and a strike on nuclear facilities in Iran. I remember the tremendous outcry and outrage in the Muslim community when Osirak was destroyed by unilateral Israeli strikes in 1981, and I very much hope that the Minister will urge caution on our Israeli friends.

In fact, when President Bush was interviewed recently at a press conference, he made the obvious statement that, regrettably, financial contracts and business far outweigh political concerns among certain countries. I hope that the Minister will use his good offices and his influence with our Russian allies to explain that, if Russia wishes to be part of and a responsible member of the G8, and a responsible member of the UN Security Council, it must for the first time put aside its financial interests, as we and others are doing, and use its influence with the Iranian regime to ask it to back down.</p>

He was elected, but there were serious fraud allegations and discrepancies at the time of his election, and, as has been said, the Opposition party&#151;the reformists&#151;secured a massive victory in the recent local council elections. We stand in solidarity with those people, who realise the dangerous way in which their President is leading their country. We hope that the Opposition parties will continue to grow.</p>

I am particularly concerned about Iran&#146;s statements that it may block the strait in the event of difficulties that it may suffer because of UN Security Council decisions. The Minister will know that more than 40 per cent. of the oil flows through that narrow gap, and I hope that he will assure me that he and his colleagues in the Ministry of Defence are working with our NATO allies and doing everything possible to ensure that the vital strait of Hormuz is kept open.</p>

The NCRI leader, Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, is equally committed to what she calls the third option: no military intervention in Iran and no appeasement, but de-proscription of all those Iranians who have come together in exile to work against the present regime, which has proved so harmful to the Iranian people themselves and which is a threat to world peace.</p>

 The point has been well made that we have seen in Iraq the disastrous results of armed intervention and regime change. I believe that most of us would now agree, however we voted at that time, that if there is to be regime change in Iran, it must be brought about internally. If that is the case, is it not perverse that many of those who might seek to bring about such change are proscribed?</p>

The People&#146;s Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran ceased internal operations in Iran in 2001, although it was proscribed in 2000. The United Kingdom Government have recognised that it has never made any threat to the UK or the people of this country, or attacked any property in the UK.

 I thank the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) for securing this timely debate. It is particularly timely given the meeting yesterday of the United Nations Security Council members and Germany to discuss the possibility of further sanctions against Iran. The 60-day limit on Security Council resolution 1737 expired last week, and Iran has yet to comply with that resolution and resolution 1696 to stop all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, and all work on heavy water projects. In fact, it is expanding the scale of its enrichment programme. Indeed, the Iranian Government are still insisting that their activities are not aggressive and that they have the right to create a system of nuclear energy that does not rely on outside co-operation. As we are all aware, however, Iran&#146;s past record of concealment and lack of co-operation with the IAEA inspectors paints a worrying picture and supports the UN&#146;s decision to call for Iran to cease all enrichment activities and to accept full IAEA inspections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para14"><a name="07022751000224">The development of nuclear technology could, of course, lead to further nuclear proliferation. If other regional players, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey, feel that Iran is arming itself with nuclear weaponry, they might feel the need to respond in kind. Iran&#146;s action in refusing to co-operate with the IAEA inspectors and to allow them unrestricted access to this volatile region at this time is not only wrong but incredibly irresponsible. Further nuclear proliferation must be stopped, and we should all do what we can to discourage such a move.</p>

important that any actions the UK Government employ are backed by the UN, have international support and are built on international law. The UK and US Governments should not take any actions that are not supported by the UN, and they should follow its lead on sanctions. The UK and the US cannot afford further to damage their international reputations by acting without the support of the UN and the international community, as we did in the case of Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para16"><a name="07022751000228">In particular, there is no role for military sanctions against Iran. Military action would serve only to strengthen the position of hard-line conservative factions and would fan nationalism in Iran, undermining the prospects for change. It would further destabilise the region by provoking retaliation throughout the middle east, creating even more bad feeling towards America and the west and further increasing the east-west divide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para17"><a name="07022751000229">Military conflict would also place coalition forces at risk. UK armed forces cannot be stretched further considering the current action in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it would be irresponsible to enter into another conflict. The recent US arrests of Iranian officials in Iraq have raised speculation that military conflict could be triggered not only by non-compliance over the nuclear issue, but by what the US perceives to be Iran&#146;s destabilising activities in Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para18"><a name="07022751000230">Already, reports are emerging that the Pentagon has been given instructions to draw up plans for a bombing campaign for Iran that could be launched at 24 hours&#146; notice, while Condoleezza Rice has refused to rule out the use of force in resolving the issues that the US has with Iran. The UK Government must make it clear that military action is unthinkable and should apply the greatest possible pressure on Washington to avoid such an option at all costs. Continuing threats from the US and elsewhere on the prospects of military action are counter-productive. They serve only to reinforce the position of hard-liners in Iran, and they could lead to Iranian withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para19"><a name="07022751000231">We need to ensure that we continue to engage with Iran rather than isolating it. Iran has offered to open unconditional talks with the west, but the US has insisted that before such talks take place Iran must stop its enrichment programme. I cannot place too much emphasis on the point that Iran should be persuaded in the strongest possible language, through diplomacy and through economic and political sanctions, to stop its enrichment programme and to open its facilities to inspectors. At this point we need to re-engage with Iran rather than enter into further conflict with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para20"><a name="07022751000232">Iran&#146;s past relationship with Iraq gives it significant power there&#151;many of Iraq&#146;s Shi&#146;a politicians have long-standing ties to Iran from their time in exile during the Saddam Hussein era, and Iran has provided military and political support for Shi&#146;ite militias and for Shi&#146;a parties.

 I thank my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) for introducing the debate, and for his demonstration of a classical education. At one stage, I thought of a variation on the old Monty Python joke: if only I had had the Persian, I too could have been a Tory Back-Bench MP. He has shown a knowledge of history, and he rightly emphasised the fact that the Iranian people are a proud and sophisticated people with a long history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para21"><a name="07022751000234">All Members from all parties have addressed the core element of the debate: how we can involve Iran in the international community, recognise its right to develop nuclear energy if it wishes and make it comply with the resolutions of the United Nations, and not only those of the United States of America, Israel and the United Kingdom, that it should not develop nuclear weapons. That is not easy. For some time now, I have taken the view that the bulk of the Iranian people in Iran, and maybe even the bulk of Iranian exiles, believe that Iran has a right to develop nuclear weapons. It is not only the regime that believes that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para22"><a name="07022751000235">We also need to think about what will happen if the Iranian regime manages, by dividing the members of the UN Security Council and by prevarication, to reach a stage at which one or more powers&#151;hon. Members have fearfully pointed this out&#151;decide that the UN&#146;s route has failed and that they will take unilateral military action, as they are entitled to do if they believe that their security is threatened. Do we have a plan B to deal with such a situation? Do we have a plan to deal with circumstances in which that had not occurred but Iran had merely obtained nuclear weapons? If that were to occur, we would have to consider a number of factors, not least the fact that if the Israeli Government decide not to use the military option, they will certainly, if they have not done so already, develop a second strike capability. We know already that many other regional powers have intimated that if Iran obtains nuclear weapons they too will go down that path, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and others. That will cause a vast escalation of the problem, and I do not think that the Iranian Government has thought that through. There are no particularly easy answers to the question. However, although I, too, do not wish to emphasise the bellicose military threat against the Iranian regime, neither should we say that it is an impossibility.</p>

can ultimately authorise military force. We should bear that in mind when it comes to the signals that we wish to send to the United Nations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para24"><a name="07022751000237">There is no doubt that over the past two or three years the Iranian Government have defied the UN. I am not saying that they have defied the United States of America, Israel or the United Kingdom, but they have defied the UN in such a way that countries such as Russia and China, which tended to be sympathetic to Iran&#146;s position, have been driven in anger and fury into supporting the sort of proposals put forward by other members of the UN.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para25"><a name="07022751000238">We should take a robust line through the United Nations, one that does not rule out the possibility that the Iranian Government would have to face a military option under the UN. It should be done in such a way that it persuades the Iranian Government that they are defying world opinion, as many hon. Members have said. Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) said, we should think of changing the behaviour rather than the regime. UN sanctions should be aimed at bringing pressure to bear upon the regime rather than on the bulk of the Iranian people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="70227h0006.htm_para26"><a name="07022751000239">One specific area that I wish to emphasise to the Minister is that disinvestment will have an almost an immediate effect on the Iranian regime. The USA has started disinvestment in a limited way, as have we. For example, I understand that the governor of California has put pressure on international banks by threatening to withdraw Californian investments from those involved with financial support of the Iranian regime. California&#146;s withdrawing its investments is an attention grabber. I believe that, in the short term, that is the best way to grab the attention of the Iranian regime. My question to the Minister is: what specific measures are the Government taking, and what pressure are we bringing to bear on members states of the European Union? There is no doubt that certain EU countries with investments in Iran are not taking such action. If they want to prevent us from going down the more military line, they should take that very much to heart.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that question. We have raised it with the Pakistani Government on many occasions, because what the hon. Gentleman describes as luxurious house arrest is not an appropriate punishment for what the AQ Khan network did. In relation to Iran, the matter is extremely serious, and I shall add to that.</p>

<p>I have taken part in two debates this morning, Mr. Martlew&#151;this and the previous debate on Lebanon and Syria&#151;in which I have heard Rafsanjani described as a moderate. I saw him give an interview in the run-up to the last presidential election with Gavin Essler on a BBC World interview. He declared: &#147;Yes, of course we have hidden aspects of our nuclear policy. We would not have been able to develop it otherwise.&#148; Rafsanjani was in charge of that Administration. We should be careful about dividing Iran into reformers, moderates and extremists. We have all got form, and Rafsanjani has got some too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para3"><a name="07022751000252">The International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors and the UN Security Council have set out the essential steps that Iran needs to take to build confidence, which include the full suspension of enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. The measures required by the Security Council would not affect Iran&#146;s pursuit of nuclear energy. Iran does not need to enrich uranium to generate electricity. However, the suspension would<i></i>help to provide confidence that Iran is not seeking the know-how to make fissile material for weapons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para4"><a name="07022751000253">I sometimes hear the argument that&#151;I have not heard it this morning, although I was waiting and prepared to hear it, but I have heard it from Dr. el-Baradei among others&#151;the IAEA board and the Security Council are wrong to insist on a suspension because Iran has either mastered enrichment or cannot be stopped. That is entirely misguided. Iran has enriched relatively small quantities of uranium, but it has not learned how to operate the process properly. Iranian scientists are yet to solve a range of technical problems and therefore although suspension remains crucial and pressing, there is still time for diplomacy to work. We remain committed to finding a negotiated solution and our approach has been to make it clear to Iran how it might benefit from meeting its obligations. At the same time, we have made it clear that it will face the risk of greater international isolation if it fails to take the steps required by the Security Council.</p>

Those proposals are far-reaching and offer a way forward that would provide confidence that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. The proposals would also give Iran everything that it needs to develop a modern civil nuclear power industry, plus other political and economic benefits. Despite that, Iran has failed seriously to engage in discussions. The proposals are still on the table and, even at this stage, I hope that Iran will acknowledge the benefits of them and take the steps required by the Security Council so that talks can begin. The current sanctions will be frozen if Iran complies with the proposals and would be lifted in the event of a long-term solution. I welcome the efforts by Javier Solana in the past few weeks to urge the Iranians  <br>

to take a positive path. I hope that everybody understands the significance of that and that real attempts have been made to engage with the Iranian Government. If the Iranians do not address international concerns, the Security Council will have no choice but to impose further measures.</p>

Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) talk about the effectiveness of financial sanctions, which are incredibly important. We know that such sanctions worry the Iranians most. An indication of that is the 400,000 Iranians who live in Dubai, where they think that they can do their business. They are living there in preparation for what they consider the inevitable imposition of sanctions as a consequence of the intransigence of the Ahmadinejad regime. Iran is not North Korea. It has a great history, as the hon. Member for The Wrekin has described, and it has a large merchant class&#151;traders, scientists and engineers. The people of Iran want a prosperous country, but they know that that will not happen under the leadership of Ahmadinejad. The people of Iran understand that economic sanctions would be effective and therefore they are taking measures to ensure that, if necessary, they can carry on with their business outside Iran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para7"><a name="07022751000256">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) asked about the straits of Hormuz. I was recently in Oman, where people are very worried that the straits of Hormuz will be blocked. This time next year, about 20 per cent. of our gas will come by ship from Qatar, where there is the biggest gas field in the world. There is always a reluctance to talk about the politics of energy in discussing this type of politics, but if we attempt to turn on the lights in our homes and nothing happens, we will be very worried about the straits of Hormuz. It is extremely important that measures are taken to ensure that the straits are kept open&#151;all the Gulf states believe that that should be the case. We must redouble our diplomatic efforts in the Gulf to ensure that the other states in that area put pressure on the Iranians together with the E3 plus three and any other group of nations.</p>

As hon. Members know, however, the MEK is proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and its involvement in violence means that it has little support in Iran. The MEK claims to support human rights and democracy, but it is hard to square that with its authoritarian structure and claims by respected human rights non-governmental organisations of serious violations of the rights of its own members. I understand that an EU court has ruled that the EU&#146;s proscription of the MEK is illegal for  <br>

 No, I shall not give way. I understand that there is currently a legal challenge to the proscription, which the Home Office is dealing with. I certainly do not want to prejudice that case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para9"><a name="07022751000260">Another argument that I have heard from time to time is that sanctions will make Iran more rather than less determined to defy the international community. Security Council resolution 1737, which was adopted on 23 December, imposed a number of sanctions that focused on Iran&#146;s sensitive nuclear and missile activities. Those sanctions are a useful political toolkit to counter the activities of greatest concern, and they are also having a political effect. The Security Council&#146;s unanimous adoption of the measures has shown that President Ahmadinejad&#146;s claim that the international community is disunited and lacking in the will to act is a fantasy. Far from making the Iranian regime and people more united, the measures have, as we have heard from hon. Members, fuelled greater debate inside Iran about the costs of the course on which the regime has set the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) rightly raised the issues whether that was fair and whether Iran should be able to continue with fissile material production, because Israel also has a bomb. Why on earth would we want another nation to have a nuclear bomb in one of the world&#146;s most volatile regions?</p>

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="07022751000261"><a name="70227h0007.htm_spnew8"><a name="07022751000513"><b>Jeremy Corbyn:</b>

 No, I will not give way. I will try to answer the questions put to me by my hon. Friend in my own way. There is no question that Israel should come clean about its nuclear bombs and delivery systems. The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk and others have made the important point that Israel will start to develop a second strike capacity. I know from my discussions in the Gulf that the Egyptians, the Saudis and Turkey will want a bomb because they feel threatened by that regime, which is why there is no more important issue on the international horizon. We must do everything that we can diplomatically. An invasion or a bombing campaign is not on the horizon, and the Government have nothing to do with such suggestions. When I was in Washington before Christmas, I also heard nothing about such an approach. We must get real about the situation and try to understand that, if we are to persuade the Iranian people that this is not the proper course, we must take much of the advice given to us by the hon. Member for The Wrekin.</p>

 Death becomes us all. Everyone hopes that, having died, their remains will be cremated or buried with dignity. There is, however, a problem. In many parts of the country there is a shortage of burial space. I shall raise with the Minister concerns that relate to my own constituency, but I know from e-mails that I have received and approaches that have been made to me since the debate has been publicised, that her response will be read with interest in many parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para10"><a name="07022751000264">Bicester in Oxfordshire is one of the fastest growing towns in England. There has been substantial new housing in recent years, and substantial further new housing is anticipated in the immediate future. Bicester is a town of some 32,000 people and is growing rapidly. It has a cemetery and the responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of that cemetery appears to have fallen to Bicester town council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para11"><a name="07022751000265">In the local government hierarchy, Bicester town council has, in effect, the status of a parish council elsewhere. Parish and town councils have limited powers. They receive no grant from central Government; they have to raise all their own money. They are under various other statutory constraints. For example, it is not open to a town council to spend any money outside its boundaries without applying to the Secretary of State for specific approval.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para12"><a name="07022751000266">That brings me to my first two questions for the Minister. First, in a unitary local authority such as a London borough or a metropolitan district, there is no ambiguity about the fact that it is the unitary authority that is responsible as the burial authority, whereas in counties such as Oxfordshire there are three tiers of local government&#151;in this instance, Oxfordshire county council, Cherwell district council and Bicester town council&#151;and my understanding is that both the district council and the parish or town council are burial and cremation authorities under the Local Government Act 1972. Have I got that right? If so, it may be sensible in policy terms to separate responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of cemeteries&#151;a responsibility that can clearly be discharged by the town or parish council&#151;from the responsibility of having to make provision for new cemeteries. In terms of both statutory powers and the ability to raise the funds needed to negotiate and purchase the land required for those cemeteries, that would be a more appropriate responsibility to place on district councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para13"><a name="07022751000267">Bicester town council has remaining in its existing cemetery approximately 200 burial plots and I understand that there are about 60 burials a year, so it will not be long before the cemetery is full. The publication &#147;Local Council Administration&#148;, in its seventh edition, which I think is the most recent, calculates that at two burials per grave, 1 acre of land may be expected to last 70 years for 2,000 inhabitants. Given that Bicester has a population of 32,000 and growing, we are talking about the town council having to acquire a sizeable acreage of land for a new cemetery&#151;I would anticipate at least 10 acres, and for a local council that has to raise all its own money year on year, that is a quite substantial burden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para14"><a name="07022751000268">Secondly, can the Minister confirm that there is at present limited statutory responsibility on local authorities in terms of a duty to bury the dead? I think that I am correct in saying that under section 46 of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, there is a duty on burial authorities to bury or cremate the dead where it appears that no other suitable arrangements would be made. That relates to what I think are described as paupers&#146; funerals. The 1972 Act provides that burial authorities &#147;may&#148;, rather than &#147;shall&#148;, provide and maintain cemeteries. I think that that fact was confirmed in the Government&#146;s consultation paper &#147;Burial Law and Policy in the 21st Century: The Need for a Sensible and Sustainable Approach&#148;, published in January 2004. It states:</p>
<a name="70227h0007.htm_brev0"><a name="07022751000403"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Although it is the public law duty of the Church of England and, to a certain extent, of the Church in Wales, to provide for burials in open churchyards, there is at present no statutory requirement on any public authority or private undertaking to make available a place for burial. The opportunity for the public to bury those who have died in ground set aside for this purpose is therefore dependent on the exercise of the discretionary powers of parish (and equivalent) and district authorities to provide burial grounds...Provision of burial grounds is also dependent on the normal application of planning legislation. No dispensation in relation to burial grounds is provided&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para15"><a name="07022751000269">Perhaps the time has come to place on district authorities a statutory responsibility to provide burial grounds and to ensure that the costs or what in local government parlance are described as the &#147;new burdens&#148; of such a responsibility are fairly met through the financial support mechanisms for local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para16"><a name="07022751000270">Notwithstanding the financial difficulties, Bicester town council has done its best to find land for a new cemetery. I firmly believe that Councillor Debbie Pickford, the leader of Bicester town council, is to be commended for the very considerable energy and effort that she has devoted to this particularly sensitive subject. The difficulty is that although the town council approached a wide range of landowners in and on the outskirts of Bicester, none of them was willing to sell any land. That is perhaps understandable. Any people who own land on the edge of Bicester have hopes that in due course such land will be designated for housing and, in the absence of any compulsory purchase, they are unlikely voluntarily to sell such land now for the purposes of a cemetery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para17"><a name="07022751000271">Two developers have planning permissions to develop quite sizeable areas of new housing on what are known in shorthand as Gavray drive and the south-west option. The town council approached the developers of the housing on Gavray drive and the south-west option, asking if they would be able to give the town council some land for a new cemetery. Both declined. Again, that is not entirely surprising. Builders of sizeable housing developments such as those find that ever increasing section 106 burdens are placed on them&#151;for example, having to provide land for new primary and secondary schools, contributions to main roads and so on&#151;and they are understandably reluctant to give up further land on which they have planning permission to build houses. In short, the town council was not able to find any landowner in the immediate vicinity of the town who was willing to sell land for a cemetery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para18"><a name="07022751000272">The town council then looked to see whether any suitable site existed on land already in its ownership. Such land is very limited and, as I am sure the Minister will appreciate, for a growing town such as Bicester, any  <br>

<notus-date day="27" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>27 Feb 2007 : Column 235WH</b><br>
recreational or amenity land in the town centre is very much valued. One site was identified, but there was then a further complication. A rock stratum goes through the town, which would make conventional burial extremely difficult, so the town council considered the possibility of above-ground burial chambers and visited a cemetery in Bedford where some above-ground chambers are already in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para19"><a name="07022751000273">Perhaps not surprisingly, that suggestion met widespread opposition from local residents, which I think reflects the perfectly understandable cultural sensitivities about burial. Those are perhaps best summarised by an extract from the &#147;Local Council Administration&#148; handbook, to which I have referred. It states that</p>
<a name="70227h0007.htm_brev1"><a name="07022751000404"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the responsible body must maintain the churchyard in decent order, that is, it must not offend the susceptibilities of a reasonable Christian, bearing in mind that ground levels always rise.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para20"><a name="07022751000274">Indeed, at the last meeting of the planning committee of Cherwell district council&#151;the local district council&#151;it refused planning permission for such a cemetery on the grounds that it would result in the loss of an attractive, well used area of public space and would be inappropriate on a small, highly constrained site in a residential area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para21"><a name="07022751000275">By definition, most town councils are likely still to have in their ownership only small land sites in residential areas. This issue is not in any way unique to Bicester. I think that there is a collective sensibility about what we believe a burial ground or cemetery should look like. That said, I readily recognise that such sensitivities may vary widely from country to country, so what might seem usual and acceptable in, say, Spain or Italy would not find public support here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="70227h0007.htm_para22"><a name="07022751000276">In short, the town council has done everything in its ability to try to purchase new land for a cemetery and has considered the potential of its own limited existing land holdings, all without success. That causes me to ask the Minister what the Government&#146;s position is on three issues: the reuse of graves; the ability of a town or district council to acquire land for a cemetery by compulsory purchase; and the need to designate land for cemeteries in the planning process and the local development framework. I appreciate that the last two issues are not immediately within her brief, but her Department has clearly been given the lead responsibility regarding the law and policy on burial grounds. As I gave the Department notice of the issues that I intended to raise, I hope that she will give a full response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para0"><a name="07022751000277">On the reuse of graves, it is worth remembering that as long ago as January 2004, the Home Office published the consultation paper &#147;Burial Law and Policy in the 21st Century: The Need for a Sensible and Sustainable Approach&#148;, which I have already mentioned. The consultation on that document ended in August 2004&#151;almost three years ago&#151;but a summary of the responses was not published until almost two years later, in April 2006. For reasons that were never explained, responsibility for the matter was then moved from the Home Office to the Department for Constitutional Affairs. Almost another year later, there is still no new guidance on burial law or policy  <br>

from the Government. So far, the review has seen three Home Secretaries and two Departments, but no action. There is also a burial and cemeteries advisory group, which is made up of Departments and regional government bodies. The group is meant to offer advice and guidance, but it has not met since December 2004. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para1"><a name="07022751000278">It is unfair of the Government to expect town councils such as Bicester to grapple with sensitive issues such as cemetery provision, without any help, guidance or advice. Given the scarcity of land available for burials and given that some burial grounds have closed because they are full, it is not surprising that the possible reuse of graves or burial grounds has been under consideration for some time. In its 2001 report, the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs concluded:</p>
<a name="70227h0008.htm_brev0"><a name="07022751000405"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is the almost universal view of those in the burial industry that reuse is the only long-term solution not only to the lack of burial space, but also to the long-term financial viability of cemeteries. If the public are to continue to have access to affordable, accessible burial in cemeteries fit for the needs of the bereaved, there appears to be no alternative to grave reuse...For the reasons stated above, and assuming that the necessary safeguards are included, we are ourselves of the opinion that legislation should be introduced allowing burial to take place in reused graves.&#148;</p>

consultation, it must now be for them to get to grips with bringing forward proposals for burial law reform. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para9"><a name="07022751000286">I move to the issue of compulsory purchase. There is no compulsory purchase power for local authorities to buy land specifically for cemeteries. I believe that district councils can use the very general powers in the Local Government Act 1972, which gives principal councils&#151;I assume that that includes district councils&#151;the power to acquire land compulsorily</p>
<a name="70227h0008.htm_brev7"><a name="07022751000412"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;for any purpose for which they are authorised...to acquire land...whether situated inside or outside their area.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para10"><a name="07022751000287">Cemeteries are needed for the public good and it must be in the interests of the public good that local authorities are able to acquire land for cemeteries. The advantage of being able to acquire such land by way of compulsory purchase, if land owners are not willing to sell voluntarily by private treaty, is that the valuation office will set a fair market price. Compulsory purchase provides a mechanism of last resort by which local authorities could find land for cemetery use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para11"><a name="07022751000288">There appears to have been a further twist in the Bicester saga. The town council was led to understand that it might well succeed with compulsory purchase proceedings if it could identify only one site on the outskirts of Bicester that was suitable for a cemetery, but that it would be very difficult to take forward such proceedings if it identified more than one suitable site. I find that rather curious. The chief executive of Cherwell district council, Mary Harpley, advised me that</p>
<a name="70227h0008.htm_brev8"><a name="07022751000413"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;with regards to the possibility of using Compulsory Purchase powers, such powers are usually contested by the landowner. The Council would have to prove that no suitable alternative to the use of that particular land was possible. To do that, the Town Council will have to document all the approaches they have made to landowners around the town. In the Planning Officers&#146; experience, without such documentation the Compulsory Purchase Order is unlikely to be confirmed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para12"><a name="07022751000289">That is clearly a substantial administrative responsibility for any parish or town council to undertake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para13"><a name="07022751000290">Lastly, it follows that if there is no suitable land available within the town of Bicester, land will have to be found in neighbouring parishes. Surely, it must be right to ensure that district councils, as the local planning authorities, put provision for cemetery land into local plans and the local development framework proposals. There may well be landowners in neighbouring villages who have agricultural land that they are unlikely ever to get permission to use for anything other than agriculture. Such landowners might well be willing to sell that land for a cemetery, as it would probably be of greater market value than agricultural land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para14"><a name="07022751000291">These issues need to be considered sensitively with the parish councils of any neighbouring parish. They should seek to identify sites that are sympathetic and accessible, as far as possible, and which command the support of local residents. Identifying sites in that way is probably best done through a planning system and the local development plan, but there seems to be no impetus or obligation on district councils to do that. I fully appreciate that this is an extremely sensitive subject, but further procrastination is not going to make it any less sensitive. Town and parish councils are being put in an increasingly difficult position. I am sure that others will be grateful for the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

 I thank the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) for securing the debate on this subject. The issues that he has raised about the town of Bicester in his constituency will echo with you, Mr. Martlew, as the Member of Parliament for Carlisle. No doubt, many of the issues that he described will be more familiar to your constituents than to mine in an inner-city area. However, this is a problem across the board, and this is an important opportunity to discuss it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para15"><a name="07022751000293">I want to make it clear from the outset that we want to give as much help as we can to any individual authority that faces this problem, and I give the undertaking that my officials will work with the relevant local authority in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s area to discuss the issues that they face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para16"><a name="07022751000294">As the hon. Gentleman says, it is important for people to have within their community a place to bury their relatives. For hundreds of years, that place has been the churchyard around the parish church, but from the 19th century, the increasing population meant that small churchyards could no longer provide burial space on the scale required. New cemeteries needed to be provided&#151;first by private companies and then by local authorities. Many of those new burial grounds are now 100 years old or more, and many are becoming full. The cost of maintaining those grounds without income from burial fees has become so high that some have fallen into disrepair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para17"><a name="07022751000295">At first, it was thought that the answer would be cremation. Although it was unpopular when it was initiated at the end of the 19th century, demand grew slowly and steadily until the 1960s, when the number of cremations overtook the number of burials for the first time. Everyone thought that there would soon be no demand for burials and that the demand for cremations would increase exponentially, but that was not the case. The proportion of cremations reached about 70 per cent. some 15 years ago and seems to have remained steady at that level. It is difficult to predict certainties, but burial grounds are likely to remain important for society in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para18"><a name="07022751000296">That is the lesson that the Government took from the work of the then Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs when it reported on cemeteries in 2001. It identified long-term problems with the maintenance and provision of burial space, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and a need to review the law and to provide renewed direction and priority for local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para19"><a name="07022751000297">Since that report was published, the Government have undertaken a range of work to address the issues. We set up an advisory group of burial professionals and others, which meets regularly. We commissioned and published the findings of research on cemetery management. We issued a consultation paper, as the hon. Gentleman said, on a review of burial law, and published a summary of the responses. We published practical guidance for burial ground managers, and undertook a survey of burial grounds in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para20"><a name="07022751000298">Since I took over ministerial responsibility for these matters in May 2005, I have met the all-party parliamentary  <br>

group on funerals and bereavement, and I pay tribute to its work under the leadership of my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner). I have discussed with ministerial colleagues who are responsible for local government and health the health and safety aspects of the maintenance of burial grounds. I have consulted and attended meetings of the Local Government Association&#146;s safer communities board&#151;I pay tribute to the work of councillor Bryony Rudkin&#151;which has brought together local authorities with this concern, and I discussed the issues with them. I have met members of the burial and cemeteries advisory group and the Chairman of the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, and responded to many letters and questions from right hon. and hon. Members. I would not want any Members or anyone outside who is concerned about this matter to think that it was not being thought through and addressed. We must proceed, but carefully and sensitively, in consultation and in a pragmatic way. That is what we have sought to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para21"><a name="07022751000299">The hon. Gentleman is right that no person or organisation is under a statutory obligation to provide a burial ground. The law that he mentioned imposes a responsibility to ensure that the dead are disposed of, and that is what happens. The dead are disposed of, and there has been no situation in which we have felt that we need a statutory obligation to enable the dead to be buried.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para22"><a name="07022751000300">As the hon. Gentleman said, in shire counties, town and parish councils, as well as district authorities, all have the power to provide burial grounds. The Church of England has provided churchyards as a matter of practice for many hundreds of years, and a number of other religious organisations have provided burial facilities. Increasingly, private individuals and organisations have developed burial grounds on an entirely commercial basis, particularly in response to specific requirements, such as providing less formal or more natural or environmentally sensitive burial grounds. There is new private sector activity in addition to the involvement of local authorities and what the Church has traditionally done. There is a mixed economy that is dependent on demand and a sense of pastoral care, and that overall system seems to be the best way of moving forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para23"><a name="07022751000301">There is a problem of burial space not being available uniformly or conveniently for all local communities. A question raised in the public consultation paper, which the hon. Gentleman also raised, was whether there should be a new duty to provide burial space. That suggestion attracted support, and many respondents thought that district rather than town or parish councils were the right home for such a duty. I believe that the mixed economy in which we do not say that a specific authority has the duty, while others do not, is the best way forward. The Government remain unconvinced about imposing a statutory duty placing an obligation on one authority at the expense of others. We do not believe that that is the right way forward. We want different solutions in different areas, rather than to step in and say how things should be done uniformly in all areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para24"><a name="07022751000302">Planning for a range of local services is vital to local government functions. Respondents to our consultation said that inclusion of burial needs assessments in local  <br>

planning arrangements was a sensible and achievable goal. We are attracted to the case for better planning for adequate facilities, and it seems sensible to identify ways in which the different levels of local government, Churches and private concerns can work more effectively together to provide not only enough burial space, but a range of different sorts of burial grounds within the context of the different demands that local authorities must respond to when making their local plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para25"><a name="07022751000303">On land acquisition, I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was arguing for a short-circuiting of the compulsory purchase arrangements. Local authorities and other public authorities must go through a number of procedures before they are entitled to take over land because they are expropriating private property. It is absolutely right that they should not be able simply to point to a piece of land and say, &#147;We want that.&#148; If they want land, they need to go out to the market and they should not be able merely to say that they want to appropriate it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para26"><a name="07022751000304">New cemeteries are most likely to be needed in built-up areas, where land is liable to be in short supply and subject to competing demands. It would be difficult to argue that burial grounds should be afforded priority over other important land use requirements, such as housing, schools and hospitals. Balancing local priorities is the job of local planning authorities and it would be hard to justify a special status for burial ground applications in the planning system. Neither do we think that well founded local objections to planning applications for burial grounds should be given any less weight simply because a burial facility is at stake. We are encouraging local authorities to put that in their local plans, but we should not have a new compulsory purchase provision enabling them to say that because the land is for burial they must grab it, or that because the application is for burial space the normal consultations are unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para27"><a name="07022751000305">I appreciate that land that might otherwise be used for housing or commercial purposes will attract a premium, but that is inevitable. Introducing valuation controls for land sold for burial use, even if that seemed sensible on the surface, would be unfair for landowners if they received less compensation because their land was to be used for a burial ground rather than for other purposes. On the whole, respondents to the consultation paper took a pragmatic approach to these difficult issues and recognised that the costs of providing burial grounds might simply have to be borne by those who wanted them. Those costs would have to be reflected in burial fees and other charges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para28"><a name="07022751000306">We appreciate that the costs and administrative procedures involved in acquiring land for burial can be significant, especially for smaller authorities. In such circumstances it may be particularly helpful to discuss with the relevant district councils how best they can help parish councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para29"><a name="07022751000307">On the reuse of old burial grounds, we are moving forward innovatively. In the first instance, we are supporting London boroughs in the reuse, at their discretion, of burial grounds that are more than 75 years old. We must proceed with caution and sensitivity because people have deeply held feelings. We are taking the matter forward, but we are starting by looking at how it works in London. That may show that people are prepared to take what is often considered to be a drastic step.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to introduce this debate on carbon capture and storage. I apologise to the Minister in advance because I have a cold, and if I start coughing and spluttering during his response, that will have nothing to do with his answers on this hugely important subject. Indeed, I am sure that they will be so favourable that he will manage to dissipate my affliction and that I will be so enthused that my adrenaline will surge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para30"><a name="07022751000309">Once in every generation, an industrial opportunity comes about whose scale and potential are so mind-blowing that it must be grabbed and realised. When something of that magnitude comes along, it is also incumbent on those in authority, who pursue the public purpose, to recognise the scale and importance of such opportunities. They must ensure that the decisions that they make and, indeed, those that they do not make, which can cause delay, do not put such projects in jeopardy. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>] </i>Perhaps I should tell the Minister that his pen is just to his right and slightly underneath the desk, if that is any help&#151;I can see it from here. The Minister is now effecting pen capture and storage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para31"><a name="07022751000310">My proposition is that, given its scale and potential, carbon capture and storage, which will give us a foothold in the hydrogen-based economy, is just such a concept. The second part of that proposition is that it is absolutely necessary that the Government and public authorities ensure that nothing that they do or do not do prevents the early realisation of that potential. Let me give a couple of quotes to indicate the extent of what we are talking about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para32"><a name="07022751000311">The British Geological Survey&#151;the Minister will recognise this, because he helpfully pointed me towards it in a parliamentary answer a year or so back&#151;estimates that potential carbon dioxide storage capacity in the UK sector of the North sea is 755 gigatonnes, which is an immense amount, given that Scottish CO2 output is only 50 million tonnes annually and that worldwide CO2 output is 8 gigatonnes annually. In other words, according to the British Geological Survey, almost a century&#146;s worth of the CO2 produced in the world could, theoretically at least, be stored in the North sea alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para33"><a name="07022751000312">That one concept gives us an indication of the extent and importance of what we are discussing. If the technology works and can be mastered and pursued, it could probably make the single biggest immediate contribution to addressing what the Prime Minister and many international authorities describe as the biggest question facing the planet: the inconvenient truth about global warming and the industrial processes that have spilled so much carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. We are therefore looking at something that could make the single biggest contribution to addressing that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="70227h0008.htm_para34"><a name="07022751000313">Let me quote the United Kingdom Hydrogen Association,  as well as talk specifically about the hopes that we have for the Peterhead project in my constituency.

a hydrogen refinery. Another way of looking at the power station, therefore, is that it will be a refinery producing vast quantities of hydrogen. The association, which promotes the possibilities that the hydrogen economy could offer this country and others, says:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0009.htm"/>


<a name="70227h0009.htm_brev0"><a name="07022751000414"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The UK Government must support opportunities for UK organisations to participate in research projects, demonstrations, building global partnerships for deployment, which will lead to permanent scientific and industrial jobs, expertise, and business contracts that will have a positive impact on the UK economy, as well as regional economies. Conversely, failing to engage proactively may lead to UK organisations being left behind economically and environmentally.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para0"><a name="07022751000314">We therefore have the potential to store vast amounts of carbon dioxide safely in the North sea and elsewhere that would otherwise end up in the atmosphere. We would also have a foothold in the hydrogen economy, which could transform our transportation and industrial projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para1"><a name="07022751000315">I know that the Minister is familiar with the Peterhead project, but the concept is elegant as well as exciting. We will be able to take methane from St. Fergus, separate it into carbon dioxide and hydrogen through the pre-burn process and send the carbon dioxide back down the Miller pipeline into the North sea, where it will be re-injected into a largely depleted oilfield. That oilfield is to be abandoned in the next few months, but we will be able to increase its lifespan by up to 20 years and to take the equivalent of another 40 million barrels of recoverable oil out of it. We will then be able to burn the hydrogen in the power station in a virtually zero-carbon way, making 500 megawatts of continuous, rather than intermittent, power available to the grid. The project is staggering in its elegance and impact and will probably be the first feasible worldwide demonstration of such technology. It will therefore give us the most amazing opportunities to learn the lessons that will lead to the general application of that technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para2"><a name="07022751000316">In the jargon, the project, which is in Peterhead in my constituency in north-east Scotland, is referred to as DF1. DF2 is in California and starts from a coke process, but once the pre-burn is done, the process is essentially the same. This Christmas, the American Government, led by President George W. Bush&#151;perhaps not the world&#146;s number one environmental pin-up&#151;announced a $90 million tax allowance to promote the DF2 project, which is 20 months behind the Peterhead project. The Minister will also know that the Norwegian Government have announced their support packages for carbon capture technology. There is therefore a risk that any serious delay by the Government in coming up with the necessary proposals and deciding how to support this world-leading and potentially planet-saving technology will dissipate Peterhead&#146;s worldwide lead of almost two years.</p>

The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran) is present, and almost 100 people are working on the project in his constituency. Towards the end of next month, when the pre-engineering design stage is finished&#151;the scheme&#146;s sponsors, BP, General Electric and Scottish and Southern Energy, have already invested &#163;50 million in the pre-engineering phase&#151;the teams will be stood down, awaiting the Government&#146;s decision on how to support the technology. That is  <br>

another indication that we run the risk of dissipating our vital international lead on this exciting new technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para4"><a name="07022751000318">There is another issue, which leads to particularly pressing questions. The Miller field is not run by BP alone, and there are a number of other partners. It is due for decommissioning, and it is well known that the other partners want to advance the decommissioning plans. The clock is ticking on the Peterhead project, and it is being driven by the decommissioning of the Miller field. If the field goes into a decommissioning phase, and the engineering design work becomes a reality, with engineering work offshore, the opportunity to have the Miller field as part of the project will be lost. We will lose the opportunity to re-inject the carbon dioxide into a semi-depleted field, to have an extra 40 million barrels of oil and to use the high-specification Miller pipeline, which is there by the grace of God, because Miller was a sour gas field and therefore had a high-spec pipeline suitable for carbon dioxide. I therefore want some indication from the Minister that the Government are aware that the timetable is tight and that the need for action is pressing if this opportunity is to be grasped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para5"><a name="07022751000319">I was somewhat concerned by the Prime Minister&#146;s responses at the recent meeting of the Liaison Committee, when he was asked by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North about the Peterhead project, and in particular whether he was concerned that delay might result in the opportunity being lost. The Prime Minister said that he was a great supporter of the project, which would heat 250,000 homes. It is actually double that; the early project would have heated 250,000 but the current project will heat 500,000 and it is a nearly 500 MW project. Then he said that the trouble was that the Government had to assess the eight or nine other projects. Perhaps the Minister will tell me today what state of readiness those eight or nine projects are in. My understanding is that few of them are even on the drawing board, never mind ready to come off it. If the Government&#146;s decision making involves considering those other projects, there will inevitably be delay in realising the potential of any one project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para6"><a name="07022751000320">I suggest to the Minister that there are various ways to allow the technology to be supported. One way in particular would involve the Government in little risk, and would not, as the Prime Minister seemed to think, involve spending massive amounts of public money.</p>

understand from discussions with BP that it is looking for the same support that is given to wind farm generators. If that were so, it would be a massive sum of money. I was given a back-of-the-fag-packet estimate on the basis of the half-scale project, the 250 MW project, which came to a total of &#163;170 million. I should be interested to hear where the hon. Gentleman gets his figures from.</p>

<p><a name="st_78"><a name="07022751000326"><a name="70227h0009.htm_spnew5"><a name="07022751000523"><b>Mr. Salmond:</b>
 I hope that that was a supportive intervention and that as a Member of Parliament for a constituency in the north-east of Scotland the hon. Gentleman supports the project. If he gives me a second or two I shall explain exactly the proposal that I was going to make to the Minister. There are two ways to support a carbon capture and storage project. One is a challenge funding mechanism, by which the first project would be guaranteed, perhaps with a capital grant&#151;even a substantial one&#151;so that the technology could be proven. The advantages of proving such a technology would be available to industry as a whole. That would justify taking that route. That is roughly the route that the President of the United States has chosen to go down with DF2 and the $90 million tax allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para7"><a name="07022751000327">There is of course another way to support the project. My understanding of the economics, certainly of the Peterhead project, and hopefully of the other competitor projects coming along behind, is that they could go ahead for something of the order of 80 per cent. of the current trading price of a renewable obligation certificate in the environmental and renewable energy sector, if the Government could guarantee that to all carbon capture projects, or at least to the early ones. However, the projects would have to have the certainty from the Government that that level of support would be available when they came on stream.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para8"><a name="07022751000328">There would be significant advantages to the Government in taking that approach now. It would mean that they would have no capital risk, technology risk or production risk in supporting the project. They would be placing the early carbon capture projects at a level just below the trading price of current renewable energy projects. That would also allow the projects to find their place in the market. They would find their place, by definition, in terms of what was the best project. Early decision making would allow the proposals to go ahead early, instead of waiting for what might be a lengthy Government examination and review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para9"><a name="07022751000329">I know that the Minister will argue that the Government have not been delaying, but a process took place in relation to the previous Budget and the pre-Budget report, when indications were given about the Norwegian agreement and the Government&#146;s approach to the matter. It was widely hoped and expected that in this year&#146;s Budget the Government would determine their intentions on how to support the technology. There has been some speculation in the press about the delay in decision making. An article in <i>The Observer</i> of 25 February mentions a &#147;growing belief&#148; that the Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) on securing this debate on a very important issue. Soon after I became Energy Minister some two years back, I was advised by my authoritative officials that it is a mistake for an Energy Minister to become enthusiastic about a particular technology. I think that it is good advice, but I rather ignored it when it came to my growing understanding of carbon capture and storage, because it can reduce CO2 emissions from power plants by more than 85 per cent., and it has significant potential in the UK and worldwide to reduce CO2 emissions, while enabling use of fossil fuels to continue. It was identified in the Stern report as one of the leading emerging energy generation technologies, with the potential to contribute up to 20 per cent. of global carbon dioxide mitigation by 2050. It would make an impact particularly in fast-growing economies with rising fossil fuel consumption, such as China and India.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para13"><a name="07022751000332">Briefly, CO2 capture and storage&#151;CCS&#151;is a three-step process, which includes capturing the CO2 from power plants and other industrial sources, transporting it, usually via pipelines, and finally storing it in geological sites such as deep saline formations or depleted oil and gas fields. I listened with interest to the evidence cited by the hon. Gentleman about the sheer capacity of the North sea for that purpose. The challenge, of course, is to bring the technology forward cost-effectively. The processes as I have outlined them are not novel, but they have yet to be demonstrated together at scale on power plant. As a result, there is still major uncertainty about the scale of additional costs over and above those of conventional fossil fuel power plant. That, in turn, makes it difficult to develop regulatory or economic instruments to bring CCS to the marketplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para14"><a name="07022751000333">Under current arrangements, by which CCS is not rewarded through the EU emissions trading scheme, it is inevitably more expensive than conventional generation, as it adds significant cost while producing no more electricity.

To obtain maximum deployment benefit, information will need to be shared. The Stern report called for greater international co-operation to accelerate technological innovation and recognised that diffusion will reduce the costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para16"><a name="07022751000335">There is a range of technology options for CCS projects, including gas, coal or lignite, power generation or combined heat and power, pre or post-combustion capture, onshore or offshore storage, in oil or gas fields or in saline aquifers. Norway has a CCS project that is gas-based combined heat and power, while the USA is developing a project based on coal gasification. If we went ahead with a competition in the UK, we would want to consider how a UK demonstration plant might add value to projects being planned elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="70227h0009.htm_para17"><a name="07022751000336">Given the uncertainty about the potential cost of a demonstration plant, it is essential that the Government understand the likely costs and consider a range of alternative technologies and locations of possible plants. We have strongly encouraged the market to proceed with bringing the technology forward, and UK industry is well placed to undertake future CCS projects. The market is considering eight or nine projects.</p>

Is he at all attracted to my suggestion that, if the Government could guarantee the early projects, which could go ahead for less than the current trading price of renewables obligations certificates, it would enable more rapid decision making to take place, the projects to come to market and the Government to be free of any capital, technology or production risk?

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para1"><a name="07022751000351">The UK also leads the way on having CCS recognised in the EU emissions trading scheme, and the UK supports recognition of CCS in the clean development mechanism for developing countries. We are working closely with Norway to develop a CO2 network in the North sea. The UK is leading the European Union&#146;s near-zero emissions coal initiative in China, and we are pursuing a similar project in India. The initiative is proceeding well, and by the end of 2008, it expects to identify options for the demonstration of CCS by 2020. The UK has already committed &#163;3.5 million to the project, and we are exploring options for further phases with our EU partners.</p>

They are a major part of the UK&#146;s CCS programme. Efforts to reduce emissions at home through such technology will be undermined unless the technology can be rapidly deployed in those countries where growth in emissions is projected to be greatest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para3"><a name="07022751000353">The world is not on course for a sustainable energy future. We must be realistic about that. CO2 emissions will continue to grow rapidly over the next 25 years, and in International Energy Agency scenarios, global CO2 emissions will be almost two-and-a-half times their current level by 2050. It shows the urgency of the situation. No single technology or process will deliver the emissions reductions needed to keep climate change within the targeted limits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para4"><a name="07022751000354">As the Stern report said, even with strong action to encourage the uptake of renewables and other low-carbon technologies, fossil fuels may still constitute up to half of all energy supplies by 2050&#151;hence the importance of this debate. The successful stabilisation of emissions without carbon capture and storage technology would require dramatic growth in other low-carbon technologies. If it proves effective, CCS could help reduce emissions from the investment in new coal-fired power stations that are planned over the next decades, especially in India and China. That is why the proposal is so attractive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para5"><a name="07022751000355">The Government are committed to ensuring that the UK plays a role in the development of that solution. We are conducting a process to ensure that our understanding of the costs of a CCS plant based in the UK is robust.

 First, I thank Mr. Speaker for granting me this Adjournment debate, in which I wish to raise the current situation relating to the urgent need to upgrade rail links to and from Teesport. It is at the heart of the case for the development of the Teesport complex and for attracting much needed inward investment to the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para8"><a name="07022751000359">I wish to say a few words about the complex, as it is an economic driver for both Teesside and the UK. Teesport is the second largest port in volume in the United Kingdom and the 10th largest in western Europe. In 2005 the port of Tees and Hartlepool handled 55 million tonnes of cargo and goods, representing almost 10 per cent. of UK ports&#146; foreign and domestic traffic flow. In recent years the port has handled an increasing flow of container traffic. At present about 7.8 million 20-ft equivalent units&#151;TEUs&#151;of containers enter and leave the UK per annum. Owing to the growth in the manufacture of finished goods in the far east and the increasing demand for such goods in the UK, that level is expected to rise by 400,000 TEUs of containers a year. The UK&#146;s port facilities are currently incapable of absorbing that growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para9"><a name="07022751000360">I am aware of the recent decisions to allow for port expansion at Felixstowe and Harwich and of the Minister being minded to approve the London gateway. PD Ports remains convinced that there is a strong commercial case for the expansion of Teesport, providing deep-water berthing in close proximity to major consumer markets. That would make a strong case to shippers and handling agents, particularly as it is estimated that more than 50 per cent. of all container traffic to the UK via ports in the south is destined for markets north of Birmingham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para10"><a name="07022751000361">The port has submitted an ambitious planning proposal to the local planning authority, Redcar and Cleveland council, and separately to the Department for Transport. The proposal is for a major expansion of the container side of the port&#146;s operations to provide new berths so that larger, more modern deep-sea container ships can call at Teesport. The development would be a big employment boost for Teesside and the north-east, bringing 500 highly skilled jobs and a further 2,000 direct and 3,000 indirect jobs. The port has had recent success in developing a riverside facility for Asda Wal-Mart, and in 2003 it invested &#163;12 million in upgrading its container terminal. This is not just a pipe dream.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para11"><a name="07022751000362">The key issue that I wish to raise is the concern about access to and from Teesport and the best way to improve it. There is no real argument about road access, but container traffic being transported by rail rather than on the roads is more environmentally friendly and allows for greater security of carriage. There are significant constraints that preclude full access between Teesport and the east coast main line and beyond. Those constraints must be overcome. They are not on the availability of train paths, as evidenced by the partnership between PD Ports and Corus, which set up a direct internal rail link between the steelworks complex and shipping berths,  <br>

which released extra freight trains paths. The problem lies in the present gauge limitation on much of the UK rail system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para12"><a name="07022751000363">The rail lines near the port that connect with the east coast main line are at W8 standard, which allows only old, 8 ft 6 in-tall containers to be carried on standard intermodal rail wagons. Global shipping lines are increasingly utilising more modern containers, known as high-cube containers because they are 1 ft taller&#151;9 ft 6 in. That places Teesport at a disadvantage. The rest of the east coast main line is currently at W9 standard. High-cube, modern generation, 9 ft 6 in containers cannot travel on both W8 and W9 gauge tracks, but both W8 and W9 are adequate for use by freight trains with low-wheelbase well wagons and those known as low-profile pocket wagons. In its planning application details, PD Ports has assumed the use of such wagons to allow the inland transportation of modern, high-cube containers to and from the port by rail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para13"><a name="07022751000364">However, the use of low-liners or well wagons is not the optimum solution. The payload, or economic viability, of freight trains is reduced by low platform-height wagons. In addition, Network Rail has identified 20 obstacles on the gauge of the Tees valley rail line, including one major obstacle in the shape of a tunnel near Yarm. Those obstacles need to be removed in order to create a rail line that is cleared to W10 standard gauge. The issue is quantifiable in scale, scope and remediation costs. The trouble is that it has been bogged down in the excessive complexities of the national rail investment programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para14"><a name="07022751000365">Initially, the former Strategic Rail Authority decided that the matter needed to be considered in the rail utilisation study for the entire east coast main line. That work has now been taken over by Network Rail, operating under the aegis of the Office of the Rail Regulator. The east coast main line route utilisation study and its parallel freight route utilisation study were part of a 2006 consultation process undertaken by Network Rail. I fear that the study was so wide ranging and involved so many major players that smaller improvements such as the one that I am advocating may get lost in the long grass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para15"><a name="07022751000366">I am aware that the Minister has visited Teesport and recognised the strength of PD Ports&#146; case. I was pleased when he suggested that the best way forward would be to consider the issue through the mechanism of a transport innovation fund grant. A submission was made and in July last year the Teesport rail connection was listed as one of the contenders for possible funding. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport then announced the outcome of the transport innovation fund application process to the House on 18 December last year. On the bid for the Teesport east coast main line link improvements, he said:</p>

Network Rail have, however, been working with the Northern Way and other stakeholders to develop a wider Northern &#147;W10 gauge&#148; strategy for routes to markets for the major northern ports, in which Teesport would be a key element. We look forward to seeing the outcome of this work.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 18 December 2006; Vol. 454, c. 135WS-136WS.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para16"><a name="07022751000367">I am not criticising the Secretary of State&#146;s decisions, which I have no doubt were based on intellectually sound advice from his civil servants. I am sure that the  <br>

work that he described will go forward and be examined when it is ready. However, I emphasise my concern that easily identifiable improvements to relatively short stretches of the lines between Teesport and the east coast main line will be subsumed into a wider study. That study will encompass a far wider geographical area, perhaps considering ports as diverse as the Humber and Liverpool. It will also consider a wider W10 gauge approach, which will be long, complicated and costly to first understand and then hopefully implement. I am concerned that the process will make the simple improvements to the Tees valley rail programme that I have outlined much more difficult to attain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para17"><a name="07022751000368">Teesport is crucial to the national economy and the implementation of the proposals and investments from PD Ports, and it can create jobs and increase competition. Some thought should therefore be given to fast-tracking these matters. For once, cash is not a problem. I am aware that transport innovation funds require contributions from proposed beneficiaries, and provided that those are geographically ring-fenced within a reasonable distance from the port, I am sure that PD Ports will play its part in possible financing schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para18"><a name="07022751000369">However, speed is of the essence. The west coast main line has recently been upgraded to W12 gauge at the expense of the public purse and Network Rail, but that is not the case for the east coast main line. Both lines are equally important strategic rail links. The need for extra container handling capacity in the UK both at our ports and on our railways is an issue here and now. If we only build new ports in the south, our road and rail networks in and around the south-east will be jammed for ever. We need to quickly enhance rail links to this key northern port to ensure that it can fulfil its huge potential. I am sure that the managers of PD Ports would welcome another meeting with Ministers to look at some of the points I have highlighted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para19"><a name="07022751000370">I hope that the Minister will seriously consider making a helpful reply today and grant me a meeting to explore some of these ideas, because as I said, they are essential for the Tees valley, the north-east economy and the economy of our country.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar) on securing this debate and providing an opportunity for the House to debate rail links to Teesport. He finished his speech by appealing for a positive response from me. In recent weeks I have been referred to as the Minister for Westminster Hall, and more latterly, as the Minister for &#147;No&#148;. However, I will do everything I can to offer my hon. Friend some comfort, and if he has raised any points that I am unable to answer today, I would be more than happy to meet him and any relevant constituent interest he might wish to bring along at the Department for Transport.</p>

volume of imports supports the shift towards a service economy. As prosperity and the demand for goods grow, efficient freight transport is increasingly vital to the UK economy. Rail freight is a competitive private sector industry, and since privatisation in 1995, the levels of freight moved have increased by 66 per cent. in net tonnes per kilometre. Rail freight&#146;s market share also increased over the same period from 8.5 per cent. to 11.7 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para21"><a name="07022751000373">The Government welcome that growth and wish to see it continue. Our rail freight policy statement to Parliament in July 2005 outlined our clear policy aim to see goods being moved in a sustainable way, which maximises benefits to the economy and to society. Rail and water freight can bring substantial benefits as they generally have less impact on society than road transport. In 2005-06, the rail freight industry moved the equivalent of 1.22 billion lorry kilometres, saving 6.74 million lorry journeys, and delivering significant reductions in pollution and congestion. We believe, therefore, that rail has a crucial role to play in goods transport alongside other modes, and we wish to see freight travelling by rail instead of road wherever this makes the most sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para22"><a name="07022751000374">I apologise to you, Mr. Martlew. I am trying to shake off a cold, which probably explains why I turned a particularly unattractive shade of puce on the Front Bench yesterday while I tried to contain my coughing. I shall try to keep it under control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para23"><a name="07022751000375">We recognise that, compared with road freight, rail and water freight can reduce accidents and congestion on our roads, and can cut pollution and carbon emissions. To support the movement of freight traffic by rail and water instead of by road, we operate two grant schemes that are administered through the sustainable distribution fund. The two schemes are the freight facility grants scheme and the rail environmental benefit procurement scheme. The latter starts in April and will replace and build upon the successful track access grants and company neutral revenue support schemes that have been in place for some years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para24"><a name="07022751000376">To support the rail freight market we have previously announced that a resource budget of &#163;18.5 million a year has been allocated for the sustainable distribution fund until 2009-10. That is designed to give industry certainty that the grants will be available for the duration of their normal contracts with customers. Some of those grants are used to support flows from Teesport. In particular, two significant flows of intermodal containers out of Teesport by rail continue to be supported under the company neutral revenue support scheme. The support, which amounts to about &#163;250,000 a year, removes about 8,000 containers a year from the roads of the Tees valley. In addition, the Department awarded a track access grant for the movement of chemical products from Teesport to Workington in 2005, removing about 14,000 lorry journeys from the roads over a two-year period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para25"><a name="07022751000377">Of course, rail links are simply part of the logistics chain. Teesport is the second largest port in the UK by tonnage, and as such represents a crucial node in the UK supply network. Recent growth confirms it as a thriving port, especially in the bulk sectors. Teesport has ambitious plans to foster growth in its container traffic, as my hon. Friend said, and has prepared plans for  <br>

development accordingly. As the port&#146;s applications in this respect are either under active consideration or soon will be, I cannot comment further on the proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para26"><a name="07022751000378">We are currently conducting the ports policy review, which we intend to conclude this summer. As part of the review, we will consider the many and varied responses to the consultation process, including those of the operators of Teesport. We will also consider the recommendations of the Select Committee on Transport, whose report on the ports industry in England and Wales was published at the end of January. Among other things, the review is looking at the policy frameworks that support port development and surface access. We are looking at the various modes on this issue, and have sought views in the consultation on encouraging modal shift.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para27"><a name="07022751000379">The review has already shown that rail access is an important issue for UK ports. I am pleased to see how the rail freight industry has worked together to formulate the forecasts that have been used in the freight route utilisation strategy&#151;the rail industry never uses one word when six will do&#151;and Network Rail&#146;s other route utilisation strategies, as well as other parts of the rail industry planning process, including the high level output specification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para28"><a name="07022751000380">The forecasts cover the period until 2015 and indicate that rail freight growth will both continue and be concentrated on specific sectors, such as electricity supply, industry, coal and intermodal traffic to and from the UK&#146;s deep sea ports and in the construction market. In the next few years, the Government will complete a number of major projects aimed at enhancing the capacity and capability on the current network. These include the west coast project where enhancements such as the Trent valley four-tracking scheme will increase capacity for passenger and freight services and additional capability is being provided to accommodate further growth. That is just one of several schemes being taken forward by the Government and the industry to improve capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para29"><a name="07022751000381">However, despite record levels of investment, we recognise that capacity in some areas remains an issue. We remain convinced that in the short term significant benefits can be gained through making maximum use of the capacity available within the current railway network. Network Rail is taking forward a series of route utilisation strategies that will help achieve this objective, which aim to ensure that capacity is used as efficiently as possible and that demand and supply are as closely matched as they can be, while ensuring better performance and reliability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="70227h0010.htm_para30"><a name="07022751000382">The route utilisation strategy process also highlights areas where small-scale investments will enhance capacity and capability, some of which may be funded by the Network Rail discretionary fund and some of which may be incorporated into the high level output specification. Teesport falls within the area of the east coast main line route utilisation strategy, which has been the subject of a year&#146;s work by the rail industry and for which a consultation draft is expected in the next few months.</p>

which Network Rail plans to publish in March this year following consultation on the draft. The freight RUS consultation document shows the important role of both Tees and Hartlepool, and Redcar, as ports&#151;centres of industrial and commercial activity. They are also the origin of rail freight flows to locations across the UK including power stations, inland rail terminals, metal processing and production facilities and, locally, the potash mines at Boulby and steel production facilities close to the docks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="70227h0011.htm_para1"><a name="07022751000384">The document also recommends further work on the evaluation of options for rail gauge enhancements on the route from Teesport to the east coast main line. During the next 18 months, the proposal will be taken forward by Network Rail, with support from the ports and the regional developments agencies, as part of a gauge evaluation package for the key northern rail routes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="70227h0011.htm_para2"><a name="07022751000385">Each Network Rail route utilisation strategy covers a period of about 10 years. In the longer term, the Government will continue to take forward a number of projects to enhance capacity, including the Thameslink project, for which we have recently received planning permission, and to whose further development we have allocated &#163;30 million in advance of the outcome of this year&#146;s comprehensive spending review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="70227h0011.htm_para3"><a name="07022751000386">This year, our strategy on the high level output specification programme will set out our long-term expectations for rail. I should mention at this point that the high level output specification will not specify outputs for freight because the Government are not actually customers of the freight industry, but it will specify clearly what it expects from passenger rail during the next control period&#151;from 2009 to 2014. One of the main considerations will be the capacity of the network and how to respond to the inevitable increases in demand. The document will specify passenger outputs and also draw on work done by the industry in the freight route utilisation strategy. That will take into account the reasonable requirements of freight to inform directly our demand models so that we can plan for passenger growth while keeping an informed eye on the needs of freight as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="70227h0011.htm_para4"><a name="07022751000387">Given that rail projects can take a number of years to come to fruition, the Department will also consider the strategic direction for the railways over a longer period so that in the shaping of the first high level output specification we will be aware of the likely pressures and requirements in subsequent years. That will ensure that we do not carry out abortive works and that any renewals that occur are designed with the longer-term requirements in mind, which will save time and money when schemes are implemented in later years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="70227h0011.htm_para5"><a name="07022751000388">We recognise the importance of Teesport to the immediate locality and to the UK as a whole, and the strategic importance of its rail freight links to the east coast main line and beyond. We also welcome rail freight growth and wish it to continue across the country, including north-east England. The challenge for the future will be to develop the rail network to cater for such growth. I pay tribute once again to my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland, and thank him for raising the matter today.</p>
