<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08100953000008">It is a pleasure to be back in Westminster Hall to discuss a major report from our Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families. As many people with an interest in the education system know, when we formed the new Committee, we were determined to get the right balance between the work on schools and the new challenge of having responsibility for children and families. We decided that on the schools side, we would consider the three major planks of educational reform, which most people believe date back to 1988 and the time when Lord Baker was Secretary of State. Of course, those reforms were about testing and assessment&#151;knowing how students were performing&#151;and the national curriculum and inspection. There is no doubt that in 1997, the incoming Labour Government carried on with those three major ways of trying to improve standards in schools. Our responsibility seemed clear: 20 years after those reforms were embarked on, we needed to assess whether they had been effective and were still fit for purpose or whether they needed modification. That is what the Committee is about in relation to schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08100953000009">In terms of children and families, we embarked on a major inquiry into looked-after children&#151;children in care. We are well on the way with that inquiry and the balance has been struck in a pretty fair way. In fact, I have just come from a wonderful lunch time meeting with a dozen young people who had been in care. We do not believe that an inquiry into children in care can be carried out without actually talking to some of those children and we have just come from an excellent meeting with them. That is by way of explaining why, at the moment, I am the only member of the Committee here. I suspect my colleagues will be joining me shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08100953000010">I would like to discuss testing and assessment in terms of the following framework. Only yesterday, I was talking to the Institute of Education about a new publication called &#147;Educational Management Administration and Leadership: The Legacy of the Educational Reform Act 1988&#148;, which is an excellent collection of essays that evaluates the progress we have made in the past 20 years. Yesterday, I was at the Institute of Education with the authors of that publication and a large audience. I argued that I thought on the whole the publication was a bit too pessimistic about  <br>

how much change there had been and how much difference the reforms had made. The thesis in the book is basically that the reforms that were introduced depended largely on a kind of market economy view of providing education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08100953000011">I want to remind the House and this Chamber that when one considers the biographies of our great Secretaries of State for Education&#151;and there have been quite a few of them&#151;it is sad that, on average, they only stay as Secretary of State for about 20 months. One wonders how they ever achieved anything&#151;let alone greatness. Indeed, yet again, in the Department for Children, Schools and Families a couple of people have moved on just as they were becoming interesting and fantastically knowledgeable about education. They went off to the Department for Transport or somewhere else. There is something wrong with our ministerial system when good men and women just learn the ropes and are then moved on. That is not good for education and if that happened with a school&#151;if we walked into a school in which the top management kept changing and the middle management churned&#151;it would be in special measures. However, that is what has happened in the former Department for Education and Skills and in the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Something is going sincerely wrong under all parties when such ministerial churn takes place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08100953000012">That happens with the civil servants, too&#151;they just begin to understand Building Schools for the Future or testing and assessment, and they have gone. I am making a serious point: there is something seriously wrong with a democratic system that ends up being more about what the Whips want and what individuals want for their career advancement than what the citizens of this country need from a Department dealing with education, or any other Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08100953000013">When I spoke about testing and assessment at the lecture yesterday, I tried to put the matter in context. In 1988, when a Secretary of State&#151;or senior politician&#151;was offered responsibility for education, they often said, &#147;No. It is a hopeless little Department with no power and a small budget.&#148; These days, that is the sort of thing that people say about the Department for Culture, Media and Sport&#151;I should not really say that, but I have heard it said. Pre-1988, people thought that the Department dealing with education was small and had a small budget and asked, &#147;If you are ambitious, why would you go to education?&#148; However, Ken Baker and the educational reforms of the past 20 years have made a real difference to that perception. Before 1988, education was largely run by local authorities and since then, during the period of reform, an England-wide, centralised education system has been delivered by franchise directly to schools. Local education authorities have been bypassed whenever doing so would be useful. That model is quite useful for understanding the change that has taken place during the past 20 years. There are some strengths in that model, but there are some serious weaknesses. That is the backdrop I want to give the House to our report on testing and assessment. That is the setting&#151;a heavy reliance on three kinds of tools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08100953000014">This is the first report. We are halfway through our evaluation of the national curriculum and we will then consider inspection, Ofsted and so on. That has put the matter in context. The report was published on 7 May. Ofsted submitted a response on 25 June and, on 15 July, we received the Government&#146;s response. The Committee  <br>

published both responses as our fifth special report, Session 2007-08, on 22 July. The Minister is an old friend of mine, but it is one of the most disappointing responses I have ever had to an inquiry of our Committee. Someone in the audience I was addressing yesterday mischievously said to me, &#147;Do your reports ever make any difference?&#148; In the House&#151;when I have a better voice than this&#151;I am known for speaking up for my Committee and boasting a little. I hope that I am not too boastful, but I do remind people that the good commonsense reports that we produced, both as the Education and Skills Committee and as the Children, Schools and Families Committee, have made a great difference. They have made a great difference to the succession of Ministers who have taken on board our recommendations, and there has been better policy implementation because of our reports. You and I, Mr. Williams, have been around for some time&#151;as has the Minister&#151;but we know that things do not happen instantaneously. Let me remind you, Mr. Williams, about the rather frenzied period spent considering variable fees, top-up fees and university funding. The report we wrote made a big difference in a short time to whether that piece of legislation was a success or failure in the House. Many people think that our report on the later White Paper on schools made a big difference and bridged the gap between the original White Paper and the legislation that flowed from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08100953000015">There have been fast and slow results. I was amused this week when I heard the Secretary of State&#151;if it was not him, it was the Minister&#151;saying that where there is an instance of bullying in schools it should be noted and reported. I remember that when the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), who is the Conservative spokesperson on schools, was a member of the Select Committee, we wrote a report on bullying. We made that recommendation on bullying at least three years ago, if not four. Now, the Secretary of State thinks that it is a good idea. That is a four-year lag and sometimes there are two-year lags, but I challenge anyone to examine the history of the Select Committee over the past seven years and not to say that it has made a substantial difference to policy. I think that Ministers have benefited from our reports and our wisdom. We have sometimes given them a good opportunity to hang a change in policy on a report from us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08100953000016">I shall go through some of the main points in the present report on testing and assessment. We stated:</p>
<a name="81009h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08100953000239"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;National testing in England is used for a wide range of purposes&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08100953000017">far too wide a range of purposes&#151;</p>
<a name="81009h0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08100953000240"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;including assessment of pupil attainment, teacher and school accountability and national monitoring.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08100953000018">That is a heavy-duty use of a system of testing. Let us compare it with the situation 20 years ago. When Ken Baker got to the Department, he did not know how children were performing in schools at all. It was very difficult for him to find out how children were progressing, so he instituted some tests in schools and found that they were not progressing nearly as well as people thought they were and not as well as local authorities and his officials were telling him. He was very disturbed by that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08100953000019">At about that time&#151;I am sure that this is right&#151;Ken Baker read one of those management books, and there was a saying in one of those books that people of my age will certainly remember, which was, &#147;If you can&#146;t measure it, you can&#146;t manage it.&#148; That was said by one of the management gurus of the time. I thought that it was in the book on one-minute management, but I checked the quote the other day and it is by another management guru. I think that Ken Baker took that idea very seriously and that Ministers have consequently always taken it very seriously, but it can be taken too far, and running through the Select Committee report is our view that it has gone far too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08100953000020">The Committee received a large quantity of evidence; there is much feeling in the country about this issue. As we said in our conclusion, the evidence was that</p>
<a name="81009h0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08100953000241"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a single set of tests cannot validly achieve all of these purposes&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08100953000021">and that one of the purposes&#151;accountability&#151;had the effect of raising the stakes of the testing system for teachers, schools and local authorities, and raising them in a dangerous way. People who gave evidence to the Committee said that people no longer wanted to be heads but wanted to stay as deputy heads because they could not bear the thought of the responsibility of being head of a school that perhaps was in an inner city or a town with high mobility of students. They could not bear the idea that they might take over a school and that following an influx of students and a decline in the achievement of the students, they would, within a year or two, given the testing system that we have, be unable to practise as a teacher or a head for the rest of their lives. Such was the fear. Whether that fear was grounded in reality is a question that the Minister will perhaps respond to, but we found a great deal of evidence that people were seriously deterred from going for senior management positions in schools because of the testing regime. That is not good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08100953000022">We stated that</p>
<a name="81009h0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08100953000242"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;national testing can be used in inappropriate ways and...this may lead to damaging consequences for the education system and, most particularly, for children.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08100953000023">That is the heart of the issue. Anything that I say flows from that, because those consequences include teaching to the test, narrowing the curriculum, inappropriate diversion of resources in favour of pupils on the borderline and just too much national testing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08100953000024">We had witnesses after witnesses and made visit after visit. The Select Committee takes oral evidence and receives written evidence, and we go out on visits. There is nothing like the visits to bring home to us the reality on the ground. Our members, both individually and as a Committee, get out to many schools. I challenge anyone in the House to say that they have been to more schools than I have. I go to schools and other educational settings all the time. I think that I beat most Ministers in that respect. They may have a little spurt of going out on visits when they are the Minister responsible for schools, but then they move on to new things and I overtake them. I unashamedly say that I think I am the champion visitor of schools.</p>

do, it narrows the curriculum.&#148; Schools should be broadening the curriculum. They should be allowing children to wander across the curriculum, find out what they enjoy, spend more time on one part of it and so on. Of course, we want the essentials to be learned, because if people cannot read and write or add up, they do not have access to other materials. We all know that, so I hope that the Minister will not throw that one at us. The curriculum, if people take it seriously in terms of its breadth, is a very good one in many ways, but if schools teach to the test, that destroys access to the broader curriculum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08100953000026">I went to schools where heads said to me, &#147;We got some special money to expand access to the broader curriculum.&#148; They would then smile ruefully and say, &#147;Do you know what we spent that money on? Teaching to the test&#151;more rehearsals.&#148; That is dreadful. I like the Minister a lot. The only time that I thought he really had his head in the sand when he was giving evidence to the Committee was when he would not accept that, up and down the country, his regime, the Government&#146;s regime, was leading to teaching to the test, a narrowing of the curriculum and a diversion of resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="81009h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08100953000027">Time and again, we found that classes were aimed at children who were just at the margins of being able to reach a certain standard. It was a question of lifting the low-hanging fruit and getting those pupils into the five A to C area. Staff were concentrating on those pupils and perhaps neglecting both the brightest students, whom they took for granted, and the less able students, whom they did not think would make that standard. Some pretty naughty things are going on in schools. That is not the case in all of them. I hate it when people say that these practices are going on in all of them, but a significant number of schools are involved. When we go into a school with very good leadership and a fantastic team of staff, there is a different environment. They know that there are tests, but they are not teaching to the test; they are providing access to the full curriculum. Many schools do that. I do not want to slag off the whole state sector. That would not be right. Most of the state school sector that I see is wonderful, but a significant percentage of schools are teaching to the test and narrowing the curriculum, which is bad for us all.</p>

 I tend to agree with that last point. It is not the majority of schools that are teaching to the test, but with regard to the minority or significant minority of schools that do teach to the test, does the hon. Gentleman think that Ofsted should pick that up in its inspections and that if it is discovered that it is going on in a particular school, that should count against the school in its inspection report?</p>

 Yes, absolutely right. I said to the chief inspector of schools, &#147;Look, if we found this in our inquiry, why haven&#146;t you been seeing it?&#148; Ofsted then did its own work and came back to the Minister and to us and said, &#147;Yes, there is a lot of evidence of teaching to the test.&#148; That reinforces the point that we made. There was a bit of me that said, &#147;Where on earth has Ofsted been that, with all its resources, it was not flagging the issue up loud and clear before us?&#148; Nevertheless, that is for another day when we do our inquiry into the inspection system.</p>

They rejected them pretty clearly and bluntly. They did not believe that the number of purposes to which the test data is put should be limited. Indeed, they said that</p>
<a name="81009h0001.htm_brev4"><a name="08100953000243"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;imposing such a limit would not be sensible, and likely to impose new burdens on schools.&#148;</p>

He must have been apoplectic when he read that. In fact, he said that the tests were fit for the purpose for which they were designed&#151;that is, cohort testing in the three core subjects. The Committee had a long session with him, and he expressed severe reservations about the tests as they are presently used. He added that problems arise when a test that is fit for one purpose is used for other purposes. He said that one test serving 14 purposes was stretching it too far. When all those functions are put into one test, there is a risk of that none of them are performed as well as they might be. That is what Ken Boston said in evidence.

 My hon. Friend speaks about the fitness for purpose of cohort testing under the present testing regime. Our report was produced in May, so we were not able to consider the specific key stage tests that were offered to children this year. One of those tests has given schools in my constituency a great deal of concern. I speak of this year&#146;s written English test, which was set for key stage 2 pupils. It required pupils to have a knowledge of historical fairgrounds; they had to write a biography of a fairground operator. Many of the pupils in my constituents are recently arrived migrants, and they did not have sufficient pre-existing historical knowledge to meet that challenge; yet, quite properly, they could have met an extended writing challenge that did not require that level of knowledge.</p>

You might ask, Mr. Williams, why we talked to them, but those in higher education are saying, &#147;Do you know that some schools teach so much to the test that by the time we get the students at 18 they do not know how to think outside the subject. They come to university saying, &#145;What do we fill in?&#146; and &#145;What do we do?&#146; or &#145;What boxes do we tick?&#146; and &#145;What bit of knowledge do you want?&#146;&#148;</p>

 Is that not a consequence of the reforms to the A-levels in Curriculum 2000? Does not the modularisation of A-levels prevent the transition from being a GCSE absorber of knowledge and concepts to becoming a thinker at A-level? It does not happen now.</p>

 To be fair, that is a subject for another debate. I am interested in getting to know the shadow Minister well. I know that he does not like our report, because he is quite fond of testing and assessments. Not only do we have a cross-party consensus between the Labour and Conservative parties on the economic measures that are going on outside this Chamber; we have one also on testing and assessment. I disagree with the hon. Gentleman and the Minister, but they will have the chance to put their views later.</p>

That is the heart of the problem. Achieving excellent test results by teaching the whole curriculum in a balanced and creative manner, without teaching the tests or narrowing the curriculum. requires considerable confidence on the part of teachers and schools&#151;confidence that many do not have.

deliberate ploy&#151;to an undervaluing of teachers and a lowering of their feeling of professional competence. We have been running this sort of system for 20 years. We might say to teachers, &#147;Do it yourself. Explore the curriculum. Do this. Do that. Open things up.&#148;; but they say, &#147;Oh, I&#146;m terrified. What if my class underperforms and the head comes down on my like a ton of bricks because I have not delivered the A to C grades expected in my subject?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para5"><a name="08100953000046">There is a real problem in the undervaluing of a highly trained work force. Once that has happened, once their professionalism has been undermined, it will lead to serious problems. In part, our report is asking why the Government do not trust teachers more. I throw in the example of the key stage tests in the summer. What kind of country and what kind of Department is it that allows millions of scripts to go running and chasing around the country, being delivered by the Royal Mail or special delivery? It was a carbon footprint disaster. The tests could have been administered and assessed locally, by local teachers. They could be set nationally and marked locally. I do not understand the logic of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para6"><a name="08100953000047">When thinking of our report during the summer&#151;I am sure, Mr. Williams, that the Clerk is telling you that I am out of order, but I do not think that I am&#151;I said to myself, &#147;What a crazy world it is that we cannot trust our teachers to do more. They are competent and highly trained. Why not give them the confidence to do many more tasks?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para7"><a name="08100953000048">The Government did not accept that the current system of targets had put the system out of balance; nor did they accept that improvements in national test results were the result of teaching to the test. They ignored the Committee&#146;s view that although teaching to the test and narrowing the curriculum were not the inevitable consequences of high stakes testing, many schools and teachers were struggling and had resorted to those techniques in an effort to maintain or improve their league table position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08100953000049">The Government said that single-level tests and increased emphasis on teacher assessment were the answers to the Committee&#146;s questions on the burden of testing. However, they did not address the concern that single-level tests might actually increase the burden of testing. That is another major point arising from the report. We are worried about single-level testing. Many people think that it is a magic answer and that people taking tests as many times as they like is better than taking them at the end of a year, but we believe that such an approach has not been piloted, tried and tested sufficiently well, so there could be unintended consequences if we rush into it as if it is the answer. In the drive towards more demonstrable reliability in results, the Committee found that teacher assessment and the wider skills of the teaching profession have been undervalued, and that the single-level tests should be treated with great care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08100953000050">The Committee expressed the view that the professional competence of teachers can and should be explicitly recognised and supported by extensive training and ongoing professional support to enhance the use of teacher assessment in schools.

imperatives of accountability through targets and performance tables, the focus on effective pupil learning could be lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08100953000051">Another major point is that the Government interpreted the Committee&#146;s recommendations as supporting their strategy to improve assessment for learning practice, promoting personalised learning and combining the two in single-level tests in the Making Good Progress pilot. In fact, the report offered no such endorsement. I thought that that was a bit naughty. We have taken effective action against the posters that one used to see outside west end theatres that said &#147;Sensational!&#148;, when reviews actually said &#147;Sensationally awful!&#148;. Such things are now against the law, but the Minister did it with our report. He put a big sign, as it were, outside the Eden Project, by which I mean Sanctuary house, that misinterpreted the report. The Committee certainly approved of assessment for learning, increased use of teacher assessment and better personalised learning, but it was not convinced that such outcomes would result from single-level tests and the Making Good Progress pilot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08100953000052">The Committee was concerned that progression targets would perpetuate the problem of inappropriate use of resources for borderline pupils, and that they would simply shift the emphasis from pupils on the borderline of level 4, for example, to those on the borderline of moving up two levels during a key stage. The Government did not directly address the issue of borderline students but stated that the focus on progression targets as part of the pilot study would enable them to consider their effectiveness in encouraging schools to secure good progress for all pupils, which is different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para12"><a name="08100953000053">I would hope that everyone in education who hears about this debate will know that the Secretary of State has hinted that the coming academic year&#151;2008-09&#151;could be the last for national curriculum testing, which implies that single-level tests may be introduced in 2009-10. I cannot tell what the Minister thinks about that from his expression, but, given that the Making Good Progress pilot, which includes a pilot of single-level tests is not due to be concluded until the end of this academic year, there must be a question whether there will be time to assimilate fully the results of the pilot if the Government are to introduce single-level tests in September 2009. I am not naive&#151;the Government want to get results as quickly as possible, and I do not blame the Minister for being in a hurry. However, the Committee is concerned about single-level testing, even if it is the flavour of the month and fashionable. We have seen the latest fashions and fads employed in other sectors of education and they do not always turn out as well as people expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08100953000054">The Committee criticised the Government for not engaging with the complexity of the technical arguments on grade inflation and standards over time. In response to my colleague who said that we did not have time to look in sufficient detail at marking differentiation and key stage tests, I should say that any inquiry can go only so far, and a report must be produced. When I first became Chairman of the Committee, Gwyneth Dunwoody, who was Chairman of the Transport Committee, said, &#147;You have to give Select Committee members a varied diet. The poor darlings don&#146;t have a long attention span.&#148; That was a lovely Gwyneth moment, but there is no doubt that people get bored if an inquiry goes on too long, so there must be time limit. I am the first to  <br>

admit that things such as a sophisticated examination of, and taking evidence on, grade inflation could have been done better. The Government cited the decision to create Ofqual as an independent regulator in response to the criticism that they did not engage in the complexity that I mentioned. However, without some form of standardised, longitudinal assessment, the Committee suggested sampling, which the Government rejected, so Ofqual will not have the tools to monitor assessment standards, as opposed to performance standards over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para14"><a name="08100953000055">Going back to where we started, anyone who reads the report will see that the Committee was systematic: we took evidence, listened to what we were told and visited places. In my experience, which includes a range of inquiries in the past seven years, the report was one of the most thoughtful and thorough the Committee has ever offered to the House. The Minister is used to dealing with the Committee and he is charming, and it was great fun when he gave evidence to the Committee, but I hope that he sometimes feels that we are a bit of a pain&#151;a positive rather than negative pain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para15"><a name="08100953000056">Some things can be put right. When we produced our report, the Government were in the first year of a five-year key stage testing contract with an American company, to which they were in hock. At that time, they could not come back to us and say, &#147;We are going to look at testing and assessment again, clearly, openly, thoroughly, and holistically&#148;, because they were in a five-year contract. I do not blame the Minister or the Department for the debacle in the summer&#151;we are inquiring into what went wrong&#151;but it gives them a great opportunity to thoroughly and holistically re-examine testing and assessment. I hope that I am right that the Minister&#151;I always think the best of people, particularly him&#151;has cleverly decided that he will not rush into another four-year contract, but sign a temporary contract for one year. I hope that he believes that that year will give him and his Department the chance to seriously assess the direction of testing and assessment, evaluate the report more thoughtfully, and introduce reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para16"><a name="08100953000057">There is a thoughtful collection of essays entitled, &#147;Education Management Administration and Leadership&#148;. From it emerges the idea that the incoming Blair Government, who liked most of the Conservative-style reforms of the previous 10 years in terms of markets, diversity and choice could, at the same time, by adding expenditure and focussing on more deprived areas, social deprivation and so on, secure social justice goals for the less fortunate children in our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para17"><a name="08100953000058">If it tells us anything it is that all the money we have expended, and the massive investment we have made in pre-school and early years education, and throughout education&#151;tapering off a bit into higher education&#151;has been a wonderful investment. It would have been even more wonderful with, along the way, some modification of what we do about testing and assessment and the way we value and use our teaching staff, and some more sensitive evaluation of whether the inspection system is quite what we want it to be. I look forward to presenting future reports by the Committee, with you in the Chair, Mr. Williams, and with, I hope, the same Schools Minister as we have today; we shall be arguing the case for the best education system for all the children in the country.</p>

 I am very pleased to follow the Chairman of the Select Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman). My remarks will aim to reinforce his argument. I want, obviously, to support the conclusions and recommendations of the Select Committee report, and to make one or two comments about the Government&#146;s response, which I do not think entirely reflected the spirit of the Committee&#146;s recommendations. I want, too, to pick up the point that the Chairman made at the end of his remarks, about timing. Had the report been scheduled to come out a little later, we might have been able to incorporate sessions that we held with the Educational Testing Service and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority into our evidence, and to make comments and recommendations about the implications of the latest standard assessment tests fiasco this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08100953000060">However, there are still some positive things to be brought out. Picking up the Chairman&#146;s point, it seems to me that in exactly the same way as the near collapse of the banking system has thrown the Government a lifeline and enabled them to review their economic policy, the collapse this summer of the testing system and the key stage 2 and 3 tests, too, has thrown the Government a lifeline and enabled them to review their testing and assessment policy with dignity. As the Chairman pointed out, the Government are no longer locked in to five more years of testing and assessment on the model that has applied for the past 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para19"><a name="08100953000061">I welcome the progress that the Government have made, particularly in the past 12 months. There has been a distinct improvement in the openness to criticisms that have been made in recent years of the dominance of testing in our system. There has been a willingness to engage with critics. There have been some positive developments with respect to interest in single-level tests, the assessment for learning programme and the Making Good Progress pilot schemes. All of that is incredibly positive and there is no question but that the Government are seriously considering and evaluating the impact of 20 years of testing and assessment, and considering whether things could be arranged differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08100953000062">I want to focus on three main issues, then make a few observations on smaller points. First, I want to discuss the question of teaching to the test&#151;a crucial part of our report, which the Government response rejected almost completely, saying at paragraph 12:</p>
<a name="81009h0002.htm_brev0"><a name="08100953000244"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government does not accept that increases in national test results are the result of &#145;teaching to the test&#146;.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para21"><a name="08100953000063">The response continued, however, to say that better understanding of what goes on in schools might be needed and that the Government were</p>
<a name="81009h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="08100953000245"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;therefore considering how best we can gather further evidence in this area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para22"><a name="08100953000064">Unfortunately, the evidence is there later in the report, in the Ofsted response in appendix 2. Page 13 is entirely about the evidence that Ofsted has produced in a series of reports. It is important to set out the response from Ofsted:</p>
<a name="81009h0002.htm_brev2"><a name="08100953000246"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;More recent evidence suggests the continuance of these trends&#148;&#151;</p>

<a name="81009h0002.htm_brev3"><a name="08100953000247"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;For example, in Year 6 mathematics there are fewer opportunities than in other years for practical work because of the emphasis given to practising skills and techniques in preparation for national  <br>

Key Stage 2 tests. Similarly, in some secondary schools, routine exercises and preparation for tests impair the development of understanding as well as enjoyment of mathematics particularly but not exclusively in year 9. The recently published poetry report also discusses the significant impact of tests on the teaching of poetry in English, particularly in year 9.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para24"><a name="08100953000066">I want to say from the start that there is really little point in the Government&#146;s saying we need to search for more evidence&#151;because Ofsted has provided it, and it is here in appendix 2, next to the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para25"><a name="08100953000067">I do not reject completely the idea of teaching to the test. The real issue is not whether to teach to the test or not; obviously, students should be prepared for the forms of assessment that they will confront. The issue is the extent to which the preparation for the test at key stages 2 and 3 dominates the time available and skews the curriculum so that it becomes increasingly focused on the three core skills. The quotation that I have just made from the Ofsted report demonstrates that that happens. I do not visit as many schools as the Chairman does, but I try to do my fair share of visits, and I have yet to come across a teacher who would deny that teaching of the test takes place, or who would reject the notion that a disproportionate amount of time is given to borderline pupils, to squeeze them over the threshold. That is good thing, because we want pupils to succeed, but we must consider the extent to which it dominates the planning of the school day and narrows the curriculum. That is an issue at key stages 2 and 3.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para26"><a name="08100953000068">For 20 years, we have had an overall education policy dominated by testing, targets and tables, and we have tended to forget about learning. It is not a question of testing or no testing; it is a question of giving testing its right place in the planning of the school day and year. We need to refocus our efforts and make sure that learning dominates what happens in schools and that testing is seen as a means to an end, not an end in itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="81009h0002.htm_para27"><a name="08100953000069">The other point about testing is that teachers, parents and the public at large do not reject it: testing has always taken place in schools. It is an essential part of the learning function and of assessing children&#146;s progress. What has been specific&#151;and, in my view, specifically damaging&#151;in the past 20 years, has been the linking of the test results to high-profile performance tables. No teacher will say &#147;I do not want the children in my class tested.&#148; Every teacher understands the importance of test results. However, when those test results are presented in the form of league tables whereby a single indicator&#151;a test result at key stage 2 or a GCSE score in secondary schools&#151;is perceived publicly as the only indicator by which the school is judged, we are entering dangerous territory. From the teachers&#146; point of view, particularly more recently, the linking of the test results for the individual class for which the teacher is responsible to the question of salary and eligibility for higher allowances changes the name of the game. It gives additional importance to testing beyond what would be merited in a normal situation.</p>

<p>We cannot differentiate the question of testing from the form of presentation of information in the league tables. League tables are the second issue that I wish to raise, and have been in existence for nearly 20 years, becoming increasingly dominant. The original theory of league tables was that they would flush out into the open the good and less good schools. They were first mooted long before Kenneth Baker, under Sir Keith  <br>

Joseph. His idea was, &#147;Well, the less good schools will simply go to the wall. Let the bad schools collapse and close, and pupils will migrate to the good schools. Hey presto, problem solved.&#148; Unfortunately, it is not quite that simple. Schools and parents are located in certain places, so we cannot simply shut schools down wholesale and allow pupils to migrate. We must recognise the over-simplicity of the argument that league tables, by themselves, can drive up standards without any damaging effects being incurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para0"><a name="08100953000070">League tables have damaging effects, because year after year, some schools always appear towards the bottom of the league tables. I am not being fatalistic and saying that schools that serve particular catchment areas or enrol children with particular learning difficulties can never improve and progress. We know, and the Government rightly, and frequently, remind us that some schools with identical cohorts of children perform at strikingly different levels. That is nearly always because of the quality of the head teacher, the senior management and therefore the body of teachers. It is not fatalistic to say that certain schools will always have more difficulty in shining in the league tables or progressing to the top.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para1"><a name="08100953000071">The difficulty is that when parents in any community see certain schools either languishing in the middle of the league table year after year or plummeting towards the bottom, a local perception builds up that ultimately becomes damning to the reputation of those schools. That happens because we have focused entirely on one set of indicators in the presentation of information. There can be no going back to the days before freedom of information, and I do not think that anybody would want to suppress information about our pupils&#146; achievements. However, by focusing on one indicator&#151;scores at key stage 2, key stage 3, GCSE or A-level&#151;we do not reflect a school&#146;s full range of qualities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para2"><a name="08100953000072">The Government have listened a little to that argument and changed the format of the league tables. They have introduced the concept of value added in an attempt to indicate the progress that a school makes. There is still some debate about the usefulness of the value-added methodology that is used and whether different value- added methodologies would give a more accurate representation of pupils&#146; progress, but we can leave that to one side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08100953000073">The Government have made efforts, but the fact remains that the deeper understanding of a school&#146;s quality that comes from an inspection report, for example, is not reflected in the league tables. The Government and Ofsted are aware of that, and I once again make the plea that we must have freedom of information about the performance of our schools. Pupils&#146; examination performance must be in the public domain, but it must be set in context. The Government could do much more to review the construction of the performance tables and ensure that Ofsted&#146;s judgments about different aspects of a school&#146;s activities are incorporated in the league tables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para4"><a name="08100953000074">The Government&#146;s response contains a reference to that matter, acknowledging that the presentation of the value-added score has its limitations. In justifying what the Government have done to improve that presentation, paragraph 41 of the response states:</p>
<a name="81009h0003.htm_brev0"><a name="08100953000248"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have added text to the front page of the published statistics to make it clear what the tests measure.

I recognise that the Government&#146;s response acknowledges that there is a problem, but we will have to go much further to ensure that our performance tables provide the full range of a school&#146;s qualities and achievements, not just key stage scores.</p>

Other members of the Committee and Ministers will be aware of the UNICEF report published earlier this year, entitled &#147;Child poverty in perspective: An overview of child well-being in rich countries&#148;. They will know that in that report, which I think was the first of its kind, the United Kingdom came 21st of the 21 OECD countries surveyed in UNICEF&#146;s assessment of the well-being of children. It was assessed by six criteria, or six dimensions, as UNICEF prefers to call them. One was educational well-being, and given the huge emphasis and enormously increased investment that the Government have put into education in the past 10 years, we would all expect the UK to come out of the survey extremely strongly. Unfortunately, we did not. When all the indicators were aggregated, we were at the bottom of the league table, and on the education dimension we were only 17th of the 21.</p>

 I am trying to recall when the research for that piece of work was carried out. Does my hon. Friend have that information? My recollection is that it was about five years ago, so the impact of all the resources and changes that he is mentioning would not have been fully felt.</p>

 The report was published first in 2007, and finally earlier this year, so by definition the research was carried out some years previously. That is true, and I am confident that our position in the league table will be higher next time the survey is done. We cannot be fully confident about that, because the similar report that came out in 2006&#151;the third assessment of the programme for international student assessment&#151;showed that our position in the international league table for the performance of 15-year-olds had fallen back since 2000. These things are not entirely predictable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para7"><a name="08100953000079">I have flagged up the matter, because the well-being of children, their overall performance and their attitude to school are issues to be considered. My hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield touched on the impact of testing, in so far as it tends to skew young people&#146;s attitudes. They want to pass the test, so they acquire knowledge without necessarily understanding what it is all about. When they progress from A-levels to university, tutors criticise them for not being able to apply what they have learned or for having forgotten it. That applies, too, to young people leaving school at 16 and going straight into the workplace, who are criticised by employers for not being work-ready or able to apply what they have learned in school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para8"><a name="08100953000080">I wish to ask whether there is a link between the United Kingdom&#146;s position in the international league table organised by UNICEF and the policy that we have adopted for 20 years in our education system.

can prove whether there is a link, but the relationship needs to be explored further. We can see for ourselves that there are ongoing problems in respect of the large number of young people who become disaffected from school at an early age, leave school early and hit the streets at 16 to fall into the category of NEETs&#151;not in education, employment or training. We can see that there is a problem when young people do not wish to continue their education or training beyond the age of 16 and when teachers and Ofsted report that an ongoing difficulty in our school is not poor discipline overall&#151;schools are, by and large, incredibly well-managed places&#151;but low-level disruption in the classroom from some young people who have switched off from the curriculum offered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para9"><a name="08100953000081">We must question whether the dominance of testing is a contributory factor to that disaffection and alienation among some young people. In one sense, it is fairly self-evident. If a youngster who does not have high-level conceptual skills, who finds it hard to grasp mathematical concepts, who does not have a strong command of vocabulary and does not come from a family with a lot of intellectual capital to support them, takes their key stage 2 SATs and does not get level 4, they will feel a failure. There is no point beating around the bush; that is what happens. Some 25 per cent. of children aged 11 fail to make the grade that the Government say they should, and they feel that they have failed. Entering secondary school with the label of failure obviously will not be a big motivation for success in their school career.</p>

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="08100953000082"><a name="81009h0003.htm_spnew1"><a name="08100953000287"><b>Mr. Gibb:</b>
 The biggest problem facing such children in secondary school is not the label; it is the fact that they will have great difficulty accessing the curriculum because they do not have the necessary literacy skills. Not reaching level 4 means that their reading age is significantly below 11 and that they will struggle throughout their career. Reading is not a high-level skill. All children should reach level 4 by the time they leave primary school. That must be the aim of our primary school education.</p>

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="08100953000083"><a name="81009h0003.htm_spnew2"><a name="08100953000288"><b>Mr. Chaytor:</b>
 I understand that point completely, and I understand how crucial the three core skills are. However, in any cohort of children, a certain percentage will have learning difficulties of one kind or another&#151;it is not a tiny percentage; it is more substantial than I think the hon. Gentleman assumes&#151;which means that it is almost impossible for them to reach level 4 in one or more of the three core skills. That is no criticism of those children or their teachers and parents; it is just the way it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para10"><a name="08100953000084">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about preparation for the secondary school curriculum. Another dimension to the problem is that, because our system has focused so hugely on testing during the past 20 years, we have given less attention to the curriculum&#146;s flexibility. Had we reviewed our secondary school curriculum some years ago and made it more flexible in recognition of the fact that children perform at different levels, have different interests and aptitudes and engage with certain activities more than others, rather than using the monolithic watered-down grammar school  <br>

curriculum established in 1988, more of our less motivated and harder-to-teach children would have prospered in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="08100953000085"><a name="81009h0003.htm_spnew3"><a name="08100953000289"><b>Mr. David Laws (Yeovil) (LD):</b>
 I agree that a number of children will find it difficult to reach the Government targets, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that that number is likely to be much closer to 5 per cent. than to the 20 to 25 per cent. that we have at present?</p>

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="08100953000086"><a name="81009h0003.htm_spnew4"><a name="08100953000290"><b>Mr. Chaytor:</b>
 Yes, I do. It probably is about 5 per cent., although it might be creeping up to 10 per cent. The problem with talking about learning difficulties is that the term encompasses a huge range of problems. Some children have learning difficulties because of their horrific home backgrounds, not because of any lack of intellectual capacity. That is why I moved the number closer to the upper end of the range than the lower.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08100953000087">When all children know that they are expected to reach level 4 and a significant minority have huge difficulty getting there or just do not get there despite their best efforts and those of their teachers, the dominance of that level and the fact that it has become such a public indicator of success inevitably reinforces a sense of failure and inadequacy. That causes those young people to enter secondary school education with comparatively low self-esteem, and that self-esteem gets lower as they progress through secondary school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para12"><a name="08100953000088">I do not want to make any more of the issue. I have made the point that we must examine the relationship between an excessively rigorous system of testing&#151;a system in which testing has tended to squeeze out flexibility and variety in the curriculum&#151;and the impact on pupil behaviour, well-being, self-esteem and overall levels of success. Moving on, I have five random comments to make arising from the report. First, the Government rejected the Committee&#146;s recommendation that we move to a system of sampling rather than full-cohort testing for a number of reasons, one of which is the additional expense. However, it is not a question of either/or. Many countries have a system whereby all students take the test but not all results are published nationally, and a sample of the students&#146; scripts is used for national monitoring purposes. It is not a question of either sampling or full-cohort testing; it is a question whether the Government insist on using the full cohort for national monitoring purposes or take a sample of that cohort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para13"><a name="08100953000089">Secondly, in view of the chaos caused this summer by the collapse of the system for which ETS was responsible, we must consider&#151;the Chairman mentioned this problem&#151;whether it is still sustainable to operate a system in which hundreds of thousands of scripts at key stage 2, key stage 3, GCSE and A-level move around the country every year. The massive bureaucracy and cost of that intensive testing system extends beyond SATs into GCSEs and A-levels. Thirdly, on grade inflation and the role of the regulator&#151;the Government&#146;s response makes an important point about the regulator; Ofqual will be given increasing responsibility for assessing standards over the years&#151;can the Minister think of another sector in which the regulator occupies the same office as the body representing the industry? It is not acceptable that the offices on Piccadilly are the home of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the National Assessment Agency and Ofqual. I do not think that we would find Ofgem, for example, sharing premises with Electricit&#233;  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para14"><a name="08100953000092">My fourth point concerns key skills. We all understand that science, literacy and numeracy are key to accessing the secondary school curriculum and to future success in life, but so is information technology. Has not the time come for IT to be included as the fourth key skill? The value would lie particularly in the fact that some young people who do not always thrive in literacy and numeracy or who still find science a closed book are incredibly good at IT. IT should be a key skill not only because it is a key skill for any young person or any adult in a job or on a university course&#151;it is a key skill whether we choose to designate it or not&#151;but because it would have the beneficial effect of opening up the possibility of success in national examinations and SATs, if SATs are to continue, to more young people than currently succeed in the literacy, numeracy and science curriculum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para15"><a name="08100953000093">Finally, the Government&#146;s response to our recommendations on diplomas is fairly bland and does not mention the relationship between diplomas and the key stage 3 SATs.

 I congratulate both the Chairman of the Select Committee, the hon.

The criticisms in the report will resonate not only with those who would be regarded as critics of the existing targets and testing regime, but with many others, including those involved in the private education system who are also very critical of much of today&#146;s education architecture.</p>

criticisms in the Select Committee&#146;s report&#151;it has done an extremely good job. I am disappointed, though, with the quality of the Government&#146;s response. The Chairman mentioned his dissatisfaction with a number of points. The response is pretty thin and unpersuasive. It almost suggests&#151;I hope it does&#151;that the Department is in flux and rethinking seriously, behind closed doors, the future of the existing testing regime, rather than taking seriously the rather bland and unconvincing defence provided in appendix 1 of the response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08100953000097">I can only think that the Minister, or whichever official drafted the report, must have been smiling with his tongue firmly in his cheek when he wrote in paragraph 2:</p>
<a name="81009h0003.htm_brev1"><a name="08100953000249"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government strongly agrees with the Committee&#146;s conclusion on the importance of national testing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para19"><a name="08100953000098">One would have thought that this was a response to an entirely different report, particularly in the light of the national media coverage of the report&#146;s recommendations. I have a BBC report&#151;so I am not quoting from something that would tend to over-dramatise the criticisms made by the Select Committee&#151;that went under the headline: &#147;Tests &#145;damaging&#146; to school system: the national testing system in English schools is being misused to the detriment of children&#146;s education, says a report from a committee of MPs.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para20"><a name="08100953000099">Although the Committee&#146;s report acknowledges that any education system will contain an element of national testing, it is quite clear from the very first page of the document that the Committee has identified major deficiencies in the existing regime and raised serious criticisms. In the second paragraph of the summary, the Committee writes that</p>
<a name="81009h0003.htm_brev2"><a name="08100953000250"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the question we have asked is whether the current national testing system is a valid means by which to achieve these&#148;&#151;</p>

<a name="81009h0003.htm_brev3"><a name="08100953000251"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We conclude that, in some cases, it is not. In particular, we find that the use of national test results for the purpose of school accountability has resulted in some schools emphasising the maximisation of test results at the expense of a more rounded education for their pupils.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para22"><a name="08100953000101">The report makes many other criticisms, as the Chairman outlined earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08100953000102">We also have what I would describe pretty much as a misrepresentation of Ken Boston&#146;s views on the national testing regime. Anybody who knows Ken Boston&#146;s views, including those he has put in the public domain, will know that he has many criticisms of and concerns about the regime. I therefore agree with the Chairman that paragraph 9 is a misrepresentation of the views that Ken Boston has put on the record. There is also the misrepresentation of&#151;or, at best, confusion about&#151;the Committee&#146;s position on the single-level test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para24"><a name="08100953000103">Furthermore, the Government&#146;s response offers a complete lack of evidence on the issue of &#147;teaching to the test&#148; and on national standards. Paragraph 12 of the response states:</p>
<a name="81009h0003.htm_brev4"><a name="08100953000252"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government does not accept that increases in national test results are the result of &#145;teaching to the test&#146;&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="81009h0003.htm_para25"><a name="08100953000104">but then it offers no evidence for that assertion. Although the Chairman has made the generous admission that the length of the report did not allow for the Committee to go into as much detail as he would have liked, the Government simply cannot rebut some of its points but offer no evidence in doing so.</p>

have now opened up owing to this year&#146;s experience and all the criticism in the Committee&#146;s report and elsewhere. There is a chance for a new consensus on the testing regime. The hon. Member for Bury, North even referred to how the Government have been learning lessons recently in a number of policy areas&#151;for example, economic problems leading to changes in economic policy, and the implosion of the testing regime potentially leading to changes in testing. I hope that that is not the only way the Government will learn to improve their policies&#151;following the implosion of existing policies. However, if this year&#146;s shambles of the key stage tests provides an opportunity to solve some of the fundamental problems in the testing regime, I hope that we will take it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para1"><a name="08100953000106">We in this place have a responsibility to try to ensure, where we have such testing regimes, that there is continuity and that we do not just lurch from one set of tests to another, with a Government determined to be seen to be addressing the deficiencies of the existing regime. The Government should not continuously change the testing regime simply because they feel under pressure to appear to be doing something all the time. We have an opportunity to improve the system, but given that there might be a change of Government within the next 18 months or so, there is also the risk that we could see&#151;over the next one, two, three, four or five years&#151;a period of constant instability and changes to the testing regime. That would be extremely damaging for the school system. The Minister will recognise that one of the big criticisms made of education policy over the past 10 years, by people in the private and maintained sectors, unions and business, has been about the degree of volatility in policy. I hope therefore that the Select Committee&#146;s report will give us an opportunity to carve out a consensus on where change should take place, so that we do not simply lurch from one set of policies to another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para2"><a name="08100953000107">Before I outline what I think are the principal weaknesses of our testing regime, and before the Minister portrays me as a left-wing, crazed lunatic who wants to dismantle any sense of accountability and testing, I want to say a few things about what elements of accountability and testing the system needs. I think that everybody agrees&#151;the hon. Member for Bury, North, who is clearly a great critic of the existing system, certainly does&#151;that there is no possibility of, or argument for, returning to a system with no clear public accountability over the results attained by young people and schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para3"><a name="08100953000108">As I shall explain later, I want to see national tests at age 11, 16 and 18. In my constituency, I find key stage 2 tests and GCSE results extremely valuable in assessing how local schools are doing. Of course, I have the benefit of understanding something about the catchment areas of those schools, against which I review those results. I have rarely noticed a school either dramatically underperforming or outperforming its catchment area without later discovering that there was either exceptional leading and teaching going on at that school, or a problem with leading and teaching. I would not want to get away from having that knowledge and accountability. As the hon. Member for Bury, North has acknowledged, once that information is collected, it is difficult, in a world of freedom of information, to deny it to parents. I would be angry if it were denied to me.</p>

If they do not, they have no chance of performing to an adequate standard in secondary education and beyond. That will demotivate them pretty rapidly, not only in English and maths but in all the other subjects in which they will be incapable of engaging. I shall not go so far as to suggest that every youngster would be able to reach the minimum levels that the Government have specified&#151;I suspect that the hon. Gentleman would not say that every single child would, as those with high-level special needs clearly would not&#151;but I agree with the implication that the number of youngsters who are incapable of reaching those targets ought to be much lower than it is today.</p>

I hope that in 10 or 20 years&#146; time, we will not have an education system that is built on an assumption that 20, 30 or 40 per cent. of youngsters cannot reach basic minimum levels.</p>

there is a gulf between quite sensible people as regards what has happened to educational standards, in terms of test results, in the past 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para9"><a name="08100953000116">If one believes many of the Government&#146;s figures, there has been an extraordinary improvement in educational standards across the country&#151;an almost unbelievable improvement in some areas&#151;which, if true, would be testament to great success. Of course, many people in the country, including many serious educationists, believe that there has been a running down of standards, and that the process of teaching to the test has distorted what the results tell us. Many people believe that educational standards have been going backwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para10"><a name="08100953000117">In his August 2007 report on the Government&#146;s performance on education, Alan Smithers summed up the position rather nicely. He said:</p>

However, this assessment is inconclusive as it is so hard to say with certainty what the extent of any progress has been...Test and examination scores have gone up, but the monitoring has been largely under government control and it has had a vested interest in the results.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para11"><a name="08100953000118">If we are to have a proper debate about educational standards in this country, and if we are to have a testing system that is meaningful, then that testing must have some kind of credible element to it that is independent of the Government. Standards should not change over time, and no one should be able to dispute what is being produced, in terms of what is happening to standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para12"><a name="08100953000119">I strongly support the Select Committee&#146;s proposal on having Ofqual, or some other body, carry out sample tests on a small proportion of one or two cohorts&#151;probably two&#151;every year, so that we can assess what is happening to educational standards over time. That assessment should be invariant to what is happening to the nature of tests and teaching to tests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para13"><a name="08100953000120">The Government&#146;s response to that proposal, in paragraph 23 of their report, was totally unconvincing. They said:</p>

It also seems likely that we would have a number of sets of incompatible performance data, which would result in confusion for schools and parents, and would be a less transparent way of holding the education system to account.&#148;</p>

Cohort sample testing would precisely bring transparency and credibility to a system that currently has none whatever. When the Government worry about the extra costs involved, they should take some reassurance from the fact that I, the Select Committee and all the others involved in this debate, other than those on the Government and Conservative sides, are suggesting a massive scaling back of the testing regime, which would supply easily enough money to carry out those sample tests of cohorts, and still save money.</p>

 I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman&#146;s flow, but does he not think it appropriate that the assessment of standards in education be carried out by the Office for Standards in Education, Ofsted?</p>

 I think that Ofsted carries out one element of inspection, but it is most certainly not carrying out inspection in a way that introduces credibility in respect of the cohort tests. If the Minister is arguing that he will give much more significant powers to Ofsted and allow and encourage it to cohort test, I might think again about what he says on Ofqual, but I fear that the Government want to create the appearance of an independent assessment of standards without creating a body with real teeth to do the job. My suspicion is that the Government do not want to accept the Committee&#146;s recommendations in that area, precisely because they do not have the assurance or confidence that the cohort sampling, of which the Committee is in favour, will bear out the alleged extraordinary improvement in standards, not only between 1997 and 2008 but over the decade prior to that, when GSCE results also went up by an extraordinary amount. That is the first area that we need to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08100953000128">The second area is how the key stage tests operate. As I said earlier, I want some element of testing and accountability in the system. I do not want the key stage 2 tests done away with, and, while we have the system of GCSEs and A-levels, it makes sense to test at those levels. The curriculum will always narrow beyond 16 years old, and we will always want to measure performance up to and beyond that age, but we could enormously reduce the rest of the testing. I agree with people such as John Dunford, with most head teachers to whom I have spoken as I have been around schools and with most other education professionals, who say that the key stage 3 tests are pretty much a waste of time. The hon. Member for Bury, North made an excellent point when he asked what will happen when, with the diplomas, the 14-to-19 curriculum comes in with a vengeance. Are we really going to maintain the nonsense of key stage 3 tests? They seem to be an utter waste of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para20"><a name="08100953000129">The testing regime is important for accountability, but it must reinforce a genuine process both of identifying the challenges that young people face in education and of doing something about it. We spend huge amounts at key stages 1 and 3, and, arguably, we could even reduce the size of the key stage 2 test, but let us look at what happens to youngsters who at an early age are identified in schools as not having the literacy and numeracy skills that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para21"><a name="08100953000130">I went to a school in east London a few months ago&#151;one of the schools where the Government are piloting one-to-one reading and numeracy tuition, which seemed to be extremely effective. I think it was in partnership with KPMG. At the end, however, when I asked the head teacher how the scheme was going, it was quite clear that the scale of the challenge&#151;the number of youngsters who would benefit from such interventions at 5, 6 and 7&#151;was way beyond what the Government were providing for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para22"><a name="08100953000131">I would rather we had a system of assessing youngsters seriously as early as possible, probably at age 5, and ensuring that we then had the money to do something about all the youngsters who will already have fallen behind. We know that most will have fallen behind before they even arrive at school. That is a greater priority than tests at ages 7 and 14, which we may think tell us something about school performance but which are widely ignored and rarely reported in local newspapers; which even I, with my interest in education, am totally unaware of in relation to my local schools; and which do not do anything about putting money into what matters, which is, once we have completed the assessment at ages 5 and 6, intervening to do something about the problems in the way the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para23"><a name="08100953000132">The Government say that the Select Committee report lacks evidence of the effects of teaching to the test, but as the Committee Chairman and the hon. Member for Bury, North clearly demonstrated, that is just not true. Appendix 2, the Ofsted response, is extraordinarily blunt about, and critical of, the effects of teaching to the test. There are two pages&#146; worth of evidence from Ofsted reports on the impact of teaching to the test. The issue is not just about curriculum narrowing, which happens in many schools but can be avoided in those that manage such matters very well, and in those with strong catchment areas, where the results are likely to be good anyway; the comments in Ofsted&#146;s response on p. 13 of the Government&#146;s response are more worrying. The hon. Member for Bury, North quoted them, but I shall do so again because they are so significant. Ofsted quotes itself, saying:</p>
<a name="81009h0004.htm_brev5"><a name="08100953000258"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;&#145;Weaker teaching (in mathematics) was too narrowly focused on proficiency in examination techniques at the expense of building understanding of concepts and their relationships.&#146;&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para24"><a name="08100953000133">In the next paragraph, Ofsted says that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para25"><a name="08100953000134">In other words, the criticism is that the tests not only narrow the curriculum but, because of what is being tested, diminish educational outcomes.

at one end of the spectrum, to the poshest private schools, the criticism has been made that that element of the education system reduces standards and stretch in the system&#151;even as the formal results profess to suggest that there is some extraordinary rise in standards. It is an issue not only at A-level, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, but in primary and secondary education, so I should like the testing regime to be slimmed down to focus more on early assessment and intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para26"><a name="08100953000135">I should like also to keep the key stage 2 tests. There is a genuine issue about whether they should be marked externally or internally with external moderation, but I would not be willing to move from external testing until we were sure that we could do so without creating credibility problems. If the tests are high-stakes tests, we must acknowledge that the most challenged schools with the poorest results risk being put under pressure to deliver good test results. We worry most about those schools, because that is where we want to know what is going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para27"><a name="08100953000136">I ask the Minister please not to introduce single-level tests. I am pleased that the Committee&#146;s report made that clear and that the Chairman took that position, too. I know that the tests sound like a good idea, and that to test people when they want sounds terribly sensitive and nice, but will they not simply institutionalise even more testing, not just at particular points in the education system but the entire time? Will the accountability mechanisms be credible, so that we can really see what happens in schools? And, anyway, is it not true that, frankly, there are benchmarks in the education process when we want to know whether youngsters have the basic skills, whether they are ready to enter secondary education and whether they have their basic skills by GSCE level?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para28"><a name="08100953000137">The issue cannot be fudged. So far, the evidence is that single-level tests have been a mess and that the Government have been reticent to publicise the effects of the pilots because they have apparently been a shambles. I hope that they will be buried and that the Government will use the opportunity of the utter shambles of this year&#146;s key stage testing to review the issue seriously and think not about a scorched earth policy, which would get rid of the genuine improvements in accountability and testing over the past 20 years, but about designing a system that is fit for purpose and does not, in the case of some tests, waste money to very limited ends. I hope that the Government will listen and be willing to respond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="81009h0004.htm_para29"><a name="08100953000138">In his response, I hope that the Minister will update us on what is happening in relation to this year&#146;s key stage results and to the number of appeals that have been received about the key stage test. We understand that there has been a massive increase in the number of appeals this year because of the problems with the tests and the marking. I would appreciate updates on how many appeals the National Assessment Agency has received so far compared with this time last year, and information on whether this year&#146;s marking is as reliable as last year. My understanding is that although Ofqual has indicated that it believes it is, that is not the view taken by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. It would be helpful if the Minister could sketch out the timetable for commissioning the tests for 2009 so that we have some idea of whether it will be held to.</p>

 I should like to add my congratulations to the Minister on his well-deserved elevation to right hon. Gentleman. It should be noted that the Ministers that I have shadowed tend to be promoted rather than having to resign in ignominy. His predecessor became Chief Whip and then Home Secretary. Before that, I shadowed the Energy Minister who went on to become the Secretary of State for Scotland. It is the contrast between a Minister and his shadow that shows him in a good light, so congratulations to the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para0"><a name="08100953000141">It is a pleasure to be taking part in this debate. I think that I detected a valedictory tone in the comments of the Chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman). I enjoyed serving under his chairmanship for the couple of years that I was on that Committee. Many of its reports under his chairmanship have been highly influential for the Government. Some, however, have received quite poor responses. I want to cite the excellent report by the Committee on special educational needs and the report into the teaching of reading that led to the Rose review and a complete change of Government policy on how we teach children to read in our primary schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para1"><a name="08100953000142">I agree with the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) that we need a period of stability in our education system. The plethora of fortnightly initiatives has undermined morale in the teaching profession. The permanent state of revolution that seems to exist, with new curriculums coming out of the QCA every other term, is too much. The hon. Gentleman himself appeared to wish to make sweeping changes to the testing regime if the Liberal Democrats came to power, but we should all be careful before recommending too many changes to the education system.</p>

When I said that I wanted all children to reach level 4 in English at key stage 2, I was excluding children with particular neurological conditions or special needs, who need extra help and attention from specialists in that area. It is important in any debate about testing in education to distinguish between those who are opposed to any external testing for ideological reasons and those who have specific concerns about our testing regime. Many people who express particular concerns about our testing regime conceal the fact that they are opposed to testing per se&#151;they  <br>

always have been, and always will be. I am not saying that anybody in this debate falls into that category, but that is often the case in the education world. There is an ideological approach that goes back to the 1920s in the United States and to the &#146;50s and &#146;60s in this country that says that children should never be tested, and that they should learn by self discovery in a non-didactic way. It suggests that knowledge and concepts should be downgraded and replaced by teaching life skills. It is an ideology that is still very prevalent in the corridors of the education establishment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para3"><a name="08100953000146">The Select Committee rightly concluded:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para6"><a name="08100953000149">Once we accept the principle of national testing, particularly its motivational role for students, teachers and schools, it is then necessary to consider each of the criticisms of the system of tests that we have in this country. The first criticism is that English pupils are the most tested in the world. However, that is factually untrue. The appendix to the report says that across the world, from Japan to France to Australia, some type of full cohort testing taken at key points in pupils&#146; progression through school is the norm. In the United States, the No Child Left Behind legislation, which came into force in 2002, introduced statutory assessment of all children every year between the ages of eight and 14. In Alberta, Canada, all children aged nine, 12 and 15 have to take centrally set and marked tests. In the 2006 study by the Programme for International Student Assessment, Alberta, if it is assumed to be an independent nation, scored the second highest score, just behind Finland. In England, there is just one set of tests after seven years of primary education. Three years later, there is another set of tests and two years after that, there are GCSEs. I do not believe that that level of national testing is too burdensome.</p>

 Am I right in saying that about a year ago, a Conservative commission on public services and education considered this whole issue and recommended the abolition of the key stage 3 tests and the residue of the key stage 1 tests as well? Is the hon. Gentleman saying that his party has taken a definite decision to reject those recommendations?</p>

 Yes, we have. Testing is here to stay. We have recommended abolishing the key stage 1 test&#151;the teacher-led assessment&#151;and replacing it with a screening test at the age of six, after two years at primary school, to ensure that children can decode. Testing will remain if the Conservatives are elected to Government in 18 months&#146; time.</p>

 I will come on to those points, but I do not accept the argument that such tests cannot be used for multiple purposes. There are two main purposes&#151;to assess the child and to provide an accountability framework for schools&#151;and I do not think that they are incompatible. I will talk in a moment about the concept of teaching to the test and the extent of that problem and how we tackle it, but I want to focus first on the issue of too many tests. There is a problem with tests from 16 onwards. The introduction of modularisation and the AS/A2 split means that sixth-formers are taking exams throughout their two years of study with repeated retakes adding to that burden. From the age of 15 or 16, children in this country have a huge burden of testing, which is unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para7"><a name="08100953000154">The reforms have done so much damage. As I said in an intervention, they have stunted the progression of 16 and 17-year-olds from absorbers of knowledge and concepts at GCSE level to thinkers at A-level. Too many sixth-formers leave school with their intellectual development scarcely above the GCSE level because of the modular approach, which was reflected in the concerns the vice-chancellors expressed in their evidence to the Select Committee. We have asked Sir Richard Sykes, the former rector of Imperial college, to look at that aspect of the exam system to determine what reforms are required to restore the integrity and rigour of our examinations and public confidence in them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para8"><a name="08100953000155">Teaching to the test was raised in the report, and it has been raised extensively in this debate. I would argue that it is a feature of weaker schools. I visit schools every week, and I always ask heads whether they engage in the practice, whether for year 6 in primary schools or year 9 in secondary schools, and whether they focus on test practice, narrowing the curriculum or stressing their pupils. The heads of strong primary schools in particular tell me that the children in their school take the tests in their stride. They simply come in on a Monday morning and do them. Those schools are confident that their broad curriculum, which includes ample time for subjects such as history and geography as well as the basics and science, equips the children with a broad knowledge and vocabulary so that they can excel in key stage 2 standard assessment tests. Ofsted itself said on page 13 of the response to the Select Committee&#146;s report that</p>
<a name="81009h0005.htm_brev2"><a name="08100953000262"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the best schools can focus on tests and exams without narrowing the curriculum.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para9"><a name="08100953000156">I believe that that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para10"><a name="08100953000157">The schools that use synthetic phonics to teach reading in reception class and year 1 get to a position in which almost every child is a fluent reader by the end of year 1, or at the end of year 2 at the very latest. In those schools, having learned to read, children then spend the next five years of their primary education reading to learn rather than still struggling to read. Children should not be put in the position 10 weeks before their key stage 2 tests in English of being rehearsed to reach level 4. In strong schools, the aim is not level 4 but  <br>

level 5&#151;they are way beyond level 4. Schools should aim to teach beyond the test. If they were to do so, they would find that the test itself was not something to worry about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para11"><a name="08100953000158">I acknowledge that teaching to the test takes place in either a minority or significant minority of schools. Ofsted needs to monitor the extent to which it takes place and to report on it at an individual school level. It should criticise schools for doing it. I am always astonished by how many teachers admit to teaching to the test. The hon. Member for Huddersfield cited people who gave evidence to the Select Committee saying that they teach to the test. Professionals should not want to boast about it. It is, as he said, &#147;naughty&#148;, and Ofsted should therefore include it as one of the things on which it reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para12"><a name="08100953000159">I agree with paragraph 131 of the Select Committee&#146;s report, which recommends</p>
<a name="81009h0005.htm_brev3"><a name="08100953000263"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that the Government reconsiders the evidence on teaching to the test and that it commissions systematic and wide-ranging research to discover the nature and full extent of the problem.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para13"><a name="08100953000160">Of course, schools are under pressure to ensure that all children who leave primary school are fluent readers and at ease with arithmetic. When tests were introduced in the mid-1990s, it became clear that one half of 11-year-olds were starting secondary school ill-equipped in the basics. Even now, one in five 11-year-olds leaving primary school still struggles with reading, and 40 per cent. leave primary school not having mastered the basics in reading, writing and maths combined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para14"><a name="08100953000161">I am always astonished when I visit comprehensive schools&#151;even good comprehensive schools with good feeder primary schools&#151;where the head teacher tells me that 25 per cent. of the children coming into their school have a reading age below the age of 11, or that some other significant percentage have a reading age more than two years below their chronological age. As much as half the intake of some weaker comprehensives with weak feeder primary schools has a reading age below the children&#146;s chronological age. That is totally unacceptable and unnecessary: reading is a low-level skill that all children, except those with particular neurological conditions, should master in the first two or three years of primary school.</p>

 I understand what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is describing, but, for the schools that I visit, it is rarely a question of poor leadership or a poor school. One has to look more closely at the situation. For example, many inner urban schools have children that have arrived from another country 18 months or a year before and have no knowledge of English&#151;that could be a significant percentage of the population. One must look at the context: a new migrant population, a much higher percentage of special educational needs than one finds in the average school, and, of course, a great deal of social deprivation. As the hon. Gentleman knows, those things have to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="st_32"><a name="08100953000165"><a name="81009h0005.htm_spnew10"><a name="08100953000308"><b>Mr. Gibb:</b>
 I understand that point. I came across it when I looked at Kobi Nazrul school, which is the school where Ruth Miskin was the head teacher. Some 98 per cent. of the children who go there are Bangladeshi&#151;a significant proportion have English as a second language&#151;yet, while she was head teacher there, she managed to get 100 per cent. of the children to level 4 in English. A few years later, the new head teacher was effective and continued to achieve those results, but I noticed that in one year, the figure went down to 67 per cent. I rang Ruth and asked why that was, and it was for the very reasons that the hon. Gentleman set out. It was impossible for children who had come into the school during the previous year to achieve the results, because they had not been there long enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para15"><a name="08100953000166">One has to look at figures about schools intelligently, and I think most people do so. I certainly do, and I am sure that Ofsted does, as do parents: most parents I have spoken to do not look only at test results. They look at Ofsted reports, speak to the parents of existing pupils at the school, and look at how well dressed the children are. They consider a range of issues, but that is not a reason for not continuing with externally administered national tests and publishing the results.</p>

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="08100953000167"><a name="81009h0005.htm_spnew11"><a name="08100953000309"><b>Mr. Sheerman:</b>
 There is a real danger in taking the tests too seriously. If Ofsted, increasingly with a light touch, is in a school for only a day and a half, there is so much pressure on it just to read the test results. There is little of the quality weighting that the hon. Gentleman described. That is the real problem with using testing inappropriately. If Ofsted had gone to Ruth Miskin&#146;s old school when the results changed and just looked at the results, it might well have condemned it.</p>

<p><a name="st_34"><a name="08100953000168"><a name="81009h0005.htm_spnew12"><a name="08100953000310"><b>Mr. Gibb:</b>
 I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is a pity that the Education Act 2005 changed the Ofsted inspection regime, which is now very short. I agreed with the changes that enabled a much shorter notice period&#151;I thought that the months of pressure on schools to produce teaching plans and documentation ready for the great visit from Ofsted was a mistake&#151;but why can we not have short-notice inspections that are slightly longer? I believe that teachers would appreciate having Ofsted inspectors in the classroom, particularly if the report on the school was negative. Ofsted needs to demonstrate that it has looked at the school in more detail than the short inspections allow at present. We must look at these things intelligently, and I agree 100 per cent. with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para16"><a name="08100953000169">The pressure on schools is important. Schools should not be forced to fiddle the system. They should examine their teaching methods if they are worried about their key stage 2 or GCSE results, rather than take shortcuts or try to game the system. That is why Ofsted needs to judge schools on the basis of a balanced scorecard. It should note schools that put unnecessary pressure on pupils, that teach to the test or that narrow the curriculum. In all walks of life, there are competing pressures. In business, people are under pressure to increase sales, reduce their costs and keep the customer satisfied. If people just focus on one of those things, the business will go bust. If they just focus on reducing costs, they will find an unhappy customer base and if they focus only on sales they will wipe out their profit and the company will go bust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para17"><a name="08100953000170">The SATs that are most criticised&#151;picking up the point made by the hon. Member for Yeovil&#151;are the key stage 3 tests. However, those are probably the most important. Years 7, 8 and 9 are known to be a problem area in our education system, as one witness to the Committee said. There is significant evidence of a dip in performance that is not just a result of hot-housing at key stage 2. For example, 11 per cent. of pupils who reach level 4 at key stage 2 make no improvement over the next three years in their secondary education and gain another level 4 in their key stage 3 tests. These are the same pupils who went through the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para18"><a name="08100953000171">The idea that any 14-year-old should have a reading age below the age of 11 is unacceptable. We need to be sure that secondary schools are setting children into ability groups from the start of year 7 in every academic subject, so that those with poor literacy are picked up early and helped. That is why it is important that we have the SATs at the end of key stage 3. There is also a danger, which would apply only to a minority of weaker schools, that, if the key stage 3 division and test were abolished, some schools would be tempted to spend more years focusing on the GCSE figures, so that instead of a two-year course leading to GCSE they may have a three or four-year course, simply to push up their GCSE results at the expense of the knowledge is needed in the earlier years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para19"><a name="08100953000172">Finally, on league tables, some people argue that the publication of the test results distorts teaching, rendering the figures unreliable as a consequence. The idea that publicly funded schools can conceal their results harks back to a pre-freedom-of- information era. I am sure that many Members of Parliament would like to go back to the era before the Freedom of Information Act 2000, but neither the public nor the media would tolerate for Members of Parliament or for schools. One key reason for SATs is to hold schools to account and identify individual schools that are underperforming. It is also important that parents are well informed about a school that they may choose for their child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="81009h0005.htm_para20"><a name="08100953000173">There is evidence that GCSE league tables have led some schools to push pupils into softer GCSEs to boost the five-or-more-GCSEs figure. That practice was, to some extent, exposed and stopped when the English and maths figures were included, but the problem is not the league tables but the target. There should not be a target for the percentage of five or more GCSEs. The objective and target for schools is to provide a broad, rigorous education for all their pupils: that is the objective and target that they should be aiming for. We can test that by using a range of measures in addition to the five or more GCSEs, including English and maths. We can, randomly and without announcing the measure in advance, publish the results for pupils with seven or more GCSEs at A* to C, for example, or for those with five or more GCSEs, including physics or a modern foreign language, then compare those figures with the headline figure showing those with five or more GCSEs, to see where schools are, pushing children into the non-core subjects to boost their results. Testing is key to the accountability of the education system. It is key to identifying the weaker schools, important for monitoring the progress that children make, and vital for motivation. If we abandon national testing, we abandon any chance of raising standards in our schools.</p>

They help to focus young people on the core skills that they need.

The results of review requests that were submitted before the summer have now been sent out to schools. The NAA is confident that results for reviews submitted after the summer break will be made available to schools ahead of the revised deadline. The number of reviews has certainly been much higher than in previous years, and that is to be expected, given the problems with delivery and the lack of confidence that that generated.</p>

 I apologise to the Minister for not congratulating him on becoming a Privy Councillor. Before he is diverted to a matter that the debate is not about&#151;that inquiry is being carried out now&#151;will he respond to our debate on a report that we have written? What I want my right hon. Friend to speak about is not whether lots of other countries have tests, but the high-risk nature of tests here with the inspection system that makes them high risk for everyone. That puts stress on the head and on teachers, and makes them different from those in so many other countries.</p>

 I shall come to that, and I appreciate that I may be stretching your patience, Mr. Williams, in saying a few words about the problems with delivery over the summer.

Friends the Members for Huddersfield and for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) said, these problems give us an opportunity to reflect on the application of the principles for testing. We have said consistently that the current arrangements are not set in stone, and that is best evidenced by our piloting of alternative arrangements for testing, on which comments have been made today. We said in the children's plan that there may well be changes, and we recognise that the system could be more flexible for schools, more personalised for individual pupils, and provide more scope for teacher assessment and professional judgment. That is why we are running the making good progress pilot in 450 schools. It is not just about single-level tests, but includes one-to-one tuition, new classroom assessment tools, and stage not age tests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="81009h0006.htm_para10"><a name="08100953000198">In testing this new approach, we hope that pupils will benefit from a more personalised learning experience, whatever their starting point, that parents will benefit from clearer information about their child's progress rather than having simply a snapshot after two or three years, and that teachers will benefit from greater freedom to use their professional judgment about the progress a child is making and when they are ready to take a test.

disadvantaged and from the brightest to the least able, will have the chance to achieve what they are capable of. The most able pupils will be able to progress quickly, and those who need more help can cover difficult areas more thoroughly in personalised one-to-one sessions with a qualified tutor. Extra sessions might take place after school at a central location such as a drop-in centre, at home, or even in supermarkets&#151;I know of one or two examples of that&#151;on a Saturday while their parents do the shopping. They will not duplicate other forms of support on offer, but will offer extra support in a way that works best for pupils and their parents, and will give parents an extra opportunity to be involved in their child's learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="81009h0006.htm_para11"><a name="08100953000199">We expect to release results from the second round of single-level tests to schools shortly, and we will publish an evaluation of the first year of the making good progress pilots later in the autumn. That evaluation will include an assessment of whether the tests functioned well in technical terms, how schools used them, and whether there was any impact on the rest of the curriculum. The Committee was right to recommend that we allow sufficient time for a full pilot of single-level tests, and to ensure that any issues and problems can be addressed before the model is rolled out. That is exactly what we are doing, and we will proceed with a national roll-out only if the tests work and result in improvements for pupils.</p>

 My interest in single-level tests is, as I said earlier, the combination of improved assessment for learning and being able to trust teachers&#146; professional judgment. As I took my drama examinations as a child, I was able to progress at a pace with momentum behind learning. Ultimately, we all want every child to have that momentum and sense of progress in their learning. We are chasing after a testing system that informs that momentum and becomes more personalised in informing that momentum. If we become international pioneers in that, so be it. That would be good.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, we are one year into a three-year pilot study. At the moment, we have not sought to anticipate or shorten the length of that pilot. It would have to show remarkable consistency and success, particularly in the technical issues of test design, to persuade us to shorten it. That is about as far as I can go at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="st_52"><a name="08100953000208"><a name="81009h0006.htm_spnew16"><a name="08100953000328"><b>Mr. Gibb:</b>
 Does the Minister accept that the single-level test will lead to a huge increase in the quantity and frequency of testing in primary schools as they enter children for each level of the test when they feel that a child is ready? Instead of taking one test in year 6, a child could take three tests as they reach levels 3, 4 and 5, and another at level 6 if that is reintroduced.</p>

<p><a name="st_53"><a name="08100953000209"><a name="81009h0006.htm_spnew17"><a name="08100953000329"><b>Jim Knight:</b>
 If an individual progresses through their learning at that pace across all subjects, yes, that might happen. However, although I am optimistic about the future success of the education system in primary schools and elsewhere, it is unlikely that pupils will constantly be taking tests when, on average, we are looking for two levels of progress for each key stage. The crucial thing is the atmosphere around taking the tests. The tests are shorter than the SATs and there is less pressure because the whole class&#151;or cohort&#151;is not taking them at the same time. The tests are a different proposition and teachers will decide the appropriate time to take them&#151;as happens with musical instrument graded examinations and other graded examinations in dance, drama and so on. Indeed, parents might be enthusiastic for the next test to be taken, but it would not be done in the same atmosphere&#151;or with the same high stakes&#151;as an end of key stage test for everybody that is taken on a Tuesday afternoon some time in May.</p>

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="08100953000210"><a name="81009h0006.htm_spnew18"><a name="08100953000330"><b>Mr. Gibb:</b>
 Music exams are quite stressful&#151;for example, when children take their grade 5 piano&#151;and how much pressure is put on children depends on the school. In good, strong primary schools, a lot of pressure is not put on children. However, does the Minister accept that most children will end up taking four tests instead of the existing one because as soon as they are ready for level 3, whatever year they are in, the school will put them in for that test in order to bank the result?</p>

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="08100953000211"><a name="81009h0006.htm_spnew19"><a name="08100953000331"><b>Jim Knight:</b>
 Obviously that is something we will consider in the pilot. We have to examine carefully whether different sorts of gaming, teaching to the test and stress on pupils will be created. We would not want to introduce the tests if those sorts of factors create negative results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="81009h0006.htm_para12"><a name="08100953000212">Whatever changes might or might not happen, we need to answer criticisms about teaching to the test, about which we have heard much today. I noted that my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield said I might have my head in the sand on that particular issue. The latest Ofsted annual report stated:</p>
<a name="81009h0006.htm_brev5"><a name="08100953000269"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;successful schools use assessment well to track pupils&#146; progress, tailor learning for them, and set targets for improvement. In the most effective schools, teachers and pupils often review learning against precise objectives regularly during lessons.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="81009h0006.htm_para13"><a name="08100953000213">That needs to be the rule, not the exception&#151;in all schools, not just the good ones. Schools must support personalised development of pupils at all levels. As I have said, there is a clear place for testing and assessment, but it has to be used in the right way. There will always  <br>

be a certain amount of teaching to the test&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North said as much. When I took my driving test, I was taught to the test, but I was safer on the roads as a result. No parent would question whether their child was well-prepared for a piano exam, which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said was slightly stressful. That is the same shorter, stage not age type of test we have been talking about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="81009h0006.htm_para14"><a name="08100953000214">However, there needs to be a balance. Following the concerns raised by the Committee, Ofsted has recently raised concerns, and we have to take note of that. I have always said that teaching to the test&#151;by which I mean focusing narrowly on assessment to the detriment of other aspects of the curriculum, rather than giving children a rigorous grounding in the core subjects as part of normal lessons so that they can pass tests in those subjects&#151;is unacceptable. We make no apologies for the focus on core subjects; they should be a priority. However, good schools achieve the right balance, and do so not at the expense of the rest of the curriculum, as the hon. Gentleman outlined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="81009h0006.htm_para15"><a name="08100953000215">We are committed to gathering evidence about teaching to the test&#151;as the Committee has recommended&#151;and to exploring how far excessive time is spent on test preparation. School standards advisers are leading on that work, and we will use the evidence to provide guidance to schools, reinforce good practice and re-emphasise the message that excessive time spent on test preparation is unacceptable. It is appropriate that Ofsted should take note of unacceptable test preparation taking place in a school and reflect that in its findings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="81009h0006.htm_para16"><a name="08100953000216">We are already taking action to improve teacher assessment and assessment for learning, which is essential to help teachers to support pupils in the context of more personalised learning. Rigorous assessment and tracking of pupil performance to inform classroom practice is the most common feature of schools that are closing attainment gaps and seeing good progress in their pupils. Some schools are already using assessment for learning effectively. However, for a quarter of schools, ongoing assessment is a key area for improvement. That is why we have developed the assessment for learning strategy, together with the national strategies, the QCA and the Chartered Institute of Educational Assessors. The strategy will support schools in improving their ongoing assessment of each child in their class, and help them to identify strengths and areas where children need to progress. It will also help them to plan their teaching and additional support for pupils accordingly. We are investing &#163;150 million over the next three years in the continuing professional development of school staff in relation to assessment for learning.</p>

 I am only coming back to the Minister on this point because he has not given us a straight answer to what is a pretty simple question. I thought he was saying that the pilots are in the first of three years, which suggests that there would not be any change in 2009 and 2010. If the Government are intent on the existing regime, why can the Minister not just give a simple commitment to keep the key stage 2 and 3 tests in 2009 and 2010? If that is what the Government are going to do, why can we not have some clarity on the matter?</p>

 I cannot add much more. We are reflecting on that matter and have a procurement in place for 2009. If we were going to continue and were not reflecting, we would have simply re-tendered the ETS contract. However, we have not done so because we think it appropriate to have some debate, discussion and reflection on these issues. We are continuing with the pilot, but I am afraid I cannot be any clearer than that.</p>

Assessment is just one part of the system of reviewing pupils&#146; progress. A testing system should be considered in the context of the other reforms we are making: raising the education and training leaving age to 18, the introduction of diplomas, the review of the primary curriculum being carried out by Jim Rose, and the more flexible secondary curriculum that started being taught this September.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="81009h0006.htm_para18"><a name="08100953000226">Our aim is to create a system of fair access, personalisation, and learning that nurtures well-rounded individuals.

We want this country to be the best place in the world for children to grow up, with a world-class education system that offers everyone an equal chance of a successful future, that narrows the attainment gap between the most disadvantaged and the rest, and that develops every child&#146;s unique talents so that they can achieve their full potential.</p>

 With permission, Mr. Williams. That was a much better response to our report than the one that we originally received. I am reasonably pleased that when the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) intervened on the Minister, the Minister refused to take the bait and give us an authoritative and distinctive answer, because we want him to be contemplative and to take the pilot seriously. We want him, during this intervening year, to have the ability to judge whether the time is ripe for change, so I take a very positive view of his remarks.</p>

It is fine going around the world assessing what happens in different countries and saying that they all have national testing. Our report said that we were in favour of national testing, but we were worried about the high-risk nature of the testing, which can mean the end of careers very quickly. A head teacher who gave evidence to us said that he was in a small school in a very disadvantaged area in the centre of London, with a high level of change because of migrants coming in and going out. The statistics on his achievements can change very quickly. If Ofsted comes in during an unlucky year, rather than the next year, his teaching career is over&#151;he will never be a head again.

He may be surprised to learn that the publisher is Civitas&#151;a think-tank with which I am not usually associated. However, I have done a foreword for that group of essays about the change in Ofsted over recent years. The reason I bring that reading to the Minister&#146;s attention is that it contains very good contributions from heads and other experts and teachers about their perception of how short the Ofsted inspection now is&#151;it is one and a half days in reality&#151;and about their fear that too often the only thing they are being judged on is the printout of their results, so that testing and assessment become so much more powerful and daunting for any school. This is about a balance. I recommend that reading to the Minister. I would be very grateful if he were to reflect on it and if we could then have a conversation when he next came to our Committee.</p>
