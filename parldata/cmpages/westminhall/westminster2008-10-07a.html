 As part of Nottingham&#146;s early intervention initiative, our city is leading the way on an anti-drug and alcohol education programme with a &#163;750,000 programme, Drug Aware, that will reach every young person in our city. For about the cost of a year&#146;s intensive treatment for a handful of addicts, we will effectively provide inoculation against drug and alcohol abuse for every child in Nottingham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08100731000011">My challenge to the Minister is that it makes no sense to wait until kids turn into offenders and then use massive amounts of taxpayers&#146; money to fuel expensive and largely ineffective rehabilitation programmes. Late intervention does not work. We should pursue a policy of early intervention, filtering out much earlier those who might drift into abuse so that specialist rehab services can focus on a much smaller hard core. It would be remiss of me not to congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his recent promotion. I am delighted that he has deferred it for a day to answer this debate. I know that the issue is close to his heart. He has been extremely helpful on both the ministerial and the personal level to the initiative that I wish to discuss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08100731000012">History will judge harshly a Government who, after a decade, do not have a nationwide system of drug education in place as the first strong line of defence to protect the nation&#146;s children. We are all aware of the effects that illicit drugs and alcohol can have on individuals, families and communities, and none of us is more so than the Minister, who helped Nottingham start its drug education journey when he was a humble junior Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08100731000013">On health, alcohol-related deaths have doubled since 1979, and last year in Nottingham there were 4,000 alcohol- related attendances at accident and emergency departments. On crime, the Home Office states that up to three quarters of crack and heroin users claim that they commit crime to feed their habit. There are about 3,000 problem users in my city, and the city council estimates that drug-related crime costs the city more than &#163;300 million a year. On the economy, the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit estimates the annual cost of harms associated with alcohol misuse alone to be more than &#163;15 billion, and the treatment charity Addaction found in a recently produced briefing report that the social and economic costs of drug misuse to the nation total more than &#163;28 billion annually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08100731000014">Such deep-rooted problems are not amenable to one-off campaigns, however well-meaning. They require decades of education to bring about cultural change. That is why it is everyone&#146;s problem and every party&#146;s issue. As I hope is shown in my recent publication, &#147;Early Intervention&#148;, co-authored with the right hon. Member  <br>

for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith), social and political consensus is vital. I welcome the Conservative and Liberal representatives as well as those of the Government to this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08100731000015">Alcohol misuse and drug misuse have a particular impact on young people, as they are directly and indirectly associated with youth offending, higher levels of school exclusion and teenage pregnancies. In Nottingham, our definition of early intervention is intervention that helps break the intergenerational cycle. A drug and alcohol awareness programme classically meets that test. Children of problem drug users and drinkers experience more behavioural and emotional problems and are more likely to develop problems with drugs and alcohol themselves. Let us break that intergenerational cycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08100731000016">For that reason, Nottingham, particularly its local strategic partnership One Nottingham, which I have the privilege to chair, sees a comprehensive drug and alcohol filter as an early intervention priority. Our lead partnership is the crime and drugs partnership, but as the Minister has seen at first hand, all the other partnerships, especially the children&#146;s partnership, have made it their problem too. The crime and drugs partnership, or CDP, has been highly successful in reducing crime in the city. Between 2003 and 2008, it exceeded Government targets&#151;and, more importantly, our expectations&#151;in reducing crime by 26 per cent. I pay tribute to Derek Stewart, the CDP&#146;s chair, its chief executive Alan Given and their team for their superb work. They know more than anyone that our priority must be to move a step up towards education and early intervention if such figures are to continue being pressed down and not to plateau.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08100731000017">Although common sense tells us that prevention is better than cure, the idea often seems to baffle those at the national level. Saving 100 kids from going wrong is harder to measure and express in box ticks than putting one person into rehab. One chief constable in Nottinghamshire told me that when he defended a drug education programme, he was asked by the Home Office, &#147;How many burglars does it catch?&#148; There are those who have enormous and vocal vested interests in late intervention, with millions of pounds and lots of personnel to defend. They have populated local policy-making machines and those in Whitehall to such an extent that to break their stranglehold will require a Minister&#151;perhaps a Minister of State&#151;with unique determination, a quality that my hon. Friend possesses in abundance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08100731000018">Drug treatment strategy and funding seem to be predicated on an unwavering supply of new entrants to the drug treatment system. Some 2,173 people underwent drug treatment last year in Nottingham. Perversely, we are congratulated on having more people in rehab. Surely the objective of a comprehensive and rounded policy should be &#147;Fewer abusers, better treated&#148;. The total cost to the Government of those in treatment in Nottingham is about &#163;7 million a year. According to the Department of Health, treatment alone costs the UK &#163;597 million a year nationally, yet the BBC reported last week that only 3 per cent. of addicts finish treatment drug-free. The strategy is to have fleets of gold-plated ambulances at the bottom of the cliff instead of a simple wooden fence at the top. I challenge the Minister to join me in rejecting that strategic approach. There  are clear benefits, including massive financial savings, to filtering out most potential abuse early by providing   <br>

volume education and prevention programmes, identifying young people at risk of problem drug use and targeting effective prevention work at them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08100731000019">Evidence shows that balanced, accurate drug education can be a factor in countering peer group pressure or delaying the onset of casual drug use. Moralistic or scare approaches are likely to be ineffective, and the threat of criminal sanctions and jail simply does not prevent large numbers of young people from misusing drugs. However, most drug education in UK schools is patchy, confused and inconsistent. It comes under personal health and social education provision, which is neither a statutory subject nor a specialist area in initial teacher education. It may not matter in leafy suburbs, but in poorly parented areas such as my constituency, learning effective life skills at school, including anti-drug awareness, is an essential foundation for many who, sadly, do not get such education at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08100731000020">We seem to have a command economy for rehab but a laissez-faire approach to prevention. Whatever we do in Nottingham, only national Government can make it happen on the scale necessary to cut off the supply of those abusing drugs. It is crucial to provide good-quality drug education whose purpose is clearly understood and whose quality is measured locally and nationally through independent inspection. Accurate and effective information and guidance for young people are key to ensuring that they never try drugs in the first place. Higher Government standards relating to the quality and coverage of drug education are therefore also required.</p>
<a name="08100731000432">
<p>Crucially, the importance of drug education must be part of a wider educational framework. It is impossible to inoculate young people against drug misuse with just a few hours of drug education. Drug education programmes can no more stand alone than can teenage pregnancy programmes, aspiration programmes to improve educational attainment or behavioural programmes. They must be one part of broader life skills education to raise social and emotional literacy, particularly among 11 to 16-year-olds, and to build on the excellent social and emotional aspects of learning programme&#151;SEAL&#151;in primary schools. That will require a Minister to take responsibility for much better joining up between the Home Office and the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08100731000021">One Nottingham&#146;s mission is about early intervention. With our partnerships in health, children&#146;s services and crime and drugs, we are implementing universal and targeted drug and alcohol education. That includes health promotion campaigns targeted at parents of young people to enable them to develop parental responsibility for their children&#146;s drinking and drug abuse, early intervention to prevent the onset of youth drug misuse, and the healthy schools initiative. The majority of Nottingham schools have achieved full &#147;healthy school&#148; status and 76 per cent. have met the programme&#146;s drugs and alcohol standard, which includes having drug education programmes embedded in the curriculum. Schools are also required to refer pupils requiring early intervention to the appropriate services. Last year 15 pupils were referred to treatment, and many more are now receiving targeted support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08100731000022">The Drug Aware award will take our efforts to the next level, and in July One Nottingham agreed and awarded funding of &#163;256,000 for each of the next three  <br>

years. I believe that Drug Aware is the first of its kind in the UK, and is based on a theoretical model in the recent Government research programme, Blueprint, which looked at 23 secondary schools in the north-west and east midlands. Furthermore, the Government&#146;s new 10-year drug strategy, &#147;Drugs: Protecting Families and Communities&#148;, sets the framework in which we will implement Drug Aware.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08100731000023">Drug Aware is also a multi-component drug and alcohol initiative and sets a standard of excellence for universal drug education for all pupils, and for targeted early intervention for pupils identified as &#147;at risk&#148;. Drug Aware will ensure that every pupil in our city receives a comprehensive programme of universal drug education from the age of five to 16 that is appropriate to the age level; provide a brand that everybody in our city, including parents and the media, can identify with; ensure effective screening of drug abuse and risks of drug misuse among young people; provide targeted intervention for &#147;at risk&#148; pupils, including improved referral to specialist services and interventions within the school by trained staff; engage parents much more fully in both policy making and drugs education, and develop closer partnership working with communities and among the police, police community support officers, wardens and local alcohol retailers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08100731000024">By extending the parameters of drugs education outside the school setting, Drug Aware will facilitate a more cohesive early intervention response embedded within families and communities, which should help maximise its impact. Drug Aware goes further than Blueprint by providing earlier identification of vulnerable young people and better targeted interventions for vulnerable and &#147;at risk&#148; groups. Once a school has met all the required standards, it will receive the Drug Aware award. That standard has to be sustained by the school and its community on a long-term basis and be subject to ongoing assessment and review by the healthy schools team. The ambition in my city is that Drug Aware, across all schools, will result in every pupil in the city receiving a comprehensive universal drug education programme from the age of five to 16, and effective targeted early intervention for those in need. That is some ambition, but we will realise it over the next three years.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is making many sensible and intelligent points. However, does he not think that the programme that he is supporting will find it much more difficult to be effective and successful while fighting against a culture in the chattering classes that accepts the taking of coke at dinner parties and a judicial system that allows pop stars to get away with taking very hard drugs with impunity?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a serious and sensible point, and speaks from his experience as a council leader in a big city. It does not help if role models of the wrong sort continue to make the bad headlines to which he referred. We are trying to change the minds of young people, particularly those from homes where parenting standards might not be of the highest level&#151;incidentally, that is another aspect that the early intervention programme in Nottingham is trying to tackle&#151;and provide them with the right  <br>

foundations so that they can say no to drugs and drink abuse. However, we are not helped when those youngsters see people on television and in the newspapers providing different, poorer examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08100731000027">In order to make the initiative work, however, we need to embed our Drug Aware programme in schools. In order to achieve Drug Aware status, our schools and their communities are required to meet set criteria consisting of five components: first, in schools, targeted early interventions are to be provided through four educational link workers and referrals to specialist services, including the identification and support of children affected by parental drug and alcohol abuse; the implementation of a specific drug education scheme of work; local assessment of young people through the Engage drugs project to identify substance use issues and targeted interventions; and Drug Aware, which will identify the external providers most effective at engaging with young people on substance abuse for schools to select from. Secondly, parents have a role, too. We intend to ensure that schools provide parent training sessions and workshops; that parents are fully involved in setting drug and alcohol policy through task groups; and that the appropriate literature is available to parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08100731000028">Thirdly, the media need to be a part of this&#151;and they will be&#151;and we hope that they will celebrate schools that achieve the Drug Aware award. The Minister will know of the excellent work done by the <i>Nottingham Evening Post</i> in our own locality in publicising the Dare scheme, which is a very important local drug education scheme. We hope that the profile achieved by Dare can be continued through the Drug Aware award. Fourthly, within the community, each school must be actively involved in devising local drugs and alcohol campaigns, graduations for each year of drugs curriculum completed and out-of-school diversionary activities. Finally, on policy, we must involve young people, parents, schools, local retailers and the police, all of whom should, and will, be consulted by the CDP through policy-setting task groups both inside and outside the classroom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08100731000029">What can be learned from our experience? In pioneering Drug Aware education in an early intervention context, I hope that a number of lessons will be learned. Drug education must be part of a wider strategy. Drug problems are often the result of multiple disadvantages, including those experienced by individuals who are part of &#147;at risk&#148; families, especially where parents or siblings are drug abusers; truanting and offending; living in neighbourhoods where drugs are readily available; self-medicating to alleviate an unhappy home life; and physical or emotional abuse. At the core of any effective prevention or intervention strategy for problem drug use must be a strong commitment to tackle its causes and context, which is why our educational approach fits into the early intervention package that we are pioneering in the city of Nottingham. It will develop the social and emotional capabilities to tackle the underlying causes of the intergenerational cycle that manifests itself in so many symptoms, such as drug and drink abuse, teenage pregnancy and low educational attainment, that afflict constituencies such as mine.</p>

 I am pleased that my hon. Friend has referred to alcohol and drug education, but tobacco appears to be missing from the Nottingham education package&#151;perhaps I am wrong  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Oct 2008">

to assume that that is the case. Tobacco is the first point of addiction for many young people; is it included in the package?</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="08100731000031"><a name="81007h0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="08100731000490"><b>Mr. Allen:</b>
 There is a limit to what can be covered in one debate, and I do not wish to run over time. However, I should like to reassure my hon. Friend that in pursuing an early-intervention package, One Nottingham funds several anti-tobacco initiatives, including efforts to prevent people from smoking. I have some notes on the alcohol part of the drug and alcohol awareness strategy, but I have had to skip over them rather quickly. However, both those addictive substances are definitely on the agenda, and they are being covered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08100731000032">Another issue that others could learn about from Nottingham is collaborative working. Partnership is a much abused word, but I hope that we in Nottingham have proved that community involvement, partnerships and collaborative working&#151;whichever phrase one likes to use&#151;are not just add-ons that are nice to have, but are essential. Just as we have said that crime is too important to be left to the police, so drug education and the tackling of drug problems are too important to be left to enforcement or to the health services. This issue is everyone&#146;s problem, and I hope that we show that in what we do locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08100731000033">We need to ensure that substance misuse training is embedded in all mainstream services, so that everyone has the right set of skills. The Drug Aware award is a fine example of something encompassing all our local partners&#151;the local NHS, the city council, criminal justice agencies, the alcohol industry, trading standards, children&#146;s services, the fire service, both of Nottingham&#146;s universities and the Nottingham business improvement district. A vast array of people is committed to making this policy work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08100731000034">Data tracking is another important issue that One Nottingham and the Drug Aware effort will highlight. We need more localised and up-to-date data collection if the early intervention package is to be effective, not least on drug misuse and teenage pregnancy. Drug misuse trends, patterns and hotspots are identified through data collection and fed back to partner agencies through the crime and drugs partnership&#146;s tackling violent crime group. In addition, a new data collection system has been introduced at our hospital&#146;s accident and emergency department to collect data on attendances for assault to help the CDP and police to identify hotspots for alcohol-related violent crime in particular and to enhance the intelligence base for enforcement action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08100731000035">However, the CDP has encountered data-tracking obstacles in its work at a local level. We have repeatedly had to make do with national statistics from general household and national alcohol consumption surveys, for example. That gap in local data sources means that it is more difficult to develop a localised, let alone personalised, solution to the problem. Of course, there must be safeguards, but there must also be a greater commitment to putting data to work at regional and local levels. I have asked the Minister to consider establishing a troubleshooting unit at national level to cut through some of the unintended consequences, misapplication and mythology around data protection, which might become every bureaucracy&#146;s favourite excuse if we are not careful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para22"><a name="08100731000036">We must develop 11 to 16-year-olds&#146; key social and emotional capabilities as a backdrop to tackling symptoms such as drug and alcohol abuse, low educational attainment and high levels of antisocial behaviour and teenage pregnancy. The Home Office must reach out to the Department for Children, Schools and Families and make a strong case for a statutory requirement on all schools to provide Life Skills 11-16, including modules on drug abuse and teenage pregnancy, and that should be covered in Ofsted assessments of schools&#146; performance. I am committed to trying that in my constituency, and I hope that the local strategic partnership, One Nottingham, will consider funding such a proposal throughout our city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para23"><a name="08100731000037">Local entrepreneurship, however, is no substitute for national policy led by a committed Minister. In addition, there must be a clear Government commitment to building drug education into mainstream teacher training, through both initial teacher training and continuing professional development. Finally, there must be consistent resources for universal drug education. Locally, One Nottingham is funding the Drug Aware award for three years; when it has proved itself, it will be taken over by mainstream providers. Nationally, Government must insist that every locality does something similar. Local agencies could easily fund this if a Minister made a case to the Treasury proposing that they keep half the proceeds of every drug rehab place saved. Treasury rules and civilisation as we know it might fall apart at such a suggestion, but let us incentivise people to invest in education, rather than pay the massive continuing costs of rehabilitating a smaller number of individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="81007h0001.htm_para24"><a name="08100731000038">In conclusion, we in Nottingham have worked with the grain of Government thinking in bringing forward our Drug Aware policy, which we believe is a state-of-the-art effort within the United Kingdom. The Government now need to look at the plethora of schemes nationwide and promote a model drug education scheme that can be adapted for use in every part of the UK. Nottingham&#146;s Drug Aware programme might be the forerunner of such a scheme. If the Minister, my friend, sets that guidance rolling in his last act as a junior Minister, he will save billions of pounds and thousands of wasted lives, and will have the understanding and thanks of every parent in the land.</p>

They understand, in a way that many parents and some MPs do not&#151;indeed, I did not, until recently&#151;the pressure that kids today are under regarding drugs. I shall come to that in a moment, and to kids&#146; attitude to drugs. Those pressures are massive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para2"><a name="08100731000042">Richard and Ian wanted &#163;550 to buy a drug awareness kit, a drug demonstration box and some DVDs, so that they could use them in schools and make their activity there more effective. I wrote to the Minister and tabled early-day motion 1283, which is in the Library pack for today&#146;s debate. The EDM states that</p>
<a name="81007h0002.htm_brev0"><a name="08100731000433"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;such charities receive little or no funding from Government sources; and calls on the Government to fund preventative drugs programmes such as that provided by Thundersley Congregational Church.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para3"><a name="08100731000043">I am sorry to say that no Members taking part in the debate signed the early-day motion, but that is probably because it was localised in respect of Thundersley Congregational church.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para4"><a name="08100731000044">I got nowhere with obtaining the cash, so I got off my butt and held for the church yet another charity event&#151;the third in two years&#151;to raise money to buy the kit. We had a curry night at the Tandoori Parlour, a superb Indian restaurant, on Hart road, and we raised &#163;1,100 clear profit, so we were able to buy the kit and to do more as well. The kit is now in good use. The drug display box and DVDs were obtained from the south-east Essex drugs partnership, headed by Ray Hatter, a professional and helpful guy who could do with more money. If he had more money, he could do more work, prevent more human suffering and save on costs to society in the long run. I see that the Minister is making notes; Hatter is spelt H-A-T-T-E-R. Actually, we are lucky to have such a superb Minister with us this morning, and I congratulate him on his promotion, which is long overdue. He is one of the best, most caring and able-to-listen Ministers in the House, and on this sensitive area of drugs and preventive measures he has always done all that he can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para5"><a name="08100731000045">As I speak, Richard and Ian are at the Deanes school, speaking to a year 9 group of 13-year-olds and taking a lesson on drugs. Yesterday, they were doing drug awareness work at a secondary school in my constituency, where they got a superb response from the youngsters. When a class of about 30 children was asked whether anyone had been offered drugs, taken drugs or been aware of anybody in their peer group who  <br>

had taken drugs, about 50 per cent. put their hands up, and some gave examples. It is a massive problem in my locality, which is relatively crime-free and clean. A few kids go through problems growing up, but broadly speaking, in my constituency the young people are fantastic and decent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para6"><a name="08100731000046">I warmly congratulate Thundersley Congregational church, and Richard and Ian in particular, on what they are doing. Clearly, Richard and Ian could not do their work without the support of the whole church, and the Minister knows where I am leading now: just a small sum to support voluntary organisations could be very effective. I am sure that the message will get back to the Home Office. We need more flexibility to provide small grants, because &#163;500 here or &#163;500 there&#151;used properly, particularly where people have specific knowledge of the disaster that drugs can cause families and society&#151;could be very effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para7"><a name="08100731000047">Finally, I shall make three brief points. First, the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) rightly raised the issue of smoking, particularly among teenage girls, which is not a problem that is going away. We must tackle it and address it more firmly if we can, particularly through parents, schools and education. Secondly, we need more residential drug rehabilitation places to allow people who are afflicted by drugs to change their lives. We will not do so without dramatically increasing the number of such places, and it would be a very cost-effective use of money. I see the Minister nodding. Thirdly, we need tougher action both to stop drugs getting into prisons and to deal with prisoners who are on drugs and end their addiction; otherwise, they will simply be in a revolving door. I know that the Minister agrees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08100731000048">I congratulate the Minister and the Government on what they have done in respect of drugs over the past few years, because they have been moving in the right direction. I am not being picky; I just wish that we had a little more flexibility to divert some of the funds to voluntary organisations.</p>

 I, too, congratulate the Minister on his promotion, but I shall keep my congratulations short, otherwise his head may swell from all the praise that he has received, and I do not want him to disappoint us when he responds. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) on making a compelling case for early intervention. No doubt he could supply figures proving that investment in early-years education has a long-term benefit but, equally, the investment that he described will pay dividends in the longer term. Clearly, he has drawn extensively on his wide experience in Nottingham and of One Nottingham, and he has highlighted the importance of partnership. Partnership&#151;the local authority working with the police, the voluntary sector or the health service locally&#151;is the way to tackle the issue, whether it is drugs or, for instance, obesity, because all local bodies must be involved. We will hear when the Minister responds whether he thinks that the balance between early intervention and rehabilitation is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08100731000050">I also congratulate the hon.

are limited and likely to become more constrained in the next few years, so as we face difficult financial times, the voluntary sector&#146;s role is likely to grow rather than to shrink.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08100731000051">I hope that all Members agree that, currently, the approach to tackling drugs and alcohol abuse is not working as effectively as it could. It neither deters people from drug use or excessive alcohol consumption nor ensures effective education and treatment. This is in spite of the fact that, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the UK has one of the highest levels of drug use in Europe and one of the most punitive approaches towards drugs. The statistics, some of which the hon. Member for Castle Point referred to, are quite horrendous: half of all 16-year-olds have tried an illegal drug; one third of 16 to 24-year-olds have used an illegal drug in the past year; there are 270,000 problem drug users in the UK; and the average age of heroin users is going down in the UK, as opposed to up in other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08100731000052">If anyone is in any doubt about the cost involved, I recommend doing what I have done in the past couple of months, which is to go to my local magistrates court, sit alongside first, the magistrates, to see how they deal with cases, and then, the Crown Prosecution Service prosecutors, to look at the cases before the courts and to make a mental note of how many involved drugs or alcohol. The overwhelming majority of cases that I saw and listened to involved drugs or alcohol as a major component of, or contributor to, the offences under discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para12"><a name="08100731000053">The Government have taken some positive steps. We welcome their approach in &#147;Drugs: Protecting Families and Communities&#148;, the 10-year strategy with an action plan to tackle the first three years, and its focus on mainstreaming prevention. That is what we are talking about today: education. We support most of what the Government are doing, as do other organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08100731000054">I have just mentioned the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. It described the UK approach positively. It looks across Europe to find how different countries are tackling drugs and welcomes the fact that there is a focus on better education and intervention for young people and families, especially those who are most at risk, which means targeting those who need help the most. It commends programmes such as FRANK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para14"><a name="08100731000055">However, on schools&#151;this was a point made earlier by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North&#151;the centre goes on to say:</p>
<a name="81007h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="08100731000434"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Throughout most of the United Kingdom, drug prevention is part of the national curriculum and most schools have a drug education policy and guidelines on dealing with drug incidents.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para15"><a name="08100731000056">One must ask, &#147;Why not all schools?&#148; as opposed to &#147;most&#148; schools. If some schools are not willing to engage in that process, perhaps there needs to be a statutory requirement so that they do engage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para16"><a name="08100731000057">It is also very clear that young people want this education. Recently, I have had discussions with my youth parliament, the Sutton Youth Parliament, which I meet on a regular basis. It is about to conduct a survey of local school pupils to find out what they think about drug and alcohol education, as well as sex education, in schools. I am sure that those pupils will want more information on drugs rather than less and that they will want a consistency of education provided across all  <br>

schools in the borough, rather than a pick-and-mix approach that leaves some children very vulnerable because they are not receiving the level of education that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para17"><a name="08100731000058">The rather patchy approach in schools, which the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has identified, could equally have been highlighted with regard to prisons. The latest annual report by the chief inspector of prisons, which was published in January, examined substance use in prisons. It said:</p>
<a name="81007h0002.htm_brev2"><a name="08100731000435"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Substance use strategies were very variable. Where there was a regular needs analysis, services were well coordinated and comprehensive. Conversely, where there was not, services tended to be fragmented and failed to meet prisoners&#146; needs.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08100731000059">The report went on to say that the prisons not doing the needs analysis</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08100731000061">The report also said:</p>
<a name="81007h0002.htm_brev5"><a name="08100731000438"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Many prisons had insufficient resources for counselling, referral, assessment and throughcare... teams&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para21"><a name="08100731000062">Finally, it said:</p>
<a name="81007h0002.htm_brev6"><a name="08100731000439"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We came across only one example of an integrated alcohol strategy, developed in partnership with the community, which was on the Isle of Wight.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para22"><a name="08100731000063">Clearly, education provision in prisons is patchy at the moment, and the Government need to address that. I believe that the 10-year strategy is trying to improve the level of provision, and I hope that the strategy will ensure that there is much more consistency in the education and support available in prisons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para23"><a name="08100731000064">We support other initiatives that are being promoted, including the national tackling drugs week. I wonder if the Minister is in a position to say whether any assessment has been carried out of the effectiveness of that campaign and how many partnerships were participating in it. Furthermore, can he demonstrate that it is an initiative that is making a very positive contribution, perhaps in raising the profile of best practice in tackling drugs?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para24"><a name="08100731000065">I have already referred to FRANK, the Government&#146;s national drug awareness campaign. Since its launch, FRANK has had some significant successes. For example, it has responded to 740,000 telephone calls and just under 50,000 e-mails, and its website has received a considerable number of hits. Again, however, although the raw statistics are impressive, I would like to hear from the Minister whether any comparisons have been made between FRANK and other types of information systems, to establish whether we are achieving best value in relation to those systems and delivering the best possible communication and information services for people who wish to access information about drugs, whether they are young people themselves or, indeed, their parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para25"><a name="08100731000066">From a Liberal Democrat point of view, I would like to make a couple more points about where we think there is perhaps a need for greater focus. Certainly we would like the Government&#146;s policy to be evidence-based. We disagree with the Government about their attitude to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. It is a body with experts in a range of fields who are examining the issue of drugs, hopefully in an impartial, independent  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Oct 2008">

<notus-date day="7" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>7 Oct 2008 : Column 12WH</b><br>
and professional way. Those experts are coming up with conclusions that we think it would be appropriate for the Government to take on board, but in fact the Government are being selective about which of those conclusions they take on board and which ones they dismiss. It is wrong for a Government not to ensure that the actions they are taking are very much evidence-based, and the evidence that that body has put forward&#151;for instance in relation to cannabis and what it thinks the classification of cannabis should be&#151;is quite clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para26"><a name="08100731000067">Drug misuse is very much a public health issue. The focus should be on education, as the hon. Member for Nottingham, North said. However, if the education process has not worked or if it is too late in the day for education, rehabilitation is required. The police resources that we have available to bring to bear on this issue should be focused very much on dealers and organised crime. The law must be credible and it must be tough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para27"><a name="08100731000068">I must use this opportunity to raise what is perhaps a parochial issue, although I suspect that there are many Members&#151;if not among those who are here today, then among Members elsewhere in the House&#151;who are affected by it, and it is that of head shops. For those Members who are not in the know, those are shops that sell drugs paraphernalia, and there a number of them up and down the country. There is one in my constituency, although I understand it is going to shut temporarily so that it can sell fireworks instead. I am not saying that selling fireworks is an improvement, but in any case it will revert to being a head shop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para28"><a name="08100731000069">There is clearly a huge inconsistency when cannabis is illegal&#151;we can argue about the classification of it, but it is an illegal drug&#151;but there are shops that are in the business of promoting and selling the materials that people need to consume it. From an educational point of view, I am very worried that we are saying to the children who go to the primary school just around the corner from that shop or those who go to the secondary school just down the road from it, &#147;Drugs are something you should avoid&#148; and &#147;Drugs are bad&#148; and so on, but they can then walk round the corner and see a shop&#151;or they can see into it, because the door is always left open&#151;and, because there is nothing illegal about what the shop is doing, they can then go in. There is no age limit on entering that shop, so a 10-year-old can go in and could buy anything on display. There is thus a huge inconsistency and it risks undoing all the good educational work in this sphere: we say drugs are bad, but people can go around the corner and see a shop that is selling what they need to enable them to consume drugs. That inconsistency must be cleared up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para29"><a name="08100731000070">I have had a meeting with Tim Hollis, the chief constable who is leading on this issue, and I will seek a meeting with the Home Office official who is dealing with the legal side&#151;the legislation to establish whether it is possible, either under existing legislation or, if necessary, through new legislation, to address this matter.</p>

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="08100731000071"><a name="81007h0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="08100731000493"><b>Mr. Allen:</b>
 I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s arguments very closely. I would just like to go back, if I may, to the issues of assessment and evaluation. They take place at two levels. First, there is evaluation of what is done locally, and it is even more important that that evaluation is scientific and clear when there is a plethora of schemes operating in lots of different localities. I therefore hope that the Home Office might consider  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Oct 2008">

finding a way it could help people to evaluate effectively how the schemes are being implemented. In particular, if people are pioneering a scheme, as we are in Nottingham, I hope that the Home Office will consider helping at that local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para30"><a name="08100731000072">Secondly, there is assessment of what policies are effective. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider joining those of us who feel that the situation here is rather like that which existed in the United States, where there were more than 600 different policies on drug education, bullying, early intervention and so on. The US Department of Justice then asked a university to rank those policies order so that there would be a small group of policies, so that people who wished to pick up on those policies and do something effective could go to one source and have a national policy assessment centre to find which policies were most effective. I think that all parties could agree on having a similar source of information at the national level here&#151;one which recommended the best of all the policies being experimented with.</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="08100731000073"><a name="81007h0002.htm_spnew2"><a name="08100731000494"><b>Tom Brake:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention and entirely agree with him. It is indeed difficult for organisations to assess the range and variety of schemes in operation, which run from the individual who operates a scheme on a shoestring&#151;a few thousand pounds a year&#151;through to large national programmes that are funded with tens of millions of pounds. There is a need for assessment, and the same need has been identified in respect of projects that deal with knife crime. Again, a similar range of projects exists, but because there has been no real independent assessment of them, we are unable to judge which of them represent value for money. I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para31"><a name="08100731000074">I shall bring my remarks to a conclusion in the next minute or so. I have focused much of what I have said on drugs as opposed to alcohol, but many of the concerns about drugs education apply equally to alcohol, particularly alcohol education in schools or, more precisely, the lack of any real education on the subject. There are the same concerns about the law and its credibility. That supermarkets are allowed to sell alcohol as a loss leader&#151;below cost price&#151;must change, and I hope that the Government will ensure that that happens swiftly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para32"><a name="08100731000075">There are solutions out there. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is familiar with the St. Neots project in Cambridgeshire, which involves everybody, including schools and off-licences, in a real partnership to tackle the alcohol problem. The partnership has resulted in a massive fall in problems associated with alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="81007h0002.htm_para33"><a name="08100731000076">Progress is being made on tackling drugs and alcohol abuse, but the Minister must respond to the challenge from the hon. Member for Nottingham, North about early intervention being neglected and rehabilitation being wrongly prioritised. We want the Minister to set out an action plan that will address the patchy drugs and alcohol education in our schools and prisons. If he can do so convincingly, he will undoubtedly receive our support.</p>

publication, &#147;Early Intervention: Good Parents, Great Kids, Better Citizens&#148;, which he co-authored with my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) and which makes some provocative points about the direction of policy. It has certainly provided me with interesting bed-time reading and some thoughts and ideas on the emphasis that might, and should, be made, and on where things are going wrong regarding the direction of policy from the centre. We must look at the importance of local initiatives, and how the arrangement between the two could be more effectively structured. I shall deal with that in further detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="81007h0003.htm_para0"><a name="08100731000078">I congratulate the Minister on his promotion to the new challenges of policing and security. In all my dealings with him, he has always been prepared to listen to, if not agree with, the points that I have made to him. I have always found the way in which he has conducted ministerial business fair-minded and honourable. I wish him well, as I suspect that those qualities will be well tested in his new role and function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="81007h0003.htm_para1"><a name="08100731000079">The emphasis of today&#146;s debate is very much on prevention and the need to address intergenerational issues, which are important, as is the stress on partnership working, however we define it. Much good work is taking place in communities up and down the country. It is important to recognise and appreciate that, but the hon. Member for Nottingham, North made an important point about the need for informed choices and better assessment so that local communities and authorities that seek to commission services or assess their policies have a much better toolkit, framework and guide for assessing their existing approaches and approaches have proved successful elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="81007h0003.htm_para2"><a name="08100731000080">We cannot prescribe some top-down solution. We cannot say, &#147;We prescribe from the centre that this will happen, and therefore it will work in your community.&#148; It is perhaps that emphasis that has been the mistake in recent years. We must recognise that the effectiveness of a solution in one community may not necessarily and automatically be replicated in other communities. There is a need for localisation. At the same time, we must recognise the things that are working and consider why and how they are working and the lessons and messages from them.</p>

The use of class A drugs alone generates an estimated &#163;15 billion in economic and social costs, which is why the emphasis of today&#146;s debate on prevention is important. However, one cannot look at it in isolation. The emphasis should not be just on prevention but on enforcement and rehabilitation as well. The question is the balance to be struck between each of those strands.</p>

Parents are key if we are to address the issues that we have debated and discussed today. We must support them properly and give them the information that they need, but, equally, there must be a focus on rehabilitation.

3 per cent. of people leaving those treatment programmes drug-free. Drug users who seek treatment and services say that they want to be drug-free: they want to be able to abstain and to get support, which is why the emphasis of policy must move in that direction and not simply be badged as harm reduction, which in many ways merely means holding people in addiction by switching them from an illegal substance to a legal one to modify or control their behaviour. It simply cannot be right to hold people in addiction by, for example, keeping them on methadone. The cost of such prescriptions is rising every year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="81007h0003.htm_para5"><a name="08100731000083">Early intervention is important, because the age at which young children now use alcohol and illicit drugs is shocking. It is getting lower and lower, and that is one of the most disturbing trends that we see. Seventeen per cent. of schoolchildren aged between 11 and 15 have used an illegal drug in the past year. We are seeing an increase in prescriptions for anti-psychotic drugs among teenagers, and class A drug use has not really budged at all in the 16-to-24 age group. Another important issue is binge drinking and alcohol. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North, my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green, and the Centre for Social Justice highlighted the effects of binge drinking among 10 and 11-year-olds, who admit going out and getting drunk on a regular basis. Younger and younger children are doing so, which is why messaging is so important. I heard what the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) said about the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, but we cannot simply delegate responsibility to the ACMD.</p>

I hope that the Minister will update us on what progress has been made on implementation. I disagree with the potential reclassification of ecstasy, which would downgrade it, because that would send out strong messages suggesting that it is somehow a more acceptable drug, whatever evidence the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs may bring to bear on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="81007h0003.htm_para7"><a name="08100731000085">I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to FRANK, which is a key part of the Government&#146;s 10-year prevention strategy, which was launched in 2003. FRANK provides information, advice and guidance to young people in relation to drugs. However, I question some of the approaches that are being taken. For example, the FRANK website says some things about the effects of cannabis, but there is no mention of psychotic episodes, paranoia and all those mental health issues that are attached to cannabis. The information that is provided therefore needs to be clearer and much more robust. Prevention has to be the watchword in all of this. I appreciate that early intervention goes much further than prevention, but prevention must still be at the forefront in the approaches taken on information and education. We bandy around the words, &#147;harm reduction&#148;, but I am entirely unconvinced that people understand what that term means. Prevention is a much more understandable concept in respect of what we are trying to achieve in all this and it is a better form of road-marking to signpost the direction of preventive policy on drugs.</p>

Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) is in the Chamber, because I paid an interesting visit to the Bolton drug treatment service in his constituency. I was interested to hear about the approach adopted by that service, particularly its use of outcome-based measures: in other words, looking at the results of things, rather than simply measuring inputs and box ticking, which, sadly, has been the approach taken by many services, not just those dealing with drugs, but other public services around the country. One of the things that struck me&#151;the people working there were rightly proud of it&#151;was that information on cocaine use was being putting across to provide better signposts to treatment for people addicted to it. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East is aware of the problems locally in respect of mixing cocaine and alcohol, and knows about some of the tragic deaths resulting from polyaddiction&#151;the mixture of those two substances together&#151;and what that has meant for so many people. He will also be aware of the question of how to get people into treatment. The Bolton drug treatment service has effectively set up its own website, because those involved thought that the information was not out there on the effects of cocaine and what might happen if cocaine is combined with alcohol. I congratulate those involved on that initiative.</p>

 I am aware of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s visit to Bolton, and I thank him for informing me that he was coming. I have had a full report of his visit. However, while he was there, did the Bolton drug and alcohol team explain Project 360, which is seeks early intervention for children from broken families, and tries to weld those families back together again and do something about the young person&#146;s abuse of substances?</p>

 Yes, it did. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention and for making that point clear. I was interested to see some of the good practice that that team is putting into effect through different strands of work. I welcome its approach on early intervention and its focus on abstinence-based rehabilitation, which is at the core of its work. There are a number of different strands of intervention. The team uses an outcome-based approach, which has led it down the route of early intervention to try to improve people&#146;s life chances. That further example of a practical approach supplements the examples in his own city given by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North in his opening speech.</p>

I should like to question the Minister about the approaches that have been taken, because there are large gaps in the provision allowing people to access services and signposting the way to treatment. That came through loud and clear from the Bolton drug treatment service: those involved thought that there was a lack of information, which prevented people from getting help, even when they wanted to go down that path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="81007h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08100731000091">We have heard a lot about education, and I agree with hon. Members that it is patchy at the moment. Parents are not a strong enough part of the process of education within schools; they need to be engaged much more. This theme comes through in the Government&#146;s 10-year strategy. I remain to be convinced about how that strategy will be implemented and what it will mean. Some of the materials and approaches that have been taken are somewhat confusing. They do not engage parents enough in the whole process, they do not equip them to deal with problems that they see at home and do not support them.</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman has made a valid point. I visited the south west last year and talked to some youth workers. I asked them why parents do not support their youngsters in getting treatment or better education. Sadly, one worker said&#151;their reply summed it up for me&#151;&#147;Well, doing that and seeing their children doing better would make their lives even worse.&#148; That was a stark statement about how some communities, whatever the debate may be about, are quite broken. We need to look at early intervention and consider how we can break the intergenerational problems that have been highlighted this morning. However, that does not detract from the essential need to give support and information to parents who want to be good parents and want to see their children do better, while recognising that there is a small cohort who take the more negative view that has, sadly, been relayed to me and to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="81007h0003.htm_para12"><a name="08100731000094">We have to put education in a wider perspective. I had the pleasure of visiting the St. Neots community alcohol partnership earlier this year, where I heard how education was being bound into the process. Talking to the kids who had been through the educational programmes, I saw how the process built links and brought together retailers, the police, trading standards agencies and drug awareness charities in a whole approach. That was a good lesson to learn. Certainly, I will monitor closely how that programme is rolled out. I hear that it is being expanded into other counties and other areas of the country. It is an interesting and important project to follow, enabling us to see how a community and partnership-based approach can be effective in reducing alcohol consumption and antisocial behaviour and the crime that goes with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="81007h0003.htm_para13"><a name="08100731000095">In conclusion, anti-drug awareness approaches may be summed up in three words: prevention, in terms of focus; partnership, as an essential element of delivery in communities; and perspective, in terms of the wider social context in which they may sit and the other policies that they are intended to supplement as an overarching approach to reduce the harm of drugs and the crime that may lead from that. I was struck by a quote from the pamphlet by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, which states that the early intervention objective is nothing less than an effort</p>

The words &#147;early intervention&#148; are now used by everyone across the political spectrum. It would be remiss of me not to tell hon. Members here and those who will read our proceedings that my hon. Friend has gone on and on about early intervention since he was elected to Parliament 20-odd years ago. That opinion was unfashionable in many ways back then, and it shows that opinions that are unfashionable in one decade sometimes become fashionable. My hon. Friend has never wavered or changed his opinion on early intervention, and he deserves great credit for that. With others, he has forced the issue on to the agenda and has made policy makers, not only at national level but at local level, look to early intervention as one way of dealing with the problem that we want to do more about.</p>

I had been teaching long enough to remember that I had tried to help her mother, who had also had problems with substance misuse when I was teaching her. It is easy to say that the problem is this or that, and that it is so-and-so&#146;s fault or someone else&#146;s fault, but it struck me at the time that whoever&#146;s fault it was, and whatever the issues and challenges for the system, the fact that that was the case reflected that,   <br>

Friend the Member for Nottingham, North knows that the work in Nottingham is entirely consistent with the principles underpinning the Government&#146;s policies of effective co-ordination and education, and early intervention. It may help if I speak more broadly about education. Clearly, it is essential, but I believe that we have sometimes asked the wrong questions about drugs education. There is quite a lot of such education in schools, and I provided it when I taught personal and social education, which was a new subject then. The question is not, &#147;Is there enough drugs education in schools?&#148; but &#147;What is effective drugs education, and what works and makes a difference?&#148; Some of the current research by the Blueprint programme, my hon. Friend&#146;s evaluation and the comments from hon. Members here are beginning to answer that question.

In their response the Government agreed to examine initial teacher training and the non-statutory nature of PSHE. We will conduct an independent review of PSHE, focusing on improved outcomes for children and young people, and on a statutory common core for PSHE. If we go to the heart of what my hon. Friend said&#151;lots of other issues arose&#151;I hope that, depending on the outcome of that review, we shall start to address the fundamental point.

Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire), raised issues of treatment, education and rehabilitation. All are important. Of course, education and early intervention treatment are fundamental, but treatment is also essential for people who have difficulties now, and we must deal with that. It is important in the treatment agenda that we have brought more people into treatment. However, when people are brought into treatment, the question changes; it is not why have people not been brought into treatment, but what is effective treatment. That question cannot be easily asked until people are brought into treatment. The Government are currently asking that question: what do we mean by effective treatment and what will actually work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="81007h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08100731000110">To some extent, I accept the point made by hon. Member for Hornchurch: rehabilitation and treatment must include abstinence as one of the options available. It is not good enough for treatment to simply move people off illegal substances on to legal substances, such as methadone. I know that the hon. Gentleman has met lots of people and will have heard that, for many, methadone is a first, important step in stabilising their chaotic lives. However, we should not be saying that one particular course of action is appropriate for every individual. Treatment should be based on medical and health grounds, and health professionals should make a judgment about what treatment is effective for each individual. I agree with the hon. Gentleman: there must be greater recognition that abstinence and residential rehab needs to play a more important part in treatment. The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) also said that.</p>

 My point was that the drug-free target should be a greater part of the goal of Government policy and the direction of treatment. Sadly, that has not been the case to the extent that it should and could have been. However, I recognise the point that the Minister has made about the use of methadone to lift people out of the circumstances that they are in. I am acutely aware that sex workers have provided a good example of how methadone can be used to provide a transition away from drugs. I hope he agrees that that should not be the end of the transition and that it is possible, and indeed imperative, to help people further and to ensure that they are addiction-free.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. However, sometimes the debate on drug addiction is polarised between those who think that abstinence should be the only treatment available and those who almost say that abstinence should be ignored. I have tried to say that treatment should be based on the individual&#146;s clinical need and what works for them. Abstinence has been absent from the available treatment options and more should be done in relation to that, but for a considerable number of people, the expectation of an immediate move from addiction to legal or illegal drugs to being drug-free is simply not based in the real world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="81007h0004.htm_para1"><a name="08100731000114">The hon. Member for Castle Point made some interesting points. I cannot give him a commitment to fund his voluntary group, but such groups are tremendously important. The work that many faith organisations, churches, mosques and so on do across the country is vital. Sometimes the voluntary sector can reach people that the statutory agencies cannot get to. I commend the work of Mr. Hatter and his colleague. Indeed, I commend the work of all the people who work in the voluntary sector in relation to this issue, both in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency and in constituencies across the country.</p>

 The Minister mentioned the quality of education. We know that the target youngsters, to whom we want to get the message across, are not very receptive. They are going through hormonal and attitudinal changes during the difficult teenage years when they grow up and we all understand that. Teachers and parents are often not as effective in getting the message across to that group of children as they could be. Mr. Hatter is probably not a reformed drug user, but I know a reformed drug user who had to make the decision either to die or to change his life. He now teaches and speaks to children about his experiences and is extremely effective in getting his message across. The children listen to him because he has been there and he can tell them what it is really like. Is there any way in which we can encourage more people who have been rehabilitated to teach our children about this issue?</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention. The problem of drugs can be more effectively dealt with by people who have been on the other side of the fence, as it were&#151;and that is the case in relation to a range of social problems, not just substance misuse. It is important to remember that.</p>

Minister with responsibility for the issue he would, in the end, with his colleagues in Government, be charged with the responsibility of making a decision. We get advice&#151;all Governments get advice all the time&#151;but in the end we have to make the decision. The hon. Member for Hornchurch was right about the advice that we received from the ACMD, but we received other advice, not least from the police and service users themselves who said other things. We reflected on and balanced that advice, and in the end made the decision that we have.</p>

In the near future, we will introduce legislation on cannabis and we are trying to ensure that the reclassification takes place as quickly as possible.

We have funded police guidance and have considered the policing of head shops. Work is ongoing in that respect.</p>

Gentleman, apart from those relating to the lack of information. Sometimes there has been an issue concerning a lack of information and how the information about the help available gets to people. We need to ensure that we tackle that. In some areas that is not a problem, but in others it is. We are trying to ensure that information is made available to people across the country and where it is needed, so that they can access the necessary help and treatment.</p>

There is an issue with parents who simply do not care and we need to take action on that, but there is also an issue with parents who care very much, but who sometimes themselves struggle to know what they should be doing with their children.

Let me put the matter in context: overall drug use by people in England and Wales, including by young people, has fallen to its lowest level since the British crime survey began measurement of self-reported drug misuse. The number of people in contact with drug treatment has increased by 130 per cent. and since the start of the drug intervention programme, acquisitive crime has fallen by 22 per cent. There are, no doubt, issues that we have to discuss, but changes and improvements are being made.</p>

 The regional spatial strategy for the south-west is an issue of prime importance for not only my constituents but those of many hon. Members here today, who I suspect were brought here by the title of the debate, rather than the prospect of my oratory&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;No!&#148;]&#151;although I am open to correction on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="81007h0004.htm_para11"><a name="08100731000128">We discussed the draft RSS for the south-west in this very Chamber in January, and the previous but one Housing Minister, who is now the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, assured us that the Secretary of State&#146;s comments on the panel&#146;s report would be available in the spring. We anticipated that that would perhaps be around Easter and that there would then be three months of rigorous parliamentary scrutiny of this fundamental and very detailed document, but the weeks and months went by and &#147;spring&#148; turned out to be 22 July. In other words, the Secretary of State&#146;s conclusions were issued to us on the final day on which the House sat, and a 13-week consultation period commenced with 11 weeks of parliamentary recess. I put it to the Minister that that does not show respect for the parliamentary process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="81007h0004.htm_para12"><a name="08100731000129">Today&#146;s debate could provide the only opportunity that all hon. Members from the south-west have to express their views in Parliament on the RSS. Although many of the issues are matters for our colleagues in local government, there are clearly issues of regional and national strategic importance that we, as representatives of our communities, should be able to speak our minds about, but the Government have made that exceptionally difficult for us. Were it not for the generosity of Mr. Speaker, we would not even be having this debate today. That is totally unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="81007h0004.htm_para13"><a name="08100731000130">That sums up the problem with the RSS: it is incredibly top-down. Earlier this year, the Department for Communities and Local Government produced a report called&#151;I ask hon. Members please not to laugh&#151;&#147;Communities in control: real people, real power&#148;. If we had read out that title at any of the five public meetings I have had on the issue in my constituency, there would have been a hollow laugh, because there is no sense that real people have real power in this process. It is an entirely top-down process.</p>

It used to be called Avon; it is now the west of England. Out of a population of more than 1 million people, a grand total of 18 people have registered comments, the most recent of which was on 25 September. One of my constituents, Ron Morton, who chairs the Shortwood green belt campaign, rang the Government office for the south-west and asked, &#147;Why are there no more comments since 25 September?&#148; He was told that the official consultation website is not currently being updated with participant submissions, because &#147;Gary is on holiday.&#148; <i>[Laughter.] </i>There is a serious point here. He has asked me to put to the Minister the following question: can the Minister extend the consultation period, this time by a period at least equal to Gary&#146;s holiday, because given the crucial timing of Gary&#146;s absence, the backlog of comments on his return is likely to be substantial?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises a very important point. Let me give an example from my own constituency. The draft RSS that came from the regional assembly had no specific proposals at all for the Yate and Chipping Sodbury area. The panel talked about 5,000 houses in that area. Yate town council asked to give evidence to the panel and was refused, but at the end of the process a big proposal was made for its area, on which it could not feed in because it did not know it was coming.

cannot comment on that. We had a debate in January, and the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) secured a debate on the issue subsequently. In that debate, this Minister said that he could not respond at that point, which was in the spring, because the process was quasi-judicial and so he could not comment. He could not comment on the panel. Now we have the revisions&#151;in the Yate case, we are talking about a figure of 3,000, not 5,000. Do we agree that 5,000 down to 3,000 is good news, or do we say that 3,000 is wrong because the panel was wrong? Are we allowed to comment on that, because we are commenting on the proposed changes, not the number that it first thought of? It is a complete farce. Nobody knows the answer to that question.</p>

 Yes, I suppose we might say it is more of an outer spatial strategy. I have no problem with thinking strategically at regional level, provided that the process is democratic, engages people and starts with local communities, rather than being imposed from on high. That is my principal objection. The strategy needs to be regional, not national, but what have the Government done between the panel report and the Secretary of State&#146;s version? They have stripped out some of the bits that make it different. The south-west wanted to go further and faster on renewable energy. That has been taken out. The south-west wanted to go further and faster on sustainable building. That has been taken out. Is this a regional strategy, or is it a national strategy imposed on the region? The regional assembly put it like this:</p>

What is the point of asking the region to come up with a document and then saying, &#147;Oh, sorry, you can&#146;t do different things in your region from other regions&#148;?

 Does my hon. Friend agree that that raises fundamental questions about the Government&#146;s definition of consultation?

thinking&#151;responding to a consultation is a waste of time because nobody is listening.&#148; I hope that the Minister will assure us that the comments that we make today and that go on the website do have a chance of changing something. If he simply comes up with 3 million, or whatever the number is, and just tells us all to get on with it, I wonder whether we would be able to change anything. Frankly, however, if we were all to give up, it would be a recipe for cynicism. That is why I have been determined to fight it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="81007h0004.htm_para24"><a name="08100731000147">I shall focus on the specific issue of housing numbers. The document covers much more, but that is the principal concern. I considered what the last but one Housing Minister, now Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said in response to our debate in January. If I were to summarise her 10-minute speech, it would be, &#147;You are all a bunch of nimbys: go away.&#148; That, essentially, was the line she took. That, however, may be in the Minister&#146;s draft speech, so I shall suggest a slightly more refined version.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="81007h0004.htm_para25"><a name="08100731000148">We are not saying&#151;I am not saying&#151;no to more houses. South Gloucestershire is not an area of nimbys: over the past 20 years, it has taken 27,000 extra houses, including the biggest housing estate in Europe&#151;Bradley Stoke. In the used currency, we are now being asked for another four Bradley Stokes. That is on top of what we already have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="81007h0004.htm_para26"><a name="08100731000149">In 2006, the then all-party cabinet of South Gloucestershire council asked, &#147;What do we need? What can we cope with? What is sustainable? What will the infrastructure bear?&#148; The council came up with 21,000 for the next 20 years. It was not nought. The council was not denying the need for affordable housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="81007h0004.htm_para27"><a name="08100731000150">If the Minister&#146;s officials have been busy, they will know that twice in this Chamber I have demanded more affordable housing to meet local needs in South Gloucestershire. It is not no to new housing; it is yes to sustainable, affordable housing to meet local needs. However, what is proposed goes way beyond that. South Gloucestershire council said yes to 21,000, on top of the 27,000 over the previous 20 years. The draft regional spatial strategy agreed by the regional assembly came up with 23,000, which encroached on the green belt. We objected to that, but it was in the same ballpark. The panel suggested 30,800; and the Secretary of State said 32,8000, which was half as many again. The issue is the margin between what the local people believe is sustainable&#151;a number that would meet local needs&#151;and a vast extra development.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. I reassure him that the point he makes about his constituents not being nimbys is echoed on the other side of the Bristol in my area of north Somerset. I see my parliamentary neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), in his seat; I am sure that he will make the same point. No one locally is arguing for no extra houses. The problem is that the houses being foisted on us are above what is sustainable, above what local people will sign up to, and far in advance of what local infrastructure, local transport and local community services will stand.</p>

It is vital for quality of life&#151;for mental, physical and spiritual well-being&#151;and not only for those who live in the countryside. It is particularly important for those who live in the towns and cities. It is not about country dwellers throwing up the barriers and saying, &#147;Leave our green spaces alone.&#148; People who live in Bristol want to keep the Bristol green belt; it is not only those who live in the countryside. If the proposal goes ahead, communities such as the village of Shortwood in my constituency, which is in the green belt, would simply be wiped off the map by a sprawling housing estate.</p>

obviously a trade-off. We do not want completely to cover all the fields. However, the document means high density housing going up, which will have an even more conspicuous impact on the landscape, and specifically so in the green belt areas. The green belt is a fundamental issue of principle.</p>

If any of our local authorities zone all those areas for housing, which will be expected of them, will the developers be able to say, &#147;You have created space for 32,000 houses. The first house we build will be put on the prime bit of green belt, which we have never been allowed to touch before&#148;? Or will they be able to say, &#147;Hang on a minute. There are lots of other brownfield sites and urban areas that you should use first&#148;? I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us at least that once the areas are zoned a local authority will not lose on appeal if it says no to a green belt development simply because of a failure to apply a sequential approach.</p>

That is happening now, so one can imagine what would happen if we built those houses. There is land for them. No one is saying there is nowhere to put them&#151;we could fit them in. However, we are talking about an area with a high level of car ownership, and a high level of commuting into central Bristol and the surrounding area. The previous version of the regional spatial strategy included specific infrastructure projects. They have been taken out and all we have left is wishful thinking about improving public transport infrastructure.</p>

The company was not sure whether it could provide extra trains in the morning. I asked whether it could double the number of morning peak journeys from Yate to Bristol and how many people it could actually get into Bristol. The company said it could carry only 140 more people. There will be 3,000 houses, but only 140 more people could be accommodated on journeys. The other 3,000 or so commuters&#151;there will be some jobs in the area, but most people will commute&#151;will not be going on trains, and buses are infrequent and expensive. Of course the Minister could do more, but has anybody really done the math, as Americans would say, to match the two numbers? It is not good enough to say, &#147;We will build 3,000 houses and improve public transport.&#148; The roads out of Yate cannot be widened without knocking down houses. It is not a question of doing something that one is determined to do&#151;physically, there simply is no room. Who is going to listen when we say no? Infrastructure is critical.</p>

 The points that my hon.

Do we not need investors and councils to shape communities that work? That way, we would not have everybody commuting to Bristol, but a place where people live and work as a community. One problem with the RSS is that it does not deliver a solution to the problem of shaping communities that work.</p>

 I echo the need for communities that work and I pay tribute to my hon. Friend&#146;s work on rural housing. I am worried that we will not be able to make people live next to where they work, so even if we zone land for employment in the middle of Yate, people will still come in and go out. We cannot control that&#151;that&#146;s life&#151;and it will always happen. As my hon.

 I am sorry&#151;he was not a Health Minister. Nevertheless, South Gloucestershire has a major, world-renowned hospital&#151;the Frenchay&#151;which includes an A and E department.

I asked the North Bristol NHS Trust how many people it thought would be in the area when the new super-hospital opened, but it had done no projections. When I asked how many extra people would be in the area and what that would mean, I was told that the new super-hospital would be the equivalent of 250 beds short when it opened. Are the health plans going to be revised in the light of the new housing? Has the Department of Health even had a say in the process?

Members who are present say that the document is scaremongering and that the development will not happen because of the credit crunch, the housing crash and so on, and that we do not need to worry.

They are not nimbys, nor are they opposed to affordable housing to meet local needs and local economic development, but they object profoundly to the undemocratic nature of the process.

shred of evidence that the numbers are doable or sustainable. Secondly, I am totally opposed to any building on the green belt to the east of the Avon ring road&#151;the A4175. I am not saying that there should be fewer houses on the green belt, but that there should be no building there whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="81007h0005.htm_para28"><a name="08100731000193">On the overall situation, let me confirm what the hon. Gentleman said. There was all-party agreement on South Gloucestershire council when it was a joint administration in 2006, and today, when it is a Conservative-led administration, that the proposed 32,800 extra homes are entirely unacceptable. The infrastructure arguments on roads, public transport and other community facilities have been made. It is simply not doable, and certainly not desirable. At the same time, all three parties on the council&#151;and we should listen to what local councillors say&#151;said that 21,500 is a substantial additional contribution. The Emersons Green development was pushed through by the previous Government without infrastructure being developed and the last thing I want is another situation like that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="81007h0005.htm_para29"><a name="08100731000194">Notwithstanding Emersons Green and Bradley Stoke in the constituency of the hon. Member for Northavon, the fact is that councillors, myself and, I believe, the majority of local residents are prepared to accept something pretty close to the original draft RSS figure of 21,500. However, what is now being proposed is significantly more than that, and it is entirely unacceptable. It must be revised down to a more acceptable level. I speak not only for my constituents and myself but, I am sure, for any sane person who has examined the numbers. There is no case for the figure that is currently out for consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="81007h0005.htm_para30"><a name="08100731000195">Secondly, as I have said, I am totally opposed to any building on the green belt to the east of the Avon ring road, from Shortwood and Bridgeyate down to Bitton, for three basic reasons. The first is that the green belt is there to separate adjacent urban communities, and if the proposal were to go through, it would totally undermine the credibility of the green belt between Bristol and Bath. I hope that the Minister will take that on board. There is massive opposition to the erosion of that green belt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="81007h0005.htm_para31"><a name="08100731000196">Secondly, the proposals for new housing are actually in the wrong place. I have pored over the documentation for more hours that I would wish, and found that in Kingswood, in the southern part of south Gloucestershire, there is a massive net outflow of people who work in Bristol, on the northern Bristol fringe and in the northern part of south Gloucestershire. People are migrating out. I believe that it is sensible to try to locate houses close to where people work, but the proposals would do precisely the opposite.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="81007h0005.htm_para32"><a name="08100731000197">That brings me to my third reason. Just imagine the environmental implications of the proposals&#151;the hon. Member for Northavon made that point. Imagine the implications for transport and roads, and particularly for public transport. Like many other people in my constituency, I have to use the Avon ring road regularly. One of the first things that I demanded when I came to Parliament was the completion of the ring road, because there were bits at either end but nothing in the middle. It has helped many neighbouring communities to alleviate transport disaster, but it is now operating pretty close to full capacity. The idea that thousands more homes to the east of the ring road, on the green belt, would cause anything other than a disaster for public transport and the environment is, frankly, cloud cuckoo land.</p>

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="08100731000201"><a name="81007h0006.htm_spnew3"><a name="08100731000533"><b>Roger Berry:</b>
 I strongly agree that, particularly at a time that we are concerned about the environment and environmental damage, we must pay due attention to ensuring that decisions about housing and employment are made together. Otherwise, the transport, infrastructure and environmental problems will become enormous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="81007h0006.htm_para0"><a name="08100731000202">I have two final points, which will be brief because other hon. Members wish to speak. First, I do not believe that the regional spatial strategy should be site specific. The hon. Member for Northavon referred to that. There must be an agreement on the total level of housing in each local authority area, and it should be made democratically. At the end of the day, however, whatever the level of housing development in south Gloucestershire needs to be by 2026, where the houses go should be a matter for the local council and local councillors. I spent far too much time as a Labour local councillor on the old Avon council, before the previous Government abolished us, arguing that local councillors should have the power to represent their people. I am not going to change that view now, just because I happen to be here. Local councils must have the powers and opportunities to say where housing is best placed. I do not believe that it is right for anyone else to assume that responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="81007h0006.htm_para1"><a name="08100731000203">My final point is about the importance of South Gloucestershire council&#146;s own response to the consultation. It is critical, as are the responses of all local councils, and I wished to make two points about it. However, I shall make only one, because I am conscious that other Members wish to speak. It would not be good enough for South Gloucestershire council to object simply to the scale of developments east of the Avon ring road. It should oppose them altogether, and I expect it so to do. That is what the economic and environmental arguments demand, what local residents want and what the vast majority of those who live in Kingswood want. I very much hope that the Minister is listening, and I am sure that he is.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb), who exposed most eloquently the very many flaws in the process that has brought us to this point. The top-down, undemocratic nature of those flaws are crucial problems. The matter is the most frequently raised issue in my constituency since the report of the examination in public, and even more since the end of July. I have been personally involved throughout the process, but other MPs were not even allowed to speak at the examination in public.</p>

If I believed that the proposals addressed that need, I would support them. However, given the environmental and other constraints in my constituency, I do not believe that we can build our way out of the crisis. The approach to providing the housing that we need should involve local communities providing houses to agreed targets, very locally and in suitable locations, and it must be backed with more Government money. When faced with a large amount of heathland, as is the case in Purbeck in my constituency, there are so many constraints that it is necessary to have extra Government support&#151;not Government dictation&#151;to meet our needs.</p>

It is proposed that there should be 2,750 homes in the green belt. The proposal is opposed by every council at whatever level, and was made by one developer. Was the hearing balanced, I ask myself? Everybody is against the proposal. It will shatter the green belt, and we will have just one urban sprawl. By the end of the process, if it is not halted, I imagine that there will be wall-to-wall housing from Wareham to Christchurch.</p>

 The problem is not just in and around Bristol and Purbeck. Is the hon. Lady aware that in Torbay, the spatial strategy would mean an urban sprawl right out of Torquay into Paignton and into green fields, with tens of thousands of houses? There is already gridlock on the roads and no schools or health services. The proposal is preposterous and ought to be buried fast. Does she agree?</p>

The growth premise of the regional spatial strategy must surely be reviewed in light of what is happening. I appreciate that it is a 20-year prediction, but the predicted growth rate of 3.2 per cent. appears to be totally out of line. I endorse the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon that there is uncertainty about exactly what the report of the examination in public says. It certainly seems to me that it implies that there is now no necessity to look for brown field sites first. We must have clarification on that point today.</p>

The change that the Secretary of State has brought to my area would remove any infrastructure requirements. In some ways, there is some practicality about that because, for example, the roads cannot be greatly improved without their impinging on the heathland. However, given the congestion during the tourism season, the provision of all the proposed extra housing without any extra roads is absolutely impossible to comprehend.</p>

Purbeck is one of the most constrained areas for development in the country, so it is an impossible proposal. In addition to the Purbeck housing, there are proposals with which some local councils originally agreed, but not at local community level, such as those  <br>

I think that everyone believes that if the proposals go ahead they will represent the destruction of beautiful areas for ever. We do not have faith in the process by which we have reached this point.

I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister realises that this is not an issue that will go into the long grass; it is a burning problem in our area, because people feel very strongly. <i>[Interruption.]</i> We get those as well, with the floods.

I understand where the South West of England Regional Development Agency and the Government office for the south-west are coming from in relation to the RSS, but there are local government representatives on the RSS and I want to know why their voices were not heard, apparently, until the plan came back with everyone against it. I should like to know who was on the RSS, and what they had to say. Were they were part of the proposals? Did they walk out? Did they not turn up? Did they express their anger? If they did not, I want to know why not, because either local government is part of the process or it might as well give up completely.

Whaddon was taken out of the text of the RSS but has remained in a map&#151;whether accidentally or on purpose we do not know. Surely the sensible thing to do would be to remove the allocation, take the map out, and say that those 1,500 homes should if anything be part of the local development framework. That would then, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry) has said, give the local authority the ability to decide where to put those homes, including in the rural communities that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) has been suggesting for some time.</p>

 Obviously I agree with my hon. Friend. It is good to see him back with us mere Back Benchers; we can find many opportunities to argue our position&#151;and we will. I want to make a couple of other points. We feel strongly about Whaddon, and about other opportunities to bring forward ideas on housing development&#151;I know we are obsessed with housing development, but that is a controversial part of the proposal. The point has been made about the need to link employment and housing. We have an employment problem in the Stroud area, not least in that virtually all the employment growth has been in my own town of Stonehouse. That has led to all manner of other problems about where people live in relation to where they must work. I asked a parliamentary question during the recess about how many commercial properties are still empty in the Stroud district and the answer was more than 500. I do not want to lose those as employment possibilities, but I cannot believe that all of them are suitable for employment and I want to know whether we are in any way going to move away from the brownfield first obligation that the Government have been right to pursue, and which has been successful. What are the implications for that? I want some of those sites to be used for housing.</p>

 I hope that the Minister hears that important point, but I want to finish with one more point: there is a degree of unfairness in the RSS.

At the very time when we are concentrating housing development as excessive numbers of the wrong type of housing where the jobs are not, we are killing our rural areas because we cannot get any development in them. What is happening is a recipe for telling developers, &#147;Go for the easy pickings. Forget the rural areas; they do not matter.&#148; That kills rural areas and is unfair to the places with excessive development. I hope that my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="81007h0006.htm_para11"><a name="08100731000222">The targets for housing allocation in north Somerset were always absurd. They represented a Whitehall-centred view of housing development, and took no account of the impact on the local environment, the need for infrastructure development, or the detrimental effects on the quality of life in the area in general. Let me just put the size of the development in perspective. In the census of 2001, the town of Clevedon in my constituency had a population of 22,000, representing about 9,300 households. I imagine that that is the size of development in many of the constituencies of my colleagues here today. By 2006 it had grown to the size that is now proposed for development in north Somerset; so what did Clevedon have in 2006 that a similar development would require? It had seven wards and seven ward councillors, one secondary and six primary schools, one leisure centre, one swimming pool, seven places of worship, six pubs, two post offices, three supermarkets, one hospital, three doctors&#146; surgeries, three dental surgeries, four vets&#146; practices, one library, 16 community meeting places, 150 allotments, one youth club and about 100 bus stops served by six main services. That is the sort of infrastructure that any of the developments in the strategy would require. Yet in north Somerset we are witnessing a contraction of infrastructure, with doctors&#146; surgeries at risk, post office closures, and inadequate public transport, especially in rural areas.</p>

In the past 20 years in my constituency&#151;in Nailsea, Clevedon and recently in Portishead, with a huge and prestigious development on a former brownfield site&#151;we have taken more than our share of increased housing. We accept that people need places to live, but one cannot simply continue to stuff the same places with ever greater numbers of houses without any consideration for infrastructure.

all those houses going to work? They will have to drive to Bristol or Weston-super-Mare, increasing road traffic against every one of the Government&#146;s targets on transport and the environment.

This is no time to grant speculative permissions that might be used in entirely different future circumstances. With the possibility of a change of Government&#151;a Conservative Government would take an entirely different approach to housing targets&#151;developers will face even greater temptation to get as many permissions as possible for future development. It is essential that local councils do not play into their hands, wittingly or unwittingly, by seeming to go along with some of the underlying assumptions.</p>

Our area faces one of the most unimaginative planning schemes, whose answer to shortage in south Bristol is simply to concrete over the adjacent countryside.

Let us put the ball back in its court by letting Stroud have greater control over where the houses should be.

 I hope that the Minister is getting the message that from one end of the region to the other, concerted opposition is being voiced to the proposals in the regional spatial strategy, not just by MPs from up and down the region and from all parties, but by many people who have come here to sit in the Public Gallery.

We have mentioned the difficulties of the lack of liaison between the Minister&#146;s Department and the Department for Transport. The Department for Transport says it will not expand junction 21 of the M5 in my constituency unless proper provision is made to improve the balance between employment and housing in the RSS for my area, but at the same time, as everybody here knows, the RSS has dramatically increased the amount of housing without any concomitant or matching increase in local employment. As a result of that lack of joined-up Government thinking, my constituency, which already has an enormous amount of net out-commuting every morning and evening&#151;it also has the matching degrees of traffic congestion&#151;will actually face increases in out-commuting. We need jobs before yet more houses, otherwise a crucial element of sustainability in the RSS will be lost.</p>

As we all know, yesterday the stock markets collapsed to a tremendous degree&#151;I do not know what they are doing today&#151;so we are in cloud cuckoo land if we think that standing here and blithely talking about such high growth rates is reasonable.</p>

 It is vital that we make the Minister aware of how ludicrous some of the figures are. On my patch, they would mean building new houses at three times the current rate. What is equally ludicrous is that we are wishing to build student accommodation on our two university campuses, which will take people out of existing homes in my city centre, but that for some bizarre reason that student accommodation will not count towards the figures.</p>

 I hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Perhaps the only thing that could be said for declining house prices is that they make some houses more affordable, if people could only get the mortgages in the first place, which of course they cannot. We all understand that the growth rates are unrealistic and that therefore the central premise of the RSS is wrong, and yet for some reason the Government seem to be grinding on remorselessly and seem unwilling to change their figures or their view. The RSS is unsustainable; it does not represent joined-up Government and is tremendously environmentally unfriendly from the point of view of increasing commuting as well as concreting over green belt land. Ultimately, it fails the crucial test in my constituency&#151;it does not put jobs before yet more houses.</p>

 I shall be very quick, Mr. Key. As others have said, it is important that we all acknowledge that we want additional housing, particularly affordable housing. In my area, the local council agreed 15,500 new houses; the examination in public then said we must increase that figure to 18,800, and then&#151;bizarrely&#151;the Government said even that was not enough and that we need 21,300.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I hope that he will join me in echoing comments made by others about the urgent need to have a sequential test so that we stick to the rule of developing brownfield, derelict properties first, and green belt land as a very last resort, if necessary. If we do not, it will lead to problems with developers cherry-picking the best and easiest sites, which would be a planning disaster. As others have said, infrastructure is crucial. Will the Minister at least reconsider the ludicrous situation in the centre of Bath, where 1,772 family homes are entirely occupied by students? Building student accommodation on our two university campuses, including the one in the constituency of the hon. Member for Wansdyke (Dan Norris), would release many of those properties. Surely, releasing properties for ordinary home use should count towards the target.</p>

interested in contributing to this debate. He pinpointed some of the key problems with the process: the first is lack of parliamentary scrutiny&#151;this is one of the few opportunities that we have had to have any input into the process, other than in writing of course, and I am sure that everybody who has written in at every stage of this process will feel that their comments have been taken into account in their entirety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="81007h0007.htm_para7"><a name="08100731000247">My hon. Friend also pinpointed the barriers in electronic media that constituents have faced when trying to engage with the process. He raised the crucial &#147;Gary question&#148;&#151;I guess that that is how it will have to be framed. I wonder whether a copy of our discussions could be sent to Gary, wherever he is in the world! There seems to be a real lack of understanding&#151;understandably&#151;about the importance of what we are debating today. That is a feature of the top-down way in which the process has been driven. It means that people are removed from decisions that will very much affect their lives. My hon. Friend was absolutely right to pinpoint that.</p>

 I would like to raise a matter that has not really been discussed&#151;the so-called &#147;Regional Approach to Transport&#148; chapter, which indicates that there is no regional approach to transport. It also states that the A303 is apparently no longer the second strategic route to the south-west and makes the entertaining suggestion that the answer to the problems with the A303 is better walking and cycling measures. That will be a great help to people wanting to go on holiday in the south-west of Cornwall. It really exposes the poverty of thinking in the document.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The extra housing numbers being advocated in the RSS mean that the available transport funding will be sucked into the new urban areas, which means that projects such as the A303, along with the A30 at Temple in my own constituency, which were on the original list, are now some way down it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="81007h0007.htm_para8"><a name="08100731000250">This debate is reminiscent of others that we have had in this Chamber on eco-towns, in which hon. Members have said time and again that planning ought to be about local people, through their elected representatives, coming together to determine the shape of their communities and looking at priorities and needs that must be taken into account. Hon. Members are right to point out that there is huge housing need but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said, there are empty properties out there, whether as a result of &#147;studentification&#148;&#151;a phrase that has come into my vocabulary in the past year or so&#151;or of the imposition on communities, such as those in my constituency and others in the south-west, of second homes, or any other factor.

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="81007h0007.htm_para9"><a name="08100731000251">Problems exist with the underlying suppositions in the document. As the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="81007h0007.htm_para10"><a name="08100731000252">This Government&#146;s regional policy is in tatters. A referendum was held in the Minister&#146;s own area on moving towards regional government, and because of this we have staggered from one change to another, and now nobody is clear about where regional policy is going. It means that a document such as the one we are discussing, which could be hugely influential on and important to developers, if not to local communities, is still in question because we do not know how we are to move forward. My party&#146;s position is that regions must come about through local areas working and coming together to form natural regions with their own priorities that will then allow serious discussions to be had about transport and other infrastructure priorities, as well as the housing issues being debated here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="81007h0007.htm_para11"><a name="08100731000253">Sadly, the process as it stands will destroy any remaining confidence that the people might have had in the planning system. Last night, while staying in my constituency, I attended a Trewen parish meeting. I am sure that you, Mr. Key, and other hon. Members will be familiar with Trewen. It is a parish of about 70 or so dwellings. The most animated point of the evening came when planning issues were raised. But those are planning issues that people can get hold of&#151;they are local, they are on their doorsteps and they understand them. It is easy to get people involved in parish planning processes, to get them engaged and to make them feel empowered&#151;they ought to be the building block of planning policy. Clearly, some brokering is required, but I think that we can overcome any nimbyist tendencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="81007h0007.htm_para12"><a name="08100731000254">Hon. Members have said that their constituents are keen to have housing, but in the places where they decide, not those decided by developers. My hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor) was right to say that we should move forward, with local authorities representing their communities and working in partnership with developers to come up with serious plans. That is what planning should be about, and that is the sort of planning that could re-engage people with the planning system. That is what my party would seek to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="81007h0007.htm_para13"><a name="08100731000255">We have seen, through the eco-towns development and from a debate that we had about Northamptonshire some time ago, that developers are using the threat of housing targets imposed from outside to go to appeal and avoid local engagement. That is a criminal position for us to be in, and we need to move forward in a far more constructive way.</p>

 I am aware of the lack of time, but does my hon. Friend agree that the south-west strategy, as produced by the Department, is an exercise in micro-management of the region that will lead to a cataclysmic outcome in many areas, as many have described? Above all, it projects forward the past failures of growth-led strategies, particularly in his area and mine, where house numbers have doubled in the past 40 years while the housing problems of local people have become worse. Does he agree that simply building more houses is not the answer?</p>

Being slightly conspiracy-minded, I wondered whether the community infrastructure levy was going to be the Government&#146;s answer to all our infrastructure problems. Given our doubtless expanding economy in the next few years, on which all this is based, do they think that it will produce the money to magic up a junction on the M5 for my hon.

As hon. Members can imagine, he has been engaged in all of these debates regarding the south-east. All the arguments that have been put forward today are familiar in the south-east, and I suspect that Members from other areas of the UK would make exactly the same criticisms if they were present, because the Government&#146;s regional strategy is bust. It does not work, it is hated and loathed, and it has contributed fundamentally to the British people&#146;s distrust and suspicion of our planning system. Our planning system used to be the envy of the world&#151;so much so that one can still find similar systems around the world&#151;but the Government have bust it, because local people no longer feel that they are in control of planning.</p>

 Those proposals are very controversial within the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, and local people must therefore be able to voice their objections.

The only way that they will gain that control is if the whole regional spatial strategy is abolished. That is what we will do when we become the next Government. That is one of the keys to ensuring that our planning system regains the respect of the people who have to live with it. We must put them in control and work with the councils so that, for every local area, a development plan is produced that local people respect and are prepared to buy into&#151;indeed, that they own. Once we have abolished the RSS, local people and councils will be in the driving seat.

Oral questions to the Department for Communities and Local Government are scheduled for next Tuesday, and I would welcome questions on this subject: they must be tabled by tomorrow. The idea that the matter has not been subject to parliamentary scrutiny is wrong. It was announced that the 12-week consultation process would start in July.

 I shall respond directly to that point after I have given way to the hon. Member for Woodspring, but I give due notice to the House that, with regards that issue and the quasi-judicial nature of the process, I am going to disappoint Members again.</p>

 What is the point of scrutiny when the Government absolutely disregard the views of those who represent the region? In this room today, more than 20 MPs, representing all parties and all parts of the region, have unanimously decried the Government&#146;s strategy. What conclusion does the Minister draw from the debate? And what change of policy will come about as a result?</p>

 Let me get to the very heart of my response. As the House is aware, owing to the quasi-judicial role of the Secretary of State in this matter, I am very limited in what I can say. The House, and certainly hon. Members present today, will be aware that, in taking quasi-judicial decisions under the various Planning Acts, there is clear guidance for Ministers, based on advice from the Law Officers and first Treasury counsel. A copy of the guidance can be found on the Department for Communities and Local Government website and is snappily titled &#147;Guidance on propriety issues in handling planning casework in Communities and Local Government&#148;. I am more than happy to provide copies of it to hon. Members. The guidance states that Ministers should not enter into discussions with interested parties on the changes that might be made to a draft regional spatial strategy. This is to ensure that the process is fair and transparent, and that representations to the Secretary of State are channelled through the proper statutory consultation process. It would therefore be entirely wrong if I were to say in this debate or in others, &#147;Well, actually, I agree with so-and-so on that particular point, and I disagree fundamentally with that approach on that point.&#148; It would be wrong because of the quasi-judicial process.</p>

responding to the consultation, surely he can at least tell us what the document means. That must be allowable. Does the document mean that we have to say yes to the first application on the most sensitive site, or can we be sequential? Surely he can tell us what the document means so that we can respond to it.</p>

 I shall come on to that point. First, I shall try to respond as best and as fully as I can to the four or five points that were made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para1"><a name="08100731000280">I have just mentioned process, so it might be useful if I outline the process that has been used. As I have said on previous occasions, the function of regional spatial strategies is to determine first, how much housing is needed and the general location where it should be built; secondly, the priorities for new infrastructure and economic development; thirdly, the strategy for protecting countryside and biodiversity; and finally, the policy for reducing carbon emissions and safeguarding natural resources, whether they are, for example, water or minerals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para2"><a name="08100731000281">As the House is aware, responsibility for the initial drafting of the strategy for the south-west rested with the South West regional assembly, which submitted its draft to the Government on 24 April 2006. A 12-week public consultation gave the public the opportunity to put comments to an independent panel, which was appointed by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to test the soundness of the draft RSS. Following that, an examination in public&#151;an EiP&#151;was held between April and July 2007 to discuss and test the draft RSS that was put before the panel. The length of the EiP reflected the level of interest in the draft RSS, and the panel reviewed comments from almost 2,000 different parties. Some 191 organisations and individuals took part in public hearings, which were held in Exeter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para3"><a name="08100731000282">The panel&#146;s report was submitted to the Government on 10 December 2007, and published for information on 10 January 2008. It contained recommendations to the Secretary of State on all aspects of the draft RSS, but representations on those recommendations were not invited. Following the publication of the panel report, the recommendations were considered, and proposed changes on behalf of the Secretary of State were published for consultation in July. As the House is aware, we are now making progress through a further consultation period, which will end on 24 October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para4"><a name="08100731000283">What I can tell the House is that the Government are committed to ensuring that everyone has access to a decent home at a price that they can afford and in a place where they want to live and work. There is strong evidence to suggest that more homes are needed in the south-west to make that possible over the next 15 to 20 years. Consequently, the proposed changes set out higher levels of housing because, as hon. Members from all parts of the House have said, the south-west has a serious housing problem. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda) for the excellent work he did as a Minister in the Department for Communities and Local Government. As he pointed out in his contribution, the south-west is the only region in the country with above-average house prices and below-average incomes, which is why the independent panel concluded that more than 28,000 homes would be  <br>

needed each year. We considered that carefully and concluded that slightly higher increases will be needed if the region is to make real progress in tackling affordability and housing supply issues and ensure that housing supply is closely aligned with the likely location of employment opportunities. I shall expand on that point in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para5"><a name="08100731000284">A key point is the current financial, economic and banking difficulties that Members have mentioned. In light of those difficulties, which are extremely turbulent and traumatic, it is important to focus on the long term as well. For the past generation or so, there has been a huge imbalance between the demand for, and supply of, housing. As a population, we are ageing, and that problem is not going to go away, regardless of the current difficulties in stock markets throughout the world. We need to address the issue through housing supply, and one way in which we can do so is through the regional spatial strategy.</p>

<p><a name="st_87"><a name="08100731000285"><a name="81007h0008.htm_spnew9"><a name="08100731000572"><b>Martin Horwood:</b>
 I am tempted to challenge those numbers on the basis that first, they are unreliable, as many academics and Select Committees have pointed out, and secondly, they are profoundly outdated, since they are based on growth rates of 2.8 per cent. to 3.2 per cent. over 20 years, which are now fantasy. In the closing minutes of the Minister&#146;s response, will he answer the question that my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon has just put to him? In the absence of a sequential test, the impact of those numbers in a housing downturn means that developers are going straight for the greenfield sites first. My hon. Friend therefore asked what we should say at those public inquiries to developers who want to build first on the most sensitive sites.</p>

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="08100731000286"><a name="81007h0008.htm_spnew10"><a name="08100731000573"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 Let me address that direct point now. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Northavon for providing prior notice of the question, which I know is of concern to him. He knows about planning policy statement 3, which puts local authorities in the driving seat in respect of development in their area. All hon. Members agree that a plan-led development system is the right approach, as opposed to something with a short-term, speculative and ad hoc nature. Having said that, I do not think that a sequential test is the right approach, because it would be rigid and old-fashioned, and it would say, &#147;It would be wrong to provide that site for development before that site.&#148; If we can be as flexible as possible, certainly during the current economic difficulties, that is the approach to take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para6"><a name="08100731000287">Let me elaborate on that point. The key test, which must be established, is whether a site is suitable for development. [Hon. Members: &#147;No!&#148;] Let me finish. Part of the test is whether the development is on green belt, which is not usually suitable, because in the planning system there is a very strict presumption against development on green belt; whether it is on greenfield, which could be suitable; or whether it is on brownfield, which, for the past 10 years, has been our preferred option. We had a policy&#151;a target&#151;whereby 60 per cent. of all developments would be on brownfield sites, and we have comfortably exceeded it. That is a major achievement, and something like 75 per cent. of all new development is on brownfield sites. That is the continuing policy of this Government; it is something that we continue to see.</p>

Members have said, from the Prime Minister downwards, we remain absolutely committed to preserving, enhancing and increasing the proportion of land that is accorded green belt status. The regional spatial strategy simply states that any partial review of the RSS should include a green belt review, with a particular view to determining whether additional land should be designated as green belt at all of the region&#146;s three green belts.</p>

 I very much hope that my hon. Friend and I will have many occasions on which we can challenge the Minister about Home Office issues, because crime and the criminal justice system are very important issues for ourselves and our constituents in Kettering and Wellingborough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para8"><a name="08100731000295">Our local policemen and women in Northamptonshire do a great job and I should like to thank them publicly for their efforts. Crime is a major issue for local residents and Northamptonshire police does a good job of catching the relatively small number of persistent and prolific offenders who commit the bulk of serious crime in our local community. However, all too often the courts fail to take those offenders&#146; crimes as seriously as they might, all too often the offenders are released on bail, despite being repeat offenders, and nowadays those offenders never serve their time in jail in full.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para9"><a name="08100731000296">The second part of the debate is about youth offending. With regard to youth offenders, there are far too many 14 and 15-year-olds committing antisocial nuisance and lower-level crimes, such as criminal damage. Dealing with them is taking up far too much police time when the police have better things to do, especially with regard to the more serious crimes that are being committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para10"><a name="08100731000297">At the moment in Northamptonshire, the police force is not able to issue fixed penalty notices or penalty notices for disorder to those offenders, despite the fact that it is technically possible for it to do so under the law. My argument is that this policy should be changed and Northamptonshire police should be empowered to issue those penalty notices, so that younger troublemakers, especially the ringleaders, can receive stiff fines for their behaviour, and my view is that if they cannot afford to pay those fines, their parents should be made to cough up. Maybe then the parents would take far more interest in what their children are up to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para11"><a name="08100731000298">This debate is really in two parts. First, it is about prolific and other priority offenders, and secondly, it is about youth offending. With regard to prolific and other priority offenders, who are known in the Home Office and elsewhere as PPOs, it is estimated by the Government themselves that approximately 10 per cent. of the active offender population in this country are responsible for half of all crime and that a very small proportion of offenders, about 0.5 per cent., are responsible for one in 10 offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para12"><a name="08100731000299">That is very much the situation in Northamptonshire. The other day I was talking to the excellent chief superintendent for north Northamptonshire, Mr. Paul  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Oct 2008">

<notus-date day="7" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>7 Oct 2008 : Column 51WH</b><br>
Fell, and he confirmed to me that there are about 35 PPOs in the north of the county, who commit the bulk of the crime in Kettering, Wellingborough, Corby and east Northamptonshire. The police know who those people are. They know their name, address, date of birth&#151;they know everything about those people and they know that they are committing the bulk of acquisitive crime. However, although the local police are encouraged by the Home Office to target their efforts on those individuals, when they catch them and present them before the courts, all too often the label of &#147;prolific and other priority offender&#148; is not recognised by the judicial system in the same way as it is recognised by the police. It is amazing that even now those PPOs, when they are brought before the courts, are all too often being given bail, only to commit further offences while they are on bail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para13"><a name="08100731000300">I like the Government&#146;s PPO programme, which the then Prime Minister launched in March 2004 as a cross-government initiative to tackle those offenders who have been locally identified as committing the most crime and causing the most harm to their communities. It is a crime reduction programme with an emphasis on reducing reoffending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para14"><a name="08100731000301">Across England and Wales, there are now 10,000 individuals who are identified as PPOs and a further 4,000 young offenders who are deemed to be most at risk of becoming tomorrow&#146;s PPOs. The Government&#146;s PPO programme is split into three strands: prevent and deter, catch and convict, and rehabilitate and resettle. I am delighted that in Northamptonshire Mr. Fell and his colleagues are being extremely assertive in the way that they approach the policing of those PPOs. For example, in Kettering I believe that there are at the moment two PPOs who the police are literally following around all day, every day. That is quite right and it has my whole support. The message to those offenders is, &#147;We know that you are a criminal, we know that you want to commit further crime and we are literally going to walk behind you or drive behind you until you stop your criminal activity&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para15"><a name="08100731000302">Also, Northamptonshire police is very good in its efforts at rehabilitation and resettlement. There is an excellent country-leading initiative in Northamptonshire called the Rose project. It has had huge success in getting repeat offenders out of their criminal lifestyle. That programme needs to be expanded and supported, but it is still extremely successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para16"><a name="08100731000303">I have previously drawn attention to the fact that too many PPOs are let off on bail. I raised it with the Solicitor-General on the Floor of the House on 19 July 2007 and on other occasions, and I very much hope that the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice can achieve greater co-ordination about the pursuit of PPOs, not only through the Home Office side of the equation&#151;that is, the policing of them&#151;but through the court system and the justice that is applied to them. At the moment, it is fair to say that there is a gap there, when those offenders get to court and in the way that they are treated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para17"><a name="08100731000304">Mr. Fell, the chief superintendent of north Northamptonshire, has confirmed to me that in north Northamptonshire it is that relatively small number of PPOs who are committing a significant level of what he  <br>

called &#147;serious acquisitive crime&#148;. In other words, they are the people in Kettering, Wellingborough, Corby and east Northamptonshire who are committing the burglary of dwellings, vehicle crime, theft of motor vehicles, theft from motor vehicles and robbery offences. If those 35 individuals were banged up and kept in jail, the number of such crimes in Kettering and in the local area would decrease dramatically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para18"><a name="08100731000305">Mr. Fell has also told me that he is concerned that many of the PPOs who are dealt with under the justice system receive sentences of less than 12 months. Therefore, even when those PPOs are convicted, they are not put behind bars for long enough and if they are sentenced to less than 12 months, on many occasions they are not subject to mandatory licence conditions upon release from custody. That can make it more difficult for agencies other than the police to engage with them in a meaningful way upon their release from custody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para19"><a name="08100731000306">There is also concern locally that, with the current overcrowding situation in prisons, it is increasingly evident that not as many PPOs are being sent to jail as ought to be the case. There are two recent examples of this in north Northamptonshire in the basic command unit area, where offenders have been charged on multiple occasions and received multiple sets of bail for acquisitive crime, including robbery, shoplifting and house burglary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para20"><a name="08100731000307">The second part of this debate is about youth offending. My argument here is that basically the Government have the weapon that the local police in Northamptonshire need to tackle youth offending effectively. That weapon is penalty notices for disorder, or PNDs. The Home Office introduced pilot schemes in four police force areas between August 2002 and September 2003. The pilots, which were for issuing PNDs to people aged 16 or over, were evaluated and two reports were produced. The pilots were generally regarded as a success, so the scheme was rolled out progressively during 2003-04 to all police forces in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para21"><a name="08100731000308">In legislation passed in the House in September 2004, the scheme was further extended to 10 to 15-year-olds, but pilots of PNDs for 10 to 15-year-olds are now operating in only seven police force areas: the British Transport police Birmingham division, Essex, Lancashire, Merseyside, the Kingston division of the Metropolitan police, Nottinghamshire and West Midlands. Under the juvenile PND trials, the penalty is &#163;40 for higher-tier offences and &#163;30 for lower-tier offences, and the parent or guardian is liable for the penalty if the youngster cannot pay. Upper-tier offences include throwing fireworks; destroying or damaging property; behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress; and making false alarm calls. Lower-tier penalties apply to offences such as being drunk in the highway, public place or licensed premises, throwing stones, and leaving and depositing litter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="81007h0008.htm_para22"><a name="08100731000309">My message to the Home Office is that I would very much like the pilots to be concluded and extended across England and Wales. Please, may we have that system in Northamptonshire? Every Northamptonshire police community support officer and police constable I have ever spoken to says, &#147;Yes, Philip, we would love to be able to issue penalty notices to troublesome 14 and 15-year-olds.&#148; They are frustrated that they cannot do that. The system works, and, especially if it can be applied to the ringleaders of small groups of offending youths, the message really will get home.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this debate, and I appreciate the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) giving their consent. My hon. Friend has on many occasions led debates on policing in Northamptonshire. He does an extraordinary job on behalf of his constituents and the whole of north Northamptonshire. In case the Minister has not had enough of Northamptonshire police after today, I am sure that he will be back tomorrow for my debate on the performance of Northamptonshire police. I am not saying that this debate is the warm-up, but that he should come back tomorrow for the conclusion. I will be brief so that the Minister has a chance to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para4"><a name="08100731000315">I agree entirely with the analysis of my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering, but the problem is that there are 35 prolific and priority offenders but only two of them are getting full-time, in-the-face supervision by the police. It works, but of course 33 others are getting away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para5"><a name="08100731000316">The problem is a lack of police on the streets. If the Minister thinks that that is just a wishful expression, may I give him some Home Office figures that were provided in answer to a written question to the Home Secretary? In 2004-05, 15 per cent. of Northamptonshire police officers&#146; time was spent on patrol. That figure is extraordinarily low, but it was actually close to the national average of 15.3 per cent. However, if we turn to the figures for 2007-08&#151;the latest available&#151;we see that the national figure has, unfortunately, gone down to 13.8 per cent., and just over 10 per cent. of Northamptonshire police officers&#146; time is now spent out on the beat catching criminals and deterring crime. If we are ever to tackle this problem and really get to grips with it, we must have more police officers on the street. It is no good saying that we are going to deal with PPOs if we do not have the officers out there to do it.</p>

I am pleased that he welcomes the Government&#146;s approach to fixed penalty notices. The Government are keen to see fixed penalty notices used and rolled out; we believe that they will save police time, but most importantly we believe that they will be effective in bringing about the changes that the hon.

That is why this matter features explicitly in the Government&#146;s crime strategy and in the current public service agreements that we have set out. The hon. Gentleman has a proven track record on raising issues about persistent offenders in his constituency on previous occasions. The Government&#146;s position is clear. I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s welcoming the Government&#146;s approach on prolific and priority offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para10"><a name="08100731000322">In 2004, we set up the prolific and other priority offender programme, as a successor to the persistent offender programme, to enable local areas to target those offenders who cause most harm to their local communities: the very offenders the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. In the wider context in which we discuss this matter&#151;I am sure that we will come back to it tomorrow in the debate secured by the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)&#151;there has been an increase in police funding in Northamptonshire, which has benefited from an increase in total Government grants from &#163;52.7 million in 1997-98 to &#163;88.3 million in 2008-09, which is a 67 per cent. increase in cash terms and a 27 per cent. increase in real terms. I have listened to what hon. Members have said. However, there has been an increase in police numbers during the time I am talking about. At the end of March this year, Northamptonshire had 1,264 police officers&#151;an increase of 87 officers from March 1997&#151;as well as 159 police community support officers.</p>

this year that the force had made considerable progress in delivering both neighbourhood policing and the wider citizen focus agenda. Again, we should congratulate the force on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para12"><a name="08100731000324">Tackling reoffending is not a matter for the police alone. Clearly, the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts together have a clear role in bringing all offenders, not just prolific offenders, to justice and to ensure that they receive appropriate and proportionate court sentences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para13"><a name="08100731000325">The hon. Member for Kettering mentioned the status of offenders as prolific and other priority offenders when in court, which he has mentioned previously. As he knows, the view of the judiciary is clear: it is not the label of prolific and priority offender that is important to the court when it sentences an offender but the defendant&#146;s full offending history and the risk of reoffending that are critical, and those matters can and should be laid before the court in the pre-sentence report. The same principle applies to court processes for deciding bail. It is the factors that have led the police and their partner agencies to select the individual offender as a prolific offender, rather than the label itself, that should be used by the police in support of a remand application. That can include details of previous convictions that it is proper, fair and relevant to put before the court. I take seriously the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about closing that gap to ensure that the agencies work together, so that the courts come to the conclusion that we want them to reach. I understand the frustration of some of his constituents when they do not see that happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para14"><a name="08100731000326">Research and evidence tell us what all or most hon. Members of this House will know. Within the overall population of people who may commit a criminal offence, some do so more often than others and some do so more seriously than others. There is inevitably a small hard core of offenders who commit a disproportionate amount of crime. That is why the Government launched the prolific and other priority offender programme in 2004, which is intended to identify that small hard core, to deal with them effectively through the criminal justice system, to bring them to justice for the crimes that they commit, but also&#151;we need to consider a slightly different approach to that advocated by the hon. Gentleman&#151;to provide the interventions required to change their criminal lifestyles and reduce the continuing revolving door of criminality and punishment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para15"><a name="08100731000327">The hon. Gentleman mentioned persistent criminals who are sentenced, sometimes, to terms of less than 12 months and who come out and reoffend. In all honesty, we have to look at that issue to see whether that is the appropriate way to address their behaviour: if they are going to offend again, even if they are locked up for a longer period the next time, is that the appropriate way to address their behaviour, or are other options available?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para16"><a name="08100731000328">Since the end of 2004, prolific and other priority offender schemes have been running in every crime and disorder reduction partnership area in England and in every community safety partnership area in Wales. This is about the police working in partnership, but I pay tribute to everyone involved, including police officers, probation officers, local authority partners and others, who are making a real difference to their local community.  <br>

These schemes can and do work, which is why, for example, Northamptonshire police and the relevant crime reduction partnership support delivery of the programme in Northamptonshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para17"><a name="08100731000329">Nationally, we know from our performance data that, in the year from April 2007, more than 1,600 offenders were taken off the prolific offender programme because they had stopped or significantly reduced their offending. The national evaluation of the prolific offender programme, published in 2007, suggested a significant impact on reoffending among those first targeted by the programme: a 62 per cent. reduction in convictions over their first 17 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para18"><a name="08100731000330">I should hate anyone listening to this debate to go away with the idea that it is a custodial sentence or nothing, or to get the idea that if prolific offenders are not specifically targeted by the police&#151;many of them are when they are back on the streets&#151;they are somehow outside the system altogether. In fact, they may be the subject of all sorts of other conditions. Hopefully, some of them are not being targeted because they are not committing crimes and are not going on to commit crimes, although perhaps that is hope over experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para19"><a name="08100731000331">Often, custody is the appropriate response, but it is most important to ensure that the offender receives the sentence that balances both the need for punishment with appropriate conditions to tackle their reoffending behaviour. The probation service makes informed recommendations to the court through the pre-sentence report and some prolific offenders will receive community sentences, but with the right conditions to ensure that they are effectively managed in the community and with the right interventions to tackle the risk of reoffending. This is not a soft option; the statistics demonstrate that this approach works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para20"><a name="08100731000332">To enable local areas to continue to benefit from this work, we included the prolific offender programme specifically as one of the Government&#146;s 198 national indicators. Those indicators, collectively, reflect the Government&#146;s national priority outcomes for local authorities working alone or in partnership. They were announced as part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review, following the local government White Paper &#147;Strong and Prosperous Communities&#148;. The inclusion of the prolific and other priority offender programme as one of those indicators is a clear demonstration of the Government&#146;s continued support for the programme and the priority that we attach to its delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para21"><a name="08100731000333">Local areas select their own priorities in consultation with regional government offices. These priorities, as the hon. Gentleman knows, are set out in the area&#146;s local area agreement. With every local authority area selecting up to 35 indicators, I am sure that, as he has said, we all welcome the fact that Northamptonshire has included the prolific offender programme indicator in its agreement. What that means for Northamptonshire, in practical terms, is that it has signed up to an improvement target to reduce reoffending among those offenders that the local agencies classify as prolific or other priority offenders by 19 per cent. in the course of the current year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para22"><a name="08100731000334">Containing the behaviour of problematic offenders will have a positive impact on the quality of life for the hon.

is a key partnership outcome identified in the Northamptonshire local policing and performance plan for 2008 to 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para23"><a name="08100731000335">This is not the end of the story. The hon. Gentleman spoke about the problem of young offenders in his constituency and I understand the issues that he raised. However, there is a wider issue to consider. Tackling today&#146;s prolific offenders may have, and does have, an immediate and positive impact that cannot be underestimated. But if we are to sustain that impact, we need to identify the next generation of prolific offenders, wherever possible before they begin offending, and certainly before offending has become a way of life for them. This is very much the focus of the youth crime action plan that the Government published in July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para24"><a name="08100731000336">I will not run through all the specifics of the youth crime action plan, but as I have been talking about the prolific and other priority offender programme, I will just mention that this programme includes a strand of activity intended to prevent and deter the next generation of young people from becoming tomorrow&#146;s prolific offenders. Youth offending teams play a key part in delivering the prevent and deter strand of the prolific offender programme and that is fully aligned with work being undertaken by the Youth Justice Board to deliver a new risk-based approach, which will ensure that interventions for young offenders are tailored to the individual and based on an assessment of their risks and needs. I know that this approach chimes with the work already being done in Northamptonshire, and it is a key part of what is done in working with the police, housing providers, education providers and the youth offending service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para25"><a name="08100731000337">Tackling today&#146;s prolific offenders can have immediate impact, but if we can successfully intervene now and prevent the next generation from following in their footsteps, then the benefits to the community are probably inestimable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para26"><a name="08100731000338">National programmes and initiatives are only ever as good as the willingness, ability and capacity of local partnerships to deliver. There is a clear role for central Government in helping to facilitate partnership delivery against clear outcomes set out in an area&#146;s local area agreement. We will continue to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para27"><a name="08100731000339">I am grateful to the hon. Member for Kettering for securing this debate and I hope that we can continue the dialogue that we have started today. My door is open in the same way as my predecessor&#146;s door was open. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will join me&#151;should I be joining him?&#151;in praising the work of his local police and partnerships for all the work that they have done and all the work that they will go on doing in the future.</p>

 You will be aware, Mr. Key, that I applied for this debate before the recess, so I had a chance to prepare a Castro-like peroration, which I have had to condense to a mere 20 minutes or so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para28"><a name="08100731000341">How we handle complaints about councillors&#151;their reputation and integrity&#151;is a big subject. I think we all agree that there was probably never a time when there were no complaints, every elected representative was considered to be a pillar of the community and integrity was presupposed, but there have been eras with less scrutiny and transparency than today. In Southport, we had our own council for many decades, but even that council had unfortunate episodes featuring a certain Mr. Poulson and prominent councillors, some of whom I am sad to say were Liberals and got themselves into trouble. Some of them went to jail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para29"><a name="08100731000342">I was a councillor for 13 years, party leader and eventually council leader. I can honestly say that during my time on Sefton council, which now covers Southport, I detected no corruption and was genuinely impressed by the rigorous checks and balances, particularly when finance and contracts were involved. During that period there were plenty of development and contestable planning applications, but that may not have been the pattern elsewhere, although I believe that it was the general pattern throughout the UK. It was probably less obviously the pattern where councils were a one-party state, and decisions were not necessarily made in the open, and transfers of political power were not seriously contested or were a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para30"><a name="08100731000343">I do not deny that during that period there was a litany of sad cases in journals such as <i>Private Eye</i>, which detailed some of the things that went wrong, but my view was that councillors are genuinely people of integrity by and large, and that councils are generally free of corruption. Notwithstanding that, I have encountered&#151;and still encounter&#151;members of the public who assure me that corruption is the norm and seem not to think it insulting to say so volubly, even in the presence of public servants who administer public affairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="81007h0009.htm_para31"><a name="08100731000344">The reality for most councillors is that there is not much glory or respect at the moment, but a lot of hard work, many complaints and sometimes little recognition for addressing those complaints and dealing with them. They accept, by and large, that the ultimate judge of their worth is the electorate, who hire and fire them. For years, that assessment has been thought to be sufficient. Councillors have been subject to criminal, constitutional, civil and administrative law, and ultimately the electorate&#146;s verdict. For many years, that recipe stood councillors in good stead and ensured that they were good citizens and that councils were run openly, transparently and legitimately. However, it was thought, as much by the Labour Government as anyone else, not to work too well when elections were uncontested or a foregone conclusion. Some people believed that the Labour Government did not do enough in such circumstances to raise the standards and calibre of councillors. Without being too blunt about it, it was thought that drunks, thugs and venial people were sometimes elected notwithstanding the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para0"><a name="08100731000345">The idea of a standards board moved up the agenda and eventually became law. An alternative might have been to make the electoral system more vital and elections more contested in areas where corruption had set in or was more apparent. The basic idea of a standards board is to have a code of conduct and a set of desirable principles and qualities for public life that can be modestly stated, agreed and observed by all. That was accepted, at least initially, as a rational solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para1"><a name="08100731000346">When I first became an MP, I was surprised to receive, as I am sure did other hon. Members, a huge bundle of forms for my surgery from the Standards Board for England inciting people to lodge formal complaints. I could not imagine their all being used legitimately or being required. That annoyed me a little because my observation is that very few councillors merit a formal complaint, although I can think of a few members of the public who could use the whole package and still ask for more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para2"><a name="08100731000347">I raised that experience at the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government when the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas) was the Minister in charge. By and large, he agreed that such touting for custom was not the way to proceed because it was a heavy-handed approach and led to complaints being used as an electoral and political tool, with complaints often being made just prior to or during elections, and so on. It also led to overload of the Standards Board and had a lack of clarity, particularly about whether complaints were legitimate because they involved a councillor&#146;s public role, or were simply applied to a councillor as a person. Councillors do not have to be saints, but there was lack of clarity about whether they should be judged on their public performance as a councillor or their behaviour as a private individual, and those two aspects of their lives were not always significantly differentiated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para3"><a name="08100731000348">I supported the change in law that suggested that local determination and local committees provided a better process for the less serious complaints. The reasons struck me as persuasive at the time. First, local committees had a better understanding of local government issues, and some of the original members of the Standards Board had an almost unworldly character. Secondly, politically motivated complaints were likely to be scented out fairly early and seen for what they were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para4"><a name="08100731000349">I am questioning now whether local determination is leading to an unacceptable variation in practice, whether the rules, legislation and statutory instruments circumscribing it allow for that, and whether the Government and the Standards Board, which still has an overall watching brief, recognise that and are prepared to tolerate it or wish to redress the balance and deal with the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para5"><a name="08100731000350">The best way to illustrate that is to refer again to my local borough, Sefton, as an example. Its references to the local standards committee have reached almost epidemic proportions. Having served on that council, I regard that with bemusement because the vast majority of councillors are decent and some are almost saintly, although I must add that an ex-mayor recently went to jail for a criminal offence, but that is not typical in Sefton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para6"><a name="08100731000351">The worst Standards Board case that I recall in Sefton in recent times is of one councillor threatening to &#147;get&#148; another after a meeting. During the poll tax period when the atmosphere on many councils could be fairly abrasive, I remember a senior councillor threatening to rip the arm from a colleague of mine during a policy and resources meeting, which continued unfazed with no one commenting because the event was not imminent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para7"><a name="08100731000352">The stricture in this case and the Standards Board&#146;s activities may be a sign of genuine progress if it persuades councillors to behave more politely and rationally. However, most cases in Sefton never get as far as having a verdict determined or a positive finding reached, usually on the permitted ground that complaints as stated do not justify the expense of investigating them. That is a kind of catch-all clause because it can apply irrespective of the complexity of the case. In other words, a complaint might be quite trivial and easy to bottom out, but because it is quite trivial it might be discarded on the grounds that the expense simply is not worth it, even though the expense might be relatively trivial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para8"><a name="08100731000353">Complaints have sometimes been rejected on the grounds that defamatory comment is robust debate, which leaves councillors genuinely uncertain about what the limitations of robust debate are. Occasionally, a formal complaint has been dismissed simply on the grounds that it is political, without mentioning the substance of the complaint itself. The common thread through many of these cases is the avoidance of a finding of fact, which is a crucial element of the decisions to be made. That leaves a twofold level of uncertainty for members: whether the conduct as described took place or whether it is simply an allegation, and even if the allegation took place, if such a verdict is arrived at, whether it would be a breach of the code. I find that somewhat unsatisfactory. At the end of the day, if the rulings do not leave councillors more certain about where they stand and what to do, the system is not working as well as it could.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para9"><a name="08100731000354">This situation has not stopped decision notices failing to make it clear that no finding of fact has taken place. I would like to mention one case. A charge or allegation was made against an experienced and respected councillor, for which there was no finding of fact. In effect, the complaint was thrown out, but the offences that he might have been guilty of, if he had been guilty, were listed at length. In addition, there was a suggestion that he went on a course that might or might not have been appropriate to the issue. There was no verdict or finding of fact, but the person concerned found he could not appeal against what was obviously an acquittal and the political opposition had a feast day in the press at his expense. That is a grotesque failure of natural justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para10"><a name="08100731000355">I suspect that all that case illustrates is that the local standards committees in Sefton and other places are under pressure, and that is not helped if frivolous complaints emerge or a tit-for-tat culture prevails. I suspect that the experiences of those in Sefton are not particularly unique and that such problems are occurring elsewhere. The foibles of the local committees can be as various and arbitrary as premier league referees are considered to be by football teams, in relation to which the same uncertainty and difficulties prevail. However, there is one important difference, and this is a very serious thing: the reputation of councillors is at stake. That is very important to councillors, not just because  <br>

 It is a pleasure, Mr. Key, to speak with you in the Chair the first time that I respond to a debate in my new role. I congratulate the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) on securing this debate. He and I served on the Public Accounts Committee, on which he still sits, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to discuss the conduct regime for members of local authorities in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para12"><a name="08100731000358">I am aware that the hon. Gentleman takes a keen interest in this matter, not only because of his 13 years as a councillor in Sefton, but as a member of the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government. This is the first Adjournment debate on the important issue of standards since the new regime, and it is particularly welcome as it gives me the opportunity not only to get off the mark, but to reassert the Government&#146;s support for the conduct regime for local authority members. I would also like to mention the Government&#146;s gratitude for the hard work of the Standards Board for England and the work of local authority standards committees. In the same way that premiership referees are not thanked enough, local authority standards committees are not thanked enough, and therefore I would like to thank them this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para13"><a name="08100731000359">It is now almost six months since the Government devolved responsibility for dealing with the conduct of local authority members to local authorities themselves, so it is an apt time to hold this debate. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the tenor and spirit in which his comments were made. To be blunt, there is only one thing in the history he articulated with which I would disagree. As someone who was a councillor for only 12 years, I can say that the events in Wandsworth were nowhere near as flowery and colourful as they appear to have been in Sefton. I cannot think of one occasion on which anyone was threatened with having their arms ripped off, but I will check with other colleagues about whether that happened in Wandsworth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para14"><a name="08100731000360">This debate gives me the opportunity to mention the extremely effective alternative action procedures, which are a fundamental aspect of the conduct regime and generally work well. The vast majority of people elected to serve as local authority members observe the highest standards of conduct, as do the officials who support them. I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman addressed that in his speech and made the point that there might be problems with only a minority of councillors or officials. Trust in our local authority members is one of the cornerstones of healthy local democracy. Voters expect the local authority members for whom they voted to represent their interests and to behave with honesty and integrity, which is why actively promoting high standards of behaviour among local authority members is an important Government objective, and it is not a duty we take lightly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para15"><a name="08100731000361">The strength of local democracy and the delivery of effective services depend very much on an elected members&#146; willingness to serve and on their commitment. It would be awful if hurdles and barriers were put in the way to stop people or deter them from coming forward to stand for local government and become local councillors. Many men and women devote their time and energy to the service of their communities as local authority members and, as stated in the recent White Paper, &#147;Communities in Control: real people, real power&#148;, we want more people to take on civic roles and to stand for office in their local authority. We also want to ensure that local authority members are an able, enthusiastic and diverse group and that local representatives reflect the communities they serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para16"><a name="08100731000362">In this country, we have high standards of probity, accountability and objectivity. That is part of the natural expectations of those we vote for, and it is enshrined in the conduct regime. However, we cannot ignore the fact that failings do occur from time to time, and there have been cases, albeit rare, where the conduct of local authority members has fallen short of the expectations placed upon them. When such misconduct occurs, it damages both the community that the local authority members were elected to serve and the wider reputation of local government. The public&#146;s trust and confidence in the democratic system as a whole is undermined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para17"><a name="08100731000363">The hon. Gentleman alluded to the conduct regime, which was introduced in the Local Government Act 2000 to promote high standards of ethical behaviour by local authority members. The regime gives a clear ethical framework for local authority members to work within and makes clear to the electorate the standards of behaviour they can expect from those they vote into office. The regime also clarifies what constitutes acceptable standards of behaviour and has introduced an independent, robust and fair means of investigating allegations of misconduct. A regime was set up for dealing with those who have fallen short of acceptable standards of behaviour, and that regime is evolving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para18"><a name="08100731000364">Last year, a revised code of conduct for local authority members was issued to provide a clearer, simpler and more proportionate code&#151;I emphasise the word &#147;proportionate&#148;. That code removed barriers to members being able to speak up for those they represent, for example on planning and licensing issues, and it has been well received by the local government world. All local authority members must abide by that code of conduct, which has been in place for over a year now, and my Department&#151;I say that on just my second day in this role&#151;has just gone out to consultation on it. We are asking for views on how it is functioning and how it might be improved. In May this year, the Government fulfilled their White Paper commitment to introduce a more locally based conduct regime for members that co-opted members of local authorities in England. The devolution of responsibility for conduct issues to local authorities provides them with greater ownership of the conduct regime and local conduct issues, and boosts their role in promoting and maintaining a culture of high standards of behaviour in local authorities.</p>

performing well, the national board does not have the remit to receive complaints about it. If people believe, for whatever reason, that the standards board is not up to the job, taking that further is almost impossible. That is an omission in the legislation, and I am questioning whether the ministerial team have a mind to change it in any way.</p>

<p><a name="st_100"><a name="08100731000366"><a name="81007h0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="08100731000585"><b>Mr. Khan:</b>
 I can tell the hon. Gentleman, on day two in my job, that we shall shortly lay before Parliament legislation to enable the Standards Board to suspend a standards committee&#146;s local assessment of complaints functions if it believes that to be necessary. That will be a last resort, following work with the local authorities to help them to improve the way in which standards issues are addressed locally. I hope that when the hon. Gentleman issues his press release, the glory will be shared between him and me for the progress that has been made on day two of my job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para19"><a name="08100731000367">I did not finish the point that I was making before the hon. Gentleman&#146;s very useful intervention. The belief in devolving down is shared by all those in local government. I know that he and his party believe in devolving down. The move to devolve responsibility was in line with the 10th report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, published in 2005, which recommended that high standards of conduct by local authority members are more likely to be guaranteed when most decision making on conduct is undertaken by local authorities. The Standards Board for England, which until that point had been responsible for investigating alleged breaches of the code of conduct, assumed its new responsibility as a light-touch regulator of local authority standards committees, responsible for monitoring their performance and issuing guidance on the conduct regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para20"><a name="08100731000368">Under the devolved conduct regime, allegations that a member of an authority has failed to comply with the code of conduct are initially assessed by the local authority&#146;s own standards committee, as has been said. That assessment is in essence a filtering stage. No decision is taken at that stage about whether a member has, or has not, failed to comply with the code of conduct. Any decision on whether there has been a failure to comply with the code&#151;in other words, a decision about guilt or innocence&#151;is determined in all but the most serious cases by a hearing of the standards committee after a full investigation of the allegation has been undertaken. The more serious allegations of misconduct are determined by the quasi-judicial adjudication panel for England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para21"><a name="08100731000369">I know that the hon. Gentleman is interested in alternative action procedures and I shall now deal with those in slightly more detail. There is no doubt that elected members of a local authority who abuse their position or abuse others should be brought to book. That is what the conduct regime is there for, but often cases are not so clear-cut and can be the result of more complicated, deep-seated issues. Perhaps there has been a breakdown in working relationships, a long-standing dispute over a contentious issue, or a lack of training. The hon. Gentleman will recognise some of the descriptions from the example to which he alluded in Sefton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para22"><a name="08100731000370">Recognising that cases are often not clear-cut, several years ago, Standards Board investigators sought and received the power to use their discretion in certain  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 Oct 2008">

cases and, after examining them, to recommend an action other than full investigation&#151;typically, facilitating mediation between disputing parties, whether two members of an authority, a member of the public and a member of the authority, or an officer of the authority and a member. The Standards Board considers that such an approach often yields the most successful, long-standing solutions. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of examples in which the complainant is an activist from one political party and makes a complaint against an elected councillor from another political party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para23"><a name="08100731000371">When the new ethical framework was introduced this year, alternative action was therefore built into the system at an early stage. The devolved regime gives standards committees, if they consider that the merits of individual cases make it appropriate, the option to refer a matter for alternative action, rather than investigate it. That means that instead of an allegation of misconduct resulting in a full investigation and possibly a sanction, the matter can be quickly addressed at an early stage through alternative action, such as mediation, training or a review of the local authority&#146;s procedures. Under the devolved conduct regime, indications are that about 9 per cent. of allegations result in their being referred for alternative action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para24"><a name="08100731000372">That is not a quick fix, and it will not be right in all circumstances. There is a right time and place for it to be used, but it is a useful tool, as it recognises that a problem has arisen and it attempts to deal with that problem in the most pragmatic way possible. Importantly&#151;this is the nub of the concern that has been raised&#151;such a recommendation does not, and should not, imply guilt. That course of action is consistent with other regimes that deal with complaints about individuals. I should make it clear that I am not advocating that all allegations that a local authority receives should be dealt with by action other than an investigation, or that there should be any default approach. The suitability of alternative action depends on the nature of the allegation. What is, I hope, apparent is that such a measure lends itself to allegations that might be judged to be less serious, where alternative action might be the most proportionate and cost-effective way of resolving an allegation.</p>

<p><a name="st_101"><a name="08100731000373"><a name="81007h0010.htm_spnew2"><a name="08100731000586"><b>Dr. Pugh:</b>
 There is a difficulty of which I hope the Minister is aware. When someone is charged with a motoring offence and found not guilty, they will not subsequently be advised to take extra driving lessons or something like that, because that would almost imply a not proven verdict. It would imply that there was a belief on the part of the committee that the person was guilty as charged, but it tried to give them a softer deal. There is a difficulty in proposing an alternative course of action that is appropriate to the allegation, if it is true, when the allegation has not been found to be true, because that can leave the person in the worst possible world of having been acquitted on the issue of fact but still, in the eyes of the public, being held to be generally guilty.</p>

 With respect, is the hon. Gentleman right? As an ex-lawyer, I am all in favour of litigation&#151;as a Minister, I am not, I hasten to add&#151;but there are examples in which people who could receive three points on their licence are encouraged to do a training session to avoid receiving a sanction.

Marks and Spencer or other shops may be discourteous and rude, a complaint is made and they receive training to be less discourteous and less rude. There are examples in which training, rather than a stick, has an important role to play. I would expect more of a carrot approach, rather than the stick approach, from the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="st_103"><a name="08100731000375"><a name="81007h0010.htm_spnew4"><a name="08100731000588"><b>Dr. Pugh:</b>
 I want to come back on that. When someone receives three points on their licence, that is because there has been a definite finding against them in the case. They might be offered something as an alternative, and many people would accept that. There is a presumption of guilt, and they are offered something as an alternative, rather than the full penalty. If, however, someone is wholly innocent of a driving offence&#151;their driving has been completely blameless&#151;but they are sent on a driving course after being acquitted, they will feel a bit raw about that, will they not?</p>

<p><a name="st_104"><a name="08100731000376"><a name="81007h0010.htm_spnew5"><a name="08100731000589"><b>Mr. Khan:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman raises a very important point, to which I am coming&#151;the foundation of guilt. I think that that is the point to which he has alluded in correspondence. I understand that he has concerns that when an allegation is referred for action other than investigation, the subject of the allegation is not afforded an opportunity to have their name cleared. Let me assure him that in terms of the conduct regime, that concern is without foundation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para25"><a name="08100731000377">I do not for a moment underestimate the fact that the subjects of allegation, breach of the code, innocence and guilt are very sensitive matters. Reputations are important in local democracies where the candidate and the voter trade in the currency of trust. However, let me reiterate&#151;this is explicitly stated in the guidance issued by the Standards Board&#151;that if a decision is made to refer a matter for alternative action, everyone involved in the process should be made aware that the purpose of alternative action is not to determine whether an individual has failed to comply with the code of conduct, and it should be clear that no finding of guilt or innocence can or should be made. The hon. Gentleman is right to distinguish the example that was given from one in which there is evidence&#151;for example, in the case of a motoring offence, a camera has taken a photograph of someone speeding through the light.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="81007h0010.htm_para26"><a name="08100731000378">As I have explained, one of the roles of the Standards Board is to offer advice and guidance about the conduct regime to local authority standards committees. That is an important part of the board&#146;s work. A robust conduct regime, trusted by local authority members and the people who vote for them alike, is an essential part of supporting the trust in local government to make local democracy function. I welcome the contribution that the hon. Gentleman has made to this important area, and I look forward to working with him over the coming months and years to improve the system  even more.</p>

 It is a pleasure, Mr. Key, to serve under your chairmanship, as you are familiar with Plymouth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para0"><a name="08100731000380">Plymouth is the largest city on the south coast of England, with a population of about 250,000. On 1 April 2008 there were nearly 116,000 dwellings in Plymouth, with 77,000 in owner-occupation. That is 5 per cent. below the United Kingdom average. There are some 15,000 homes in the private rented sector, and 22,000 in the social rented sector, of which about 15,000 are owned by registered social landlords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para1"><a name="08100731000381">Plymouth is one of 29 new growth points that are working with the Government to create large-scale sustainable growth in order to take our population up to 300,000 or more. I, of course, welcome the support that comes with that designation. There is a buy-in to the growth agenda across all the key public and private-sector players that, if not unique&#151;I heard the regional spatial strategy debate earlier today while finalising this speech&#151;is certainly unusual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para2"><a name="08100731000382">Plymouth has some award-winning regeneration going on across the waterfront&#151;from Gun Wharf to the Devonport urban village, and from the Mount Wise estate to Millbay and the East End renewal project. Those projects now in progress seem on the whole to be reporting that their plans are set to weather the current global storms in the financial markets, but there is no doubt that plans over the next few years to build on those programmes are already being affected by the current very uncertain and difficult circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para3"><a name="08100731000383">Unemployment in the city has reduced greatly, but it remains the second highest in the region. Average annual earnings are &#163;17,688 and the average house price is &#163;157,000. House prices are more than eight times the average income. Fifty-two per cent. of the working population earn less than &#163;20,000. The income needed for the average priced property is nearly &#163;40,000, and for the cheapest an entry income of &#163;32,000 is needed. With home buying that expensive, it is little wonder that home ownership in the city is 5 per cent. below the national average.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para4"><a name="08100731000384">Those circumstances already existed before the profound shocks in the financial system had such a devastating knock-on effect across the world. We are learning how important trust and co-operation are within our systems, and what happens when those values seize up. First-time buyers will, of course, find the drop in house prices welcome; but the truth is that as long as the demand for homes runs ahead of supply, which it will continue to do, the need to build many more homes remains if we are not to return to the huge increases seen particularly in the last few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para5"><a name="08100731000385">That is very different from the United States, where the housing market is failing for different reasons&#151;a housing surplus, horrendously bad lending practices and the knock-on effects for its financial systems and those of the rest of the world. House prices are falling in the UK because of the global financial crisis, but predictions from the national affordable housing planning unit are that affordability still matters and that the ratio  <br>

There is the vision for the built environment developed by world renowned town planner David Mackay; there is the local development framework of our award-winning planning team; and there is the plan of the City Development Company, led by chief executive Paul Carrol. The development company was launched recently to deliver the growth in jobs&#151;42,000 of them&#151;to match the growth in population from 250,000 to at least 300,000, identified by David Mackay as being the critical mass at which our community would function better in all sorts of ways.

That was very much in line with the Government&#146;s stated policy. Somehow or other&#151;I hope inadvertently&#151;the Secretary of State seems to have removed that hierarchical approach and restored 21 communities across the region to a position of equal consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para10"><a name="08100731000390">We want to help the Government address their agenda of tackling regional disparities and creating sustainable communities and a big enough supply of homes. However, confidence that the necessary levels of support will be focused on growth points such as Plymouth has been undermined. We want to help the Government, but we need clarity to be restored to the spatial strategy if we are to have the self-confidence and the investor confidence to go forward with our ambitious plans, especially in the present economic climate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para11"><a name="08100731000391">Formal submissions on this stage of the strategy are due in later this month, and I will certainly be putting in a formal representation&#151;as, no doubt, will others. However, I take this opportunity to flag up the issue in the hope that it will be reviewed at the earliest possible stage. Nowhere in the country is as positively engaged with the Government&#146;s agenda as Plymouth, but we need consistency in the Government&#146;s support for our growth point status. Nor should our growth in population and housing be just about numbers; it must also be about getting the right mix of tenure.</p>

Today, I want to build on the discussions that I have already had with the Minister and his colleagues on the key issue in the report&#151;how to get some important rungs put back on the bottom of the house buyer&#146;s ladder.

21st century solutions for Plymouth&#148;, those rungs can be restored by improving the supply of houses in the intermediate market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para13"><a name="08100731000393">Whenever shared equity and affordable housing products come on the market, there is great demand for them. However, the part-buy and shared-equity market is small, and in the sort of market that I have described in Plymouth, it plays a limited role in connection with the affordability issue. For example, two executive civil servants aiming to share a home would still be hard-pressed to afford the joint mortgage or rent and service charge on a typical shared-equity property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para14"><a name="08100731000394">That is not to say that those options do not have an important role to play alongside the new initiative that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government launched with the Prime Minister, of rent with an option to buy as part of the welcome &#163;l billion package to support the housing market that was announced on 2 September 2008. As they stand, however, they will not tackle the widening affordability gap, ensuring that the rungs on the bottom of the house-buyers&#146; ladder are within reach of people who would be able to afford to buy in those parts of the country where the ratio of house prices to average earnings is more in kilter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para15"><a name="08100731000395">Difficulties often bring opportunities. Among the dark clouds that presently beset the international financial system, I believe that there is such a window of opportunity&#151;a golden one&#151;to address the issue in Plymouth, much of southern England and perhaps elsewhere. In my report, I sought to bring together the concept of the local housing company and the community land trust. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for responding to representations from me and from my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) to include a definition of a CLT in the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para16"><a name="08100731000396">For such a model to work, the land would need to be gifted&#151;or, in DCLG speak, made into an asset transfer to the community. It would be held in trust and, through mutual co-operative ownership, people would own a share in the bricks and mortar. The homes built on it would become the asset in which the individual invests. It is the value of the land that drives up the cost of home ownership, so such a model would provide for sustainable affordable housing; it would put those important rungs back on the bottom of the ladder and back within reach of those with modest incomes. Other models attempt to create sustainable affordable housing, but none that I know of performs the role of keeping those important bottom rungs permanently within the reach of first-time buyers, who would otherwise be blocked from buying and unwillingly trapped in renting&#151;and which would add to pressures on the rented sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para17"><a name="08100731000397">The Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 has given legal definition to the community land trust. I therefore hope that Plymouth will give serious consideration to combining the concept of the CLT with the development of the local housing company to make best use of the precious little land that we have for building. A CLT would mean that the land never left the ownership of the community&#151;and now is the time to make that happen.</p>

permanently affordable intermediate market in housing should take centre stage nationally, becoming a relevant part of our response to the profound shocks that we are witnessing daily in the international financial markets. In the present circumstances, mortgage loans for standard shared-ownership products could become increasingly difficult if not impossible to obtain. Because of the lack of liquidity in the credit markets, mortgage lenders are likely to seek to lend scarce mortgage funds to prime borrowers on the open market who can afford a deposit of at least 20 per cent. At the same time, pension funds and assurance companies will be looking for debt investment secured on good-quality residential property assets, rather than high-risk, asset-backed securities. Mutual home ownership on land owned by CLTs offers the opportunity of a unique and attractive debt investment, secured through corporate loans on occupied residential property assets, which would generate a guaranteed and attractive yield for pension funds and life assurance companies that are seeking to match yields to liabilities on a low-risk basis. Mutual models of home ownership are attractive partly because they have a good track record of payment compliance, and therefore low default rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para19"><a name="08100731000399">In the new realities of the financial markets in the UK, restoring trust and co-operation are premium considerations, so I hope that the Government will prioritise an examination of the opportunities offered by the model. As well as restoring those important bottom rungs to the house-buying ladder, it can help the economy in the face of the logjams that the financial crisis has created, draw investor funds back into the market and deliver affordable new homes, because of its low-risk nature. The mortgage and financial mechanisms have been tried and tested in Canada.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para20"><a name="08100731000400">I hope that Ministers will be prepared to listen to the few people in this country who have experience of the model and that they will prioritise time to understand the detailed financial analysis, which shows its relevance as part of the response to the challenges that we face. We have lost many checks and balances in the whirlwind of globalisation, and the model is one check that can be put back&#151;the situation is crying out for action now. I hope that the Minister will urge the new Minister for Housing to give her urgent and serious consideration to the matter, and to meet me, my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud and the chief executive of CDS Co-operatives, David Rodgers, to explore it more fully.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Will the Minister reaffirm the Government&#146;s commitment to social rented housing? In the current financial climate, it is essential to my constituents. I should like to place on the record my belief that a vote in support of the stock transfer proposal, which is going ahead at the moment in Plymouth, is vital if tenants&#146; homes are to be improved further and if they are to have a greater say in how their estates are managed. That change, with those outlined by my hon. Friend, are vital for the quality of the housing offer across all tenures in Plymouth.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. That is the only way in which to bring quality into that sector of housing in Plymouth, and I support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para23"><a name="08100731000405">There are some excellent private landlords in the city, and the city council has worked well alongside them to transform the landscape of the traditional private rented sector. Plymouth&#146;s award-winning empty homes team have a variety of projects, including the HouseLet programme, and since 2003 they have secured private sector houses for 505 families through a highly successful leasing scheme. That is a model of exceptionally good practice and merits support for growth in the present climate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para24"><a name="08100731000406">I was prompted to look into housing in Plymouth by, among other things, a Saturday morning roving surgery that brought me face to face with a woman who had moved, with her children, five times in five years in the private rented sector. Shorthold tenancies can run counter to the good work that is being done to support families, so I hope that the Government are serious about reviewing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para25"><a name="08100731000407">Support for voluntary downsizing could also release a lot of family-sized homes. I do not want the forced removal of tenants to smaller homes, and would fight against any such move, but some home owners and tenants who want to live in smaller, lower-cost, better-maintained homes are often prevented from doing so by bureaucracy, petty rules, petty sums of finance, or simply the lack of someone to offer advice and practical help. There are better ways to manage such demand to the benefit of both the tenant who moves and the tenant who is waiting for a larger home. It would be a big help if support services could free up even a third of what I believe to be around 1,000 two to three-bedroomed houses in Plymouth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para26"><a name="08100731000408">The turbulence in the world markets and the credit crunch do not take away the need for more homes in the UK. It is vital that the Government face up to the challenge of maintaining their programme of house building in such difficult circumstances. More than anything, my report brought home to those involved in its drafting that if we do not get things right now, we will condemn a generation to a housing market with limited, and sometimes no, choice. By restoring the rungs on the bottom of the house ownership ladder, we would facilitate both things. By enabling house purchase and shared equity, especially of the CLT variety, the pressure on renting, particularly in the social sector, is relieved.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Key, so soon after the bruising debate earlier this morning. I too congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy) on securing this debate. I recall with affection our debate on growth in Plymouth in April. Its scope was ambitious, and showed the huge growth potential in her constituency. That ambition has not changed over the summer&#151;indeed, if anything, the appetite for ambition and growth seems to be stronger than ever. I congratulate her on her excellent report &#147;Homes for the Future: 21st Century Solutions for Plymouth&#148;. She is right to focus on the fundamentals and beyond the short-term turbulence to the medium and long-term future, and on what should be done to meet future needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para28"><a name="08100731000411">As she is aware, the Government&#146;s objective is to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live in a decent home that they can afford, in a community where they want to live. To achieve that, we need first and foremost to increase the supply of all types of housing, including, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck), social, market-led or intermediate housing. The National Housing and Planning Advice Unit says that we need to build something like 250,000 additional homes each year to meet the imbalance between the demand and supply of housing, which is caused by social change, longer living and the fact that people move around and live differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para29"><a name="08100731000412">Although the credit crunch has reduced activity in the housing market to a low level&#151;I shall go on to say how it directly affects Plymouth&#151;the Government are determined to mitigate short-term difficulties and to prepare to ensure that housing delivery resumes as quickly as possible, when the inevitable upturn happens, when conditions allow. That includes ensuring sufficient headroom within the planning system to allow for a rapid recovery of housing supply to meet long-term demand. Major, cross-Government packages of measures to meet the current challenges in the housing market have been announced on 16 July and, more recently, on 2 September. They will do three things: first, they will help first-time buyers; secondly, they seek to minimise the risk of repossessions; and thirdly, they offer greater resources and more flexibility for councils and housing associations to build or purchase properties, which will help to reignite and kick-start the construction industry. The measures will also provide confidence and address the long-term challenges of affordable housing.</p>

record of housing delivery and planning for growth in recent years. I am confident that it will be in a position to respond quickly and effectively to an upturn in housing. For example, house building in the city has trebled from about 400 units a year in 2003 to about 1,200 units a year between 2004 and 2007. The local area agreement set a target of 1,000 net additional houses, under national indicator 154, for the next three years. That reflects the submitted regional spatial strategy before the proposed changes were published in July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para31"><a name="08100731000414">Last year, Plymouth was the first large urban authority to adopt a new-style core strategy, which provided for at least 17,250 extra homes by 2021. It subsequently adopted five action plans focusing on key regeneration areas and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton mentioned, it is in partnership with the Government as a new growth point. The partnership, which includes South Hams, was allocated &#163;3.4 million for infrastructure projects in 2008-09 and a further &#163;6.3 million for the period 2009 to 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="81007h0011.htm_para32"><a name="08100731000415">As I have mentioned, the credit crunch, which is uppermost in our minds at the moment, has had a major impact on construction contracts in both Devonport and Millbay. Sales have come to a halt, as first-time buyers are unable to access mortgages and developers are therefore reluctant to build. In response, the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships are working with registered social landlords, the city council and developers to restore developers&#146; confidence and ensure that such important developments are delivered. To do so, they are considering making use of the &#163;1 billion housing package to which I have referred, particularly to support the renewed emphasis on investment and flexibility and to bring forward resources for up-front infrastructure.</p>

 I do not want to hark back to earlier debates, but in the debate in April on growth in Plymouth I was struck by how much my hon.

Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton made an interesting point about the importance of the private rented sector in addressing housing need, about which I agree with her. She mentioned previous legislation on the matter, and I can tell her that the Housing Act 1988 was intended to achieve a balance between the rights of tenants and those of landlords, and to make it easier for landlords to regain possession. One result was that the sector has expanded, with the number of households living in the private rented sector growing from something like 8 per cent. and falling in the mid-1980s to 12 per cent. now. That demonstrates the fact that the changes have had a positive effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="81007h0012.htm_para6"><a name="08100731000427">My hon. Friend will be aware of the Rugg review. The Government commissioned an independent review of the private rented sector from Julie Rugg of the university of York. It will be about how we can better understand the private rented sector and increase the professionalism of landlords across the board. I believe that the Rugg review will be published on about 23 October, and the Government will examine it very closely.</p>

Friend&#146;s speech seemed to be how we can help people to get a foot on the first rung of the housing ladder. I have mentioned a variety of ways, but one important one is staircasing and the right to staircase up as and when circumstances allow, in which I am very interested. She will be aware of the Government-funded homebuy scheme, which is sufficiently flexible to enable low-cost home ownership properties to be retained when it is essential and, as an important aside, to meet the needs of purchasers with disabilities. Generally, we want shared owners to increase their equity stake when they can afford to do so, and to move to full ownership. Receipts from the sales of shares are reinvested by housing associations to help other households. However, to retain properties when it is essential to do so, newer shared ownership leases under the new build homebuy scheme contain a right of first refusal. It requires purchasers who have increased their equity stake to 100 per cent., and wish to move, to offer the property back to the provider in the first instance.</p>

Friends the Members for Plymouth, Sutton and for Plymouth, Devonport and by mentioning community land trusts. My hon. Friends the Members for Plymouth, Sutton and for Stroud (Mr. Drew) have been invaluable in pushing forward that agenda. As has been acknowledged, we put a definition of community land trusts in the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 to help to provide lenders with certainty and confidence. I have no doubt that, thanks to the hard work that my hon. Friends have pushed forward, we will go further and the idea of social enterprise and co-operation will be invaluable in meeting the short-term challenges to provide the housing that we need for the long term in Plymouth and elsewhere.</p>
