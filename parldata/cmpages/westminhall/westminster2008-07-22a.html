 I thank the Speaker&#146;s Office and the shuffle. I am not sure what is involved in securing a debate, but I have applied every week for this one on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), who is sitting next to me on the Front Bench. We feel that it is extremely important to highlight the five post offices in my constituency, the two in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe and the seven in that of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield that are earmarked for closure.</p>

Only minutes before this sitting, I was notified by the office of the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs that that Minister would not be able to reply to the debate. Perhaps he is suffering from post office debate fatigue; with the large number of post offices all over the country earmarked for closure, I can imagine that he might be sick and tired, but it is extremely disrespectful to my constituents and the people who are so desperately worried about the loss of their facilities for him to deem that he has a more important meeting. I exchanged words with him on the phone this morning and told him that I would raise that point in the debate.</p>

I start the debate with regret that I am faced with a different Minister who does not hold the post offices brief, but I am delighted to welcome him to his place. I know that he is a very competent Energy Minister. I hope that he will exhibit the usual reading skills of Ministers drafted in at short notice.</p>

represent, have been campaigning to save the post offices. The odd political point is made by some of the other parties, but they have clearly rallied behind the five post offices earmarked for closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08072258000015">The closures will result in further decimation of our close-knit communities and put pressure on our rural communities, villages and towns, particularly in Old Amersham. I know that the Post Office has deemed that it must close 2,500 branches, and in some ways I do not blame it, but almost half the post offices in the UK double as shops, as the Minister will know. My constituency is no exception. All the post offices concerned have an associated retail outlet. Over the years, post offices have found, particularly under the Labour Government, that their profitability and the amount of trade they can carry on has been reduced, whether by the BBC&#146;s removal of their ability to issue licences or the Government&#146;s removal of the facility for people to receive payments through the post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08072258000016">There is an iniquity to the whole process. If one post office is saved, another one goes. I have no wish to put other branches in my constituency under threat, but that is the situation in which we find ourselves. Due to the very nature of the closure programme, communities are pitted against each other, which is quite disturbing.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend share my incredulity that the policy that the Government and Post Office management appear to be pursuing applies a formula to determine which post offices should close and which should remain open? A post office might be economically viable and attract many customers, but if it falls outwith the parameters set by the formula in terms of its distance from a certain population, it can nevertheless be chosen for closure, irrespective of the views of its customers.</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="08072258000018"><a name="80722h0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="08072258000473"><b>Mrs. Gillan:</b>
 My hon. Friend raises an absolutely valid point that I was hoping to come to later. It is incredible that the Post Office can use formulaic deductions to close our post offices without considering what is happening in the community. The Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform acknowledged that by saying in a recent report on the network change programme that</p>
<a name="80722h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08072258000434"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;pure commercial logic cannot be the overriding factor here; the Post Office performs a social function&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08072258000019">If the social function of post offices is recognised, it goes against the grain to use any formula whatever for closing them.</p>

I have experienced the pain of earlier closure programmes in my constituency. I campaigned outside the Chesham Bois post office and the Holmer Green post office, and the Hyde Heath and White Lion road post offices have closed. I hope that the Minister will take this message back and that the Post Office will hear it loud and clear: I do not want our past failures to keep post offices open to be reflected in the latest round of closures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08072258000021">The further closure of a third of the network in my constituency will have a profound effect on the area.

other post offices, which will then become stretched beyond capacity. In the very worst cases, some of my local residents will not be able to access post offices at all. I also find it extraordinary that when everybody is so conscious of their carbon footprint and when we are trying to reduce the number of journeys made, the closure programme will increase the number of journeys made by car in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08072258000022">I shall start with Chalfont Common post office, which is run by Mrs. Aruna Soni. The post office is one of the most valued services in the area, and to deprive local residents of it seems ludicrous. As well as being situated in an area with a large retired population and a significant amount of social housing in an isolated position up a large hill, it happens to be right next door to a National Society for Epilepsy care facility, whose residents depend wholly on its services. One of the suggested alternatives, Chalfont St. Peter, is 1 mile away and Chalfont St. Giles is 1.9 miles away. Those are wholly impractical alternatives for the people served by the post office. The National Society for Epilepsy facility is home to 120 of my constituents with severe epilepsy. Many of them are wheelchair-bound, and none is allowed to drive, because of their illness. The other day, several residents turned up when I was protesting outside the post office. Many of them have suffered seizures, and so could not use the bus service anyway&#151;were it even adequate&#151;to access a post office. It would be extremely difficult to access that mode of transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08072258000023">The area is home to a large number of elderly people, many of whom can no longer drive. The route to Chalfont St. Peter involves an overall descent or climb of more than 120 ft, which includes a 200-yd hill, and negotiation of the A413. That might not represent a challenge to the Minister, or anyone in the younger generation, but it is almost impossible for those older residents. The only bus service&#151;the 355&#151;runs seven times a day, reduced to a mere five times a day for 20 weeks of the year, and there are no seats or shelters at the stops, which makes it wholly unsuitable for frail and elderly people. I hope, therefore, that the post office will remain open, not least so that it can continue to serve people in its immediate vicinity.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend share my view that the way in which the Post Office analyses the travelling needs of customers of the sub-post offices it proposes to close leaves a great deal to be desired? Two years ago, when four sub-post offices were closed in Aylesbury, in one case the mostly elderly users were advised to use an alternative that would have required them not only to walk the best part of a mile, but also to cross a railway line on a pedestrian level-crossing, even if they were using wheelchairs or Zimmer frames.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. who recalls the case correctly and adds considerably to the point about access difficulties that I am trying to highlight on behalf of my constituents.</p>

The service is second to none.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08072258000027">I turn to the post office in Old Amersham, which is run by Mr. Kuhanandan. That area, too, has a large retired population and a significant amount of social housing. I declare an interest, because I live around the corner from the post office and know it well. The older members of the community rely heavily on the post office, which provides not only an excellent social focus for the town, but an invaluable service for people who in many cases simply cannot make the trip to post offices further afield. The post office is located in the heart of the old town and provides a catalyst for many of the surrounding businesses. If it is ripped out of the heart of the old town, those businesses will suffer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08072258000028">The suggested alternative post office&#151;the one surviving post office in Amersham since the closure of the White Lion road post office&#151;has already been transferred from Sycamore road to the Londis shop on Hill avenue, which is run by Mr. and Mrs. Patel, but even now it is insufficient for the number of people it is supposed to serve. There are long queues and waiting times, and when its catchment area increases, to cover a population of what I calculate is about 28,000 people, the post office will become completely unfeasible for anyone who does not have a couple of hours to spare.</p>

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="08072258000029"><a name="80722h0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="08072258000476"><b>Mr. Lidington:</b>
 The experience in Aylesbury since four sub-post offices there were closed two years ago is exactly as my hon. Friend fears for her area. The queues at the remaining Crown post office in the centre of the town have increased, and in my experience it is commonplace to queue for a quarter of an hour or more. Some constituents have complained to me that they have to wait for up to 30 minutes for even the most straightforward of transactions.</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="08072258000030"><a name="80722h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="08072258000477"><b>Mrs. Gillan:</b>
 That is quite alarming. I certainly believe that if the catchment area of the one remaining post office in Top Amersham increases to cover the size of the population anticipated, there will indeed be many problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08072258000031">Furthermore, the journey from the old town to the top town is not only longer than the 0.9 miles the consultation document suggests, but encompasses either an unlit road or an unpaved and unlit footpath through woodlands, both of which are uphill. Such a journey would be wholly unfeasible for many of the town&#146;s elderly residents&#151;it might even be unfeasible for me! That needs to be taken firmly into consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08072258000032">Furthermore, the post office serves Amersham hospital, which has development plans, as we all know in Buckinghamshire. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and my hon. Friends the Members for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and for Wycombe and I, have often hunted as a pack in this Chamber on health matters. I believe that Amersham hospital wants to become a foundation trust and to increase out-patient numbers, which means that there will be increased footfall in the old town, and of course my hospital in Chalfont St. Peter is now faced with closure, so it looks as though there will be more patients in Amersham hospital, which is a mere stone&#146;s throw from the post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08072258000033">Old Amersham is charming, and I invite the Minister to visit my constituency&#151;purely for leisure purposes of course. The town is a gem&#151;all Buckinghamshire Members have them&#151;with some of the most beautiful and well  <br>

preserved 16th and 17th-century buildings. Tourism is an important part of life in Amersham; people visit our excellent museum and the old town hall, and come to shop in the town. The small independent retailers are a key part of the old town&#146;s quaint charm, to which the post office is crucial. It is a useful service, and if it is ripped out of the heart of the old town, the whole town will suffer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000034">I turn to Waterside and Mr. and Mrs. Patel. Waterside is a small but very friendly post office in the most deprived fifth of the Chiltern area, which includes a large hinterland of social housing. I have heard from a number of residents who do not have their own transport. They find the post office&#146;s location crucial to their lives. It lies just outside Chesham town centre and unclogs the Chesham post office, which already has a large number of customers&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury is nodding in agreement. Waterside post office acts almost as an overflow or relief valve for the main post office in Chesham, where queues and long delays are often reported through no fault of the postmaster or postmistress, but because the facility is so popular in my area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08072258000035">The local business community, including industrial complexes, lies in the post office&#146;s hinterland and often uses the post office to send packages&#151;I have stood and watched people do it. They will be inconvenienced by a drive into Chesham, which is often quite blocked with traffic, because it is so popular. The Waterside facility relieves the town centre of blockages caused by too much traffic going through it. It is also registered as a newsagent in the consultation document, but is actually more like a general store. Mr. and Mrs. Patel expect to lose half their income as a result of the post office closure, which would put the shop under threat, and would be a great loss to one of my constituency&#146;s deprived areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08072258000036">Another post office for closure in my area is in Botley stores. It is run by Mr. Thuraisingham, and when I visited it some of my constituents were very vocal in their support. The furthest alternatives are Chesham, at 1.7 miles, and Great Hivings, at 2.4 miles, to which there is no direct bus service. As I have said already, Chesham is overloaded, and if traffic is forced back into the town, owing not least to the need to travel up and down the hills in the area by car, congestion and the damage to the environment will increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08072258000037">I received a particularly sad note from a constituent of mine, Mr. Walker, who at 85 has a dodgy ankle, and whose wife has had a hip replacement. He said of the Chesham post office:</p>
<a name="80722h0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08072258000435"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It will be crippling to stand in that queue. You are lucky if you get out of that place in half an hour&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para22"><a name="08072258000038">That is because the post office is so popular; and the Botley stores post office provides it with some relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para23"><a name="08072258000039">Hilly terrain, a large retired population and a shop under threat&#151;is that not a common theme running through all the closures? It is a crying shame that the fabric that makes up our communities is being deconstructed.</p>

Minister&#146;s eyes are glazing over; he must have heard all this before, but it is a plea from the heart about a constituency that will be badly damaged.</p>

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="08072258000041"><a name="80722h0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08072258000478"><b>The Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b>
 I assure the hon. Lady that my eyes were not glazing over&#151;I understand the importance of local community. I was simply reflecting on the fact that the trend toward post office closure is not new. Considerable numbers were closed before 1997, but she has not talked about the reasons for that. To suggest that it is a feature only of this Government is misleading.</p>

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="08072258000042"><a name="80722h0001.htm_spnew7"><a name="08072258000479"><b>Mrs. Gillan:</b>
 I believe that 8,000 post offices have closed since 1979, but that 5,000 of them have closed since 1997, so the trend has been showing an increase. In my constituency, there has been a constant drip-effect from post offices being taken away from our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para25"><a name="08072258000043">I shall speak on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe for a moment. We have applied for this debate every week since the embargo was lifted, but we were unsuccessful until this eleventh hour. We are grateful for the debate, but my hon. Friend is on a plane, so he is physically incapable of being here. I pass on his apologies. However, I kindly offered to make some points on his behalf. He will suffer the closure of two post offices, one of which is the Desborough road branch in the Abbey ward of Wycombe. One of the three super output areas in that ward is ranked among the most deprived 10 per cent. in the country in terms of income deprivation for older people. That must mark the post office out as one that needs saving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para26"><a name="08072258000044">My hon. Friend was extremely surprised that the Post Office relied on him to notify it of the deprivation data for wards in which post offices are closing, rather than doing the research itself. That is a disturbing development, and I think something similar has happened in my area, for which the Post Office does not seem to have made a report&#151;it might be suffering from closure fatigue. Dare I suggest that its investigation into each and every branch has lost a little momentum as time has passed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para27"><a name="08072258000045">My hon. Friend would like to know how older and disabled people will reach alternative post offices in High Wycombe if his two post offices close, given that in both cases the nearest post office is more than half a mile away, and that High Wycombe has the hilly topography shared by all of us in the south Chilterns. In both cases, if customers from the closing post offices were to move to the two alternative post offices, they could have between 30 and 40 per cent. more customers a week, but there are currently no plans for additional positions at those post offices, so the rise would inevitably cause long queues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="80722h0001.htm_para28"><a name="08072258000046">In summary, the Minister must realise that our local communities are being broken up by the Government. The post office network provides a valuable service to some of the most vulnerable people in all our constituencies, which is why each closure must be examined in detail and why a reprieve must be handed out to the cases that merit it. Indeed, there is merit to many of my post offices remaining open because of the people they serve and the service they provide.</p>

minimising our carbon footprint? However, those are not the people I am particularly worried about; I am worried about those who will not be able to hop into a car. The Minister would find a surprising number of such people if he made a detailed study of each of my post offices. If public transport were better developed, I would have less of a case, but the public transport systems in south Buckinghamshire are weak, and we do not have the luxury of an integrated transport system that would comfortably connect up the remaining post offices. I shall be left with 10 post offices; five of the 15 in my constituency are closing under the formula that my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury mentioned.

The one thing I do know about the service here is that there is no service and that the customers, especially the elderly and the infirm, are irrelevant to you. In my working life, I never enjoyed the luxury of setting price increases without making economies, but not at the expense of the service I gave. Had my service gone down, I would have gone out of business. This is a service that is going down in our communities, and we need to fight for it.&#148;</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan). I thank her and congratulate her on securing the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para3"><a name="08072258000053">I have the misfortune of having more proposed post office closures in my constituency than any other Buckinghamshire MP&#151;no fewer than seven. They are the Denham Garden Village, Farnham Royal and Loudwater branches, the Old Town post office in Beaconsfield, the Oxford road post office in Denham, the Parade in Bourne End, and a branch in Wycombe lane, which is the road between Wooburn and Loudwater. The number of proposed changes contrasts with the earlier round in which my constituency seemed to escape lightly. Perhaps that is why this is now being inflicted on us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para4"><a name="08072258000054">There has been quite a movement to preserve local post offices and stores in my constituency over the years. In one case, in Hedgerley, which, mercifully, is not in the list, there was a long battle to preserve a post office when the old post office building was shut down.   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 July 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 176WH</b><br>
That was done by putting in a portakabin and reopening the post office at a new site, which proved very successful. There was a great deal of local support for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para5"><a name="08072258000055">The area that I represent is very wealthy. It is often commented on that the wealth indicators for south Buckinghamshire rank it as one of the two or three wealthiest constituencies in the United Kingdom. One area, Gerrards Cross, is without doubt the wealthiest place, per capita, in the UK&#151;both in its north and south wards. As the Minister will understand, however, no one is more disadvantaged than those who are poor in a wealthy area. My hon. Friend touched on that when she pointed out that our area has one of the highest rates in the UK of car ownership per household, at 2.6 cars per household, and that, for those who do not have cars, access to public transport is almost nil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para6"><a name="08072258000056">Notwithstanding the wealth, there are plenty of pockets of clearly identifiable deprivation in my constituency, where either those who are on low incomes or the elderly&#151;and sometimes the two combined&#151;live. When one looks at the list of proposed closures, it is noteworthy that, with perhaps one exception, each and every one can be properly defined without exaggeration as situated in an area with a relatively high presence of low-income families. I do not know whether that is just an accident or whether it correlates with the way in which the Post Office has carried out its survey, but the correlation is absolutely clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para7"><a name="08072258000057">I shall give the Minister a couple of examples. Denham Garden Village, as the name implies, is a residential area that has been set aside for elderly people in Denham. It used to be a Licensed Victuallers national home, but it has been taken over by a housing trust for the elderly, Anchor Denham. The post office is located in the middle of the complex and attracts a range of users. Admittedly, some residents may have gone to live there with some capital assets, but many residents have few. It is clear that mobility is a serious issue, and the post office, as part of the village centre within that area for the elderly, is of particular value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08072258000058">Farnham Royal, on the edge of my constituency near Slough, is an area with clearly identifiable indices of deprivation, as, indeed, are parts of Denham parade on Oxford road in Denham. Wycombe lane post office also caters for a very mixed area, and when one comes to old town Beaconsfield, to which I shall return in a moment, other considerations come into play. The first thing that I note when I look at the list is that in those places, the post office appears to serve the local community well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08072258000059">I wrote to the postmasters in my constituency about the matter, but, because of the debate&#146;s short notice, I am afraid that some of them have not been able to reply. However, I thought that one was particularly worth quoting, as the author asked for anonymity. She did so, because, she said:</p>
<a name="80722h0002.htm_brev3"><a name="08072258000439"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are in a difficult position, having been instructed by our &#145;Internal Area Manager&#146;, not to discuss the proposed closures with the Press&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08072258000060">which I find absolutely scandalous and totally pointless. She went on to say:</p>
<a name="80722h0002.htm_brev4"><a name="08072258000440"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;However, your letter says you have heard...that this branch is scheduled to close and you request our views on the proposals.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08072258000061">They were then supplied. The post office is situated in the middle of the village; it has been there for at least 50 years; it is the hub of village life; it has a pedestrian  <br>

crossing immediately in front of the premises; there is parking nearby; it is much used by elderly and disabled customers; the alternative post office does not have those facilities; and there are three sheltered housing sites within easy reach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para12"><a name="08072258000062">Another post office that I mentioned a moment age was the one in old town Beaconsfield. There is always a tendency for MPs to pontificate on places in their constituency to which they may be&#151;in truth, because constituencies are big places&#151;only occasional visitors, but, as it happens, the post office in old town Beaconsfield is situated next door to my Beaconsfield office. I go to it frequently, it is a one-stop shop, I post my letters there and I buy things there. It is a busy post office, there are frequently queues for the counter and my impression is that it provides a valuable local service. Although Beaconsfield is in part very wealthy, 30 per cent. of its housing is social housing, and much of that is located in the older part of the town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08072258000063">I have before me the distances from post office to post office, and closure would mean that people would have to walk 0.7 miles to the new town office, which is along a lengthy road. The alternative is Holtspur post office, which is 1.25 miles away and would involve a not very pleasant walk along the A40&#151;out of town completely. I am not even sure that there is continuous pavement along the road&#146;s full length. The old town post office mainly serves the area to the south, and the distances from individuals&#146; homes to the other offices would consistently exceed 1 mile. I am quite satisfied about that from my knowledge of the area, and, as I said to the Minister, many people who use the old town one-stop community shop in Aylesbury End are very elderly. There is an Abbeyfield Society home situated about 500 yd to the south, most of whose residents are more than 90 years old, and, if they go out into old town Beaconsfield, they will use the post office. I meet some of them there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para14"><a name="08072258000064">I noted the Minister&#146;s intervention on my hon. Friend when he said that post office closures have been going on for a long time. They were initiated under previous Governments&#151;although the closures have greatly accelerated in the past 10 years&#151;and I am the first to accept that the Government and the Post Office have to respond to social changes in the use of post offices. However, I must say that from the way in which the list has suddenly been magicked up, and from the criteria that have been applied, I really wonder whether there has been an adequate analysis of each post office&#146;s viability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para15"><a name="08072258000065">The Wycombe lane post office postmaster, Mr. King, has accepted closure, but it is worth reading out his letter. He wrote:</p>
<a name="80722h0002.htm_brev5"><a name="08072258000441"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In May 1997, the Labour Government inherited a Post Office that was profitable and since then they have done a great deal to make it unprofitable...It is my sincere opinion that after this round of closures there will be yet another. With this in mind, I believe the best option for me is to accept this planned closure with its package, which will enable me to take a little time to plan my future.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para16"><a name="08072258000066">He goes on to make the point that there is another post office, which&#151;I have to accept&#151;is not too far away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para17"><a name="08072258000067">It is invidious to leave any post offices out, but I have to draw up a priority list, and in respect of Denham Garden Village, Bourne End and Beaconsfield post offices, I find the criteria inexplicable. Demand and use will continue, and no one has suggested to me that the  <br>

postmasters feel that they are at the end of the road in terms of their ability to make a profit from the facilities. The process has simply not been properly thought through. I hope that we can use today&#146;s debate to obtain some greater clarity from the Minister and send out a message to the Post Office that if it wishes the post offices to be used, it has to show that it values them as much as the communities do. I have absolutely no doubt that they value them a great deal.</p>

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="08072258000068"><a name="80722h0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="08072258000481"><b>Mrs. Gillan:</b>
 We can make so many points about the closures, but one post office operator in my constituency made the particular point that the closure of the Amersham old town post office would leave three people unemployed and the postmaster with an unexpired lease of about &#163;5,000 a year. The loss of employment in those small areas, where the post offices provide jobs for people, is an enormous problem. Where will they go?</p>

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="08072258000069"><a name="80722h0002.htm_spnew2"><a name="08072258000482"><b>Mr. Grieve:</b>
 I entirely agree. When I consulted the Bourne End post office, it was explained to me that there are four part-time staff. I have visited that post office, and I suspect that those people would otherwise have great difficulty finding other employment. Many are not young, and, in many ways, they work at the post office because it is part of the community. The pleasure that they get from working at the post office correlates to the number of people who go in and out of it. So I agree entirely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000070">I want to bring my remarks to a close by saying to the Minister&#151;at the risk of repeating myself&#151;that I accept that sometimes difficult decisions must be taken but I worry about this process. There is no confidence in the consultation that is taking place and there is a perception that these decisions about closures are a foregone conclusion. The evidence of my own eyes suggests to me that some of these post offices due for closure are viable, have a good future and could continue providing a really good service to the local community and making a profit for the Post Office itself.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) on securing this very timely and valuable debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para19"><a name="08072258000072">I should like to pick up on a couple of points that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) made during his very passionate speech. The first point was about the postmasters of local branches being told that they should not communicate with the press. In fact, it is even worse than that, because two of my local postmasters have told me that it has been made very clear to them that if they should campaign or contact the local press in any way their compensation package from the Post Office would be changed, which I think is an absolute outrage. I would like the Minister to respond to that point when he winds up the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08072258000073">The second point that my hon. and learned Friend made was that he felt that this list of post offices had been &#147;magicked up&#148;. I would go one step further and say that the complete list is a sham and that there has been no great analysis involved in its production. I say that because last November, some eight months before the publication of our area consultation, the Post Office  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 July 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 179WH</b><br>
inadvertently published the list of the post offices in my constituency that were due to be closed. They did that because during the previous consultation for Northamptonshire and counties further to the north, the Post Office published a map and simply chose to &#147;grey out&#148; the north Buckinghamshire-Milton Keynes area, but failed to obliterate the small red crosses on the post offices that had already been identified as long ago as last November as the branches that it wanted to close. Therefore, the idea that due process has been followed in trying to identify which post offices in my constituency need to be closed, given that eight months ago that map was published, is an equal outrage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para21"><a name="08072258000074">I am pleased to say that I cannot compete with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield for the number of post offices in our constituencies that are due to close. Only four are due to be closed in my constituency, although six are due to be closed in Milton Keynes. When people think of Milton Keynes, they probably think of an urban area, although my constituency is two-thirds rural and one-third urban. Of the four post offices in my constituency due to be closed, two are in the rural area and two in the urban area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para22"><a name="08072258000075">However, the overwhelming feeling in Milton Keynes is a complete lack of belief in the Government, because at a time when they are forcing our city to expand they seem to be forcing our post office network to contract. People in Milton Keynes simply do not understand that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para23"><a name="08072258000076">I intend to be brief, but I shall begin by discussing the two post offices in my rural area. The first is in Little Brickhill, in the south of my constituency, just a few miles north of Buckingham. I went to a protest meeting about three or four weeks ago and literally the whole village turned out in the village hall. There is absolute outrage at the prospect that the last facility in the village&#151;the last village shop&#151;is going to be closed. Yes, the post office has a relatively small number of attendees each week, but it provides the complete economic and social heart of Little Brickhill. The nearest post office that people in the village will be able to go to is in Bletchley, about two miles away. However, the Bletchley main post office will also have to accommodate the closures of branches in the constituency of the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), who has chosen not to attend this debate today. So it will have to accommodate the customers of four post offices and there is great concern about whether it will be able to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para24"><a name="08072258000077">The other rural post office in my constituency that is due for closure is Weston Underwood, which is in the north of my constituency. I intend to attend a protest meeting that will be held in Weston Underwood this Wednesday and it is a shame that nobody from the Post Office will be able to attend it, because if they were able to do so they would understand the strength of feeling there. The Weston Underwood branch is the last of a group of rural post offices in that area that remains open and it also provides the financial heart of that small community. The nearest post office that people in Weston Underwood will be able to attend is in Olney, the town that I live in, but that is about two miles away and there is a very infrequent bus service between the two.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 180WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para25"><a name="08072258000078">It is absolutely right that when we talk about the nearest post offices to those being closed, we also bear in mind that it is not simply the distance between the two post offices that people have to travel. Invariably, people have had to travel some distance in the first place to get to the post office that is due to close. So we are not talking about a one-mile journey; we are perhaps talking about a four-mile journey becoming a five or six-mile journey. All too often, rural buses only run to these centres of population, so it is not actually that straightforward simply to add an extra mile to the journey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para26"><a name="08072258000079">From a pure numbers point of view, the two most significant branch closures in my constituency are in the heart of Milton Keynes. The first branch is in the grid square of Conniburrow, just to the north of the city centre. It currently accommodates about 1,500 people per week who carry out transactions and it serves a population of about 20,000 people. About 15 per cent. of people attending that branch are elderly and it provides an incredibly valuable service. I went to a protest meeting in the area last Friday and the turnout was very impressive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para27"><a name="08072258000080">The problem in Conniburrow is that there is no bus service to the alternative post office that has been proposed, Crown Walk in central Milton Keynes. The Crown Walk office is only 0.9 miles away. However, due to the nature of Milton Keynes, which includes a very impressive grid road system but also lots of overpasses and underpasses, it is impossible to get to the Crown Walk office by road, because there is no bus service, and if people were to walk, although the distance may be 0.9 miles as the crow flies, it is considerably further by the time they have gone up and down 46 steps, left and right, and through the underpasses. There is great concern that the Crown Walk post office is simply inaccessible to those currently using the Conniburrow branch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para28"><a name="08072258000081">The final post office in my constituency that is set to close is in Fishermead, which is one of the most deprived estates in south-east England. It is a tremendous estate, but the post office really is the heart of that community. I attended a meeting in the area last Friday and there are many vulnerable residents there who also feel very strongly that access to Crown Walk will be almost impossible, because of the nature of the road layout of Milton Keynes. There is a bus service to Crown Walk, but it is infrequent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para29"><a name="08072258000082">One of the principal concerns that people in Milton Keynes have is that the alternative post office that is being proposed, the main office at Crown Walk, is already used by some 8,000 people each week. Effectively, that number will have to increase to some 13,000 people a week. Last Friday, I went to see the Crown Walk branch for myself and the queue of people was already stretching out of the door. People were talking about experiencing waits of between 30 and 40 minutes at the moment, so I simply do not understand how that branch will cope when the customers from two major post offices in neighbouring grid squares are also trying to use it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para30"><a name="08072258000083">For the reasons that I pointed out at the start of my speech, it is absolutely right to say that this whole consultation has been a sham, not least because of the advance publication of information on the post offices   <br>

They commented that a six-week consultation was too short for the most vulnerable people to be included. The survey revealed that more than 90 per cent. would be personally affected if their post office closed, and that three quarters of those respondents would be significantly affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="80722h0002.htm_para34"><a name="08072258000090">Three quarters of the respondents could get to their local post office on foot. However, if their nearest post office were to close, only 14 per cent. would be able to do so. Also, if vulnerable people&#151;those on benefits, for example&#151;had to take public transport, they would have to find an additional amount of money somewhere. More than 60 per cent. of the over-75s use the post office to pay their bills. The survey illustrates what the hon. Lady and the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) and the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) said about the closures being a country-wide problem.</p>

When I took a petition around to 35 local shops in Shirley, the shopkeepers said, &#147;Please don&#146;t make us go to the Stratford Road post office,&#148; which is the alternative to the Haslucks Green Road post office. They said that waiting there could take 35 or 40 minutes, and that as local businesses they just did not have the time to do that. So, although there was another post office closer, they were not using it.</p>

I do not believe that there is a direct correlation between needing a post office and the amount of money that one has. Coming from a similar supposedly wealthy constituency, I have a huge amount of sympathy with him.</p>

All those things are conspiring to decimate our post office network and to make it less, not more, sustainable.

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para9"><a name="08072258000103">We have had an important debate, and I entirely understand why my hon. and learned and hon. Friends are so concerned about what is happening in their constituencies. We heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham that one third of her post office network is closing, and from my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield that almost the same proportion&#151;30 per cent.&#151;of the post offices in his constituency are closing. That is about twice the national average, so I entirely understand why they felt that the matter needed to be raised in the House before we break for the summer. It is a devastating blow. Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham said, the closures result in the decimation of communities which, all too often, lose not just the post office but the shop that is also such a vital part of the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para10"><a name="08072258000104">The Minister intervened, saying that this process had been going on for some time. Post office closures have been going on for some time, but the rate of closure since 1997 is three times higher than before 1997, in the 18 years of Conservative government. As my hon. Friends have said, back then, post offices were making a profit: they only went into loss in 1999 and, until that  <br>

point, the network was making a profit. At that time, people were closing their post offices if they could not find anybody to take them on: they were closing because people were choosing to retire. This is the first time that a Government are saying, &#147;You must close&#148; and ordering people to close post offices. In spite of the huge amount of public support and sympathy for particular post offices in the network, post offices may not stay open once that decision has been made and confirmed. So there is a fundamental difference now and, because of the way in which the closures are being driven forward, this is a devastating blow to our post office network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08072258000105">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes raised concerns about what they described as the gag on postmasters talking publicly about the closure programmes. There has been some misunderstanding about this. Certainly, postmasters are asked to keep closures confidential before they are announced, but there is no gag on their speaking out publicly afterwards. Indeed, when this matter was raised with me recently, I wrote to Alan Cook, the chief executive of the Post Office, and he said:</p>
<a name="80722h0003.htm_brev0"><a name="08072258000442"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I can unequivocally reassure you that all sub-postmasters will be compensated for closure regardless of the stance they take towards the closure of their particular office.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para12"><a name="08072258000106">So there is no doubt&#151;the Minister responsible for post offices has said it in the main Chamber and the chief executive of the Post Office has said so&#151;that once the closures are public, postmasters are free to campaign to keep their post offices open, because anything else would be an intolerable infringement of their liberties and their freedom to campaign as they would wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para13"><a name="08072258000107">The problem, as has eloquently been set out in this debate, is that there is deep dissatisfaction about the consultation process. The Cabinet Office guidelines say that consultations of this nature should take 12 weeks, but we have only been given six weeks&#151;that happens sometimes over holiday periods, in the run-up to Christmas or over the Christmas period&#151;and people have not had the chance to campaign against proposed closures as effectively as they would wish. Having seen what has happened elsewhere in the country, people feel that the odds are stacked against them. I understand why sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses in Buckinghamshire will feel that, however hard they campaign and however strong a case they put forward, a decision has been made somewhere and there is nothing that they can do to get it overturned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para14"><a name="08072258000108">The process has been deeply flawed. The access criteria have been rightly criticised. My hon. Friends have highlighted some of the failings in the process. Essentially, somebody has put a pair of compasses on a map and drawn a circle around individual post offices. Proposals for closure have been made in respect of those post offices that can most readily be taken out of the network while keeping the best geographical spread. However, that takes no account of profitability or viability and it is leading to some perverse decisions. For example, no account is taken of whether the roads are straight. I know Buckinghamshire relatively well. The roads from village to village do not go as the crow flies, but meander through valleys and woods, and there is a range of longer roads. Nevertheless, the map will show that the distance is three miles from the nearest post office. However, if one takes that route&#151;there almost certainly  <br>

is no bus&#151;one finds that the road journey could be twice as far, making it much more difficult. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield spoke about the lack of public transport and the impact on people who are less well off in wealthy areas. That is a very valid point.</p>

It would be much more sensible if future housing growth were taken into account.</p>

If any one of the post offices that have been mentioned this morning is saved, another one will be added to the list for closure.

 Will my hon. Friend give me the benefit of his experience of speaking on this matter from our party&#146;s Front Bench? I asked the Post Office how much it would save from the closure of each of the branches in my constituency and I received vastly different figures for each post office. I understand that 10,000 of the 14,000 existing branches around the country lose money. Therefore if this were a cost-saving exercise, hon. Members might think that at least some logic would be applied to the closures, taking into account the savings that the Post Office would achieve from the closure of each branch. However, not even that has been brought to bear on the situation. Does my hon. Friend have any experience of such illogicality in other parts of the country in respect of the premise that the Post Office is using for the closures?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an extremely valid and important point. When the proposals for closures were being set out, the Minister responsible talked about some post offices only having a few customers a week, the assumption being that those were the ones that would be closed. In fact, those post offices are in some of the most remote areas and they are being kept open, rightly, to serve remote areas. However, as a consequence, often the busier, profitable post offices are being closed. Alan Cook, when giving evidence to the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee, admitted that some profitable post offices are included in the list of proposed closures. It is incomprehensible how one can make a network more profitable, or less unprofitable, by closing the elements that make money. That shows the flaw in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para17"><a name="08072258000113">We should be looking at not only how the Post Office can have its decline managed, but how we can make it relevant and provide a service that is right for these years and this century. We should be looking to develop the network, freeing it up to work with other carriers, rather than just the Royal Mail&#151;carriers such as UPS, FedEx and others, which pass the doors of post offices day after day, unsuccessfully trying to deliver packages, trundling back for miles to their depots and coming out  <br>

again the next day. It would be much more sensible if the post office network could be a hub for all those sorts of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000114">The post offices should be a centre for more financial services, as the National Federation of SubPostmasters is calling for, and they should be more of a hub for Government services than is currently the case. We would undoubtedly continue to provide subsidies to the Post Office network&#151;we have said that clearly&#151;but, by bringing more business into the network, we would be able to sustain many more post offices than under the proposals made in the Government&#146;s current programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para19"><a name="08072258000115">We are also finding that unfair restrictions are being put on those businesses that are being closed down. This will be the next stage about which there will be concern, as my hon. Friends will find in Buckinghamshire. Once a post office has been taken out of the shop, the Post Office will determine what other services can be offered in that business. For example, the shop will be told that it cannot have a national lottery outlet. There is an agreement between the national lottery and the Post Office about how many post offices may have national lottery outlets, so many have been told up until now that they may not have a national lottery outlet; but bizarrely, when they lose the post office from their premises the Post Office will tell them that they still may not have a national lottery outlet because now the shop does not have a post office in it.</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman also aware that, where a post office is being closed down, if it elects to retain an existing national lottery facility, the compensation received by that post office will be diminished?</p>

 The hon. Lady is right: it can be diminished significantly&#151;by thousands of pounds. When people find that retirement is being forced on them by the loss of a post office, and that the rest of their business is essentially being ripped away from them, they feel very angry indeed. The same applies in respect of phone top-ups, a service offered through post offices, when, as part of the compensation package, people are told that their business may no longer offer telephone top-ups. Some people also wish to work with PayPoint, but they are told that their compensation will be put at risk if they do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para21"><a name="08072258000119">Finally, the elephant in the room in this debate is the future of the Post Office card account. It is disappointing that we have not had a statement from the Department for Work and Pensions before the House rises for the summer about the contract for the Post Office card account. This is causing massive concern. If it were to go to anybody other than the Post Office, it would lead to thousands more closures. The National Federation of SubPostmasters reckons that it would lead to 3,000 more closures&#151;an even bigger round of closures than we are seeing in the current round. The Government owed it to the House, and to the postmasters and  <br>

The Post Office is doing the Government&#146;s bidding. The Government have set the funding package; the Government have determined the number of post offices that must close; and the Government have determined the access criteria and allowed intolerable burdens to be put on the future business activities of those shops. The Government&#146;s own Members have been unwilling to try and stop the programme, although they were given the chance and campaigned in their own constituencies to keep post offices open.

The background is important, and the programme of a substantial number of post office closures has given rise to much concern and protest, including in my constituency.

It is losing around &#163;500,000 a day, it has 4 million fewer customers a week than just three years ago, and three out of four post offices run at a loss to Post Office Ltd. If the Post Office were run as a commercial network, there would probably be only about 4,000 branches. Some very rural branches have so few customers that the cost per transaction is &#163;17.

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="80722h0003.htm_para28"><a name="08072258000129">Many services that have traditionally been conducted over post office counters are now transacted by other means. On pensioners and elderly people, I recall my time as the Minister for Pensions when Post Office card accounts were introduced, and I shall come to that later. Eight out of 10 pensioners have their pensions paid directly into a bank or building society. Among new retirees, the figure is nine out of 10. I suspect that when hon. Members in the Chamber draw their pensions, they will do so not through the Post Office, but in the way that they are used to for their salaries. As I said, nine out of 10 newer pensioners do not use the post office. Most people have their salaries paid directly into a bank, so it is hardly surprising that that is the trend. One million people a month now renew their car tax online, but last year that figure was only 500,000. Most people use the internet in one way or another, and that cannot be uninvented. The Post Office faces competition from companies such as PayPoint, which won the contract for the TV licence, a decision that was taken by the BBC, not by the Government.</p>

To do nothing in the face of such challenges was not an option&#151;I alluded to that during an intervention&#151;and we are talking about long-term trends. Between 1979 and 1997, some 3,500 post offices closed, but on a random and unmanaged basis. We are trying to put some organisation into that. To be fair, Opposition Members should address the long-term decline of our post office branches for social, economic and internet reasons. Instead of walking away and leaving the network to decline with no plans for where or how branches would close, the Government have provided a subsidy of &#163;150 million a year.

There are two factors to take into account when assessing the profitability of a particular post office. First, the business done in a post office and the level of payment from Post Office Ltd directly into that branch has to be considered. Secondly, consideration should be given to the central support costs from Post Office Ltd that are attributable to a branch. That might include IT costs, cash handling and other services not paid by the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress. Taking both factors into account, three out of four post offices are loss-making for Post Office Ltd, including many relatively busy offices.</p>

Gentleman that, legally, we had to put that out to tender. It is not possible simply to award the contract to the Post Office. The Post Office is in a strong position to bid, but it would be inappropriate to say anything more without potentially jeopardising the tendering process. I hope that the hon.

A letter was re-drafted to state that there was a clear commitment to there being no link between compensation and sub-postmasters&#146; views. I hope sub-postmasters are clear about that.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Olner, for calling me to open this important debate on bovine tuberculosis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="80722h0004.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000164">I initiated the debate in my capacity as chairman of the all-party group on dairy farmers. I set up the group a few years ago, and we now have more than 170 Members. I am pleased to say that it is a cross-party group. We work together extremely well in fighting for the cause of dairy farmers. I am pleased to see the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) in his place, as he is an active member of the group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="80722h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08072258000165">The National Farmers Union has calculated that a total of 40,000 cattle will be slaughtered in our country this year as a result of bovine TB. In the county of Shropshire, the situation is equally dire. In 1997, 47 cattle were slaughtered there as a result of bovine TB. This year, conservative estimates put the Shropshire figure at 1,600. I have repeatedly mentioned the figures in the House. To go from 47 to 1,600 cattle slaughtered a year in Shropshire alone is phenomenal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="80722h0004.htm_para20"><a name="08072258000166">Many farmers in my constituency have been brought to their knees. I do not use that expression lightly, because I feel passionately about the issue. They have been brought to their knees not only by the Rural Payments Agency but predominantly by the rampant spread of bovine tuberculosis throughout Shropshire. The disease is clearly out of control. We need the Government to take immediate, well thought-out and strategic action. I was devastated when the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced in the House that there would be no cull of badgers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="80722h0004.htm_para21"><a name="08072258000167">What really concerns me is that local communities and local councils are not allowed to make decisions, or at least to be party to the decision-making process. We should devolve responsibility and a certain amount of accountability to local councils. That is what happens in Germany and other countries. Their Governments understand that the situation varies throughout the country, and they allow certain regions to make their own decisions. I should have thought that the Government would want to devolve responsibility, as culling badgers is such a controversial issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="80722h0004.htm_para22"><a name="08072258000168">In Shropshire, I would call for a limited cull of badgers in the triangle formed by Pontesbury, Minsterley and Westbury on the Shropshire-Wales border, which is where bovine TB is as its most acute and rampant. That would show whether a cull might work. If the Government had given us the power, that is where I would have used it. As it is, I have to joke with farmers in my constituency about chasing the badgers across the border into Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80722h0004.htm_para23"><a name="08072258000169">The Government have given the Welsh Assembly autonomy and responsibility, but they will not give it to us in the west midlands. They give the Welsh the ability to deal with these things in their own way. Indeed, in conjunction with Plaid Cymru, the socialist Members of the Assembly have decided to have a limited cull of badgers. It is frustrating to live cheek by jowl with a Welsh community that has listened to the advice of scientists and is having a limited cull, when just across the border in Shropshire, we are not allowed to do so.</p>

It does not want to rock the boat, in case the Government make life even more difficult. Those days are now over. In the dying days of the Labour Administration and in the run-up to the next Conservative Government, the NFU has to be extremely forceful. It must demand that action is taken, and not be too deferential.</p>

I have written to Mr. Barroso, even though it was galling to me as an arch-Eurosceptic. I asked his opinion of Government action over bovine TB. It was a difficult thing to do, but the only thing left in our armoury was to check the EU&#146;s stance on the Government&#146;s handling of bovine TB. In an era when human rights are so important to the European Union and the European Court of Justice, I wanted to ask Mr. Barroso and legal experts what are the human rights implications of not dealing with the disease in the UK. What about the human rights of Shropshire dairy farmers who are on their knees and going out of business?</p>

The two countries account for more than 40 per cent. of all British cattle exports, and I am concerned that they are acting against the spirit of the EU. I would be grateful if the Minister could give some assurances that pressure is being brought to bear on those two countries to ensure that they stop the unofficial boycott of British meat imports.</p>

It is the largest organisation in my constituency, with more than 5,000 members throughout Shropshire. Of course, its symbol is a badger. I have attended many meetings at which I have been grilled on my views on badgers, which I shall come to. My wife and I were invited by the trust to watch a badger sett. We went to Whitchurch in Shropshire and spent four hours with the trust watching the sett. The badgers were indeed cute and cuddly, and I thought they were very sweet. We were even given a cuddly toy badger for my baby daughter. Perhaps the trust wanted to convince me just how sweet the animals are and not to call for them to be culled. I appreciate that badgers need to be protected, but we need to engage with the trust and show its members the devastation that wildlife is facing as a result of the spread of bovine TB. We need to explain that many badgers die a slow, lingering death as a result of the disease.</p>

I made most progress with the right hon. Member for South Shields, the current Foreign Secretary, because he was more prepared than any of the others to meet me and to listen to my views on the issue. I am worried that the Administration have realised the strength of feeling among members of wildlife trusts against the culling of badgers, and in turn the importance of people who live in key marginal seats and in city areas. The Government do not want to offend such people in the run-up to a general election and have therefore taken the easier option of making announcements about extra investment in vaccination and other things. They did not want to grasp the nettle and adopt the most controversial in a plethora of proposals&#151;the one that the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee recommended, as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire said. They are not prepared to grapple with the issue because of the ferocity with which any such measure would be met by members of the wildlife trusts.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) on securing this debate. Following the announcement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on 7 July, it provides a useful opportunity to discuss where we go from here, for which I am grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para8"><a name="08072258000186">I have listened carefully to the points that have been made and to the hon. Gentleman. They echo many of the points raised by stakeholders during our discussions in the run-up to the decision on badger culling. The decision not to issue licences to cull badgers for bovine TB control was not easy to make, and I know that many farmers are disappointed, as the hon. Gentleman has articulated. However, based on the available evidence, including the science, we truly believe that it was the right decision. The hon. Gentleman called for a cull of badgers in his area. I can only reiterate what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said about the decision. All the evidence was carefully considered and all views were heard, but in the end we could not be certain that a cull of badgers would improve the disease situation in cattle. Delivering an effective large area cull in practice would be a difficult and costly operation that would need to be sustained for a number of years, and public opposition to culling would increase the challenge of effective delivery. In fact, we believe that there is a risk that culling badgers could make the disease situation in cattle worse. Clearly, such a policy would not be in anyone&#146;s interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para9"><a name="08072258000187">Although we have ruled out badger culling, we have made it clear that we remain open to the possibility of revisiting the policy under exceptional circumstances, or if new scientific evidence becomes available. As part of the TB announcement, my right hon. Friend made it clear that vaccination has been made a priority, as recommended by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. We are strengthening our programme of research to develop cattle and badger vaccines, and are planning for their deployment by investing &#163;20 million over the next three years. Also, funding will be provided to set up and run a deployment project using injectable badger vaccine, to build confidence in the long-term contribution that badger vaccination could make to tackling bovine TB, and to provide valuable information that could help to bring us closer to the long-term goal of an oral badger vaccine. We need to decide in partnership with industry how best to meet that goal, and therefore the exact nature of the project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para10"><a name="08072258000188">However, vaccination is a long-term policy option and a successful outcome cannot be guaranteed. The earliest projected dates for widespread use of vaccines are early 2014 for the Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin oral badger vaccination, and mid to late 2015 for BCG cattle vaccines with a differentiating infected from vaccinated animals test. Injectable BCG badger vaccines may be available in 2010 but are not expected to be used widely owing to the cost and acceptability of trapping badgers for injection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para11"><a name="08072258000189">We should not lose sight of the fact that, even if successful, vaccination alone will not provide a solution to bovine TB; it can only form part of a programme of measures. There are a number of ways in which vaccination may be used to tackle TB in cattle or badgers, each with associated benefits and problems. At the core of those is the need to balance the costs versus the benefits of disease control, but wider matters need to be taken into account and balanced, including acceptability, practicality, trade, and legal constraints. Work has begun on those considerations to enable the use of a vaccine once it is available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para12"><a name="08072258000190">In his statement, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mentioned the partnership group. A decision on badger culling has been made. Our overriding priority is now to build a strong partnership with the farming industry so that we can consider the priorities for tackling this difficult disease. It is not for the Government to dictate the form and composition of the TB partnership group. The form of those arrangements is just as much a matter for industry as for Government. We hope to begin discussions with industry partners soon.</p>

He will not be surprised to hear that we are disappointed by that judgment and are considering whether to appeal. Cattle compensation is a major cost for the taxpayer and the Government have a responsibility to ensure that the systems are, as far as possible, fair to cattle farmers and taxpayers.</p>

compensation arrangements for bovine TB affected cattle resulted in a significant over-compensation problem. We will continue to operate the current table valuation system while we review it in the light of the judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para15"><a name="08072258000193">The hon. Gentleman referred to the case that is currently in the news of bovine TB in veal calves exported from the UK to the Netherlands. I cannot comment on what he said about Belgium. However, I confirm that my officials have been in close contact with the European Commission and the Dutch authorities in recent days, and have provided a full description of the circumstances of the relevant calf exports. All the TB testing and export certification requirements had been correctly implemented. Discussions with the Commission are continuing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para16"><a name="08072258000194">The hon. Gentleman presented his case in a reasonable way and made his points forcefully, as he has previously in Westminster Hall and the main Chamber. However, I disagree with the assertion that the Government have done little to tackle TB over recent years. While the randomised badger culling trial was in progress, we introduced measures to supplement the routine cattle testing and surveillance programme. For instance, we implemented zero tolerance of overdue TB herd tests and introduced pre-movement and gamma interferon testing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para17"><a name="08072258000195">Those policies are having an effect. The pre-movement testing of cattle that are over 42 days old and are moving out of high-risk herds detected 756 reactor animals in 416 herds in England between March 2006 and April 2008. Those reactors might otherwise have spread disease within buyers&#146; herds. The gamma interferon test identified 5,419 reactor animals from the 47,215 sampled between October 2006 and May 2008. The number of reactors identified by pre-movement and gamma interferon tests shows the worth of those policies. We are grateful to the farming community for its co-operation and commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000196">In addition, we have worked with the industry and with vets to produce husbandry guidance and have funded a wide-ranging research programme to look into matters such as how the disease is spread, how we can improve diagnosis and how we can vaccinate against it. We have spent over &#163;110 million on TB research in the last 10 years and about &#163;8.5 million in 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para19"><a name="08072258000197">The Government have been asked whether the eradication of bovine TB is still our aim. Due to the current level of the disease, that is not realistic in the immediate future. Our immediate priority is to work with the new TB partnership group to focus on approaches in the TB strategic framework to control disease and prevent its further spread. Once the disease is under control, the next stage will be eradication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para20"><a name="08072258000198">The hon. Gentleman has a proud and distinguished record. He has been a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee and set up the all-party group on dairy farmers. He spoke of bringing together Members from all parts of the House. Indeed, Members from all parts of the House have rural areas in their constituencies. It is not right to characterise this debate as rural versus urban. I say to him honestly and genuinely that we did not come to our policy decision by taking an urban perspective. It was difficult to grasp these nettles, but a decision had to be taken. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that he would take that decision on his watch.</p>

 I am pleased to have the chance to hold this debate on the housing needs of families with children with disabilities. The issue is important, and we all see it in our constituencies. Given that this is the last day of debates in Westminster Hall before the summer recess, the fact that there are more Members in the Chamber than there often are for hour-and-a-half afternoon debates is a tribute to how strongly people feel about the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para25"><a name="08072258000206">I pay tribute to the work of the Every Disabled Child Matters group, which has worked hard to put the needs of children with disabilities higher on the agenda, and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble), who is in the Chamber, for chairing the parliamentary hearings that have taken the matter forward and produced a step change in policy and in our thinking about services for children with disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para26"><a name="08072258000207">The housing needs of children with disabilities are often overlooked, yet they are important both for the children and their families, including their brothers and sisters. If their housing provision is not right, one child&#146;s disability can become the family&#146;s disability. That can have a profound effect on the life chances of the other children and their ability to do their homework, get a good night&#146;s sleep, play or have friends around.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para27"><a name="08072258000208">My concerns are about children with all forms of disability, including physical disabilities and learning difficulties. I am also concerned about children with behavioural difficulties that might fall short of what is normally recognised as a disability but that none the less have profound consequences on their use of space and amenities and on the living standards of the family. I shall focus on three points: space and overcrowding, the provision of and need for aid and adaptations and the assessment of housing need and design.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para28"><a name="08072258000209">Every Disabled Child Matters did an excellent survey that set out the scale of the needs of families with disabled children. In total, 770,000 children in the UK have a disability, based on the definition used in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. In a survey of 3,000 affected families, the organisation found that they were often in the greatest housing need; for example, 56 per cent. were in rented properties, which is much higher than the national average. They also tended to be in the worst properties&#151;those in the greatest need of repair. About 50 per cent. were in properties in a poor state of repair, and particular problems were reported with insulation and heating, which are especially important if children are at home for a long time and cannot move about much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para29"><a name="08072258000210">The position of those families is the most striking, and their needs the most acute in the housing pressures that result from the disability of the children. The EDCM survey found that 55 per cent. of the families had problems with family space&#151;in other words, space to play and space apart from other family members. Some 42 per cent. had problems with their functional rooms, such as the kitchen, toilet and bathroom, being   <br>

difficult to use, and 41 per cent. had only one toilet and/or bathroom. That can be a problem, especially if the only toilet or bathroom is upstairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para30"><a name="08072258000211">Of the families surveyed, 38 per cent. lacked space for storage and equipment, which can be difficult for people with wheelchairs, pushchairs or other aids. About 38 per cent. had problems with location and 33 per cent. had problems with access around the home or with getting in and out of it. About 21 per cent. lacked the space needed to use the equipment and carry out the therapies that the children needed, and 21 per cent. had inadequate facilities to meet their caring needs such as lifting, toileting and bathing. In total, 86 per cent. of the families surveyed were in homes where there were difficulties with at least one of those matters, and a quarter were experiencing difficulties with six or more different problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para31"><a name="08072258000212">It might help if I give a personal example of how that affects families I have met in my constituency. Mrs. A lives in my constituency with her daughter and her daughter&#146;s five children, who are aged from about eight to their mid-teens. Two of them have special needs and one is severely affected by autism. They live in a little house with a garden and although they have four bedrooms, two are tiny&#151;little more than box rooms&#151;so one of the adults sleeps in each.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para32"><a name="08072258000213">When I visited, I found that the oldest child, who is the autistic boy, was pacing up and down in the combined living and dining room all the time. He could not relate to anything else that was going on in the house, he just walked up and down. He shared a bedroom with one of his siblings, and the other three children, one of whom has a disability, shared the other room. A number of the doors and fittings in the house were broken, which was not surprising given the disability that the oldest boy suffered and the way in which he constantly moved around the house. He was quite a large, well built boy. The family were living in conditions that anybody would recognise as severe overcrowding, although they were not statutorily overcrowded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="80722h0005.htm_para33"><a name="08072258000214">The thought that struck me, and in many ways appalled me, was how on earth the other children could have friends around to play when their oldest brother was apt to pace up and down in the living area. Given the pressures in the house, how could they get their homework done and have the private space that they needed in their bedroom, let alone get a decent night&#146;s sleep? The family were actually managing extraordinarily well, but at what cost and with what difficulties? Do we really think that such a situation is acceptable in 21st-century Britain, either for children with special needs or for their brothers and sisters? Any child has needs of their home&#151;their living space and their bedroom&#151;and I was ashamed that any family in my constituency should have to live in such circumstances.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. She is making a powerful contribution. Does she agree that one real difficulty is people&#146;s ability to access the information that they need so that they know what they are entitled to? It was striking to read in the Joseph Rowntree Foundation&#146;s research:</p>
<a name="80722h0006.htm_brev0"><a name="08072258000446"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Most families had already moved at least once in response to their child&#146;s needs or their needs as carers. The vast majority had made those moves without any professional advice or assistance.&#148;</p>

 I agree completely. As I shall explain later, it is important that there is more joined-up working between those who deal with disabled children and those who deal with children&#146;s policy, so that children&#146;s policy and housing policy are co-ordinated. Members such as me who represent constituencies with two-tier local government know of the difficulties of two local authorities trying to work together, sometimes across different cultures. There is not always enough thought about the housing component of children&#146;s needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para3"><a name="08072258000220">Every Disabled Child Matters recognised housing, and homelessness in particular, as the No. 1 risk factor for children. However, that was not carried forward into tough recommendations on housing policy. Disabled children probably get the worst end of the bargain. I agree completely with my right hon. Friend&#146;s point. Getting different agencies to work together to provide different aids and adaptations gives families profound difficulty. Perhaps there is a cultural gap between families&#146; thinking about how they want to live and bureaucracy&#146;s attempts to fit that into its procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para4"><a name="08072258000221">One family in my constituency was living in quite a small three-bedroomed house. There were three children, one of whom was disabled and who, as he grew older, needed a wheelchair. As he grew larger, it was increasingly difficult to get him up the stairs to the only bathroom. The family also needed an extension to his sitting room to cope with the extra space needed in living areas for a child with a wheelchair, which is different from children sitting on a sofa. It was distressing for the parents, because of their difficulties in getting their son upstairs for a bath, as well as for the other children, who loved their brother dearly, cared for him and were wonderful to him but had difficulty playing with him in such restricted space.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para5"><a name="08072258000222">In another case, a woman whose child had mobility problems came to see me. She lived in a second-floor flat without a lift, and had managed to carry the child up and down the stairs until the child got heavier when it became more difficult. The final straw was when the child was placed in extensive plaster casts for a long period, which made it impossible for the mother to get the child up and down the stairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para6"><a name="08072258000223">In looking for a way forward, I point to the recommendations in Every Disabled Child Matters. I shall pick out a few of them for my hon. Friend the Minister to respond to. The report recommended that the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Communities and Local Government should issue guidance that adaptations for children should facilitate inclusion in family life&#151;that might sound obvious, but it does not necessarily work that way; so that it is not possible to argue, for example, that the family&#146;s dining space should be used for the space needed for adaptation. Families with disabled children should not have to choose between space for the disability or family life; they must be able to have both. That might mean sometimes considering home extensions rather than just using one of the downstairs living rooms for space for an adaptation.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Lady on securing this important debate, and I concur with her about the difficulties with two-tier authorities. Does she agree that some problems are made worse by the fact that housing is not pooled within strategic partnerships? During the passage of the Children Act 2004, it was presumed that local authorities would cover housing, but that is not the case with housing trust arm&#146;s length housing. In my experience, it is more difficult to come up with innovative ideas such as extensions, and it is only when there is a catalyst, such as an MP, that things can be moved along.</p>

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="08072258000225"><a name="80722h0006.htm_spnew3"><a name="08072258000522"><b>Ms Keeble:</b>
 I agree completely. There may also be a perception that families with disabled children can get by, which means that the right standards are not set for the quality of the space and accommodation that they should have. The hon. Lady is right: trying to chase things through arm&#146;s length arrangements and joint working is exceptionally difficult.</p>

 Does the hon. Lady agree that one of the main problems is that there are not enough bungalows, whether in the public or private sector? If there were more bungalows, it would help a lot of disabled children as well as a lot of elderly people.</p>

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="08072258000227"><a name="80722h0006.htm_spnew5"><a name="08072258000524"><b>Ms Keeble:</b>
 Yes. I do not know how many bungalows or one-storey houses there are. We need to ensure that housing is built so as to allow the installation of technology that enables people to get about. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency is close to mine. We have some good local examples of housing built to a high standard that meets people&#146;s needs through making good use of new technology.</p>

That would mean removing even the &#163;30,000 for mandatory grants, bearing in mind the fact that adaptations for children are often made for a whole lifetime in order to avoid the need for families with disabled children to move house, as my right hon.

parents of disabled children, transparency in housing allocations and adapting processes and participation for families in current and future housing decisions. In addition, all agencies should ensure that staff have basic housing training to ensure that families have access to the help and advice they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para9"><a name="08072258000230">The housing situation of families with disabled children should be included in the remit of relevant inspection bodies, such as the Audit Commission, the Planning Inspectorate and Ofsted, and the disabled children&#146;s indicator should apply to housing as well as to other services. That is a problem sometimes. The fact that services for children must carry into housing services as well is not always thought through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para10"><a name="08072258000231">To those recommendations, which come from the Every Disabled Child Matters report, I add the following. First, the housing needs assessments and strategies of housing authorities should consider specifically the needs of families with disabled children and factor them into their procurement of social housing. That should not be difficult, as information on children with disabilities should be held by local educational and health services and well known to local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para11"><a name="08072258000232">To deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone), local authorities should ensure that more housing is provided to mobility standards of the type used by some specialist housing associations such as John Grooms. I have seen such houses in Northampton. The building standards that make them suitable for families with disabled children also make them much better for all families. The space in the corridors and stairwells gives the houses a completely different atmosphere and feel. Such houses are lifetime houses: a family moves into one, and the house can adapt to the family&#146;s changing circumstances. Children with disabilities become teenagers with disabilities, and parents might find that they themselves need lifts, hoists, walk-in showers and other features.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para12"><a name="08072258000233">Following that recommendation would also mean that we considered carefully decisions to allow the construction of three or four-storey blocks of flats without lifts. Such buildings can be extraordinarily difficult for a family on a second or third floor with a child who acquires a physical disability or a learning or behavioural difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para13"><a name="08072258000234">Secondly, the overcrowding rules should consider the spatial requirements of families with children who have physical disabilities. That has been a thorny and vexed problem for many years. I started campaigning on it as a local government councillor in 1986, and in many respects we are not much further forward than we were then. We still use standards that were originally produced in 1935, which do not meet the needs of any families, least of all families with children. Every Disabled Child Matters has asked that the bedroom standard be amended to reflect the need for all disabled children to have separate bedrooms from other children in the household and for all social housing providers to reflect that in their vettings policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para14"><a name="08072258000235">Extra space needs to be considered for children with autism and behavioural difficulties, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which puts pressure on both living space and space for other children. The requirement must be to assess such needs in housing allocations and to take them into account once the new overcrowding standards are drawn up, which we hope  <br>

will happen in the not-too-distant future&#151;given that 22 years have gone by. I understand that some of those things might be difficult owing to problems with defining some of the behavioural difficulties, which often put more pressure on other children in the family than almost anything else. If a child has to share a bedroom with a seriously disruptive sibling, and there is no proper living space either&#151;sometimes because the parents have to sleep in the living room&#151;the life chances of all children concerned are profoundly affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para15"><a name="08072258000236">On aids and adaptations, what has happened with the monitoring and assessment of the implementation of the changes made so far? As I am sure the Minister knows, just because guidance is issued does not necessarily mean that it is followed. I am sure that some local authorities follow exceptionally good practice and can be held up as beacons to those that have not quite worked out how to do it. In particular, what has happened about dealing with logjams in assessments by occupational therapists and the need for more co-ordination between the children&#146;s and housing services managing the disabled facilities grant? A number of colleagues brought up that point. My hon. Friend should look back at the Every Disabled Child Matters report, which rightly gave very high priority to housing as a risk factor for children. However, having identified it as a risk factor, the document did not carry through into policies that would ensure that children&#146;s housing was properly provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para16"><a name="08072258000237">In conclusion, problems remain with the provision of the housing standards that families and children in 21st century Britain expect. In many ways, the problems may seem very challenging, and certainly some of them, such as the overcrowding, will be expensive to solve, but if we are to ensure that all families have access to proper housing, we must ensure that housing standards meet the needs of the most vulnerable children in our communities. I hope that while we all enjoy our summer holidays some careful work can be done to ensure that the thoughts on this matter of both the voluntary sector and other colleagues can be carried forward.</p>

looking into the pressures on families with children with disabilities. Interestingly, housing did not feature very large in that debate. Part of the fault lay with us and the questions that we asked in order to focus the debate. However, it was equally important that many of the families whom we met and who came to give evidence to parliamentarians put health and social care needs to the fore. I think that they did that because they thought that we could do something about those things, whereas with housing they seemed to have so many insurmountable problems that they often give up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000242">From my dealings with the local authorities in my constituency and with housing associations, I get the impression that all too often they give up as well and do not know what to do. It is about time that we decided that something can and should be done, and that we got on and did it, which is why I agree with my hon. Friend about the excellent report from the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign, which focuses our attention on housing and the way that it really can make the difference between a family staying together and falling apart. A family with more than one disabled child&#151;or just more than one child&#151;might be receiving support from the health service, the education service and social services, but if they are in cramped and inadequate accommodation, everything will go wrong. It is our responsibility therefore to look at housing and to push it up the agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para19"><a name="08072258000243">Like my hon. Friend, I congratulate the Government on what they have done so far. We campaigned long and hard for the removal of means-testing for families with a child with disabilities applying for the disabled facilities grant, which made a huge difference. The Government also raised the limit from &#163;25,000 to &#163;30,000. However, it remains inadequate for many families, which is why I too would like the Government to re-examine the problem. We do not want families to have to move to find better accommodation&#151;in some instances, in so doing, families have had to repay some of the money paid to them. We need to get this right at the beginning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para20"><a name="08072258000244">The parliamentary hearings highlighted the fact that many families with a disabled child do not understand why different agencies do not talk to each other about their needs. In our debates we get tied up in all sorts of questions about data sharing and limiting the amount of data shared to protect information held on individuals by different Departments. However, the people whom we are trying to help just assume that data are shared, and then do not understand when they find out that the health service does not tell social services that a disabled child has been born who will need social care help, or tell the education service that, &#147;In X number of years you will have X number of children with this disability. Plan for it!&#148; If they cannot even plan across health, social care and education, what about housing? It is a very poor relative in all this, and there does not seem to be any planning whatsoever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para21"><a name="08072258000245">I would like the Minister to take away a simple message: endorse the comments being made about agencies working together and planning the needs of their local community. There have been many changes in the way that local government operates, such as local area agreements and the setting up of children&#146;s trusts, that should facilitate that. There are opportunities for the housing needs of children with disabilities to be incorporated into strategic planning.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making some good points. Does she agree with the point that our hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) made about accessing information and advice&#151;that it would be helpful to have a named lead officer in each local authority with responsibility for housing advice and leading the way on assessment and assistance for disabled children? Such officers would link social services and whoever else is involved, so that we get a coherent response.</p>

 I absolutely agree. Information, advice and guidance are key to everything that we do for families with disabled children. They need that advice and guidance on education, health, social care and housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para22"><a name="08072258000248">There are concerns about areas with two-tier authorities. I see the difference between the two halves of my constituency. The half in Blackpool has a unitary authority that has co-ordinated services, which means that I can get such advice from one person, who should therefore be able to give similar advice to residents. The other half has Lancashire county council, the third-tier authority, providing children&#146;s and social services, and Wyre borough council as a housing authority. Those authorities need to liaise with each other, particularly because the housing authority is planning future housing development. I speak as a former Lancashire county councillor, so I know that the situation is not new. The difficulty of getting information and co-ordination across two-tier authorities has always been complex, but there are now ways of doing things that did not exist before, and we can get that co-ordination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para23"><a name="08072258000249">I want to discuss some of the recommendations in the Every Disabled Child Matters report. One recommendation was that Government offices should</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="80722h0006.htm_para24"><a name="08072258000250">Of course, to underpin that, we need a clear idea of who those children are, how many there are and the nature of their disabilities, but such analysis often does not exist. One reason why is that clinicians sometimes make inaccurate prognoses about children&#146;s future outcomes. When a baby is born with profound disabilities, it is difficult for a clinician to say exactly what is wrong with the child and how they might progress as they grow older. I have had constituency cases in which the family had been told that a child&#146;s disability would have certain consequences, but five or six years later the situation was entirely different. It is therefore important, if agencies are to work together, that clinicians make as clear a diagnosis as possible about the child and their life chances.</p>

It does not necessarily need to be shared by saying, for example, &#147;Jane Smith has been born; she has this and that disability and you will need to do x to support her and her family.&#148; Information can be shared numerically. We can look at groups of children and plan services for them. Parents think that we already do that, but it is not happening, and we need to look at ways of doing it to make their lives much easier. We can then have the sort of housing strategy that we are talking about. Similarly, housing must be included in the core offer that will be available   <br>

to families through the Aiming High for Disabled Children programme. As local authorities liaise with families in such circumstances, they should consider housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para1"><a name="08072258000252">As my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North said in her excellent speech, we must consider the space that many such families need, and the disabled child&#146;s need for a bedroom and toilet facilities. The need for toilet facilities causes more problems than anything else as children grow older, because if there is no downstairs toilet or bathroom, families cannot lift them up and down stairs. In many houses, through-floor lifts are impractical, and stair lifts, if families can get them, are not always suitable for disabled children. We must ensure that housing authorities, developers and providers understand what we mean by providing appropriate space and adaptations in homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para2"><a name="08072258000253">I visited a home in my constituency that had been specially built for a family with three sons who all had muscular dystrophy. The house looked wonderfully spacious and had a huge kitchen and living room. When it was built, it served the children&#146;s needs, but when I met those boys they were young men in their early 20s. The house that had been perfectly adequate for them when they were younger was no longer adequate for them, and I liaised with the family about alternatives such as providing independent accommodation for those young men. Even when a problem seems to have been solved, that might no longer be the case as children grow older and the space that has been made available is no longer enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para3"><a name="08072258000254">My hon. Friend talked about the importance of housing as a risk factor. It is not only a risk factor in the sense that there is risk to the child of having an accident at home; there is also risk to the family of breakdown and abuse. If a family suffers much anxiety and stress because of the housing in which they live, it may, sadly, result in physical violence among family members, including the disabled child. A family&#146;s housing situation can also put pressure on the services that are available to them. If their circumstances are so inadequate that they cannot cope with the pressures as a family, they will make more demands on everybody else, such as demands for short breaks or demands on the health service. If the home situation is sorted, the family might not need as many services. They will need some, and those services need to be available, but some of the pressure on services that provide short breaks, for example, comes about because families cannot cope in their current circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para4"><a name="08072258000255">I hope that the Minister will be proactive in this matter, and that he will look to the responsibilities of local government. I hope that he will take into account the modern building techniques that housing developers can use, which have been implemented in certain areas. New properties can be constructed in such a way that adaptations can easily be made, such as moving light switches up and down. One of my brothers is an architect and he tells me about all the new things that are available. We should be using them. We should no longer be building little boxes that cannot be adapted&#151;something that undermines the things we are talking about. We need properties that can be adapted easily to the family&#146;s needs, whatever they are&#151;whether the family have a disabled child or, later, an elderly relative living in the home, who could equally benefit from adaptations to it.</p>

They may be disabled children, but they are children first. They should have opportunities to play and to have private time to themselves. When they become teenagers, what teenager wants their mother or father to carry them to the toilet and supervise them in there, and carry them back out? Let us remember that they are children and we should give them the sort of life chances that any child should have. Their housing needs are part of that.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to take part in this debate, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on securing it in the last gasp of the parliamentary term before we rise for the recess. I congratulate, too, the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on pulling together information in a pretty neglected area. The report makes it explicit that it is difficult to drill down to the numbers of affected individuals. At one end of the spectrum the figure appears to be enormous. According to the Government&#146;s own estimates, 770,000 children in the UK have a disability, based on the definitions in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which cover a wide range of disabilities from severe physical impairment to behavioural difficulties. The hon. Lady elucidated the wide range of demands that that might place on housing needs, which can create difficulties in responding. There may be some common factors relating to space, but the differing needs of children in different areas, with different disabilities, make co-ordination quite complicated, and that needs much better understanding at local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para6"><a name="08072258000258">We can talk in very broad terms about the number of young people with a disability, but the report made it clear that much of the more detailed work that it has been possible to carry out has focused on children with severe disabilities. We need to know an awful lot more about the whole spectrum of disabilities. We need much more information so that we can be better placed to understand the problem as well as to find solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para7"><a name="08072258000259">The report was also excellent at raising the wide range of challenges posed when families live with and care for a disabled child. The issue is not simply access. That is an easy assumption that is made all too often. There may be a need for appropriate family space or sleeping accommodation, or the issues may be wider housing conditions, safety or overcrowding. It is disturbing that families with a disabled child are 50 per cent. more likely than other families to be overcrowded. That is quite a startling statistic. One of the other factors that can be thrown into the mix, as the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) has mentioned, is the fact that people&#146;s needs and requirements are likely to change over time. That means that flexibility is needed in assessment, so that there is not just one point at which a young person is assessed, when their need base is established for the future. What is needed is an almost continual review process, so that as the family and young person change, their needs are met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para8"><a name="08072258000260">It is disturbing that housing is not the priority when many issues relating to meeting disabled young people&#146;s needs are discussed in local and central Government.   <br>

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 210WH</b><br>
We see from the report that all too often disabled facilities grants become the gateway for a wide assessment of the appropriateness of housing. People who do not fall into the relevant category or make the application seem to fall through the net altogether. At central Government level, the work that has been undertaken has not focused on housing. &#147;Aiming high for disabled children&#148; was largely focused on health and social care for young people. The focus in the Department for Children, Schools and Families has, again, been on special needs education provision, rather than on considering the impact that housing could have. It is difficult to see how we can ensure that it fits into the equation. The Minister is a housing Minister, so it will be good to hear how his Department plans to co-ordinate with the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and the Department of Health, to ensure that all the issues properly join up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para9"><a name="08072258000261">Exactly the same challenges face central and local government. The hon. Lady spoke about the additional challenges posed by two-tier authorities in trying to marry up all the issues. What is happening in the context that we are considering is probably an example of a wider problem: the silo approach to delivering services, at local or national Government level, or both. I can think of examples involving families with disabled children when it has been incredibly frustrating to try to join up all the different Departments, and the support that the family were trying to get. Probably most of my surgeries include a handful of people who come with a problem that has been caused by difficulty in joining different Departments together. The concern, where disabled children are concerned, is the extra vulnerability in the mix, which means that it should be even more of a priority to resolve the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para10"><a name="08072258000262">The report is explicit in its recommendations to central and local government about getting recognition in local and regional planning of the needs of disabled children, such as space requirements and the need for living and communal space. It also flags up the lack of any requirement to ensure that a disabled child has their own bedroom. Not being able to provide that will, in many cases, have a massive impact on the whole family&#146;s quality of life and ability to cope. The report is also explicit about the need to get central and local government to join up, and makes helpful suggestions about identifying a senior officer to be responsible for co-ordination, and getting housing on to the list of factors that need to be considered when assessments are made. Those are practical things that could be done fairly easily, by local authorities pushing best practice and through clear guidance and expectation from central Government. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to those specific proposals, which would make the process much easier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para11"><a name="08072258000263">Three other issues need to be considered more widely, however. I have already touched on the first one, which is about not just catering for disabled children&#146;s housing needs, but the management of their transition into adulthood. Some of the young people whom this debate is about will be severely disabled, and reliant on carers&#151;usually their families&#151;to look after them for the rest of their lives; but some will expect to live independently at some point. There are questions to be addressed about ensuring that their needs are met not just when they are children, but also when they are adults. A figure that struck me in the evidence submitted by the Joseph Rowntree  <br>

Foundation in support of the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign document showed the availability of specially adapted accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para12"><a name="08072258000264">The most telling statistic is that less than half of disabled children who require specially adapted homes live in suitable accommodation. That contrasts with the 80 per cent. of people aged 65 or over living in accommodation that is specifically adapted to their needs. Clearly, there is much better performance in respect of the older age range, where there is a wider expectation that access and other issues will be addressed. The second most shocking statistic is that only 60 per cent. of people aged 16 to 44 live in accommodation that is adapted to their needs, so although it is worst for young people, it is pretty bad for young adults, too. The transition must be managed, and I wonder whether it might be more difficult now that child services and adult services have been separated. I can think of examples in my constituency whereby families have had real difficulties getting their child&#146;s needs met during the transition. They are suddenly treated as a different person in respect of the requirements that must be met once they hit 18 years old. There are equivalent challenges in meeting their housing needs, and the issue needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para13"><a name="08072258000265">The provision of housing for disabled adults also needs to be addressed. We know that disabled children are more likely to live in poverty, but children are also more likely to live in poverty if their parents are disabled. It is important that we address the needs&#151;particularly the housing needs&#151;of any family facing a disability, whether a child&#146;s or an adult&#146;s, because it will impact on their quality of life, on their space requirements and on many other considerations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para14"><a name="08072258000266">More widely, how much do local authorities actually know about the scale of the problem and the level of need in their area? We know, broadly, the numbers of children living with a disability and the qualitative information about young people with specific, severe disabilities, but we have no sense of what is going on across the piece. There is a wide variety of need in different areas, so what will the Minister do to help local authorities undertake a basic fact-finding exercise to ensure that the proposals are based on assessed needs rather than on central estimates?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para15"><a name="08072258000267">The debate about the prioritisation of families with disabled children and their lack of access to housing is almost academic unless the fundamental issue about the lack of social housing is addressed. Some 1.6 million people are on social housing lists, and the Local Government Association predicts that the number will reach 2 million by 2010. That is important for families with disabled children, because they are more likely to be tenants than homeowners. From talking to housing officers in my constituency, I know that the biggest shortage is in decent-sized family accommodation. A few months back, I asked them about the property turnover that they expected, because the biggest reason why people turn up at my constituency surgery is housing and an inability to find appropriate housing. Those people are often families, and while it is easy to say that a disabled child should automatically have their own room, if only a handful of family-sized houses changes hands over one year, only those with the most acute needs will have their requirements met. That may mean  <br>

that not all the needs of families with disabled children in the area will be met, so unless something is done to address the wider problems, families with disabled children will still be in a difficult situation.</p>

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="08072258000268"><a name="80722h0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="08072258000531"><b>Ms Keeble:</b>
 Given that the hon. Lady&#146;s party is committed to tax cuts and to cutting public spending, how would she increase spending to meet people&#146;s profound need for social housing, let alone for disabled housing?</p>

 We have not committed to tax cuts; we have said that the burden of taxation falls unfairly on those on the lowest incomes. Our priority should be that problem&#146;s resolution, and I hope that the hon. Lady agrees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para16"><a name="08072258000270">A constituent of mine has a disabled son and lives in terrible circumstances, but the local authority uses the existing rules on needs assessment, and the disability is exacerbating matters. My constituent lives in the same property as her abusive ex-partner, she has a child on the at-risk register and she cannot leave because she has been told that she will lose her tenancy and be judged intentionally homeless. It has caused many problems, but the fact that she has a son with learning disabilities should not be the reason why the situation is unacceptable; wider issues need to be resolved. There needs to be a fundamental consideration of how to meet the challenges of social housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para17"><a name="08072258000271">The Housing Corporation will not meet its target for building social housing this year. The hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood discussed requirements, including ensuring that new homes are adaptable and accessible, but the discussion is academic unless we build new social homes. The building of social housing is no longer cyclical to the housing market; it is in sync with the cycle. Now that there are wider difficulties in the house building market, my concern is that the availability of social housing will dry up even more.</p>

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="08072258000272"><a name="80722h0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="08072258000533"><b>Mrs. Humble:</b>
 The hon. Lady is quite right that we need to build houses in a different way and ensure that they are adaptable to a variety of different needs. However, does she agree that there are families living in homes that need not major but fairly minor adaptations, but that, often, the families are unaware of them? Toilets, for example once more, can be adapted so that children and adults with a disability can use them. People need to have information and resources to access the easy adaptations to their premises.</p>

 The hon.

I again congratulate the hon. Member for Northampton, North on ensuring that it is on Parliament&#146;s agenda, but I very much look forward to hearing from the Minister what he and his Department can do to draw the important strands together, so that that most vulnerable group of people receives the support that it needs and deserves.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 213WH</b><br>
the recess I join all other Members in congratulating the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on securing the debate and on her speech. Both her speech and that of the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) were cogently argued and raised some very important points. I also want to join all Members who have spoken in welcoming the work of the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign and the underlying research documentation that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation produced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000275">One of the themes of today&#146;s debate is the recognition that, in dealing with these issues, not only is there a need for a cross-departmental approach at local level and a cross-agency approach, but there is clearly a need for a cross-departmental approach at Government level as well. I am sure that the Minister will be able to assist us on those matters when he replies to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para19"><a name="08072258000276">The Every Disabled Child Matters document makes some cogent and important points and we need to look at finding practical ways to take forward some of the ideas that have been raised in this debate. The hon. Member for Northampton, North referred to the issues of supply and space. Those are important considerations, as hon. Members who have read the document will know. There is an issue about the supply of accessible homes and that relates to accessible homes in all sectors in the housing market. John Grooms, the specialist housing charity, estimates that there will be a shortfall of about 300,000 homes that are needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para20"><a name="08072258000277">I agree with all the hon. Members who have spoken, in that I imagine that every Member of this House has some experience from their own constituency casework of people who are under pressure because of the lack of appropriate accommodation. I agree that it is particularly difficult for those with children, especially managing the transition from childhood to adulthood and then on to independent living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para21"><a name="08072258000278">I have been helped in my understanding of those issues by the work of an organisation in my constituency called Bromley Sparks, which acts as an advocacy group for young people with a range of disabilities who are exactly at that stage of life when they are seeking to move into independent living, sometimes, of course, because their own parents are no longer in a position to assist them. The work of Bromley Sparks in our local area is very valuable and it is an example of how the voluntary sector can work constructively with local authorities and housing associations to tackle the issue of independent living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="80722h0007.htm_para22"><a name="08072258000279">The point about bedroom sizes and general space within the home is a valid one and one that we need to look at in considering how we take things forward. The Government have an aspiration for all homes to meet lifetime home standards. As the Minister will know, my hon. Friends and I have welcomed that aspiration. At the moment, the plan for all homes to meet those standards is being rolled out to the public sector first. The Minister will also know that my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper), who speaks on disability matters for the Oppostion, has raised with him how we ensure, at the appropriate point, that there is a level playing field in relation to all housing supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para0"><a name="08072258000280">It is important that we take these issues on board, but it is also important that we ensure that developers, planners and the public alike understand the implications of lifetime homes. For example, it is important in areas  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 July 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 214WH</b><br>
such as London and other major cities, where space is at a premium, that we accept that lifetime homes may sometimes require a degree of flexibility in the application of density targets in relation to specific sites, to ensure that homes that have the requisite size can be provided, where appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para1"><a name="08072258000281">Of course, it is also important in how we look at the detail of planning policy, so that, for example, we do not have the situation that has occurred in previous years where calculation of densities by units rather than by habitable rooms per hectare can tend towards the creation of flatted units, whereas we all know&#151;I think that it is common ground between us&#151;that particularly in affordable housing and to some degree the market sector there is a shortage of family housing, as has been referred to during the debate. It is a case of finding the means that enable those family homes to be delivered promptly and easily; that is terribly important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para2"><a name="08072258000282">I agree that that does require good work by local authorities. With respect to the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood, I do not think that she was saying that it is an impossible hurdle when people are dealing with two-tier authorities; in fact, I know that she was not saying that. It can be tougher. However, there are examples of good practice and many of us know that the Local Government Association is keen to encourage that good practice.</p>

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="08072258000283"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="08072258000536"><b>Mrs. Humble:</b>
 I would not want my hon. Friend the Minister to go away with the idea that, although there are problems with two-tier authorities, those problems are insuperable. I shall give the hon. Gentleman one example that I know about of two-tier authorities working together. Lancashire county council told my borough of the needs of a particular family. When some new building was taking place, within that new build a home was constructed specifically for that family&#146;s needs; in fact, they had more than one disabled child. So two-tier authorities can work in this area.</p>

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="08072258000284"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="08072258000537"><b>Robert Neill:</b>
 The hon. Lady is absolutely right. She reinforces the point that I think that we are all agreed upon, that encouragement of good practice is important. However, I would also make the point that the closer that housing strategy is developed to the community that those houses are going to serve the more likely we are to get that really accurate and detailed assessment of the housing needs of particular communities that can deliver those homes. A remote construction of housing strategy tends to militate against the objectives that I hope all of us are seeking to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para3"><a name="08072258000285">Similarly, as the Minister will know, my party broadly welcomes the changes that have been made in relation to the disabled facilities grant. Those changes give more flexibility to local authorities. However, one thing that we want to ensure is that in practice the end of the 60:40 split in related matters enables local authorities genuinely to ensure that the same amount of money is available and that they can optimise on that flexibility at a time when their budgets from other sources are, of course, very constrained. Nevertheless it is, of course, the right direction to be going in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para4"><a name="08072258000286">I also want to say that the point about registers of accessible housing and assessment of need is a valid one that is flagged up in the report. It seems to me that those registers are an example of something that can be done,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 July 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 215WH</b><br>
with the use of modern technology, without the need for huge bureaucracy. Those registers are not difficult for forward-thinking local authorities to achieve. I hope that we will be able to work with the local government community in achieving them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para5"><a name="08072258000287">It seems that the overall objective for all of us is to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility and sensitivity built into both the system and the use of budgets, so that we can deliver the funding that is available to the area that it is likely to be most effective, so that assessment targets the real needs of people and we incentivise the various agencies that are involved in this issue to pull together in the most constructive way possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para6"><a name="08072258000288">That process includes the issue of adaptations. Again, the point is well made that there has been good work and there have been improvements&#151;I know from my own locality that real efforts have been made to speed up the assessment of need&#151;but there are still areas where more needs to be done. I hope that the Government will continue to monitor those improvements and to work with the local government community, including local councils, to identify the most efficient ways of making those improvements and bringing that good practice forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para7"><a name="08072258000289">Of course, we have to take on board the holistic picture, if you like, in relation to the funding that is made available to disabled people. For example, I know that some people find that, when they have savings and they then apply for grants for capital facilities and so on, those savings militate against them getting some support. That seems rather onerous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para8"><a name="08072258000290">There is another interesting issue that I have come across. Somebody may move, for perfectly good reasons, from a house that has been specifically adapted for disabled living, but we must ensure that that house is still available for others who could benefit from those facilities. It is not something that needs to be complicated, but it reinforces the need for the various agencies to talk to each other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para9"><a name="08072258000291">This has been a very constructive debate, which has highlighted a very important issue and the work of valuable organisations in an area that is worthy of our attention, and I would express the hope, as other hon.

Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) in particular touched on it, and I agree with her. As hon. Members will know, increasing the supply of good quality, affordable housing for everyone, including households that have special needs, is a key priority for this Government. I am therefore grateful for the opportunity to discuss briefly what we have done and our future aims specifically in respect of the needs of disabled children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para12"><a name="08072258000295">The hon. Lady mentioned the need for additional spend and for ensuring that we focus on affordable housing. Again, I agree with her. We are providing &#163;8.4 billion across the regions over the next three years to invest in affordable housing, initially through the Housing Corporation and then, touch wood&#151;I believe that the Housing and Regeneration Bill will be receiving Royal Assent any second now&#151;through the new Homes and Communities Agency. That will be a 50 per cent. increase in funding compared with the previous three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para13"><a name="08072258000296">The hon. Lady also mentioned affordable housing units. We are increasing the number of affordable houses to 70,000 by 2010-11, of which 45,000 will be new social rented homes. That is 50 per cent. more than last year. That is an important consideration in respect of increasing the supply of housing, particularly affordable housing.</p>

<p><a name="st_71"><a name="08072258000297"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="08072258000539"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b>
 I am pleased to hear the Minister outline the degree to which the Government are making affordable housing a priority, but does he not agree that 45,000 additional social rented homes set against waiting lists totalling 1.6 million indicates the scale of the problem? The provision will meet a fraction of the underlying need.</p>

<p><a name="st_72"><a name="08072258000298"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew3"><a name="08072258000540"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 I agree with the hon. Lady&#146;s essential premise, which is that we have not been building enough homes. There is a huge imbalance between the demand for and supply of housing. We need a variety of providers to help meet the demand. The private sector and registered social landlords will play a role, and councils will play a role in direct delivery. We need all of them to step up to the plate to ensure a good supply of affordable housing across the board that addresses the specific needs of different segments of the population.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="08072258000299"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew4"><a name="08072258000541"><b>Mr. Andrew Smith:</b>
 We all agree that there is a need to provide more housing, and more social housing, particularly for disabled children, but would the Minister agree that as well as public and private investment, in many areas, including my own in central Oxfordshire, we need more planning permission, some of which will almost certainly have to be for green belt land, in order to find sites suitable for the social housing that is desperately needed? Was it not curious that during the Henley by-election, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats competed with each other to oppose a site that could have provided such housing?</p>

moved straight to the points raised by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, who is the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para14"><a name="08072258000301">My hon. Friends the Members for Northampton, North and for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) touched on three points. The first concerned the strategic housing assessment that local authorities are required to make. The second concerned adaptation and problems of accessibility, and the third concerned space and overcrowding. I shall address those points one by one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para15"><a name="08072258000302">We have rightly discussed strategic housing assessments and the role of local authorities. My right hon. Friend intervened on me on this matter. It is included in the recommendations of the report &#147;Disabled children and housing&#148;, which states, as has been mentioned, that Government offices for the regions are to ensure that all English regions and localities consider the housing needs of families with disabled children as they develop their housing strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para16"><a name="08072258000303">The House will be aware that the housing Green Paper that we published last year calls on local authorities to play a stronger role in addressing the housing needs of all residents as part of their crucial place-shaping role. As part of that, they are expected to assess and plan for the current and future housing needs of all local people, including vulnerable people such as families with disabled children. We expect the Government offices, as part of their relationship management role, to work closely with local authorities to ensure that their strategies, including those on housing, address the needs of all local people.</p>

<p><a name="st_75"><a name="08072258000304"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew6"><a name="08072258000543"><b>Mrs. Humble</b>

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="08072258000305"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew7"><a name="08072258000544"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 I shall discuss the Homes and Communities Agency and then give way. The relationship between the new agency and local authorities will be valuable. Councils will be allowed to step up to the plate to provide skills and capacity and, in some respects&#151;this is a direct response to my right hon. Friend&#151;local authorities will be challenged if they are not providing enough in terms of the needs of their local community.</p>

<p><a name="st_77"><a name="08072258000306"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew8"><a name="08072258000545"><b>Ms Keeble:</b>
 Would my hon. Friend accept that one of the issues around the assessments is that, at present, there is not proper recognition of the spatial requirements of families with children with disabilities, in particular learning and behavioural difficulties? If assessments are to be made, they must take on board the fact that such families have different and greater requirements, and that it is not enough to make the assessment on the basis of the current assumptions about the type of space and facilities that they require.</p>

<p><a name="st_78"><a name="08072258000307"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew9"><a name="08072258000546"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 That is an important point, and I shall liaise with colleagues in the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department of Health to consider what else we can do to provide guidance for local authorities that will help to address it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para17"><a name="08072258000308">I come back time and again to the point that local authorities are best placed to provide the place-shaping role in their local areas. They are usually best placed to understand what is necessary in their local area. I was struck by an intervention from the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone), in which he spoke about  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 July 2008">

bungalows. I agree with him on that. Certainly on my own patch but on others as well, there will be a need to accommodate older people and other vulnerable people. We need to address that, and local authorities should do that with their strategic housing role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000309">Let me move on to adaptation and accessibility. I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Bayley, for speaking about the Housing and Regeneration Bill again, but hon. Members will understand that I have lived with it for 12 months. I have let it go now, but I am going through cold turkey and need to talk about it a little.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para19"><a name="08072258000310">One of the first amendments that we discussed&#151;we considered Lords amendments last night&#151;was to clause 2, which deals with the objects of the new Homes and Communities Agency. The agency is charged with improving and increasing the supply of housing in England, regenerating communities in England and having regard to sustainable development in pursuing its objectives. The amendment that came from the other place was that the agency should also have regard to the needs of elderly and disabled persons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para20"><a name="08072258000311">That is an important amendment. It very much chimes with what the Government want: homes that are easily accessible and adaptable, and that meet the lifetime needs of the population. That is very important, and I believe that accessibility will be a condition of grant from the agency when we and others bid to provide social housing.</p>

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="08072258000312"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew10"><a name="08072258000547"><b>Mr. Andrew Smith:</b>
 Will the Minister also keep under review the content of building regulations in this area? They are obviously a means by which general guidance can be enforced to the benefit of disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="st_80"><a name="08072258000313"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew11"><a name="08072258000548"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 I have ministerial responsibility for building regulations. They are an interest and a passion of mine, and I want to have a look at them. I shall certainly consider my right hon. Friend&#146;s suggestion in the overall general cycle of reviewing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para21"><a name="08072258000314">On the disabled facilities grant, I was pleased with what hon. Members from both sides of the House said about the changes that we have made. Hon. Members will be aware that the disabled facilities grant is a mandatory entitlement for eligible applicants to help fund adaptations, such as the provision of ramps, door widening, stair-lifts and level access showers. Funding for the disabled facilities grant programme has more than doubled from &#163;57 million in 1997 to &#163;146 million in 2008, and it will rise to &#163;166 million by 2010, an increase of over 30 per cent. That is in recognition of the important role that the grant plays in maintaining disabled people&#146;s independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para22"><a name="08072258000315">We recognise how important this grant is for families with disabled children. In December 2005, we ended means-testing for this group, removing the disincentive to work for parents and ending the delay that is harmful to children&#146;s life chances, improving the health of both parents and children. As hon. Members have mentioned, in May we announced a package of measures to modernise and improve the disabled facilities grant programme, including raising the limit on a single grant to &#163;30,000, which had the immediate benefit of helping children with complex needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para23"><a name="08072258000316">My hon. Friends the Members for Northampton, North and for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood mentioned  <br>

access to gardens, which is an important part of the disabled facilities grant. Previously, that was not an explicit grant condition, but now it is. That change will benefit children in particular by giving them a greater opportunity to play outdoors and helping raise their quality of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para24"><a name="08072258000317">I acknowledge the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North. Families with disabled children can face greater costs in adapting their properties than are allowed for under the current maximum limit. The Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) Order 2002 allows local authorities greater flexibility in providing discretionary assistance for repairs and adaptations. My hon. Friend mentioned that she wished to see the &#163;30,000 cap removed to take into account lifestyle changes as the child gets older and has different needs. I understand where she is coming from, but there is no limit on the number of applications that can be made to the DFG, so if the needs of a child change, as is inevitable, further applications for assistance approved by the local authority will entitle them, again, to a further grant of up to &#163;30,000. That addresses the points raised by my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="08072258000318"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew12"><a name="08072258000549"><b>Mrs. Humble:</b>
 I am pleased that the Minister has confirmed that people are able to re-apply. A family with a disabled child, in a case that I took up, went to their local authority to see if they could have a new adaptation because the child was growing, but they were told that they could not. It was only after I had intervened on their behalf that we clarified this point. Again, as hon. Members have mentioned, appropriate information and advice to parents is a key issue.</p>

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="08072258000319"><a name="80722h0008.htm_spnew13"><a name="08072258000550"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 I am pleased that I was able to help to clarify matters. I agree with my hon. Friend that information is key with regard to this issue. We are proud of our record on the disabled facilities grant, but we are not complacent. I recognise that ongoing work is needed further to modernise the programme. Work is going on in the coming year to improve the delivery of the programme, with an overhaul of the means test and application form to help speed up the process. Other changes include the removal of the ring fence to increase flexibility in the provision of adaptations, while continuing to ensure that they are provided by retaining the mandatory nature of the grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="80722h0008.htm_para25"><a name="08072258000320">My Department will continue to work with stakeholders and other Departments in helping to modernise the programme. I should be interested to hear further from stakeholders, including the Every Disabled Child Matters group, about how the programme could be made to work more effectively as part of this ongoing process. I am aware that the Every Disabled Child Matters group is meeting my noble Friend and ministerial colleague, Baroness Andrews, in a couple of weeks to discuss this matter. That is a welcome step. Our aspiration is to see all homes built to lifetime home standards by 2011.</p>

home standards. My noble Friend Baroness Andrews has been a passionate champion of these standards and she has pushed this agenda through Whitehall to ensure that there is a Government commitment. I pay tribute to her for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para0"><a name="08072258000323">As this debate has shown, we need to create a more adaptable housing stock to address changes to our population as we get older and with regard to the specific needs of people with young families or disabilities, or both. We are also committed to ensuring that all publicly funded housing will be built to lifetime home standards by 2011. Features that are suitable for elderly people will also benefit many other groups in society, including those with young families and disabled people. We are learning from experience that, if we design solely for the young, some people can be excluded, but if we design with the elderly in mind everybody benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para1"><a name="08072258000324">The Housing Corporation and the Homes and Communities Agency, which I mention yet again, is committed to increasing the number of homes built to lifetime homes standards. That commitment is included in its national affordable housing programme 2008-11. It is also committed to including this as a mandatory standard in future programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para2"><a name="08072258000325">Local authorities are not obliged to build to the lifetime homes standards. However, a number of draft regional spatial strategies have made reference to specifically considering the needs of disabled and elderly people in developing housing strategies. As a result, local authorities will need to consider carefully how they can meet the need for accessible housing in their area, through measures such as the provision of lifetime homes or wheelchair accessible housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para3"><a name="08072258000326">I now move on to the third point that my hon. Friend raised regarding overcrowding. I know from the early-day motion on disabled children and housing and the campaign briefing that lack of space is a particular concern. That has been mentioned in today&#146;s debate. I am all too aware of the problems that overcrowding can lead to, particularly for children: it can affect their health, their education and their wider well-being; it can leave small children with no room for toys; and it can leave older ones with no space to do homework or play with friends and make them more likely to underachieve at school. We need to do something about this. As hon. Members have mentioned, these issues may be particularly acute for households with disabled members. Therefore we need to ensure that local housing authorities have tangible means of helping overcrowded households to provide real solutions to this very real issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para4"><a name="08072258000327">Of course, ensuring that new housing developments include larger properties is key to solving overcrowding. We are increasing the national percentage of social rented homes delivered through the affordable housing programme to 30 per cent. in 2008-09, rising to 33 per cent. in 2010-11&#151;that is from a current provision of 25 per cent. That means more family-sized homes with three or more bedrooms, which will help overcrowded households, including those with disabled children, where space for equipment can be a real problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para5"><a name="08072258000328">Last year, we supported pilot projects in London to demonstrate and test innovative new approaches to tackling overcrowding. To date we have invested more than &#163;35 million in pilot schemes in London, which  <br>

have successfully developed effective ways of tackling this problem in the capital, where the pressures are particularly acute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para6"><a name="08072258000329">We want to ensure that good practice on reducing overcrowding is disseminated. We used lessons from the pilots in developing our action plan, published last December, which sets out how both local authorities and registered social landlords can manage their existing stock in innovative and proactive ways to address overcrowding. We are investing a further &#163;15 million over the next three years, starting with 38 pathfinder areas that account for over half of overcrowded social tenants. This year, each pathfinder has been allocated &#163;110,000 to develop their own action plans for tackling overcrowding, based on good practice and the innovative approaches developed by the pilots.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para7"><a name="08072258000330">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate and on the manner in which it has been conducted. Every hon. Member who contributed to this debate rightly mentioned constituency matters. We have all had to deal with this matter in relation to cases in our constituency mail boxes. For example, I have tried to help get a house for Mr. and Mrs. Wareing and their severely disabled daughter, Katie.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para8"><a name="08072258000331">Building on the work that we have already done in the past 10 years, there are challenges with regard to the disabled facilities grant, in respect of moving forward to ensure that we have the accommodation that this whole country needs and, particularly, with regard to ensuring that we can address the needs, wishes and aspirations of families with disabled children. That is what a Labour Government should be doing.</p>

 It is a privilege to introduce one of the last debates before the recess. It relates to an issue that has preoccupied me pretty much since I became an MP 11 years ago. At our weekly surgeries, we all see people with legal problems which those of us who are not legally qualified struggle with. Many involve unhappiness about the treatment provided by solicitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para9"><a name="08072258000333">To give an idea of the order of magnitude, last year Citizens Advice had 300,000 cases with a legal dimension referred to it, a quarter of which involved the conduct of the solicitors involved. That conduct was not necessarily wrong, but the figures show the magnitude of the problem. I acknowledge that not all the complaints that we hear about solicitors are valid, however strongly expressed. In many cases, people believe that they have been cheated by the legal system, and that may have been so on grounds of common sense or natural justice, but they may have lost on a point of law and find that difficult to accept, particularly as it is so difficult to obtain legal aid funding. We are coming increasingly close to do-it-yourself law with people pursuing their own cases in complex areas and feeling a sense of grievance about the process when they lose. Many people blame their solicitors when the problems lie with the HM Courts Service, judges or elsewhere, but in many cases there is a genuine complaint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para10"><a name="08072258000334">Another qualification that I want to make at the outset is that I recognise that, as with accountants, architects and Members of Parliament, I am sure that the vast majority of solicitors are entirely honest, competent and admirable professionals, but some are not and it is those with which we are concerned. During the Government&#146;s period of office attempts have been made to strengthen the profession&#146;s self-regulating processes, particularly that covering solicitors. The Government have been active in that and I am not criticising their approach, but there are some loose ends that I shall refer to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para11"><a name="08072258000335">Citizens Advice sent me a brief for this debate, which is worth quoting. Its considered judgment&#151;it probably hears about more such cases than anyone else&#151;is:</p>
<a name="80722h0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08072258000448"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We support recent reforms to legal services regulation, and have long argued that consumers...are not sufficiently protected from poor or negligent services by the traditional systems of...self-regulation within the legal profession. Too often we see cases in which clients have been very poorly advised and serviced by their solicitor, and costs have been vastly disproportionate to the issues involved. The consequences of poor conduct by solicitors can be devastating for their clients. Therefore we welcome this debate.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para12"><a name="08072258000336">I have just been at a meeting in Committee Room 6 with an organisation called Complaints Against Solicitors, action for Independent Adjudication&#151;CASIA&#151;which was established 13 years ago; I seem to remember that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) was actively involved with it. It is a network of people who have had terrible experiences, not just with solicitors, but with the legal system. Many of the people I have just met had appalling stories to tell of ruin caused by negligence or, in some cases, worse treatment by their solicitors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para13"><a name="08072258000337">To provide a perspective on the matter, it may be helpful if I review the continuous process of change that has characterised the legal complaints process.  <br>

I am not sure what happened before 1997, but I believe that there was something called the Solicitors Complaints Bureau within the Law Society which dealt with complaints. It evolved into the office for the supervision of solicitors, which most of us remember dealing with and which was notorious for delays, evasion and administrative failures. I believe that the Government shared that assessment and were critical of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para14"><a name="08072258000338">The Minister&#146;s predecessor, David Lock, talked about self-regulation of the legal profession as a privilege and not a right, and on the back of that the Government initiated various changes with the Law Society, including establishment of the legal complaints commission&#151;the Office of the Legal Service Complaints Commissioner&#151;and, in 2006, the splitting of the various regulatory processes within the legal profession, one branch leading to the Solicitors Regulation Authority and another leading to the legal complaints commission, which is interrelated with an ombudsman, who happens to be the same individual as the legal complaints commissioner. In 2010 and 2011, we shall move into a new environment in which there will be an overarching Legal Services Board split into two subsidiary roles&#151;the SRA and the Office of Legal Complaints, which will have the OLSCC and the ombudsman folded into it. Merely reciting that list of organisations indicates a rapid and continuous process of organisational flux, which may have been necessary, but has been enormously confusing to people pursuing long and complex complaints.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para15"><a name="08072258000339">To evaluate where the matter is heading, it is worth quoting <i>Which?</i> The Consumers Association acknowledges that in the past few years, the changes have</p>
<a name="80722h0009.htm_brev1"><a name="08072258000449"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;meant that since 2006 the LCS has much improved, while the SRA has made much of its independence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para16"><a name="08072258000340">Clearly, there has been action, and there is statistical evidence that the SRA has been striking off or suspending more solicitors. The number rose from 32 to 45 between 2006 and 2007, but the OLSCC fined the Legal Complaints Service for an inadequate plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para17"><a name="08072258000341">I have two questions for the Minister. Will the OLSCC, which has established itself as a genuinely independent and often outspoken voice for consumers, continue to have oversight of the arrangements until the new set of institutions comes into effect in two years? My second question concerns a point that the consumer bodies are anxious to pursue. What is the Government&#146;s position on the proposal that complaints data should be published? It is obviously important that when someone approaches a new solicitor they have some indication of that solicitor&#146;s past record and whether complaints have been upheld. Consumer groups are anxious that there should be full and transparent publication. I know that the Law Society is going out to consultation, but do the Government have a view, and are they actively promoting it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000342">Before coming to my two key issues, I must digress a little into a case that has established my interest in the matter. I do not want to go too far into the details of a complex case that goes back over a number of years, but I shall give the background. It relates to one of my constituents, Dr. Oraki, who is Iranian by origin, with whom I first became involved when she was fighting a compensation claim over a post office that was closing in Whitton in my constituency. We eventually secured compensation, largely due to the intervention of the  <br>

National Federation of SubPostmasters and me, but during the course of the battle, she sought legal advice from a firm called Dean and Dean. Its senior partner was Mr. Tehrani, and Mr. Mireskandari was a trainee solicitor. They provided her with legal services on a subsidiary issue relating to the tenancy of the property and the landlord, which was described as a fairly simple matter. Dr. Oraki entered a fixed-fee arrangement for &#163;1,000, but something went wrong in court. I was not there, but the solicitor probably did not secure the result that Dr. Oraki wanted and there was a good deal of frustration.</p>
<a name="08072258000433">
<p>Some time later, the solicitor presented a bill for more than &#163;19,000, which has become a cause c&#233;lèbre within the legal complaints process. My constituent alleged two serious failings, one of which was breach of professional care or client care, and was subsequently admitted in court&#151;I cannot comment on whether that was correct, but that was the allegation. The second, more seriously, was that one of the gentlemen involved, Mr. Mireskandari, had charged a full fee as a fully qualified solicitor when he was an assistant trainee. My constituent went to considerable lengths to demonstrate that he was not fully qualified at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para19"><a name="08072258000343">On the basis of her allegations, my constituent refused to pay the bill. The matter was referred to the legal complaints process, and she sought action in respect of professional negligence. However, in the course of that prolonged dispute, the solicitor threatened her with bankruptcy and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. She was advised&#151;including by me&#151;that bankruptcy is not a good place to be, even if one happens to be in the right. She therefore offered to pay the outstanding bill, but that was refused. She offered a second time with witnesses present and the solicitor refused to accept it again, and insisted on taking her to the bankruptcy court. She was a solvent&#151;indeed highly solvent&#151;bankrupt, but nevertheless she was made bankrupt and has been so now for three years while the legal complaints processes have rattled through the system. She has gone backwards and forwards between the Legal Complaints Service&#151;</p>

 I do not think it is before the courts any longer, Mr. Bayley, but I accept your ruling.

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para20"><a name="08072258000346">The first public policy issue is whether it is right and proper that solicitors should be able to use bankruptcy as a means of pursuing a financial claim with their clients. I have written on that subject to the Solicitor-General, who has sent me a thorough and helpful reply. I do not fully agree with it, but at least she has set out the Government&#146;s case. Her argument is that solicitors should be able to pursue a bankruptcy case just like anyone else. However, there is an obvious problem in that there is an asymmetry of knowledge. A solicitor clearly has access to much more sophisticated legal information and knows the court procedures and staff, which means it is clearly a highly one-sided encounter.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 225WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para21"><a name="08072258000347">The Solicitor-General also said that my constituent could get another lawyer to defend her in the process. The problem with that is that when someone has become bankrupt and their assets are in a trusteeship, no solicitor will take on the case. Indeed, there is a great deal of reluctance to do so&#151;not just by her, but by others. I have come across several other cases of this kind where it has become virtually impossible for people to defend themselves effectively when a solicitor&#151;especially a powerful solicitor&#151;takes bankruptcy proceedings against them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para22"><a name="08072258000348">I wish to ask a fairly open-ended question: is it possible to explore with the Law Society a mechanism whereby solicitors can pursue legitimate financial claims? Of course, like any other business, they must be able to do so&#151;I am not suggesting otherwise&#151;but it should be done in a way that prevents possible conflicts of interest and unfairness. Let me make an analogy. The situation is a bit like a dispute at a private school in which a pupil has not paid their fees because their parents will not pay them. The parents might be right or they might be wrong, but instead of simply resorting to expulsion the head teacher of the school decides to administer corporal punishment to the pupil. There is an element of that situation in this sort of treatment, so I ask the Government to think about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para23"><a name="08072258000349">Finally, the second very important issue that I wish to raise&#151;the other issues are important to the individuals concerned, but this is an important matter of public policy&#151;is whether the legal authorities have sovereign immunity. In the past few days, it has been announced in the newspapers that the solicitor to whom I referred&#151;Mr. Mireskandari&#151;is issuing a &#163;10 million defamation claim against the head of the Solicitors Regulation Authority. That was announced in the newspapers. Although I am not familiar with the individual case and cannot comment on it, I wish to ask the Minister whether the head of that organisation enjoys legal immunity from that or any other source.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para24"><a name="08072258000350">That is a public policy issue for the following reason. If the head of that body does not enjoy legal immunity, how can we be fully confident that he can do his job in the way he is required to? Imagine what would happen if the head of Ofgem could be sued by a gas company that was angry because an inquiry was being pursued. That would be an analogous problem. Are the head of the legal regulatory body and his staff protected by legal immunity?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para25"><a name="08072258000351">The same question extends to the legal services ombudsman; does it enjoy legal immunity? I am sure that the Minister understands the problem. If a powerful solicitor feels threatened by an inquiry and they feel that they have the right to issue legal proceedings against the head of the regulatory body, it is difficult to see how the integrity of the system and public confidence in it can be maintained. I am not a lawyer, but I am essentially asking the Minister about a matter of fact: are the organisations that she has quite properly established to protect the public themselves protected from legal claims?</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 226WH</b><br>
enthusiastic at the end of this part of the parliamentary Session. However, I am grateful that the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) has initiated a debate on the conduct of solicitors because it is something that is very dear to my heart, particularly as I recently took the Legal Services Act 2007 through the House. I will come back to the Act in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para26"><a name="08072258000353">It is important to recognise that almost everyone at some point in their life will have to use legal services of one sort of another. It could be a relatively straightforward thing, such as taking an oath, or something more complicated, such as buying a house, getting divorced or dealing with matters after the death of a family member. Often, when an individual&#151;the consumer or customer&#151;has to take legal advice from solicitors, they are at a vulnerable stage in their life. It is, therefore, paramount that solicitors give individuals confidence in the standing of their firm and the services they provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para27"><a name="08072258000354">It is equally important that if things go wrong&#151;as inevitably they sometimes do&#151; the complaint is taken seriously. Consumers need to know exactly where to take their complaint about poor service or the conduct of their solicitor, both now and in the future. As the hon. Member for Twickenham said, the legal profession is independent and self-regulating. The process for dealing with complaints is provided by and for solicitors&#151;by the legal profession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para28"><a name="08072258000355">The hon. Gentleman gave a brief and succinct outline of the stages through which we have come in dealing with complaints against the legal profession. The fact is that 10 years or so ago, a complaint against the legal profession was almost a waste of time&#151;the profession did not take complaints seriously, and often ignored them and brushed them under the carpet. The profession certainly did not respond sensitively to consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para29"><a name="08072258000356">Since then, we have come a long way. It has been an arduous process, and I put on record that I am grateful to the Law Society and to the Solicitors Regulation Authority. They have come to recognise that the type of behaviour that was prevalent in the past is no longer acceptable, and that the consumer must have confidence both in the behaviour of the solicitor initially and in the complaints system if a solicitor falls down during the process. In fact, the Legal Complaints Service handles a fairly large number of complaints. The most recent statistics show that it received 1,159 new complaints about poor service and closed, or dealt with, another 1,200 or so&#151;indeed, it dealt with them within three months of receiving the complaint. It has improved its services in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="80722h0009.htm_para30"><a name="08072258000357">The hon. Gentleman talked about the SRA, which is the regulatory arm of the Law Society. It is now split from the policy arm of the Law Society. It was appropriate that the Law Society was not seen to be acting as trade union and regulator, as it had been. That has made a big difference to the way that complaints are handled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para0"><a name="08072258000358">There is a code of conduct, which sets out the behaviour that solicitors should abide by and what is expected of them in their dealings with consumers. Rule 1 of the code states that solicitors must act in the best interests of the client. It might be of interest to the hon. Gentleman to know that under rule 2, there are provisions relating to client care and information about costs. Those rules are in place to ensure that the solicitor gives the client all necessary information so that they can make proper decisions about if and how the matter should proceed.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 July 2008">

<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>22 July 2008 : Column 227WH</b><br>
A consumer might decide because of the cost that it would not be appropriate to take the action further. The rules are approved by the Secretary of State and any changes receive a high level of scrutiny. The impact on the consumer is considered before the rules are approved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para1"><a name="08072258000359">The SRA is responsible for taking action against any solicitor who breaches the code of conduct. Once an allegation of misconduct has been investigated, the SRA has the power to take disciplinary action if it considers that a solicitor has been in breach. In the 12 months before April this year, the conduct investigation unit of the SRA concluded investigations into 4,875 cases. That is a staggering number of individuals who felt that they had not been best served by their solicitors. As the hon. Gentleman said, we see people in our surgeries who do not think that their solicitor has served them well. Sometimes that is because it is hard for people to accept that the answer to their question is no, but on other occasions it is because they have not been well served. Of the 4,875 cases, 141 were referred to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal and 63 orders were made to strike solicitors off the register, which is the ultimate sanction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para2"><a name="08072258000360">If consumers are unhappy about how a complaint has been dealt with by the LCS or the SRA, they can refer the matter to the legal services ombudsman. The hon. Gentleman will know that the ombudsman takes her job seriously and keeps a strict eye on the Law Society and the SRA. Her latest annual report displayed concern about poor decision making in individual cases, although she recognised that the time taken to deal with complaints was decreasing. I am pleased to see that improvement, but there are still problems. There are cases in which the conduct of solicitors has been called into question and it often appears to the consumer that no action has been taken. However, it must be remembered that the SRA investigation process can involve a great deal of work, so it may be some time before the complaint is resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para3"><a name="08072258000361">I will answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s two questions and then return briefly to the future system under the Legal Services Act 2007. He mentioned Citizens Advice and Which? and I put on the record my thanks to both organisations for working extraordinarily closely with us when we were drafting the 2007 Act. I took seriously their advice about ensuring that the consumer was at the heart of the new system. As a result, the Act will allow the consumer to feel that their voice will be heard loud and clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para4"><a name="08072258000362">The hon. Gentleman asked about a particular bankruptcy case. I shall obey your strictures, Mr. Bayley, and not  <br>

refer to that case. I will take on board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question and speak to the Law Society about whether there is a more appropriate way for solicitors to deal with their clients. However, solicitors, like all businesses, must be able to receive their fees when appropriate. I will ask the Law Society to consider whether there are other ways to deal with that issue. In a bankruptcy court it would be for the court, rather than the solicitors, to decide whether the bankruptcy should go ahead. The court should take all issues into account, including whether the consumer felt that they had received the service they expected. Under the 2007 Act, a new office for legal complaints will be established, which will have a lay chair and a lay majority to ensure that the consumer&#146;s voice is heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para5"><a name="08072258000363">The hon. Gentleman asked whether the SRA, its chief executive or the ombudsman have immunity. They do not enjoy any statutory legal immunity. They enjoy protection from civil liability and criminal prosecution to the extent that is determined by the usual principles of law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para6"><a name="08072258000364">It is important that the public know that they can trust solicitors, barristers and others in the legal profession, and they must know where to go if things go wrong. There have been justified criticisms of the current complaints system. One need only look at the matter of miners&#146; compensation to see some of the issues that have arisen. I hope that the framework we have put in place in the 2007 Act and the work that the SRA is doing on listening to consumers to inform its policies will provide the public with the high level of service that they deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para7"><a name="08072258000365">The hon. Gentleman asked whether issues raised by the SRA could be published. I will ask the body whether it has considered publicising any of the issues that have arisen in the course of dealing with the complaints of individuals, because it will be for the SRA to take that decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para8"><a name="08072258000366">I appreciate the opportunity to highlight the changes that we are making through the 2007 Act. I will take on board the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman and ask the Law Society and, if necessary, the SRA to look at them and come back to me. I will advise him as soon as possible of any other changes that may be made to put consumers at the heart of the legal system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para9"><a name="08072258000369">This is the second debate that I have held on the subject, the first being in 2004. I spoke then of the virtues of allotments and lamented the decline in their number. Although allotments can be owned privately by individuals or charities, or let by companies such as Railtrack or Network Rail, most are owned and let by local authorities. The vast majority of allotments fall into that category, so for the most part I shall dwell on the legislation and administration that governs that sort of allotment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para10"><a name="08072258000370">In the brief time available, I want to take stock of developments since the 2004 debate and note the unfortunate lack of progress since then. In my opinion, the benefits that allotments bring to individuals and communities cannot be overstated. I have spoken to many allotment holders in Wirral, and they all point to the physical benefits, and, interestingly, the mental benefits, of working on an allotment. Growing one&#146;s own vegetables and fruit is relatively cheap, and it is a distinct advantage for those who are feeling the pinch of economic pressures. It is also good for those who want to contribute to biodiversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para12"><a name="08072258000376">Allotments are a good place to source organic products. They are minus the food miles and the carbon footprint, and they have recently become more fashionable and vital. They are set to become ever more popular, and more of an imperative among a broader ranger of people in light of rising food prices. Many plot holders have told me that increasingly diverse groups now use or hope to use allotments. It is not simply a hobby for retired men, as the stereotype used to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para15"><a name="08072258000379">Gardening in one&#146;s own space brings feelings of satisfaction and tranquillity, with the opportunity to chat to fellow plot holders. Indeed, the more indirect advantages of working on an allotment have been exploited by some local mental health charities. They run various allotment schemes, including one run by the Restore charity in Oxford. I am told that it cultivates an allotment site of two acres outside the city centre in Cowley, where people grow fruit, vegetables, flowers and willow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para16"><a name="08072258000380">Children who have the opportunity to work on an allotment gain a wealth of outdoor experience and knowledge about growing fresh produce, and about nutrition. Their work on allotments contributes to solving the problems of childhood obesity. One might presume that such children are more incentivised to eat their greens if they grow the greens themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para17"><a name="08072258000381">There is much evidence to suggest that allotments are rising in popularity. More than 30 books on allotments have been published since 2001, and waiting lists for allotments grow ever longer. According to statistics provided by the National Society for Allotment and Leisure Gardeners, 51 of Bolton&#146;s 61 allotment sites have reached full capacity, and all the others are close to full. If that information is indicative of what is happening in other areas of the country, it suggests that allotments are hugely popular, and in demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000382">In Wirral, it is thought that about 400 people are on waiting lists. I repeat that in the west of Wirral there are no allotments. In Blyth Valley, there are approximately 900 plots, but in 2007 there were 850 people on the waiting list. In Yorkshire, six towns have a combined waiting list of more than 3,500 people. In many areas, including York&#151;although you might know better, Mr. Bayley&#151;Medway, Peterborough, Solihull and Worcester, to name but a few, waiting lists have increased considerably over the past few years. In some places, people have been waiting for more than seven years.</p>

That would increase the number of allotment spaces, not reduce them. It seems that the number is reducing at a time when demand is rising fast.</p>

There is great demand, and I am delighted that my hon. Friend is making such a powerful case. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in response, because if the Government were to be slightly more generous in their grant-related expenditure or their standard assessments, local authorities could be much more positive.

significant regular increase in what I regard as the pitiful amount of funding that the councils give for the purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para27"><a name="08072258000397">I suspect that the situation is the same elsewhere. I asked for more plots, but we have ever-longer waiting lists. Any increase in plots has not been synchronised with demand. Four years after my original debate, I find myself asking for the same provision, which is not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para28"><a name="08072258000398">Let me give another example from my constituency, which I imagine applies equally to my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford), to illustrate what allotment holders and societies are up against. The council has published an allotment strategy, complete with plans to prevent vandalism and provide toilet facilities where possible, but there is little evidence that it is being implemented, or that it will be. The council&#146;s view is that it cannot allocate resources until it knows the full picture, but that will happen only when the necessary research is conducted, and nothing much is happening in the interim. My constituents tell me that the council is not fulfilling its responsibilities to market and provide allotment usage in any form, and that there is little knowledge about allotment provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para29"><a name="08072258000399">It has been suggested that the council&#146;s long-term strategy is to encourage self-management of sites, including funding, through allotment societies, which should apply to the lottery and other sources. Only allotment sites that have formed societies can avail themselves of grant funding, and a committee has to be formed and a bank account opened before funds can be applied for and released. At least 16 sites in Wirral have not formed allotment societies. It seems to me that the council, like others, is trying to shift the burden of responsibility to the allotment societies, by giving them the burdens of management and funding. Frankly, allotments seem to be near the bottom of the council&#146;s list of priorities. In essence, the process of amelioration, if it happens at all, is slow, and slower than it should be. I believe that my area is not an exception, but a reflection of what is happening in the rest of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80722h0010.htm_para30"><a name="08072258000400">What are the causes of this disappointing lack of progress? Principally, there is a lack of reliable national data on unmet demand for allotments. If we do not have a clear picture of national demand, how can we take appropriate action? The last review of the issue was carried out by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2004-05, but the returns have not yet been analysed, so we are none the wiser. The most reliable statistics we have are from the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee report of 1998. The data show that in 1943 there were 1.4 million allotments and only 300,000 in 1996. Worryingly, we have no evidence to suggest that numbers of allotments have not plummeted further. There is certainly no evidence from my own constituency or from research that I have conducted that there has been a widespread, consistent attempt by local authorities to provide new allotments to keep up with demand.</p>

been launched, which will in time give us the information for which we have waited so long. I welcome that, but it will not help to bring back the allotments that have already been lost. Indeed, some would argue it is too little, too late&#151;I argue that it is too token.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="80722h0011.htm_para1"><a name="08072258000402">The other major cause of a distinct lack of adequate allotment provision is the legislation. The Smallholdings and Allotments Act 1908 contains a mandatory obligation on the municipal authority to provide and let allotments, but the obligation is not bound by any period of time, thus in effect absolving the authority from the responsibility to look for suitable land. No realistic sanctions can be brought against a recalcitrant authority, apart from an action before the county court on the basis that it is in breach of its statutory duty. Generally, would-be allotment holders are unable to go to such expense or take such risks simply to prove a point. Where local authorities seem to be matching demand, the standard 300 sq yd plot is being subdivided. As such, the figures are somewhat misleading, but the plots are less useful for growing food, as that requires more space.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="80722h0011.htm_para2"><a name="08072258000403">There are many competing factors where local authority land is concerned, not least potentially lucrative buildings, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North referred. Councils, including Wirral, find it difficult to provide money for allotments, but they do not necessarily find it difficult to find money for other things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="80722h0011.htm_para3"><a name="08072258000404">The problem can and should be remedied. Current legislation could be changed to put time limits on a municipal authority in which they must provide and let allotments. There should be sanctions to deter non-achievement of such objectives. The word &#147;sufficient&#148;, which is always used in regard to the requirement on local authorities to provide allotments, is wet and open to whatever interpretation a council may choose. Generally speaking, &#147;sufficient&#148;, to the layman, means, simply, &#147;insufficient&#148;.</p>

That is good news, but there is no point looking into allotment potential if there is little scope for using such potential. Other issues, such as the upkeep and promotion of allotments, need to be addressed. Local authorities are used to being set targets in other areas, and I see no reason why targets for allotment provision and facilities cannot be introduced. As it is, local authorities, rather than Government, respond to local demand for allotments, and they should be encouraged to develop their own allotments strategy. To make that manifest, enough provision must be made in budgets. That can only be achieved with effective and rigorous backing and monitoring from Government.</p>

allotments make many positive contributions to people&#146;s lives and communities. There is enormous scope for joined-up government, incorporating objectives from different Departments, from health to biodiversity and education, and social interaction and cohesion within communities. That the Government have up until this point failed to capitalise on what allotments have to offer shows a failure of drive and imagination. The launch of one database here and a stand-alone publication there is not enough. We must do better. Allotment provision provides a big bang for a relatively modest buck.

 That is a very important point.

As far as I am aware, none of them currently does that. That means that people living in inner-London boroughs who could benefit from allotments often find them almost impossible to get.</p>

Written representations on the need for allotments can be made to a local authority by any six resident registered electors or persons liable to pay council tax, and under section 23(2) of the 1908 Act, the local authority must take those representations into account.

PPG17 advises local authorities to make provision for all types of public open space and states that they are expected to undertake robust assessments of local needs and audits of existing open space, and to establish standards for new provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="80722h0011.htm_para11"><a name="08072258000419">Using that information, local authorities should plan to meet the future needs of their population, such as those linked to new housing developments, and can include provision standards in their development plan.

That important work will be undertaken by a green space organisation once a grant has been awarded, and it will involve supporting a dialogue between the Local Government Association and key allotment organisations to decide how best to support local authorities and link up with wider agendas such as health and education. It is important that we put a rocket up local authorities to ensure that that takes place and that the concerns that have been clearly articulated today are addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="80722h0011.htm_para15"><a name="08072258000425">However, our legislation is strong and provides for the protection of allotments, which is a unique protection. Section 8 of the Allotments Act 1925, reinforced by planning guidance, states that allotments cannot be treated as previously developed land. That might seem a technical matter, but in practice it makes it very difficult for them to be disposed of or built on. A council can dispose of an allotment only in exceptional circumstances and if it can fully justify to the Secretary of State that there is a need for a change of use, against extremely robust criteria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="80722h0011.htm_para16"><a name="08072258000426">In 2002, we sought to strengthen the existing protections. In 1998, a Select Committee inquiry on allotments concluded that the criteria for assessing allotment disposals were too weak. As a consequence, we strengthened the criteria for the disposal of statutory allotments. As I said, they were reinforced by PPG17. The purpose of that was to ensure that the community&#146;s need for the allotments in question would be taken into account and that they were considered surplus to need. My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South mentioned the difference between the number of allotments in 1943 and now, but that change has meant that the loss of allotments has decelerated. That is welcome, but of course we need to turn the curve and ensure that more allotments are provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="80722h0011.htm_para17"><a name="08072258000427">The key is to ensure that allotments are there for those who want them and that they are properly protected and managed. Responsibility for that lies with local authorities, but central Government remain incredibly  <br>

interested. We have taken a number of actions in the past 12 months to reinforce our commitment to allotments. For example, we published in June 2007 revised guidance for plot holders, &#147;Allotments: a plotholder&#146;s guide,&#148; to ensure that they know their rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="80722h0011.htm_para18"><a name="08072258000428">In the past year we have also worked closely with the LGA to produce a second edition of &#147;Growing in the community&#148;, which was launched in March 2008. That updated guide reflects the significant developments in the allotment movement since 2001 and contains some excellent examples of current good practice, showing innovative use of allotments that has benefited all sections of the community and highlighting their importance in promoting health, community engagement and community cohesion. It also includes a section on allotment provision, an up-to-date policy framework, a guide to legislation and examples of good practice affecting allotments. The LGA has sent a free copy to each local authority, and we hope that it will help local authorities to make full use of the legislative programme and the protection afforded to allotments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="80722h0011.htm_para19"><a name="08072258000429">We are working closely with organisations with an interest in allotments to consider a point that my hon. Friend  <br>

mentioned: how to engage more effectively with local authorities to ensure that they are clear about their responsibilities under legislation and planning guidance. We will offer clarification through the revised good practice guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="80722h0011.htm_para20"><a name="08072258000430">Allotments are an incredibly important matter, and one in which I am passionately interested. I am quite keen to get an allotment myself, because I am interested in the health benefits&#151;they are sadly needed, as hon. Members will see&#151;and in people growing their own produce. That is important, and I would like to encourage it as much as possible. Members have expressed the view that allotments provide great positive benefits for the community in healthy living, active ageing, community cohesion, combating climate change and protecting and enhancing community empowerment. That should be recognised in local authorities&#146; development plans and enforced as much as possible.</p>
