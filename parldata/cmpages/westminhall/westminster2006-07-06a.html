John Whittingdale (Maldon and East Chelmsford) (Con):</b> I
welcome the opportunity that this debate provides to consider both the
Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport report into analogue
switch-off and the wider subject of analogue switch-off, which has not
received as much attention in the House as it merits.</p><p><a name="06070682000007">Analogue switch-off is a huge
undertaking. It will affect almost every household in the land, and for
that reason the Committee, which I chair, chose to examine it as our
first subject of investigation at the beginning of this Parliament.
During the course of our inquiry we received 54 submissions and took
evidence from 41 witnesses. The Committee visited Berlin, which is the
one place on the globe that has so far switched off its analogue
transmission, to see what lessons we could learn from the experience
there. I also visited Sandy Heath, which is one of the large
transmitters operated by Arqiva, to see at first hand what switch-off
entails.</p><p><a name="06070682000008">Switching off
analogue transmission is a vast task&#151;particularly in this
country, where television viewers are more dependent on analogue than
in many others, where there is wider penetration of cable and
satellite. It will require hugely complicated organisation. The
Secretary of State has compared the task of switch-off to
decimalisation, and one witness to our inquiry, David Elstein, said
that switch-off had</p><a name="06070682000234"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;more
potential for chaos and consumer revolt than any other civilian project
in our history, including North Sea gas conversion and
decimalisation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070682000009"><b><a name="06070682000248">Mr.
Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b> I ask the hon.
Gentleman to cast his mind back to North sea gas conversion, although
he is probably not old enough for that, whereas I am. The model then
was that everybody&#146;s appliances were changed by a system that
did not require them to do anything expect admit the authorised people
at the right time. The whole task was carried out for them in a way
that is not going to happen this time.</p><p><a name="06070682000010"><b><a name="06070682000249">Mr.
Whittingdale:</b> There are parallels, but they can be taken
only so far. It would not be practical to expect the Government to send
out a converter to every household, because the cost of doing so would
be astronomical&#151;it will be quite considerable as it is. That
gives an indication of the scale of the undertaking on which the
Government have embarked, and the first question that my Committee
addressed was therefore why we are doing it.</p><p><a name="06070682000011">Much of the justification given
for switch-off is based on the benefits of digital television. I need
no 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 324WH</b><br>persuasion. My life was transformed when I installed my Sky box and had
access to multi-channel television. It was transformed again when Sky
plus came along and offered personal video recorder capability, and I
look forward to a third transformation, when high-definition boxes
eventually reach the shelves. Digital television offers huge
advantages, particularly for watching 24-hour news
channels&#151;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Perhaps not the
movie channels, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley
(Mr. Evans) is
devoted.</p><p><a name="06070682000012">Digital
television has been available to everyone who has wanted it for a
considerable time. Anyone who wishes to have access to digital TV can
install a Sky dish. In large parts of the country, they can obtain it
through cable and in about 70 per cent. of the country through
freeview. The question is why we are compelling people to switch to
digital, particularly as other means of distribution are coming on
stream. There is already freesat from Sky, the possibility of freesat
offerings from the BBC and ITV in due course, and IPTV&#151;internet
protocol television&#151;through broadband connections, which is a
real possibility in the near future, with BT Vision intending to launch
in October. So why are we forcing the pace and removing choice from
people who say that they are content with their existing analogue
service and do not see why they should have any more
services?</p><p><a name="06070682000013"><b><a name="06070682000250">Mr.
David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Does the hon. Gentleman
agree that one problem is that it is uncertain whether the technology
will reach all people after switchover? The complaints that I have
heard are twofold. First, people object, as he rightly pointed out, to
being railroaded into making a decision prior to switchover. Secondly,
constituents are concerned that they might still be ineligible for
those services in the new wave of television that the hon. Gentleman
described. Does he agree that that is a concern, particularly for older
people?</p><p><a name="06070682000014"><b><a name="06070682000251">Mr.
Whittingdale:</b> I agree in part and shall come to extending
freeview to universal coverage, which is one of the potential
advantages of switchover. The chances are that his constituents will
benefit and will have access to freeview once switchover takes place.
However, a small number of people might still be unable to receive
freeview. I shall come back to that group, because it is deserving of
help.</p><p><a name="06070682000015">To return to the
case that has been made, the Government first advanced an economic
cost-benefit analysis. The cost of switchover is relatively easy to
quantify, although the figures range considerably, depending mainly on
what is thrown into the pot as part of the cost. The Government have
said that the cost will be of the order of &#163;5 billion,
whereas Mr. Elstein told us that it would be about &#163;13
billion, although he included the public service publisher idea of
Ofcom and the power costs of the additional boxes. <i>The Sunday Times
</i>told us that the switchover would cost &#163;23 billion but, on
examination, that included providing every household with a plasma
screen, which might have pushed up the cost a little.</p><p><a name="06070682000016">The one thing that everyone
would accept, however, is that we are talking about a considerable sum
of money. The cost is likely to be borne by almost every 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 325WH</b><br>household, because the consequence of switchover is that every
television receiver will have to be digitally enabled. That will
probably require at least one set-top box, and perhaps another for
analogue recorders, such as video cassette recorders. Switchover will
also require new wiring and perhaps new aerials to be fitted in a
number of households, so for each household quite a considerable cost
is attached.</p><p><a name="06070682000017"><b><a name="06070682000252">Mr.
Nigel Evans (Ribble Valley) (Con):</b> Although there will be
some help for the very needy, it will be provided through a funding
arrangement, via the BBC TV licence. While my hon. Friend is discussing
costs, does he not agree that there must be a better way of funding
that help? Because the TV licence is set at a flat rate and regressive,
the nearly poor will be paying for the very
poor.</p><p><a name="06070682000018"><b><a name="06070682000253">Mr.
Whittingdale:</b> I agree and shall come to that argument, but
I welcome the fact that the Government have recognised that they have a
responsibility to help those who are most vulnerable and likely to find
the process most difficult by providing an assistance package. However,
it was the Committee&#146;s view&#151;not only the
Committee&#146;s, but almost every outside
commentator&#146;s&#151;that that is a welfare action and should
therefore be funded by the exchequer, not the
BBC.</p><p><a name="06070682000019"><b><a name="06070682000254">Janet
Anderson (Rossendale and Darwen) (Lab):</b> Is the hon.
Gentleman aware that the BBC is perfectly happy with the suggestion
that that help should be funded out of the licence
fee?</p><p><a name="06070682000020"><b><a name="06070682000255">Mr.
Whittingdale:</b> At this moment, when it is looking to the
Government for assistance in the licence fee settlement, the BBC
probably regards it as highly unwise to express anything other than
enthusiasm, although I am not sure that it would necessarily say the
same thing in private. In a sense, it is immaterial whether the BBC is
happy with the arrangement. My view and that of many others is that the
cost should have been picked up by the Exchequer. I was just completing
the list of costs attached to the process. The other two considerable
costs will be the conversion of transmitters and the necessary
marketing exercise to inform everybody that that is taking place. If
all the costs are added up, the &#163;5 billion estimate may be about
right.</p><p><a name="06070682000021">Some of the
benefits that will flow from switchover are more theoretical. The
Government have argued that a monetary value can be attached to the
benefit of the new services that will become available to people
receiving digital terrestrial television. My argument is in part that
if people attached a considerable value to those services, they would
have obtained them already and would not be waiting to be compelled to
get them.</p><p><a name="06070682000022">The
Government have come up with a curious concept that they call the
imputed consumer benefit of compulsory migration, which the Committee
regarded with a degree of scepticism. Nevertheless, there are concrete
and quantifiable benefits. There will obviously be a saving to the
broadcasters, because they will no 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 326WH</b><br>longer have to transmit programmes both in analogue and digital. In
addition, the spectrum released as a result of the analogue signal
switch-off will have a value. When that was first discussed, people got
a little bit carried away with memories of the amount of money raised
by the 3G auction, but I do not think that we will see such sums again.
The return on the spectrum that is released will depend on the use to
which it is
put.</p><p><a name="06070682000023">The
Government concluded that there was a net present value benefit to the
process of between &#163;1 billion and &#163;2 billion,
about which we were not wholly persuaded. We are talking not about a
cost-benefit analysis but a decision taken on stronger grounds. There
are two main reasons for the analogue switch-off, including to extend
the coverage of freeview. However, I have received complaints from some
of my constituents who cannot get freeview. I was amused by
what I imagine was the look of horror that passed across the face of
the chief executive of Digital UK, when he checked the current freeview
coverage for each Committee member&#146;s constituency and found that
mine is one of the worst in
Britain.</p><p><a name="06070682000024">Another
benefit of switchover is that it should allow the power of the digital
terrestrial signal to be boosted to enable almost universal coverage of
DTT. That will extend choice to almost every household, which is a
benefit that will restore an element of
fairness.</p><p><a name="06070682000025"><b><a name="06070682000256">Mr.
Roger Williams (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD):</b> The hon.
Gentleman mentioned the number of constituencies in which there is
difficulty receiving freeview that might be enhanced by the digital
changeover. I understand that 1.5 per cent. of households do not
currently get analogue reception and after the change 1.5 per cent.
will still not get it&#151;but it may not be the same 1.5 per cent.
That will cause a certain amount of aggravation and even chaos for the
people
involved.</p><p><a name="06070682000026"><b><a name="06070682000257">Mr.
Whittingdale:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. We were
particularly concerned about that 1.5 per cent. That may sound like a
small proportion, but it represents a large number of households. Part
of the problem is that we do not entirely know who they are, so
identifying them should be a
priority.</p><p><a name="06070682000027">The
Committee was also concerned in that although we recognise that it is
beneficial to make the DTT signal available throughout the country, DTT
technology already looks primitive when compared with some of the
alternatives becoming available. Freeview boxes, for instance, are
mainly based on MPEG-2 technology, which limits the number of channels
that can be transmitted and makes it impossible, for example, to
receive HDTV. In time, we may migrate to MPEG-4, but that will require
a new generation of boxes to be fitted. DTT will always be subject to
some capacity constraints, particularly when compared with the
alternatives of satellite reception or internet-provided television.
Therefore, we wondered whether it was sensible to promote a technology
that might become obsolete. The lifespan of DTT may be no more than 10
years, by which time most people will be more demanding and will want
better quality, more choice and interactivity, and something like BT
Vision, or its equivalents in IPTV services, will be taking hold. 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 327WH</b><br>At that point, we may have to consider &#147;Switch-off 2&#148; to
shut off the DTT signal and release that spectrum for more valuable
uses.</p><p><a name="06070682000028">Switching off
the analogue signal will release a chunk of spectrum. One of the big
questions facing the Government is what they will do with it. The
Committee heard about a number of different applications, including
wireless broadband and mobile television. The broadcasters are keen to
reoccupy the spectrum for HDTV, having only just given up analogue
transmission.</p><p><a name="06070682000029"><b><a name="06070682000258">Mr.
Evans:</b> Just before my hon. Friend leaves the subject of
freeview, does he agree that some people, who are as yet undecided, may
need repairs done or a brand new aerial installed? The Committee is
still concerned that there may not be sufficient aerial contractors
available, and with so many installations or repairs being necessary,
this may be the beginning of a cowboy&#146;s charter for a small
group of people, who may rip off unsuspecting individuals with
exorbitant
charges.</p><p><a name="06070682000030"><b><a name="06070682000259">Mr.
Whittingdale:</b> My hon. Friend is right; that was a
considerable concern for the Committee, and the Government are
moving to address it. I agree that there is a risk that the most
vulnerable people may be exploited by the
unscrupulous.</p><p><a name="06070682000031">I return
to the allocation of the released spectrum and Ofcom&#146;s task as
part of the digital dividend review. Traditionally, the Government have
decided the general use of a band of spectrum. For instance, it was
decided that a particular part of the spectrum should be used for
mobile applications in respect of the 3G auction, and a market
mechanism&#151;an auction&#151;determined which operators were able
to take advantage of it. There has been a suggestion that the entire
thing should be done this time through the market and a bidding
process, but I am not sure whether that is sensible. Different
arguments are already being advanced. Understandably, the broadcasters
said, &#147;Look, if we are to continue to offer a choice to viewers,
it is important that HDTV be available on freeview as well as
satellite.&#148;</p><p><a name="06070682000032">I
declare to the Committee that last week I received through the post,
slightly to my surprise, a set-top box to allow me to have access to
the BBC&#146;s current HDTV trial, run from Crystal Palace. I was
told that I was one of 450 viewers who have been selected to
participate. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Bath
(Mr. Foster) indicates that he too was fortunate enough to be selected
as one of those 450 viewers. We are clearly both very
lucky.</p><p><a name="06070682000033"><b><a name="06070682000260">Mr.
Don Foster (Bath) (LD):</b> I did not request the box; it came
without any explanation. I have discovered that I can use it neither in
my flat in London nor my home in Bath, because of the configuration
that I
have.</p><p><a name="06070682000034"><b><a name="06070682000261">Mr.
Whittingdale:</b> I have not yet discovered whether it will
operate in my home, but I will report back to the
Committee.</p><p><a name="06070682000035">More
seriously, the decision about what use the released spectrum should be
put to carries some urgency. Arqiva made the point to the Committee
that 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 328WH</b><br>it is having to order the equipment to fit on transmitters now and that
there is a three-year lead time in terms of antennae and equipment to
be fitted on transmitter masts. Therefore, unless decisions are taken
very soon, there is a danger that its people will have to go up the
masts twice: first, to fit the equipment for the digital terrestrial
signal, to boost coverage, and then a second time to deal with
potential use of the released spectrum. That obviously has considerable
cost implications, which may affect the economics, so I hope
that the Minister can confirm that now that the radio regional
conference has determined the frequency allocations, we will move
swiftly to a decision on what the released spectrum should be used
for.</p><p><a name="06070682000036">I think that the
main concern of the Committee, having accepted that the decision on
digital switchover has been taken and that it will go ahead, is that we
address the difficulties that it poses&#151;the practical problems
that must be overcome if the task is to be completed successfully.
Digital UK has been given the task of leading the process, and the
Committee has been impressed by the work that it has done so far, but
there was some concern about resourcing and the authority that Digital
UK would have in the event of disputes, particularly between
broadcasters and others. Considering that Digital UK is owned by the
broadcasters, we had some concern about whether it would be able to
bang heads together, if that became necessary, when its board members
were the people whose heads needed banging. We were also worried that
there was some confusion about where responsibility lay in Government
and that not necessarily enough attention was being paid to the issue
in the higher levels of
Government.</p><p><a name="06070682000037">At our
final evidence session, we had before us the then Minister for Industry
and the Regions, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth
(Alun Michael), and the then Under-Secretary of State for Culture,
Media and Sport who is now the Minister for Pensions Reform, neither of
whom was willing to say that he was ultimately responsible for the
process. They suggested that it was somehow shared between them, which
I think the Committee regarded as unsatisfactory, in that essentially
it meant that responsibility did not lie with either of
them.</p><p><a name="06070682000038">I have been
encouraged by the fact that when the hon. Member for St. Helens, South
(Mr. Woodward) took up the post of Under-Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport, he was described as Minister for switchover,
and although the Government have not formally accepted our
recommendation in their response, he does seem to have been given the
task of taking a grip of the whole process. We would very much welcome
that. I hope that he will pay close attention to the process to ensure
that it proceeds
smoothly.</p><p><a name="06070682000039">On awareness
of digital switchover, which is the first requirement, there appears to
be encouraging progress. The latest tracker survey, which I was shown
by Digital UK, shows that awareness is up to 71 per cent. and
understanding of the process at 66 per cent. There were one or two
interesting figures in the survey. Slightly surprisingly, it showed
that the least aware group was the youngest age group rather than the
oldest, which we would not necessarily have anticipated. The survey 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 329WH</b><br>also showed that ethnic minorities were more unaware of the process than
other groups. With regard to support for the process, it showed that
roughly one quarter of those questioned were fairly enthusiastic about
switchover; one quarter were not enthusiastic and indeed were negative
about it; and half were fairly resigned to the process. Clearly, a
considerable task remains to explain to people what will happen and to
persuade them that it is a good thing that it is
happening.</p><p><a name="06070682000040">The
Government have frequently cited the figure for digital
penetration&#151;the number of households that have converted to
digital&#151;which has reached almost 75 per cent., but it
would be a great mistake to think that we need not worry about those
households, because every single household that has a digital set in
the main room almost certainly has analogue sets in the kitchen, in the
bedroom and in the children&#146;s rooms. Therefore, the process will
affect them as much as anyone else. Although 75 per cent. of households
have gone digital, 60 per cent. of televisions are still analogue.
There are 37 million televisions out there that will have to be
converted. It is also estimated that 25 million aerials will need to be
replaced. That poses very serious problems in terms of the supply
chain.</p><p><a name="06070682000041">We were
concerned when we took evidence from, for instance, DSG International
plc, which now owns Dixons, that unless there was a steady migration,
there was a danger that there could be a last-minute rush to convert,
in the last few weeks before switchover. We were concerned that people
would go into the shops on their local high street only to discover
that the shelves were empty and that the supply chain simply could not
cope with a huge last-minute surge in demand from people wanting to
convert in time for switchover day. It is therefore extremely important
that we persuade people that they need to act early. That will be
harder when we are expecting people in the areas that cannot get
freeview at the moment to fit equipment that will not work until
switchover takes place. We will be expecting them to make the leap of
faith that it will work when switchover does take place. There are real
concerns about the supply
chain.</p><p><a name="06070682000042">Another issue,
which my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley mentioned, is the
replacement of aerials. Some 25 million may need to be replaced. The
Confederation of Aerial Industries told us that it thought that
replacement would happen in any case because every time there is a bad
winter, aerials are blown off roofs and people replace them. That
ongoing process of replacement should mean that there will be far more
aerials that are compatible and ready for digital reception than there
are now, as a result of the natural course of
events.</p><p><a name="06070682000043">However,
having heard from the CAI that it was relying on bad weather to blow
down aerials for them to be replaced, we were slightly alarmed then to
hear from the transmission companies that they were under a very tight
timetable to convert the transmission towers but were reasonably
confident that that could be achieved as long as there was not bad
weather. We eventually discovered that what was needed was bad winters
to blow down aerials, requiring them to be replaced, and fine summers,
because that is when the 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 330WH</b><br>transmission companies intend to convert their transmitters. With any
luck and God&#146;s help, the process should be achieved, but the
situation that I have described gives an idea of the potential
problems.</p><p><a name="06070682000044">My hon.
Friend and others on the Committee, particularly the hon. Member for
Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly), were concerned about cowboys. The
hon. Gentleman, who unfortunately cannot join us this afternoon, laid
great stress on the danger of cowboys exploiting the process. There
will be huge ignorance about what is required, and there is a danger
that people will call on old ladies, saying, &#147;Have you heard
about the switchover? Don&#146;t worry. I&#146;ll sort you out.
It&#146;ll only cost you
&#163;500.&#148;</p><p><a name="06070682000045">I
very much welcome the launch of a registered digital installer scheme.
I recently attended the conference of the Confederation of Aerial
Industries to discuss what it was doing to encourage people to look for
the accreditation mark to ensure that an installer is reputable.
However, the Government may need to do more not only in encouraging
people to look for accreditation and use reputable installers, but to
alert the trading standards authorities and enforcement officials to
look out for cowboys. I am told that there have already been one or two
examples of cowboys seeking to use digital switchover as an opportunity
to exploit
people.</p><p><a name="06070682000046">There are one
or two other problems. There are 1,154 transmitter towers, and the
Government intend to convert every one, but I am told that, in addition
to those, relay transmitters have been installed in some areas of the
country, sometimes even by parish councils, to ensure that particularly
remote communities can receive a television signal. Those relay
stations, which may be small and locally financed, will have to be
converted, too, but as far as I am aware we are not sure how many there
are, let alone where they are, and who will be responsible for
converting them. I hope that the Minister will consider
that.</p><p><a name="06070682000047">I raised with
the Minister on Monday at Culture, Media and Sport questions the
problem relating to multiple dwelling units. Some 20 per cent. of the
population live in MDUs&#151;some 4.5 million households. The
question arises of who will be responsible for converting MDUs. It may
require a considerable cost to convert aerials and all the connection
network for each household within an MDU. Will landlords be
responsible? What about MDUs owned by councils or housing associations?
Who will pick up the cost? Will the Government make money available to
councils through the revenue support grant to meet the cost of
converting MDUs? All those questions have not yet been properly
considered.</p><p><a name="06070682000048">The area
that has caused most anxiety is the assistance package that will be
made available. The hon. Member for Brecon and
Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) mentioned the 1.5 per cent. of
people who will not be able to get digital terrestrial television even
after switchover, and rightly said that that 1.5 per cent. might not be
the same 1.5 per cent. who currently cannot get analogue. The Committee
felt that if households currently able to receive analogue television
are unable to get either analogue or digital terrestrial after
switchover and can therefore probably continue to receive television
only if they install a satellite receiver 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 331WH</b><br>at considerable cost, they would deserve extra help in recognition of
that additional cost. In their response, the Government indicated that
they had at least some sympathy for that view. I hope that the Minister
will expand on
that.</p><p><a name="06070682000049">The Government
propose to give assistance to the over-75s and the disabled. For those
on benefits, help will be free. However, we are concerned that the
group who will need assistance will go considerably beyond that part of
the population whom the Government have identified. The Americans have
just announced plans to switch off their analogue signal, and the
American Government are to set up a fund of $1.5 billion to
make available to each of the 21 million households affected two
coupons, worth $40 each, to be spent on television set-top boxes. I do
not suggest that the Government should finance every household in the
country, but it is interesting that the Americans have decided that
they need to provide financial help to every affected household to
achieve their aims. I hope that the British Government might at least
consider providing help a little beyond the narrow group that they have
identified.</p><p><a name="06070682000050">The
Committee shares the view of the Ofcom consumer panel regarding people
who are not necessarily over 75 or impoverished, but who are socially
isolated. I am talking about people who live in geographically remote
areas or who live in urban areas but do not have many friends or family
living nearby; people who do not have much contact with the outside
world. They will find this whole process very frightening, and they
will need help.</p><p><a name="06070682000051">In
the past, such people might have been able to rely on the nice,
friendly local or electrical retailer in the high street, but sadly
they are all disappearing. It was put to us that only the voluntary
sector could undertake that task and that it is essential that the
Government should work with the voluntary sector and provide it with
training, so that it can help such people. Often, they are the only
ones who know where such people are. It was suggested that the Minister
needs to recruit an army of volunteers to assist if we are to ensure
that such people will receive the help that they will undoubtedly
need.</p><p><a name="06070682000052">My hon. Friend
the Member for Ribble Valley made the point&#151;I shall not dwell on
this at length&#151;that this matter is the Government&#146;s
responsibility and should therefore be paid for by them. They have made
it plain that they do not intend to do that and that they think that
the BBC should pick up the cost through the licence fee. We do not
agree, but the Government will have to justify that decision when the
licence fee bills arrive through people&#146;s
letterboxes.</p><p><a name="06070682000053">The
Committee concluded that switchover is a hugely complicated task, which
poses enormous challenges. Whether or not one thinks that the decision
is right, it has been taken. On balance, I now accept that it is the
right thing to do, and I commend the Government for doing it, because
they did not have to. They could have sat back and allowed people to
continue to migrate across naturally, leaving a future Government to
decide that the time had come, but they have decided that this country
should take the lead and be one of the first in the world to switch off
the analogue system, even though it probably affects a bigger
proportion of our population than it will in 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 332WH</b><br>most other countries. That is certainly a brave decision; Sir Humphrey
would call it &#147;courageous&#148;. I hope that it works. It is
in none of our interests that it should go wrong, and I hope that some
of the problems are flagged up in the Committee&#146;s report, so
that we can address them and there is a better chance of switchover
being achieved
smoothly.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070682000242">3.5

Michael Moore (Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk) (LD):</b>
Thank you, Sir John. Let me be the first to pay tribute to the hon.
Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) and the work
of his Committee. In its comprehensive report and the evidence that it
gathered for the inquiry, it has done not only the House but the
country more broadly a great service. The report addresses many
important issues that I shall now touch
on.</p><p><a name="06070682000055">Like the hon.
Gentleman, I have thought long and hard about this matter and the
nature of digital switchover, and I think that it is a good thing on
balance. It is a major step forward technologically, which offers great
prospects and opportunities in terms of the range of services that will
be available to our constituents. In that respect, we should welcome
it, but as the hon. Gentleman and his Committee have highlighted, a
huge range of issues need to be sorted out before we can be confident
that we can do it successfully.</p><p><a name="06070682000056">I have a special interest in
this issue because I represent a large chunk of the land mass within
the Border Television region, which will be the first area of the
country to transfer exclusively to digital in 2008, if the current
timetable is adhered to. The Selkirk transmitter, in my constituency,
is expected to be the first to pass to digital. I visited it a few
months ago and was given an explanation of all the technical issues
affecting the site. I confess that I did not necessarily understand
many of them, but I was at least impressed by the fact that they are
many and complex. I am also pleased that some of the finest engineering
brains in the country are tackling those
issues.</p>

<p><a name="06070682000057">In recognition
of the range of issues that will affect my constituents before most
people, I, along with Digital UK and other local community groups,
established a borders digital forum in my constituency last December.
In Melrose, in a week&#146;s time, we will have the second one of its
kind, which will be supported by representatives of local community
councils, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, Elder Voice and
many other community groups representing those who we anticipate might
have the most at stake or, perhaps, some of the biggest difficulties
when the moment arrives.</p><p><a name="06070682000058">There is no doubt that interest
is growing. People are concerned that we should get things in the right
order, and that we in the Border Television region should be the
pioneers who get it right, rather than the guinea pigs whose
experiences other people learn from. The process is irreversible. One
day, it will happen and we will no longer have analogue television, so
it is absolutely essential that all the different parts of the process
are done right.</p><p><a name="06070682000059">As
people learn more about all this, they are raising more and more issues
with me about what will face 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 333WH</b><br>them. An obvious example is the fact that there is still quite a bit of
confusion about whether digital switchover is just about television or
whether it includes radio. That confusion is reinforced by the name of
the organisation which is there to help the process: the name Digital
UK does not suggest that that organisation is concerned only with
television. Certainly, much of the correspondence that I have recently
dealt with raises concerns about the digital radios that people in my
constituency have bought, which have frankly been a massive waste of
money because it is not part of the process. I understand that there is
no prospect in the medium term that digital radio will be available in
my part of the world. I appreciate that it is available
through digital television and that, before too long, people will be
able to get devices that extend availability from their main television
set to other parts of their house. For now, however, there is a false
perception in some people&#146;s minds about what all that
entails.</p><p><a name="06070682000060">The hon.
Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford made an extremely important point
about levels of public awareness and the perception that people are
well on their way towards understanding what will happen. Some 70 per
cent. of households have now gone digital, and that statistic will give
great comfort to those in charge of the process. As he said, however,
that often simply means that one or other of the televisions in the
house has been converted, which leaves an awful of other televisions
and bits of equipment that must still be converted. There is still a
lot of confusion about that, and many people in my part of the world,
where attention is most closely focused at the moment, will need to
spend a lot more time than they anticipated with wires and strange bits
of equipment over the next 18 months or
so.</p><p><a name="06070682000061">A recent MORI poll
for the Department of Trade and Industry looked at readiness for
digital switchover in the Border Television region, particularly among
organisations that will be affected. The Committee was again right to
focus many of its concerns on multiple dwelling units, but there are
major issues relating to hotels, guest houses, hospitals, care homes
and the like. Although the awareness level of the organisations
surveyed was similar to that of the public as a whole&#151;about 72
per cent.&#151;only 63 per cent. of care homes and 69 per cent. of
those responsible for social housing were aware of the switchover date.
A lot of people&#151;51 per cent.&#151;have not even begun to
prepare for what will be involved or to develop any kind of plan.
However, they are only about 18 months from the moment of truth, and it
worries me considerably that not enough is being done to prepare for
that moment.</p><p><a name="06070682000062"><b><a name="06070682000263">Mr.
Evans:</b> I was under the impression that there was to be
some sort of advertising campaign in the first area. Has the hon.
Gentleman noticed any advertisements in newspapers or leaflets in his
area?</p><p><a name="06070682000063"><b><a name="06070682000264">Mr.
Moore:</b> There has indeed been an advertising campaign, and
Digital UK has been at pains to point out to me how extensive it has
been. There have been full-page advertisements in newspapers such as
the <i>Southern Reporter</i> and the <i>Berwickshire News and East 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 334WH</b><br>Lothian Herald</i>, and leaflets have been sent out. However, there is a
bit of an issue about the technical level of the language that has been
used, although the problem is not that it is too technical, but that it
is a bit too simplistic. It is not being pitched at the right level,
with the result that people cannot gain anything other than a general
awareness that a big technological development is coming along the
tracks quite soon.</p><p><a name="06070682000064">The recent Help the Aged
letter, which right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber
will have received, was important because it highlighted the scale of
the task at hand. Reflecting on the pensioners&#146; parliament that
it held last year, Help the Aged said that 25 per cent. of the
participants regarded digital switchover as an opportunity, but that 57
per cent. saw it as a threat, which reinforces some of the
Committee&#146;s findings. We must not underestimate the scale of the
challenge still before us.</p><p><a name="06070682000065">Of course, our first and most
obvious concern relates to the technical issues. Anybody who represents
a rural constituency&#151;indeed, I am sure that this is also true of
those who represent urban seats&#151;will know that the availability
of digital terrestrial television can be rather patchy. In my
constituency, freeview is very limited, even in some of the major
towns, such as Hawick and Galashiels. In some cases, people on one side
of a town can get it, but those on the opposite side cannot. People are
therefore still slightly sceptical about the idea that the power will
be boosted and that those who cannot get the service now will get it in
due course. In fairness, every engineer I have heard speak about this
says that that will happen, but that is now what people expect to
happen, so I hope that the Government will be able to
deliver.</p><p><a name="06070682000066">The Chairman
of the Select Committee and my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and
Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) have highlighted the fact that 1.5
per cent. of people do not get analogue and that it is thought that the
same proportion will not get digital. I accept their point that it will
probably be a different 1.5 per cent., but I am concerned that
the proportion will be rather higher than 1.5 per cent. among my
constituents. People will be very worried until the digital mapping is
completed later this year and there is a postcode database to show them
whether they will get the expanded service in time. I hope that
sufficient resources will be put into that database and into making
sure that we understand who will and who will not get the signal in due
course.</p><p><a name="06070682000067">I do not want
people to be forced down the satellite route, not least when there is
no choice of satellites and no guarantee that there will be a choice,
other than through BSkyB. Of course, BSkyB has transformed British
television, and it deserves great credit for that, but I doubt that
even BSkyB would think that it was fair or appropriate that it should
have a monopoly over services to perhaps the most vulnerable people in
the country.</p><p><a name="06070682000068">The
report mentions the cost of converting every last transmitter, and I
accept the Chairman&#146;s point that there is an issue about whether
we have identified every last one. However, I make a plea that we do
not go back from the stated position that every transmitter will be
converted, because it is vital that we convert them all if we are to
achieve even a minimum level of 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 335WH</b><br>choice for people across the country. This is a matter not only of cost,
but of equity and fairness.</p><p><a name="06070682000069">The Committee&#146;s report
also referred to planning permission and asked whether it might get in
the way of converting transmitters. However, nothing in the
evidence&#151;I apologise if this is not the case and I have not
studied the report carefully enough&#151;specifically suggests that
Scottish Borders council, which is the council in my constituency, has
been getting in the way of planning applications. Nor did I see
anything about consultation with the Scottish Executive, which clearly
has a locus in planning in Scotland that is not mirrored south of the
border. To what extent is the Scottish Executive being brought into the
process?</p><p><a name="06070682000070">There are
going to be quirky situations in many parts of the country, but there
is a particular issue in the borders, where we will be the first to
make the changes. That is true not least of
Berwickshire.</p><p><a name="06070682000071"><b><a name="06070682000265">Mr.
Beith:</b> Will my hon. Friend give
way?</p><p><a name="06070682000072"><b><a name="06070682000266">Mr.
Moore:</b> I anticipate a question coming, but if I
may, I will just hold the floor for a moment.</p><p><a name="06070682000073">Most people in Berwickshire get
Border Television, but by a fluke of something or other, a strip on the
coast gets its signal from Grampian. I have spoken to ITV engineers
about that, and they say that there is no reason on earth why people
there should get that signal, but they clearly do. The engineers are at
something of a loss to explain why that is the case and what will
happen immediately after switchover. Likewise, a number of people
receive the Tyne Tees signal, which comes up from south of the border.
That is where my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed
clearly has a similar interest to me, although he seems to have lost
interesting in intervening.</p><p><a name="06070682000074"><b><a name="06070682000267">Mr.

Beith:</b> I did not want to disturb my hon. Friend&#146;s
train of thought. His capacity for reading my mind has not yet been
perfected, because I was going to ask about his previous point about
planning. The planning guidance to local authorities in England has
been changed and is now more accommodating of satellite dishes than it
was. However, there is still a problem in conservation areas, and the
ideal solution is not necessarily even more lax planning requirements,
which might spoil some of our most beautiful and historic buildings and
areas. I hope that my hon. Friend recognises that it would be
undesirable to have a great growth of dishes in such areas and that
people must be offered help to ensure that they can have access to
services without having to despoil areas of particular beauty or
historical interest.</p><p><a name="06070682000077"><b><a name="06070682000270">Mr.
Moore:</b> I apologise to my right hon. Friend for appearing
to think that I could read his mind. I am also grateful to him for that
important point, which reinforces what has been said about not forcing
people down the satellite route because of the unavailability of a
digital terrestrial signal.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 336WH</b><br><p><a name="06070682000078"><b><a name="06070682000271">Mr.
Don Foster:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that one solution to
that planning problem, particularly in conservation areas, and for
listed buildings, might be to urge the manufacturers to develop the
flat dishes that used to be available from the precursor to BSkyB? It
is technologically possible, I understand, and those dishes would be
much more attractive and perhaps solve some of the planning
problems.</p><p><a name="06070682000079"><b><a name="06070682000272">Mr.
Moore:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point, and I hope that
the Minister is paying careful attention.
</p><p><a name="06070682000080">It is clearly
important for my constituents in Berwickshire that some of the
confusion about what signals people will get in due course should be
resolved. There is also a more general issue&#151;the degree of
choice that people will have.</p><p><a name="06070682000081"><b><a name="06070682000273">Mr.
Roger Williams:</b> My hon. Friend represents, as I
do, a constituency that is in a devolved nation and on the border with
England. Some of my constituents get their public service broadcasting
from the midlands, which, because people in Birmingham do not really
appreciate the Welsh Assembly, does not have lots of Welsh Assembly
news on it. Therefore, when the Welsh Assembly elections are held,
people do not seem very engaged. It seems to me that the digital
changeover will not help that situation, and I wonder whether his
constituents have similar
experiences.</p><p><a name="06070682000082"><b><a name="06070682000274">Mr.
Moore:</b> I am being tempted into dangerous territory, Sir
John, and will resist the broadening of the debate. However, I offer my
hon. Friend this more optimistic thought: certainly, under some of the
digital solutions, there will come a point when it will be possible to
choose which variation of the BBC and which regional version of ITV to
watch. That must be a good thing, and it will allow people to decide
for themselves whether they listen to the news from Birmingham or from
Cardiff.</p><p><a name="06070682000083">The point
that I was making before my hon. Friend raised that important issue was
about the degree of choice that people will have. That has to do with
the relay transmitters. As I understand matters, the commercial
broadcasters are not under the obligation to ensure that their signal
gets all the way down the line to every last community where there is a
digital terrestrial signal for the main public service broadcasters.
The argument is a difficult one. People in Jedburgh will rightly ask
why they should receive a service that is less useful and not as wide
as the one that people in Hawick, Galashiels or elsewhere
receive. I know that one answer will be, &#147;Well, it is
better than you had before,&#148; but I do not think that that will
be a winning argument. Nor, I hope, will the argument that most of the
extra channels are shopping channels.</p><p><a name="06070682000084">Although they look slightly
strange to me on occasion, I am pretty sure that over time the
commercial stations will change, and to rule out large segments of the
population from access to them on the digital platform would be to do
them a major disservice and to make a major mistake. I repeat what the
Select Committee has said&#151;that switchover is compulsory. People
are not getting a choice to opt into it. In such circumstances there is
a much greater onus on the Government to ensure that everyone is
treated equally and receives the full range of services.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 337WH</b><br><p><a name="06070682000085">Affordability is another issue
on which the Select Committee rightly spent quite a long time. We have
seen in the debate how in the past few months the prices of set-top
boxes and other bits of kit have been reducing. That is welcome, but as
the Committee wisely points out, a mismatch is developing between the
sales pitch for digital switchover in the first place&#151;which
talks about all the wonderful services that will be
available&#151;and the cheapness of the some of the kit, which will
not be able to provide all those services. There will be a dangerous
expectations gap for the Government, or others, to fall into, and it is
important to deal with that issue as early in the process as possible.
We should not underestimate, either, the difficulty of getting those
set-top boxes wired up. The cheaper ones tend to be those that break
after a few weeks, and need to be replaced&#151;but perhaps I should
not generalise from my own
experience.</p><p><a name="06070682000086">As the
Committee has said, there will be other costs, to do with aerials and
electricity costs. What kind of environmental message is being given to
people by the lack of off-buttons on set-top boxes, at a time of
growing concern about environmental issues? The switchover is
compulsory, and for all the reasons that I have identified the
Government still have an awful lot to do. I hope that they will take up
the task with more urgency than I detect at present.</p><p><a name="06070682000087">As to vulnerable groups, I
endorse all that the Select Committee has said about the fact that the
current proposals are far too restrictive and will rule out a huge
number of people. Some of the evidence suggested that a large number of
people who are entitled to benefits do not take them up and will
therefore be excluded from the assistance scheme as currently drafted.
No one would question the need to target the bulk of the resources at
such people, but there are many others who, for financial or other
reasons, will need some assistance, and we must hope that the
Government will realise that before too long. If they do not, that will
fuel resentment and disappointment when the switchover process is not
handled as smoothly as was promised, and does not, as hoped, fulfil its
great potential.</p><p><a name="06070682000088">A
missing part of the debate, it seems to me&#151;although perhaps it
is a secondary concern in the current circumstances&#151;is regional
programming. One of the great strengths of Border Television, as it is
currently structured, is the fact that a vast amount of regional
programming is undertaken. That applies not only to the news service,
which is watched by a staggering proportion of people in the
constituencies served, but also to documentaries and much of the rest
of the output. It seems to me that some trade-offs are being made in
the digital switchover process, and that ITV and others are being
allowed to reduce regional content. I worry that, as Lord Bragg has
recently suggested, in a few years&#146; time not only arts
broadcasting but regional programming will be severely squeezed, and we
will not benefit from the diversity for which ITV is at present rightly
praised, which has been a real strength of the system for
decades.</p><p><a name="06070682000089">I want
finally to talk about ministerial responsibility, which the Chairman of
the Select Committee also 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 338WH</b><br>mentioned. It seems fairly clear, from his presence today and from other
circumstances, that the Minister who is to respond to the debate will
have responsibility for this matter. I am glad about that, and I hope
that he will confirm that it is so. People are a wee bit suspicious
when they think no one is in charge. They wonder why no one is willing
to take charge, and whether there is something they should know; are
the people in question a bit worried? I am sure that that is not what
the Minister feels, and I hope that he will reassure us about that this
afternoon.</p><p><a name="06070682000090">I want to
make him an offer, which I also extend to the Secretary of State. On
the assumption that the first switchover moment will be hailed as a
great achievement and held up as an example not just to the Border
Television region but to the whole country, I hope that the
Secretary of State and the Minister will be able to be present in the
Borders, at the Selkirk transmitter. I hope that we will be able to
throw a great party for them. The warm welcome that will be available
to them will be a nice incentive to come and see the switchover. I hope
in the mean time that there will be a chance for them to make
constituency visits, to reinforce some of the points that need to be
made, although I am sure that the Minister has been well briefed about
the technical issues and geography that are so much a part of the
Border Television
area.</p><p><a name="06070682000091">I do not think
that any Member of Parliament in the region is opposed to what is about
to happen, but there is a reasonable consensus across the parties and
across the border that there are still many issues to sort out. This
process is irreversible and we do not get a second chance at it. I hope
that the Government will ensure that it happens
properly.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070682000243">3.30

is, and things cross it. People do not believe assurances that they
will get Border Television or BBC Scotland because they are in the
right postcode district. They know that postcodes cross the border.
Indeed, such people receive health literature and all sorts of other
things meant for the other side of the border. It is in the nature of
television transmission that it does not fit artificial
boundaries.</p><p><a name="06070682000096">I have a
meeting on Monday with the chief executive of Border Television and a
senior engineer about precisely what will happen at the Halidon
transmitter. One of the possibilities is that Border Television will
give away part of its transmission area and that those who currently
get Border Television from the Halidon transmitter may in future get
Tyne Tees television and not Border Television. I do not think that
that issue has been resolved.</p><p><a name="06070682000097">Whichever way things go, it
will create a lot of discussion among my constituents, particularly
between the rugby fans and the English football fans. Rugby fans tend
to like Border Television, because it gives a lot of reporting to rugby
union and rugby league. English football fans do not want to be
switched over to a Scottish game when an important English game is on.
The issue arouses strong feelings and there remains some uncertainty
about what will happen.</p><p><a name="06070682000098">I am not even sure that the
broadcasters are clear about who transmits to where and who gets which
bit of the transmission. All that will be fairly graphically
highlighted when the digital switchover takes places. Some people
manage to get both and manage to have a choice&#151;I am in that
category&#151;by getting a poorer signal from one of the
transmitters. That will be relevant when I talk about another part of
my constituency in a moment.</p><p><a name="06070682000099">In terms of the regional issues
that my hon. Friend mentioned, it would be helpful to have a clear
guarantee that everybody will have access to their neighbouring
region&#146;s output if they get digital reception. Such access is
technically perfectly possible. I understand that in many cases it will
happen without anybody even asking for it. It will help to solve the
problem if people have the choice&#151;most do not have such a choice
now&#151;to switch between Border Television and Tyne Tees, English
BBC1 and Scottish BBC1, and English BBC2 and Scottish BBC2. That is
technically feasible. If such a choice were made available, it would
reduce one of the sources of difficulty that we have in the
process.</p><p><a name="06070682000100">Another part
of my constituency, the area around the village of Elsdon, gets Border
Television. It cannot get a major signal from any transmitter at all. I
remember Ofcom writing to me to
state:</p><a name="06070682000235"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Elsdon
lies outside the official service area of any of the terrestrial
television
transmitters&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070682000101">The letter
went on to explain how that situation was not likely to change. People
in that area depend on one 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 340WH</b><br>small relay system. Some people have bought Sky. Quite a number of
people get Border Television from the Caldbeck transmitter; it is a
Cumbrian transmitter of Border Television. Such people get a poor
signal but they can watch
it.</p><p><a name="06070682000102">The crucial
difference between getting a poor signal on analogue and a poor signal
on digital is that one can watch a poor signal on analogue, although it
looks a bit fuzzy, but a poor signal on digital results in either a
blank screen or a freeze frame, and people just cannot watch it. If
they find themselves in the position&#151;no one seems to know the
answer to this issue&#151;of getting a poor digital signal, they may
have no television service at all, unless they are prepared to pay for
Sky. People ought not to be put into such a position.</p><p><a name="06070682000103">Therefore, I hope that, as part
of the help for the 1.5 per cent. of people who do not get
analogue, the Government will re-examine the potential impact of the
switchover on people who are already getting a poor analogue signal and
who in future might not get any television at all. Such a situation is
unreasonable and unacceptable in an age when it is technically possible
to meet their
needs.</p><p><a name="06070682000104">Another problem
in an area such as mine is that, whereas the Tweed valley area and
parts of the west of my constituency get Border Television, most of the
area gets Tyne Tees. They are all subject to publicity that says,
&#147;We are going digital in 2008&#148;. People therefore say,
&#147;Oh dear, I must buy this free box and this special set. I must
get my aerial renewed because we are going digital&#148;. Such people
are not actually going digital until 2012, if the present timetable is
followed. A number of people are getting frightened that they will lose
their television service completely when they have no need to do so,
because they will continue to get Tyne Tees television. As my hon.
Friend said, more needs to be done to make the picture clearer and more
understandable to people, so that they know whether there is a real
reason to spend some
money.</p><p><a name="06070682000105">Again, that
issue is particularly confusing for elderly people. They might well
say, &#147;I don&#146;t think I am going to bother buying all this
if I know that I have got another four or five years of analogue. If I
am still in good health and strength in four or five years&#146;
time, I will do it then. I do not need to do it now.&#148; Currently,
such people feel under some pressure to change.</p><p><a name="06070682000106">I want to mention a couple of
further issues. The first is the situation for blind people, about
which the Royal National Institute of the Blind has written to us.
Blind people make good use of television. Their ability to do so will
be impaired if they depend on using a remote control. The RNIB has made
it clear that blind and partially sighted people, and some other
categories of disabled people need an alternative mechanism for
controlling the digital box if they are to have access to television.
The Government have included blind and disabled people in the category
to which they want to give special help, but we want to be sure that
the right to special help is available. That would enable those people
not to be denied access because the system is more technologically
complicated to
operate.</p><p><a name="06070682000107">Secondly, my
hon. Friend mentioned the energy issue relating to free boxes, but
there is a further point. Not only do some of them not have a
switch-off mechanism, but a number of free boxes lose all the stations
if they are switched off at the plug. People 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 341WH</b><br>have to retune them all over again. I have a radio that does that as
well, and there is nothing more exasperating than coming home,
discovering that there has been a power cut during the week and having
to retune the stations on the radio. If people have to do the same on
the television with the free box, they will opt to leave the free box
on all the time, so wherever there is a television that might be left
on standby, a free box will be left on standby as well. That would mean
a significant net increase in the use of energy across the country at a
time when we are trying to reduce energy use. The Government need to
address that as well.</p><p><a name="06070682000108"><b><a name="06070682000276">Mr.
Don Foster:</b> Is my right hon. Friend aware that the recent
survey by the Energy Saving Trust says that the average
household&#146;s energy bill will go up by &#163;30 a year for the
reason that he just described?</p><p><a name="06070682000109"><b><a name="06070682000277">Mr.
Beith:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for reminding me of that
figure. It is also an issue for Government, quite apart from anything
else, because of the fuel poverty problem. The key issue of energy
conservation is one that they ought to
address.</p><p><a name="06070682000110">A number of
decisions remain to be resolved, including who will receive English
television and who will receive Scottish television. Which BBC channel
people receive is also affected by this. Not only is BBC1 different in
England and Scotland, but BBC2 is different. There are unresolved
issues and great uncertainty about how areas with very poor reception
will be served. Many people still face difficulties and the Select
Committee Chairman, whose work we appreciate, said that the issue has
the potential to cause great concern and distress. I warn my hon.
Friends that it has great potential to increase the number of letters,
calls and surgery visits from our constituents, who will want to know
why they have been landed with the problem and why it is so
complicated. They will hark back to the days of natural gas conversion
when they were looked after, partly because of the safety aspect. All
they had to do was to admit an officially designated person to their
house to adjust the equipment and in almost all cases everything was
all right. However, even that switchover was not perfect and there were
a few problems because some so-called cowboys turned up, but it
demonstrated that there is a more hands-on way in which the Government
and broadcasters could help people. There are significant dangers if we
do not get it
right.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070682000244">3.41
pm</h5><p><a name="06070682000111"><b><a name="06070682000278">Mr.
Don Foster (Bath) (LD):</b> I was slightly taken by surprise
when you called me, Sir John, because I had hoped that other colleagues
would enter this crucial debate. I want to begin, as others who follow
me will, no doubt, by congratulating not only the hon. Member for
Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), but all the members of
his Committee on an excellent report that has undoubtedly stimulated a
lot of thought. His crucial point, which was absolutely right, was that
insufficient attention has been devoted to the issue in the House.
Perhaps as a result of his Committee&#146;s report, the issue will
now receive the wider 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 342WH</b><br>airing that it deserves because over the next few years it will affect
every single one of our constituents. It is
crucial.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060706/halltext/60706h0313.htm"/>


<p><a name="06070682000112">The hon.
Gentleman was right to say that, whatever the problems, it is worth
reflecting on the enormous benefits that will arise if the procedure
for switchover&#151;perhaps we should call it switch-off&#151;is
right. There will be enormous benefits in terms of additional channels,
greater quality and consumer choice, new features, such as
interactivity, better allocation of scarce spectrum space and social or
economic benefits, or a combination of the two, from the release of the
analogue
spectrum.</p><p><a name="06070682000113">There is no
doubt that the move to digital is already popular. Around 18 million
households have already decided freely that they want to move into the
digital era, although I point out in passing that I was slightly taken
aback by one statistic in the important trial carried out in Bolton
about targeted assistance packages. It showed that 7 per cent. of those
who were surveyed said that they were very satisfied with the digital
services they received, when in fact they did not receive any digital
services. That is further evidence of the additional explanatory work
that needs to be done.
</p><p><a name="06070682000114">There is no doubt
that, if we manage the switchover carefully, it will bring huge
benefits to the vast majority of our constituents. Reference has
rightly been made to the 1.5 per cent. of people who will lose out if
the plans go ahead as currently constructed. Planning and managing the
switchover properly is crucial. I do not want to be over-critical, but
it is worth reminding ourselves that the former Secretary of State, now
Lord Smith of Finsbury, proposed that we should achieve that by 2010.
There has been a two-year slippage. It was equally disappointing that
Ofcom had to urge the Government in letters to get on and decide when
the date would be and, if it was to be 2012, to announce that so that
the planning could begin. It took the Government a long time to make
the announcement and it was done, strangely, by burying it somewhere in
the Labour party&#146;s manifesto for the last general election. Be
that as it may, a decision was made. The Select Committee was right to
say that it was a bold decision and that, if properly managed, huge
benefits would accrue from
it.</p><p><a name="06070682000115">There is no
doubt&#151;other hon. Members have touched on this&#151;that there
is an urgent need to improve the information given to the public on a
variety of issues relating to the digital switchover. We know that 25
per cent. of the population are still in analogue homes. We know that,
although 75 per cent. now have some form of digital equipment, as the
hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford rightly said, that often
refers to just one television set, when there are two or three sets,
video recorders and so on. There is still a lot of work to be
done.</p><p><a name="06070682000116">I welcome the
decision by Digital UK to launch its &#163;200 million information
campaign a few months ago. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) said, the first area to
be affected is the borders area represented by him and my right hon.
Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). They are the
first to enter this brave new world. My hon. Friend was absolutely
right 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 343WH</b><br>to demand that the procedure must be right, so that the borders are not
the guinea pigs from whom others
learn.</p><p><a name="06070682000117">My hon. Friend
raised a number of issues, but one area of comfort from a recent survey
in his constituency is that 75 per cent. of people recognise what needs
to be done for the digital switchover. They fully understand what will
happen, whereas only 66 per cent. of the rest of us understand. His
constituents are already ahead of the game in terms of understanding,
but that leaves 25 per cent. who do not understand, with only 18 months
to go. He is absolutely right to say that there is a lot of work still
to be
done.</p><p><a name="06070682000118"><b><a name="06070682000279">Mr.
Moore:</b> I appeal to my hon. Friend to distinguish between
people being aware that there is a big process going on and those who
fully understand the details and issues arising from it. They have got
to the point where they know that it is happening, but they are
beginning to worry about the
particulars.</p><p><a name="06070682000119"><b><a name="06070682000280">Mr.
Foster:</b> I shall perhaps share the statistics later with my
hon. Friend. The survey is even more encouraging than he suggests, but
he is right to say that there is a lot of work to be done in a short
period and it is crucial to ensure that we get it
right.</p><p><a name="06070682000120">My hon. Friend
and a number of other hon. Members raised some issues that are
important to touch on, so that we can hear the Minister&#146;s
response to them. We have already heard about the supply chain, the
huge amount of work that will be done, the large number of television
sets, digital boxes and 25 million aerials that will be needed and the
need to ensure that orders are placed early so that the kit will be
available when it is needed. Concern was also rightly expressed in the
report in relation to potential problems from cowboy operators. I was
delighted that in their response to the report the Government said that
they would work with the relevant trade organisations to try to find
ways of overcoming that. That is
welcome.</p><p><a name="06070682000121">Other hon.
Members have raised concerns about various aspects of planning. My
right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed referred to
conservation areas and listed buildings and the difficulties of having
a satellite dish, which are not permitted under planning rules. I
declare an interest because that applies to many parts of the wonderful
city of Bath, where people cannot have satellite dishes in the very
area where they are unable to get Channel 5, so they do not have access
to those digital terrestrial television services. They feel as though
they are losing out.</p><p><a name="06070682000122">As I have already said, the
development of new technology and new ways of receiving satellite
broadcasts, especially the flat-surface receivers that were in use some
years ago, may provide part of the solution to that planning problem,
but the issue must be taken more seriously. I note from the
Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee report that the
relevant Departments here and in the devolved Administrations are
considering the planning issues at the moment.</p><p><a name="06070682000123">Another crucial matter, to
which the Chairman of the Select Committee referred and which affects
25 per cent. of the population, is that of people living in 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 344WH</b><br>houses in multiple occupation, or MDUs, to use the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s more recent jargon. There is concern that, in many
cases, the owners of those properties, whether they are local councils,
housing associations or private landlords, are not taking enough action
to prepare themselves for what is necessary. A campaign is clearly
needed to persuade the owners of houses in multiple occupation to take
more vigorous action. I was pleased that reference was made to some of
the other types of property&#151;for example, care homes, hotels and
so on&#151;where there are similar
problems.</p><p><a name="06070682000124">Several
other issues were mentioned. I have already referred to the assistance
package. Like others, I believe that the Government will have to
consider a wider range of people who will need support under that
package. The matter will no doubt be debated as further research is
done. However, what many of us want, very quickly, is the answer to the
crucial question who will pay for it. It would be absolutely wrong if
that money were lumped with the BBC&#146;s licence fee.</p><p><a name="06070682000125">It is the Government&#146;s
social policy that there should be free television licences for the
over-75s, which I welcome, and the Department for Work and Pensions
gives hundreds of millions of pounds to the BBC to make up for its lost
source of income from potential licence fee payers. Targeted assistance
is exactly the same: it is a social policy of the Government and it
should be funded by them. The Minister may challenge me to say where
the money will come from, but clearly there will be huge financial
dividends to the Exchequer from the release of the analogue spectrum
and potentially from spectrum charging, issues to which I will return
in a second.</p><p><a name="06070682000126">Funding
is a crucial issue. I am delighted that other hon. Members have voiced
their concerns about the energy consumption of some of the new
equipment. I said when I intervened in the speech of my right hon.
Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed that the latest survey shows
that the additional energy used by the new digital set-top boxes will
cost each household &#163;30 more. That does not include the
additional cost of running some of the high energy usage television
sets that are increasingly coming on to the market. Those costs can be
reduced if the equipment can be manufactured to have an
&#147;off&#148; button, but at present few of them do.</p><p><a name="06070682000127">I was pleased that, during DCMS
questions on Monday, the Minister agreed to discuss the issue with the
industry to see what can be done about it. In response to my question
on the need for energy labelling on equipment, a matter that was
referred to in the Select Committee report, the Minister said that the
Government would work with the relevant bodies to find a form of
labelling. Digital UK said that it may be prepared to incorporate it in
the logos that it puts on the
equipment.</p><p><a name="06070682000128">I shall
refer now to sources of income from the Government, particularly the
use of the release spectrum. Most people accept that there are two
potential uses and that we will end up with a mixture of both. One will
be social use&#151;the release spectrum might be used for hospital
television, local TV and so on. The economic benefits will be from the
sale of the spectrum to a range of potential users, for example, the
provision of television services through mobile phones. Many other
options are being considered.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 345WH</b><br><p><a name="06070682000129">The hon. Member for Maldon and
East Chelmsford referred to the box that he was sent; I, too, was sent
one. There is no doubt that the BBC, ITV and others are pressing hard
to persuade us of the merits of high-definition television. However, we
should be aware that, under current technology, high-definition
television makes a great deal of use of the spectrum.</p><p><a name="06070682000130">If we are to go in the
direction of high-definition television and we stoke up too much demand
at this stage, we will remove some of the potential alternative uses. I
am not saying that that is a bad thing, but we need to think about it.
That is why the Select Committee was absolutely right to say that the
decision on what we will do in respect of the release spectrum must be
made very quickly, or we will be in all sorts of difficulties further
down the track.</p><p><a name="06070682000131">The
Government have consistently hinted at the possibility of spectrum
charging. We keep being told in parliamentary answers that taxation is
a matter for the Chancellor and that the Chancellor has made no
decision in that respect. However, we know that Ofcom is looking at the
matter at the moment.</p><p><a name="06070682000132">Once we move into the exciting
digital arena and the Chancellor starts considering the introduction of
a charge for the use of the spectrum, I hope that the Minister will
lobby his right hon. Friend definitely not to use it to charge for
those services that provide what we call public service broadcasting.
That is crucial.</p><p><a name="06070682000133">We
must not underestimate the huge challenges ahead. If they are properly
handled and dealt with, there will be great
benefits.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070682000245">3.57
pm</h5><p><a name="06070682000134"><b><a name="06070682000281">Mr.
Malcolm Moss (North-East Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> May I
begin by commending the Chairman of the Select Committee on Culture,
Media and Sport, my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East
Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), and his team on an extremely important
report? I was about to say that it was overdue, but it got there in
time.</p><p><a name="06070682000135">From my reading
of the conclusion, it appeared that the Chairman chose his words
extremely carefully, perhaps with some content from his Clerk. It
stated:</p><a name="06070682000236"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Government&#146;s adoption of a firm and early timetable for analogue
switch-off is a bold, and some would say brave,
decision.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070682000136">The two key
words in that quotation are grossly understated; as one reads the
report, the word &#147;rash&#148; springs to mind, and the word
&#147;spatchcock&#148;, which was used in a Select Committee report
when energy was being privatised in the 1980s. It had the press rushing
out to consult their dictionaries on what &#147;spatchcock&#148;
meant. Hon. Members can rush to their dictionaries tomorrow to find
out. It means a cobbled-together process that does not stack together
in a meaningful, logical way.</p><p><a name="06070682000137">Behind the Select
Committee&#146;s report is an assessment that, if the Government are
not careful, they will have serious problems on their hands that will
affect the whole electorate. It will not be piecemeal; it will affect
everybody, not just one or two people.</p><p><a name="06070682000138">I urge the Minister to address
the matter, as I am sure he will. He probably did not realise when he
took 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 346WH</b><br>up his position as Minister in the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport with responsibility for the creative industries that, in the
words of David Elstein,</p><a name="06070682000237"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This will be the
biggest single civil project in the history of this
country.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06070682000139">I do not
suppose the Minister realised that he was landing himself with a
project of that size.</p><p><a name="06070682000140">The report states that the
project needs leadership. It needs a central organisation and critical
leadership, probably from the Minister who is designated to deliver it.
I hope that the Minister will confirm that he is also the Minister who
will be seen to deliver the package, to whom Parliament can turn, and
who bangs heads together, as my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and
East Chelmsford said earlier. That will be necessary, because there are
so many vested interests. Bringing together all those involved will be
a massive task. It needs ministerial authority to push that through, as
is well stated in the
report.</p><p><a name="06070682000141">If I were in
the Minister&#146;s shoes, I would listen carefully to the experts
who gave evidence to the Select Committee. I would carefully read what
they said and wrote, and would have them in to discuss their
experiences. Those who gave evidence to the Committee have been in the
business for 30 or 40 years and know that what is proposed will be
incredibly difficult to do. One commentator, Chris Goodall,
said:</p><a name="06070682000238"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;for a large
fraction of the population...digital
TV&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06070682000142">that is,
digital terrestrial
TV&#151;</p><a name="06070682000239"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;represents
nothing of benefit
whatsoever&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06070682000143">He went on
to say that it would be &#147;costly and extremely stressful&#148;.
He was involved in the introduction of Channel 5, during which Channel
5 had to do all the video cassette recorder tuning. That went well over
budget; I think that it cost &#163;165 million in the end. However,
that is nothing compared with what is proposed for the
switchover.</p><p><a name="06070682000144">Of
course, it is the Government who are undertaking the programme, which
is compulsory, as was mentioned earlier. They have dictated that it
will happen, and they have set a time scale. The Government took that
unilateral decision, and I agree with other hon. Members that their
level of responsibility is therefore elevated right to the top. They
cannot just move problems on and pass the buck to individuals in other
organisations. They decided on this major undertaking, so they must
have a critical responsibility. Of course, as many hon. Members have
said, that means that they will have to put their hand in their pocket
along the line.</p><p><a name="06070682000145">It
might be helpful, in selling the idea to all who will be involved, if
the Government came clean on their cost-benefit analysis. They are
saying, &#147;This is good for you; we believe there are benefits
here,&#148; but they are not showing transparently the figures for
the workings that they have had done internally, so that others can
come to their own conclusions on whether this incredibly expensive
project will be worth all the
trouble.</p><p><a name="06070682000146">It has been
costed that the average household will pay between &#163;80 and
&#163;570, but, again, what is the average household? Apparently it
is 2.4 television sets. The figures of between &#163;80 and
&#163;570 were in the Culture, Media and Sport Committee press
release of 29 March. Even the lowest level of &#163;80 is, for many
people, a pretty substantial amount. It is nearly as 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 347WH</b><br>much as the licence fee, which many people at the threshold of claiming
benefits find incredibly difficult to pay. There will be significant
financial pressure on a large number of people who will not fall into
the group that qualifies for the
assistance.</p><p><a name="06070682000147">The
Government have answered that compulsory switch-off is necessary
because about 27 per cent. of UK households will be unable to watch
digital television via the terrestrial freeview service until the
analogue signal is switched off. That first surfaced in the
Government&#146;s Green Paper on the future of the BBC, which went on
to conclude that digital switchover would be pursued as the only way to
ensure that the benefits of high-quality free-to-air television were
available to all. But of course, as has been mentioned, high-quality
free-to-air TV is already available to that 27 per cent. through
satellite delivery.</p><p><a name="06070682000148">Why have the Government opted
for the least useful of all the digital platforms as an essential
requirement for consumers, irrespective of the cost of provision?
Digital terrestrial television offers the least choice, little or no
interactivity, the smallest number of channels and limited scope to
upgrade to the newer technologies that have been mentioned, such as
high-definition TV. As the Select Committee Chairman said,
&#147;Switch-off 2&#148; looms large in the not-too-distant
future.</p><p><a name="06070682000149">Who benefits?
I would argue that it is not the consumer. Everyone will pay higher
costs, and for many there will be limited increases in viewing choice.
Nor will the satellite and cable TV companies benefit. The main
benefits will of course go to the terrestrial broadcasters, led by the
BBC. In fact, it would seem that it was the BBC that pushed for DTT
when no one else wanted it. The reasons are obvious: the BBC will get a
digital platform to which it has been given privileged access&#151;a
platform that, by restricting the number of channels available,
protects both the BBC from the competition of new entrants and its
audience from a proliferating digital market.</p><p><a name="06070682000150">Ironically, when the BBC argued
for DTT, it certainly did not factor in the fact that it would be made
responsible for the assistance package and would have to load the
licence fee to cover the costs. That is all linked in with the
negotiations that are now going on about not just the charter, but the
licence
fee.</p><p><a name="06070682000151"><b><a name="06070682000282">Sir

argued for DTT to end the unfairness of a significant group of licence
fee payers funding BBC digital channels without having access to them,
so it seems bizarre that it is now tasked with addressing that
so-called unfairness by increasing the licence fee burden, with which
many people already struggle. It is those people, of course, who cannot
afford digital, whether satellite or cable. They are the people on
benefits and the elderly. Is it right that that most regressive of
funding mechanisms be used for a Government-determined engineering
project, rather than for the broadcast services that it was originally
designed to pay for?</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 348WH</b><br><p><a name="06070682000154">The Government have yet to
announce the details of the targeted assistance programme to help the
vulnerable groups with switchover, although they have said that the BBC
will be expected to fund the programme. Although still uncosted, the
assistance scheme could end up
costing</p><a name="06070682000240"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;on the far side
of a billion&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06070682000155">That is a

includes the technical cost that the corporation will face in switching
over, but crucially it does not include the targeted assistance
package. We are therefore still waiting for the final licence fee
figure and for the details of the assistance package. At the BBC, there
are concerns that, if the amount of targeted help needed is high, the
figures in other parts of its licence fee bid may end up being cut in
order to keep the overall settlement at a politically acceptable
level.</p><p><a name="06070682000157">On the
assistance package and who it will help, 57 per cent. of the
elderly respondents to the Help the Aged survey that was commented on
earlier saw digital television as a threat and not an opportunity.
Furthermore, it has been estimated that some 10 per cent. of UK
households are likely to be either unable or unwilling to switch to
digital. The Select Committee estimated that training local voluntary
workers to visit isolated people would cost as much as &#163;100 per
household.</p><p><a name="06070682000158">It seems
strange that all those figures have not been factored in at this early
stage. Some so-called pilots have been done; there were two in Wales,
and of course the Boston pilot alluded to
earlier.</p><p><a name="06070682000159"><b><a name="06070682000284">Mr.

Yes.</p><p><a name="06070682000163">People in the
industry would argue that those pilots were not proper pilots; a very
small number of households were involved. However, they found that
introducing the new technology, particularly to the elderly, took
repeated visits by skilled technicians and people who were able to take
them through the whole process. It might be argued that, if one were to
roll that out throughout the country, one might not have the problems
that were met in the small, focus communities. However, I would argue
the opposite. We must not underestimate the ability of many elderly
people to embrace that technology, but with all the channel-switching
opportunities that it presents, it is confusing for them. To satisfy
those people who, at the end of the day, take delivery of the new
system, the people introducing the switchover must factor in and cost
more hours than they have hitherto.</p><p><a name="06070682000164">The Government ought to embrace
a completely new pilot study on a scale that will yield significant
results and enable them to come up with accurate figures. If the
figures for assistance are underestimated, 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 349WH</b><br>there will be huge pressure on the BBC and the licence fee to ensure
that its social responsibility is delivered properly.</p><p><a name="06070682000165">We are told that the Government
will charge the BBC a new tax on the digital spectrum that will be
released. The BBC has put a figure of &#163;300 million into its
costings for the licence fee negotiations. That &#163;300
million will go straight to the Treasury, and the argument was made
earlier that, if the Government take that money, they should put some
of it back into the assistance scheme and into assisting the BBC. When
the new spectrum is released, there may not be much of it available,
because TV companies will bid for it and even more channels than we
have now will access it. The switchover is compulsory and determined by
the Government, so if money goes to the Treasury, the Government have a
moral responsibility to put some, if not all of it, back into the
system.</p><p><a name="06070682000166"><b><a name="06070682000288">Mr.
Don Foster:</b> The hon. Gentleman said he anticipated the BBC
being for the spectrum, and he rightly pointed out that the
BBC&#146;s costings included money for it, but, possibly to help him,
will he make his party&#146;s position clear? I have said that it
would be inappropriate to charge the BBC for the spectrum and give the
Chancellor money from the licence fee, because it would be a stealth
tax. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</p><p><a name="06070682000167"><b><a name="06070682000289">Mr.
Moss:</b> We have said that it is another stealth tax, so I
agree with the hon. Gentleman.</p><p><a name="06070682000168">There are all sorts of issues
that we could go over, but I suspect that we would repeat points that
many hon. Members have already made in the debate. The switchover is a
massive undertaking. I can see the need for the Government to appear
firm in their resolve by setting dates for future activity, but as we
heard from those who represent constituents in the border areas, they
are concerned about being guinea pigs. There is a lack of
understanding. The digital companies&#146; switchover promotion does
not seem to have got through, and the marketing costs will be far more
than people have estimated.</p><p><a name="06070682000169">I urge caution on the
Government, and I recommend a much larger and more important pilot
scheme. The longer they leave the switchover, the fewer the people who
will need their equipment converted. What is the rush? I do not see the
need for it, because the benefits to those who are finally brought in
are limited.</p><p><a name="06070682000170">If I
were in the Minister&#146;s shoes, I would want to hold back on the
project at the earliest opportunity. Perhaps from his remarks, we will
find out that he has already decided to do just
that.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06070682000246">4.15

absolutely huge. The Government were right to make the decision to
commit themselves to switch off analogue and switch over to digital. It
presents a huge challenge, but I must say to the hon. Member for
North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), it is worth the trouble.
I shall decline his invitation to move the deadline of 2012. We begin
switchover in 2008, we will complete it in 2012, and we are embarking
on what might best be described as a digital revolution. It is right
that we embrace it, there are huge benefits in it for the United
Kingdom economy, and as part of the creative industries, which
represent 8 per cent. and growing of gross value added, GVA, the
digital revolution and switchover will play its part. It would be
foolish in the extreme if we were not to take up the challenge. The
question is, how do we deliver it?</p><p><a name="06070682000177">I pay tribute to the Chairman
of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, the hon. Member for
Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale). His understanding of
these matters is considerable, and that opinion is held in all parts of
the House. His assiduous attendance even at engineering conferences and
those of aerial installers commands almost incredulity on my part, but
none the less, admiration. He suggested that television transformed his
life for the first time, then a second time, and that he looks forward
to its third transformation with HDTV. I can say only that I think Mrs.
Whittingdale might have something to say about
that.</p><p><a name="06070682000178"><b><a name="06070682000295">Philip
Davies (Shipley) (Con):</b> Given the considerable economic
benefit that the Minister believes will derive from the switchover,
does it not reinforce the Committee&#146;s view that the Government
should pay for the cost of providing television and receiving equipment
for vulnerable groups? It would in effect be a welfare cost or a
means-tested benefit, not a broadcasting cost. The economic benefit of
switchover to the country and therefore the Exchequer reinforces the
case.</p><p><a name="06070682000179"><b><a name="06070682000296">Mr.
Woodward:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will be so generous as to
be patient, he will discover that I shall address that point in the
course of addressing the number of points that hon. Members have made
during this discussion.</p><p><a name="06070682000180"><b><a name="06070682000297">Mr.
Whittingdale:</b> The Minister has been very generous in his
remarks to me. I can return the 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 351WH</b><br>compliment by telling him that I found the conference of the
Confederation of Aerial Industries extremely valuable, so I have
encouraged the confederation to invite him next
year.</p><p><a name="06070682000181"><b><a name="06070682000298">Mr.
Woodward:</b> I am sure the hon. Gentleman will be glad to
know that I heard a rumour that next year&#146;s bonding session of
the Conservative party will also be held at the confederation&#146;s
conference. I would not want to intrude on that.</p><p><a name="06070682000182">One of the critical questions
is, why are we undertaking the switchover? I have already mentioned the
position of the creative industries in the United Kingdom economy and
the role that the digital revolution and digital television play in
that, but there is also the specific context of the timing. First, we
need to manage the transition. Secondly, more and more people are
turning to digital services. The figure for penetration is 75 per cent.
of this country&#151;the highest almost anywhere around the globe.
Without any Government coercion, as it was almost described this
afternoon, people have made a free-market choice to have a digital
television. Again, it is important to emphasise that we are
not forcing it on people, as 75 per cent. have, without any
of the implications of switch-off, voted with their feet and gone out
and put themselves into the ambit of digital services either now or in
the future.</p><p><a name="06070682000183">It is
also critically important for all hon. Members to understand&#151;I
know that some do, but I want to ensure that everyone does&#151;that
in the long term it would not be economically viable for broadcasters
to sustain dual transmission costs. The hon. Member for North-East
Cambridgeshire raised that issue, but it is important to understand
that it would be incredibly economically inefficient if we were to
demand of the broadcaster that they maintain dual transmission
standards.</p><p><a name="06070682000184">Another
question raised by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and
the Chairman of the Select Committee was why we are investing so much
in DTT when there are newer, perhaps better, technologies in the
offing. At the moment, and for many, television via an aerial remains
the cheapest and most convenient option. The Government want to ensure
that as far as possible people have a choice of platforms, although we
remain platform-neutral. It will be only through switching off the
analogue signal that freeview coverage can be extended beyond its
current levels.</p>

<p><a name="06070682000185">The
hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) and others raised questions about
aerials. I shall deal with some of those points now. First, Ofcom
estimates that only 10 per cent. of outdoor aerials might need
to be improved in relation to receiving analogue signals. The actual
number of aerials that might need to be upgraded for digital might be
as low as 2 per cent.</p><p><a name="06070682000186">In relation to the important
question of aerial contracts and the possible abuse of them as a result
of digital switchover, in March the Government launched the registered
digital installer scheme to instil in consumers a sense of trust in the
advice they are given when they seek help to upgrade their aerials.
Already, 250 installers are training for that and another 500 are
registered to undertake the training. It is important to add a codicil
that the RDI licensing body will have an 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 352WH</b><br>inspectorate that will investigate complaints, and that it has already
alerted trading standards officers to remind them of the need to
protect consumers in the run-up to digital
switchover.</p><p><a name="06070682000187"><b><a name="06070682000299">Mr.
Moore:</b> I do not expect the Minister to have this
information at his fingertips, but would he be able to let us know how
many of those registered installers are in the Border television region

people who were involved in training in aerial installation. The
numbers are increasing all the time but I am happy to maintain an
ongoing correspondence with the hon. Gentleman on the subject, for one
simple reason&#151;we have to get it right, and I believe that we
will, but it will be through dialogue rather than assumptions on my
part or anybody else&#146;s. It will happen. As the hon. Gentleman

constituents or those in the industry, I extend the open invitation to
make it an ongoing dialogue. It is in everybody&#146;s interests that
we get this right.</p><p><a name="06070682000191"><b><a name="06070682000303">Mr.

churlish about the visit that the Minister made to Carlisle. I want to
point out, as I have already pointed out to some of the people who
organised the conference, that it was hard for people from the Borders
and the north-east of England to get to. The information is
being fed to him, and I hope that he will have the chance to come back
to us at the earliest

Woodward:</b> I am sure, Sir John, that you will not want me
to delay too long on the subject of invitations. We have nearly two
years before switchover, and it is inconceivable that we will not spend
time in the constituencies involved. I accept the invitation
willingly.</p><p><a name="06070682000193"><b><a name="06070682000305">Paul
Farrelly (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab):</b> Sadly, the

extended to the Chairman of the Select Committee, so the rest of us
ordinary members did not get the opportunity to go along. Clearly, the
market has recognised that, like the Select Committee, the Government
have made a brave and bold decision, which is very welcome. I am
concerned that the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member
for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), is urging prevarication.
Within this ambitious and bold 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 353WH</b><br>timetable, the biggest potential variable in terms of cost is the cost
of aerial installation and the potential for abuse. Does my hon. Friend
agree that we must do all in our power to ensure that vulnerable people
do not suffer from cowboy
installers?</p><p><a name="06070682000194"><b><a name="06070682000306">Mr.
Woodward:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. I can
only underline the importance of that. It is in nobody&#146;s
interest that we see anybody exploited. All hon. Members from all
parties would rightly be concerned if vulnerable people, in particular,
were exploited. We shall need to confront some issues that are not
obvious examples of exploitation. For example, some hon. Members are
concerned about the number of retailers that are still selling
television sets that are only analogue compliant. Although we have a
digital box scheme on hand, we might need some discussions with
retailers to oblige them, when they sell a television set, to advise
people&#151;or if it is being sold online, to oblige retailers to use
a pop-up&#151;that the equipment they are buying will require further
modification and incur further expense either for them or, if they fall
under the Government&#146;s targeted assistance scheme, for the
Government.</p><p><a name="06070682000195">We need
to consider a number of issues to prevent not merely exploitation but
people making genuine mistakes. By working through self-regulation
rather than Government intervention, we can, I hope, get the outcome
that we all want. It is important for all hon. Members to note that the
Government will come down strongly on the side of protecting consumers
and the most vulnerable.</p><p><a name="06070682000196"><b><a name="06070682000307">Mr.

Indeed, I posed a question during one of our hearings about the number
of analogue TVs still being sold, particularly approaching Christmas.
Is it not the case that his discussions with the industry should not
only include the winding-down of the sales of the remaining analogue
televisions, but encourage them to sell high-definition televisions as
the norm? The more are produced, the cheaper the cost will be. We have
already noticed a big reduction in the initial costs of those
TVs.</p><p><a name="06070682000197"><b><a name="06070682000308">Mr.

question of residences of multiple occupation. That is an important
point, which was rightly raised by the Chairman of the Select Committee
and by the Committee. Landlords have 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 354WH</b><br>been upgrading communal television aerial systems since the launch of
digital television in 1998. By 2004, NOP estimates were that about one
third of the systems had been upgraded. None the less, progress is not
quick enough. It needs to move more quickly and we are in discussion
with the industry. With Digital UK, we have recently appointed Ross
Fraser, chief executive of HouseMark, which was established by the
National Housing Federation and the Chartered Institute of Housing, to
chair a group of housing stakeholders to help advise Digital UK and the
Government on how best to reach all landlords in both the private and
social sectors.</p><p><a name="06070682000201">Progress is an issue and will
continue to be in some constituencies more than others. Although we
will not begin the switchover programme for two years, constituencies
will face the problem within the next two years and that must be
addressed. I hope that Ross Fraser will help lead us through the
problem, but the Government are already aware of it and acting to
resolve it.</p><p><a name="06070682000202">Hon.

receive DTT&#151;another important issue. I remind the House that at
the moment 1.5 per cent. of people cannot receive television pictures,
although it has been pointed out that getting a poor picture on
analogue is different from a poor picture on digital if it simply does
not exist. We are aware of that, as are Ofcom and Digital UK. We are
trying, as far as we can, to identify those households that may be
affected. I say &#147;may&#148; because we are still in a
speculative period, but for those hon. Members whose constituencies
face switchover in two years, time is now moving quickly. I assure them
that they are the focus of our attention, and that we will be
addressing the problem. However, as I say, it is an ongoing dialogue,

existence was brought to my attention by the aerial
industry&#151;those remote communities that can receive television
only because they have installed small, local relay transmitters? They
are not part of the 1,154 network. I understand that it is not clear
exactly where they are. Are the Government working to identify them,
and will they then provide the help needed to convert those
relays?</p><p><a name="06070682000204"><b><a name="06070682000312">Mr.
Woodward:</b> If the hon. Gentleman is referring to self-help
transmitters&#151;</p><p><a name="06070682000205"><b><a name="06070682000313">Mr.
Whittingdale:</b>
Yes.</p><p><a name="06070682000206"><b><a name="06070682000314">Mr.
Woodward:</b> I can tell him that there are 330 of them, and
that Ofcom is looking into the situation. I hope, Sir John, that my
answer impressed the hon. Gentleman. It shocked me.</p><p><a name="06070682000207">I was asked whether the cost
should be met by the Exchequer rather than through the licence fee. I
know that hon. Members across the House have been concerned about that.
I appreciate the arguments, but I remain unconvinced of the conclusion
reached by some that it should be funded by the Exchequer. We believe 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 355WH</b><br>that it is a broadcasting cost. We also want to ensure that everybody
has access to all BBC services. Licence fee payers will benefit from
more choice, better picture quality and new services. That best fits
with the principle of maintaining universality of access to the
broadcasting system. It should be remembered that people buy their
television sets: we do not give them sets as part of the licence fee
arrangements. In our view, it is more analogous to the purchase of a
television set than to the receiving of the
programmes.</p><p><a name="06070682000208"><b><a name="06070682000315">Paul
Farrelly:</b> Clearly that issue exercised the Committee more
than most. In fact, during some of our discussions on tax theory and
practice I found myself drifting off to the dreaming spires and the
economic tutorials of half a lifetime ago.</p><p><a name="06070682000209">Although we commended the
Government on most of their recommendations, we did not agree on this
one. Given subsequent debates about the licence fee, I fear that if the
BBC were to fund it the issue would become even more of a political
football. Another thing that exercises me is the question of
accountability. If it goes wrong&#151;if it is
insufficient&#151;can Ministers of whichever political hue simply
blame the BBC? I note that in their response, the Government said that
they are working with the BBC to address accountability issues. How
does the Minister see those issues being
resolved?</p><p><a name="06070682000210"><b><a name="06070682000316">Sir
John Butterfill (in the Chair):</b> Order. May I give the
Minister some brief comfort? I have now been informed by the Clerk that
following representations about the lack of air conditioning, the
Speaker has ruled that the dress rule can be relaxed. If the Minister
wishes to remove his jacket at this rather late stage, he is at liberty
to do so, and other hon. Members may remove
theirs.</p><p><a name="06070682000211"><b><a name="06070682000317">Mr.
Woodward:</b> As always, Sir John, your characteristic
generosity knows no bounds. I shall remove my jacket, not least because
it will complete the picture being taken by the camera behind
me&#151;if the BBC is generous enough not to caricature
it.</p><p><a name="06070682000212">My hon. Friend
makes an important point. I am unable to answer him as he would wish.
Our discussions with the BBC are ongoing, but I do not want to give him
a false sense of hope. We are committed to the present route. My hon.
Friend should not expect it to change. None the less, I hear what he
says.</p><p><a name="06070682000213">Our discussions
with the BBC on accountability, too, are ongoing. My hon. Friend will
have the chance to ask the Secretary of State that question on Monday,
and I am sure that he will wish to avail himself of that opportunity.
He may be a little disappointed, and he may have to wait for clarity on
the subject. However, I respect the question, and I believe that we
will shortly be able to answer it.</p><p><a name="06070682000214">The hon. Member for North-East
Cambridgeshire and the Select Committee Chairman asked about the sale
of spectrum. We have not yet got a precise estimate. It is not possible
at this stage to make a reliable assumption of the market value or of
the potential auction proceeds of the spectrum to be released by the
switchover. Indeed, it will be a matter primarily for Ofcom. However,
it clearly has a value.</p><p><a name="06070682000215">In answer to the questions
posed by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire&#151;and, 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 356WH</b><br>perhaps, the hesitation that he encouraged&#151;I would simply say
that there are values to be received by the Treasury. They are worth
having, and delaying and frustrating them will lead not only to a loss
of sales for the Treasury; it will lead also to a significant loss of
opportunity for the television and broadcasting industries, the
telecommunications industry and the other public service bodies that
would wish to make use of that spectrum.</p><p><a name="06070682000216">It is necessary to provide
clarity as soon as we can, within a decisive framework that recognises
that we are dealing with a fast-moving target. The technologies that
may wish to avail themselves of the use of spectrum are fast-changing,
both in hardware and software, and the true value can be determined
only once the spectrum space is available. It would be foolish to
speculate on its value. Equally, it would be foolish simply to
prevaricate for the sake of it.</p><p><a name="06070682000217"><b><a name="06070682000318">Mr.
Don Foster:</b> Will the Minister clarify something? He said
that it is primarily a matter for Ofcom. Given that there are two
options&#151;one is the social benefit accruing from the use of the
released spectrum, and the other is the economic benefit, largely to
the Treasury&#151;the Government have a key role in deciding which
bit of the spectrum they intend to release for economic reasons and
which for social. That, surely, is not for Ofcom to
decide.</p><p><a name="06070682000218"><b><a name="06070682000319">Mr.
Woodward:</b> The answer is yes and no. There are good reasons
for that. It is important to recognise the nature of the fast-moving
technology with which we are dealing. The anticipated value of the
spectrum sale two years ago was very different from what it would be
now, and I dare say it will be different in two years&#146; time. It
will depend on the demands made of that spectrum space. The way
spectrum is going in the long term, with the ability to get more and
more on ever less width, is another dimension that has to be
considered. In the pre-Budget report, the Government stated their
position and declared policy that the future use of spectrum released
through the digital switchover should be determined in a
technology-neutral auction or auctions, and that Ofcom would apply
administrative incentive pricing when spectrum had not been
auctioned.</p><p><a name="06070682000219">I suspect
that this discussion could delay us a long time. I am happy for it to
do so, but I imagine that some hon. Members would prefer me to enter
into correspondence with the hon. Gentleman, which I would be pleased
to do.</p><p><a name="06070682000220"><b><a name="06070682000320">Mr.
Moss:</b> I commend the Minister for his honesty. This is the
first time that we have heard from the lips of a Minister that this is
being driven partly by the Treasury&#146;s need to fill its black
hole. Will he give us some indication in percentage terms of the
impetus on the Treasury to get this thing through within the time
limits, and the impetus on DCMS and the service industry to broaden out
digital reception for the bulk of
people?</p><p><a name="06070682000221"><b><a name="06070682000321">Mr.
Woodward:</b> I am obviously being invited to talk about the
state of the Government&#146;s economic affairs; as you are aware,
Sir John, they are in excellent condition, thanks to the undoubted and
highly commendable prudence of the Chancellor. The hon. Gentleman
invites me to talk about black holes, and no 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 357WH</b><br>doubt I could delay the Chamber for some time on the subject. However, I
have the feeling, Sir John, that you would quickly bring me to
order&#151;</p><p><a name="06070682000222"><b><a name="06070682000322">Sir
John Butterfill (in the Chair):</b> You are absolutely
right.</p><p><a name="06070682000223"><b><a name="06070682000323">Mr.
Woodward:</b> &#151;and remind me that the subject of debate
was the digital switchover, not the incompetence of the Conservative
party, in government or otherwise. I shall therefore attend to the
matters before us.</p><p><a name="06070682000224">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk
(Mr. Moore) on setting up his Borders digital forum, which is
enlightened and right. The hon. Gentleman is bringing together the core
people and focusing particularly on bodies in the voluntary sector that
can help older constituents and those with disabilities. That is vital,
and it is good to hear of their role. The hon. Gentleman is an example
to everybody in leading his constituents in the right direction, to
ensure that they are best able to take full advantage of digital
switchover. As has been observed, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s region
will be the first to switch over, in the second half of 2008. I am a
little cautious about the mention of 18 months; by my count, it will
happen in 24 months, although my maths may not be as good as the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s.</p><p><a name="06070682000225">We should get the expectation
gap right; needs have to be addressed in respect of that. The hon.
Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) brought up the other dimensions of
services, touching on high-speed broadband. We have a fast-moving
target and we need to look closely at the correlation between digital
switchover and high-speed broadband. It is perfectly clear that
convergence is taking place between the creative industries&#151;the
broadcasting, digital games, film and music industries and
others&#151;and that services that have traditionally used analogue,
or now digital, will also develop interactive programmes that require
high-speed broadband. Such channels may well be
offered.</p><p><a name="06070682000226">The issue is
moving fast, and a fast-moving target is before us, with which the
Government are trying to keep pace. We will endeavour to do so and
recognise the issues in respect of the constituency of the hon. Member
for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and
Selkirk.</p><p><a name="06070682000227">Questions
were asked about the involvement of the Scottish Executive. We
are working with all Government Departments and the devolved 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 358WH</b><br>Administrations to ensure that they are fully engaged in the
process&#151;particularly in helping to ensure that the public are as
informed they can be and that their television sets are converted on
time and as they should be. Of course, we always welcome advice from
hon. Members if they feel that, for example, the Scottish Executive are
not at the same speed as us. In a spirit of constructive dialogue I
say, let me know and we will deal with
it.</p><p><a name="06070682000228">Questions were
asked about energy use in respect of digital switchover. On Monday, I
said in the House that we welcome the action taken by Intellect to
support the use of energy labelling and investment in energy-efficient
products. All hon. Members are becoming increasingly aware of such
issues, and we shall play our part in ensuring that the industry
factors in the energy issues and makes them a part of the digital
switchover.</p><p><a name="06070682000229">The right
hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) raised questions about
access to other television regions. Although we have no plans to change
the boundaries of the ITV regions, I am happy, having noted his
comments, to ensure that those representations are passed to Ofcom for
further discussion. In a spirit of constructive dialogue, I am happy to
enter into correspondence about suggestions made by the right hon.
Gentleman. However, I should say that those currently able to tune
their aerials to more than one transmitter should be able to continue
to do so after switchover, although, as now, they will need an aerial
adjustment or upgrade to make the
change.</p><p><a name="06070682000230">I have tried
to cover the points raised by hon. Members. This issue will be ongoing
and we must recognise that, as we roll out switchover from 2008 to
2012, things will change. The Government have a duty to get the
framework right and work with Digital UK, Ofcom and all partners to
ensure that we get maximum benefits from digital switchover for all
consumers and everybody who pays a licence fee.</p><p><a name="06070682000231">We also have a duty to
recognise the needs of the industry and those creating the many jobs in
this country that will come from the benefits of switchover. At the
same time, we should try to avoid any possibility of waste, which might
be caused if switchover were delayed and if dual transmission, which
would be money wasted, were to happen. I am sure that there will be
plenty of opportunity for us to debate the issues again, and I welcome
the Select Committee&#146;s
report.</p><p><a name="06070682000232"><i>Question
put and agreed to.</i></p><p><a name="06070682000233"><i>Adjourned accordingly at
