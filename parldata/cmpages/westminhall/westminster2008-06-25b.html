 It is a pleasure, Mrs. Dean, to see you in the Chair. I am delighted to be able to open this debate on the Government&#146;s counter-terror strategy. It will give the House as a whole the chance to range widely over that strategy and to explore the four strands of Contest, the title that the Government have given the strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000011">I shall be relatively narrow in my focus. I want to examine the Prevent strand of Contest. Parliament is rightly spending a great deal of time on aspects of what could be called the supply side of violent extremism&#151;in other words, the problems caused by people who come off the conveyor belt to terrorism and commit acts of violence. I intend to focus on the demand side&#151;on preventing people from getting on that conveyor belt in the first place. Surely we can agree that although it is sometimes necessary to pre-empt or punish terrorists, it is far better to prevent those vulnerable people exploited by al-Qaeda and the like from being drawn into terrorism and extremism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08062578000012">Some Members will know that I have a special interest in these matters, as I am the Conservative Member with the largest number and proportion of Muslim constituents. However, it is important to emphasise that violent extremism is not the monopoly of a single ethnic or religious group. By way of illustration, I recall an act of violent extremism carried out in Britain in 1999&#151;the atrocious bombing of the &#147;Admiral Duncan&#148; pub by David Copeland, a neo-Nazi, that killed three people and wounded about 70. Only yesterday, a man described as a neo-Nazi sympathiser was convicted in Leeds for offences under the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000013">I want this morning to consider the strategy&#146;s past, to ask the Minister some questions about the present, and to make some suggestions on how the strategy might evolve in future. However, I begin by honouring some of the anti-violent extremism work that I have seen being undertaken by local authorities. I am thinking not only of projects carried out in my local authority area of Wycombe but of work undertaken in Dudley by Mohammed Afzal and his colleagues to help teach local imams better English; in Bedford among young people by Father Jay Macleod; by the Sultan Bahu Trust in Birmingham and the West London Alliance of local councils; in Hendon and in many other places. Later, I shall probe the Preventing Violent Extremism project as a whole, but the dedication, commitment and effectiveness of those who work on some projects is beyond doubt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08062578000014">I turn to the Prevent strategy&#146;s past. Since 7/7, it appears to have fallen into three phases. The first began in the immediate aftermath of the atrocity, when the   <br>

Government set up the Preventing Extremism Together working groups, which were convened in July 2005 and required to report by mid-September. By any standards, that was a tight timetable, and it caused some unease. The Government appear to have relied a great deal during that stage on established and often controversial organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08062578000015">Critics argued that that first phase lasted a mere two weeks. On 5 August, while the working groups were still sitting, Tony Blair rushed out a 12-point action plan, which included the suggestion that some mosques should be closed. An extensive report, &#147;The Rules of the Game&#148; published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, claims that that plan took the then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke), &#147;by surprise&#148;. The Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), who was then the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, described the plan as half-baked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08062578000016">Parts of the plan, including the proposed closure of some mosques, were never implemented. However, Blair&#146;s sense of restlessness with old contacts and old partners endured. It will not have been eased by the publication in September that year of a damning report on Contest by the Prime Minister&#146;s delivery unit. It found:</p>
<a name="80625h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08062578000461"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The strategy is immature. Forward planning is disjointed or has yet to occur. Accountability for delivery is weak.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08062578000017">It said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08062578000018">and here is the rub&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08062578000019">It also stated:</p>
<a name="80625h0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08062578000464"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We measure meetings and reports, not real world impact.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08062578000020">Blair&#146;s spirit of impatience culminated in October of the following year in the launch of the Preventing Violent Extremism programme, to which I have already referred. The then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the right hon. Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly), called for new voices to combat extremism, and criticised the Muslim Council of Britain for its boycott of Holocaust memorial day&#151;a point on which she, I and others agreed in the past, and a position that the MCB has now reversed, which is an extremely welcome decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08062578000021">As for the Preventing Extremism Together working groups, there is still controversy over how many of their 27 recommendations the Government have implemented. What is certain is that the Government did not implement one of the main ones&#151;a public enquiry into 7/7. One year after that terrible event, there seems to have been a mood of disillusion among many associated with the working groups. One member of the Government, the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan), is on record as saying:</p>
<a name="80625h0001.htm_brev4"><a name="08062578000465"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I worry that the Government might become the Duke of York&#151;marching all these talented British Muslims up the hill of consultation and dialogue, only to march them down again as very little appears to have changed&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08062578000022">During this second phase, the Department for Communities and Local Government seems to have been the lead Department, and the Preventing Violent Extremism programme was the Government&#146;s flagship scheme.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 73WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08062578000023">The launch last month of the Government&#146;s new strategy document entitled &#147;Preventing Violent Extremism: a Strategy for Delivery&#148; seems to mark the transition to a third phase. In this phase, the Home Office, and schemes that concentrate help directly on vulnerable young people, such as the relatively new Channel project, appear to assume a new importance. I say &#147;appear&#148; because it is hard to know. After all these changes of gear&#151;and in some instances, changes of direction&#151;there is still a lack of clarity about the strategy, almost three years on from 7/7.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08062578000024">Mention of the Home Office brings me, of course, to the Minister. I am sorry that the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, the right hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), is unable to respond to the debate due to other parliamentary engagements. This may be the right point to ask his understudy, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker), a few questions. I appreciate that he may not have time to respond to all of them during the debate. Indeed, I doubt that he will, so I would be grateful if he confirmed that he or his colleagues will be happy to respond in writing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08062578000025">First, can we assume from the Minister&#146;s presence that the Home Office is now the lead Department with responsibility for the Government&#146;s counter-terror strategy? Moving on, will the Government publish details of how they propose to assess the success or otherwise of the strategy as a whole? In particular, will they publish details of how they propose to assess its success in relation to the Prevent strand&#151;especially in winning the hearts and minds of young Muslims? On what basis does the Minister disagree with the poll conducted by the Association of Chief Police Officers, published last weekend, which found that</p>
<a name="80625h0001.htm_brev5"><a name="08062578000466"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Increasing numbers of young Muslim people...might be willing to support violent terrorism to articulate their disillusionment and disengagement"?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08062578000026">On the Preventing Violent Extremism programme, the Minister will have read reports that a number of local councils of different political persuasions are refusing to sign up to an indicator called IN35, as a priority indicator. IN35 measures resilience to so-called violent extremism. Those local authorities argue that the indicator, used as a priority indicator, in effect obliges them to act beyond their competence as an arm of the police or of the security services. Will the Minister give a categorical assurance that no Minister or Department has asked local councils to instruct or request refuse collection workers to root through bins for incriminating material? Will he tell the House how many councils are presently refusing to sign up to IN35 as a priority indicator? Why did the DCLG ring-fence the scheme&#146;s funding in the first year, un-ring-fence it for the second year, and is apparently considering ring-fencing it again during the third year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08062578000027">I turn to the Minister&#146;s Department and the Channel project. I understand the importance of projects that seek to concentrate help on vulnerable young people directly. However, the programme&#146;s outlines, as reported in the media, raise some serious questions. How are these young people to be identified and by whom? How will any information held about them be shared? If such  <br>

information is held and shared, what safeguards will be put in place to ensure privacy and confidentiality? How, to put it plainly, will young people be protected against being mistakenly identified as potential violent extremists, at serious possible cost to their prospects, safety and standing in the community?</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that another problem is that malicious allegations could be made? In certain circumstances, such allegations would be quite difficult to disprove and could lead to innocent people being victimised.</p>

 I agree completely. I am concerned that if the membership of the bodies that we are talking about is quite widely drawn, as it properly should be in some senses, there might not be sufficient safeguards against malicious allegations and gossip finding their way on to written records, with very damaging consequences.</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="08062578000030"><a name="80625h0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="08062578000511"><b>Bob Spink (Castle Point) (UKIP):</b>
 I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s cerebral and analytical approach, which is quite refreshing. There are differences between terrorism in this country and in some other countries, and although we tend to home-grow our terrorists, rather than import them, terrorists in America, for instance, tend to come from outside to commit their acts of terrorism. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the Government should do more research into what causes those differences? If we understood the mechanisms behind the problem, we might be able to tackle it better.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="08062578000031"><a name="80625h0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="08062578000512"><b>Mr. Goodman:</b>
 I do believe that and I will come to precisely that point when I finish the rather analytical series of questions that I am firing at the Minister. My last question in this context is simply this: when will the series of parliamentary questions that I tabled on the Channel project as long ago as March be answered?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08062578000032">I am sure that hon. Members will agree that young people are particularly vulnerable in prisons and universities. There is evidently a serious problem in prisons, where hardened, violent extremists clearly attempt to recruit Muslim and non-Muslim criminals who are searching for identity, purpose and meaning in their lives. Such prisoners are unlikely always to give time to the prison imams. What concrete steps are the Government taking to prevent prisons from effectively becoming universities of extremism, as the H-blocks did in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08062578000033">On universities, I can do no better than quote my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), who asked in a debate last year:</p>

In other words, why is the man who is charged with checking extremism on Britain&#146;s campuses in fact linked with a body that was set up by a separatist Islamist organisation?&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 17 April 2007; Vol. 459, c. 43WH.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08062578000035">On the police, how do the Government intend to ensure that the Pursue strand, which is largely the property of police anti-terrorism branches, does not undermine or overwhelm the Prevent strand, which is largely the property of local police? How will the two be co-ordinated?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para22"><a name="08062578000036">I want now to turn from those detailed questions to the bigger picture. On the Prevent strand, there are two views of what the Government&#146;s strategy should be. The first holds that they should build a broad coalition against violent extremism&#151;in effect, violent extremism in Britain&#151;and, therefore, against al-Qaeda and other violent groups, such as elements on the neo-Nazi fringe. The second view holds that they should build a broad coalition against extremism per se, on the ground that extremism is the root from which violent extremism grows. According to this view, British National party hatred of black, Asian and gay people today becomes the attack on the &#147;Admiral Duncan&#148; pub tomorrow. Similarly, detestation of the kuffar, or non-Muslim, today&#151;a view that is fired by a narrow, exclusivist, hate-filled reading of Islam&#146;s sacred texts, and which is looked on with horror by mainstream Muslims&#151;can become the 7/7 terror attack of tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="80625h0001.htm_para23"><a name="08062578000037">How can extremism be defined? Admittedly, that is a difficult task, but page 60 of the Government&#146;s strategy document gives an indication by listing some of the engagement criteria for organisations. However, the criteria are rather vague and should be clarified. One definer of extremism might be support for attacks on our troops in Iraq or Afghanistan. Another might be campaigning for the establishment of separate sharia jurisdictions under British law. Yet another might be the incitement of violence against women, gay people or non-Muslims.</p>

He has called for the banning of Hizb ut-Tahrir and the barring from Britain of Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi&#151;a lead that the Government eventually followed. He has also called for us to prevent public money and support from flowing to bodies such as the Cordoba Foundation and the Muslim Brotherhood. My noble Friend Baroness Neville-Jones made a similar critique in her report &#147;Uniting the Country&#148;. My noble Friend Baroness Warsi noted that partnership arrangements with special interest groups are wrong, partly because</p>
<a name="80625h0001.htm_brev7"><a name="08062578000039"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;some such groups often hold ambiguous views on cohesion and integration.&#148;</p>

When questioned only a few moments before condemning the Cordoba Foundation in the quotation that I have just cited, however, the Secretary of State failed to comment on the presence of the MAB on the mosques and imams advisory committee.

The Campusalam initiative was specifically established to combat extremism on campus. Yet at least one speaker at its first event had close links with the Muslim Brotherhood. Campusalam comes from the stable of the Lokahi Foundation, which has received roughly &#163;450,000 from the Government and a similar amount from the Greater London authority. The foundation&#146;s director, Professor Gwen Griffith-Dickson, has complained that, under present policy,</p>

help, as the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) indicated. Different people give different explanations. To some, the cause is poverty and discrimination. To others, it is foreign policy. To others still, it is generational tensions between older people who came to Britain, often from the Indian subcontinent, and their younger, British-born children and grandchildren. To others still, it is the separatist ideology of al-Qaeda and other movements, which distorts the Islamic concept of jihad and seeks the establishment of a worldwide caliphate. I believe that all those factors play a part and it would be wrong to exclude any of them. Some people of course go further and argue that Islam itself is the cause of terror and extremism, and an obstacle to integration and cohesion. My view is precisely the opposite. There is not too much mainstream Islam in Britain today: rather, in relation to the problems that we are exploring, there is often too little. I believe that building further support for mainstream Islam within our Muslim communities is a key part of defeating terror and extremism and advancing integration and cohesion. I shall explain why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000052">As my Muslim friends and contacts point out&#151;and I should, on a cautionary note, say that I am of course not a Muslim myself, so I speak with some hesitation on such matters&#151;a key institution in preventing extremism and building moderation is the mosque. However, in many mosques the language of worship and of the Friday khutbah hails from the subcontinent or elsewhere abroad. Often, younger people and women have little place in the institutional life of the mosque. Children, meanwhile, are taught to recite the Koran, but not necessarily to understand its meaning and explore wider Islamic teaching, history, spirituality and culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para2"><a name="08062578000053">There are of course many exceptions. I am thinking of the Karima al-Marwaziyya Foundation in my constituency, in which young people participate actively, and which is linked to Wycombe Islamic mission; but my friends and contacts ask, if some young people have dropped out of the mosque, perhaps because it does not meet all their needs, are not they especially vulnerable to al-Qaeda and others who distort the sacred texts of Islam for their own fanatical purposes? They go on to say that al-Qaeda&#146;s attention is concentrated at least as much on Muslims as on non-Muslims, and that one of its strategic aims is to groom young Muslims for extremism and terrorism, and thereby to undermine mainstream Muslim leadership in Britain and elsewhere.</p>

 Is not one of the fundamental problems that, for whatever reason, lots of Muslims just do not feel British? There are other communities in this country&#151;for example, a well-established Sikh community in Kettering&#151;who feel extremely British, with no hatred at all towards the British state. Yet the extremism in some Muslim communities extends to hatred of the British state, even though many of those Muslims have been here for many years. Why is that?</p>

is a matter of, for example, what the Government do about national holidays. I do not have time to explore that aspect of the issue this morning. I want to return to the function of the mosque in building resilience against violent extremism; perhaps at some future date my hon. Friend and I and others will get the chance to debate the issue that he has raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000056">I do not of course have the time to explore all the contributory factors to extremism and the obstacles to integration and cohesion that I cited a few moments ago. I do, however, want to float a few ideas, largely in relation to helping further to build the capacity of Islamic religious institutions, precisely in order to forestall the extremist drive to win the hearts and minds of the next generation of Muslims and the ownership of Islam itself. The Government&#146;s main means of assisting the Islamic religious institutions remains the Preventing Violent Extremism scheme. We have to recognise that it is extremely problematic to target taxpayers&#146; money at one religious community. Some non-Muslims, and in my experience particularly some black church groups, say for that reason that the scheme is unfair. At the same time, some Muslims, particularly many young Muslims, say that the branding of the scheme is offensive. Why, they argue, are they uniquely singled out? Furthermore, there is no evidence as yet that the programme as a whole is preventing violent extremism, despite the admirable schemes to which I referred in my introductory remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para4"><a name="08062578000057">In our view, Ministers should allow local councils more discretion in the use of the fund for other community cohesion purposes. Since the targeting of taxpayers&#146; money at one religious group is always problematic, should not Ministers be looking more closely at utilising the energy, flair and dynamism of the private, independent and voluntary sectors? After all, there must be, on the one hand, many rich, charitably inclined, mainstream Muslim potential donors; and there are certainly, on the other hand, many mosques seeking to improve their capacity. It is surely not beyond the wit of Government to link one to the other. Can Ministers further encourage their contacts to donate to suitable charities or foundations, which would in turn grant funds to, say, a mosque seeking to pay a well qualified, English-speaking Imam the kind of salary that would not only attract him to the job but keep him in it; or to an education project that brings pupils from different schools and religions together; or to a madrassah curriculum for children that seeks, as some now do, to demonstrate an Islamic basis for our common way of life?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para5"><a name="08062578000058">Moving on, extremists are clearly adept at constructing a grand narrative of conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims by the manipulation of Islamic texts, and at running bookshops on site or online with books, tapes, DVDs, films and lectures that hammer out simple and repetitious propaganda messages of confrontation, hatred and anger. Is there more that Ministers can do to encourage mainstream Islamic publishers to offer clear, simple and Islam-based material, in plain English, that rebuts extremist claims and that advances the case for shared values and our common democracy? Can they also encourage, in relation to the grand narrative itself, the many mainstream Islamic scholars in our universities and elsewhere to help construct a counter-narrative of modern British Islam that would marry Islamic teaching and western democracy and give shape and force to that  <br>

more simple material? I believe that some scholars are in fact already helping to construct that counter-narrative in their everyday scholarly work. However, there must be more that Ministers can do give such a project impetus. I have previously floated the idea of a privately funded institute of British Islam. I am interested to see that the Government&#146;s strategy document refers on page 4 to</p>
<a name="80625h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="08062578000476"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the establishment of a board of leading Muslim scholars&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para6"><a name="08062578000059">which seems to be a thought along much the same lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para7"><a name="08062578000060">The terror threat is clearly serious, the scope of counter-terror is clearly vast, and I do not have time to explore all the issues involved, such as the &#147;prestige gap&#148; arising from the relative economic underdevelopment of many Muslim majority countries. In conclusion, however, there is perhaps more reason&#151;I say that, again, with some hesitation&#151;to be optimistic about the long-term prospects in Britain than there was in the wake of 7/7. I do not propose to make judgments about all the issues arising from the Ramadan controversy, the defection of Maajid Nawaz from Hizb ut-Tahrir, Ed Husain&#146;s &#147;The Islamist&#148;, and the emergence of such relatively new groups as Muslims for Secular Democracy, the City Circle and the Quilliam Foundation. However, those developments are all unquestionable indications that contemporary debate within British Islam is lively, and that the overwhelming majority of British people, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, are united against terror and extremism. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

 It has been a pleasure to listen to my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) give us a lesson on the Prevent arm of the Contest strategy. It is always a challenge for someone such as me to pick through all the many groups that the Muslim community either takes some learning from or is in dispute with, so I will look back at <i>Hansard </i>and use his speech as a reference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08062578000063">I shall not prolong my speech; I simply want to raise some of my concerns about the Government&#146;s counter-terrorism strategy and some of the issues that have presented themselves to me over the last three years as I have made contact and visited certain locations involved in it. It is right to remind the Chamber that the Contest strategy consists of Prevent, Pursue, Protect and Prepare. We have heard my hon. Friend speak eloquently about the elements of Prevent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08062578000064">To follow on from that, I have some concerns about the Prevent strategy and how we are funding some initiatives from the centre. In counter-terrorism, it is easy to focus on areas where we are vulnerable to attack rather than the areas of growth of the terrorists. For example, large amounts of the money earmarked for the expansion of the counter-terrorism branch functions of Prevent go to Manchester rather than to Lancashire, where my constituency is. Anyone who looks at the mapping of the Muslim communities in the north-west will see that that is the wrong way round. I recognise that Manchester has a bigger population, but prevention may need to occur a long way off from the point or place of attack, as was all too obvious on 7/7.</p>

I was horrified about 18 months ago when university lecturers refused to participate in the Government&#146;s much-needed and welcome call to map and keep an eye on students and the activities of some radical groups on campus. It is incredibly important that they play a role. It is not politics&#151;Marxist, old-fashioned 1960s anti-state politics. It is important, and it is the role of a good teacher or lecturer to have concern for their class. That is all that the Government were asking them to participate in. I hope that they reconsider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08062578000066">I want to focus more on the Pursue strand, highlighting some of the challenges. I have no real problem with the Government&#146;s efforts in that area. I think that the regional hubs have been a success. It is not a new model, of course; it goes back to the tasking and co-ordinating groups in Northern Ireland. The hubs have helped to eliminate the traditional budgetary arguments and fighting over territory, and have ensured that tasks are carried out with priority, no matter who is effectively in the lead. That is a success, and I hope that it grows and gets the results that we should all expect from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para12"><a name="08062578000067">One of the real challenges for the special branch departments in each police force&#151;I think that they have been renamed counter-terrorism branches&#151;is the huge amount of intelligence that they now have to map on communities. Before 2001, there was effectively no mapping of those communities and individuals or ranking of individuals by how much of a threat they were or were likely to be, or perhaps by whether they would play a role in radicalisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08062578000068">When I first took over an intelligence cell in Northern Ireland, we had 20 years of intelligence stacked up in computers and files.

That point is important and not to be underestimated, because it is how we can allow for a long legacy in counter-terrorism.

security services want something done&#151;searches, arrests or surveillance&#151;they go to their local branch and use the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para16"><a name="08062578000073">We may be moving piece by piece towards having an FBI, and I make no secret of the fact that I sometimes think that that might be a better model, but we should keep an eye on that interface and never forget that the security services are not an executive body but an intelligence analysis body.

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para17"><a name="08062578000074">The Government should always be on the lookout for new offences. I find it amazing that people are known of in this country whose job is to recruit young men to go and fight abroad in Islamic jihads around the globe. What came out in the inquiry after 7/7 was the fact that some people were discarded not because they were not terrorist threats, but because they were not recruiting in relation to Britain. I remember that one individual had been involved in recruiting people to go and train in camps. Surely that should be an offence in this country. We should be considering ways to cut off the activities of such individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08062578000075">I still have concerns about some of the other strands, such as Protect. I am not sure that we have done enough in our infrastructure&#151;for example, radios in the London underground and detection of the use of chemicals in certain vulnerable zones. Four or five years ago, the United States had already bought detection for the New York subway&#151;off the shelf, from a British company&#151;and had funded a lot of work on detecting suicide bombers. We are not there yet, and we should be at the forefront, given our experiences. We must keep an eye on that. It perhaps needs better examination by one of the Select Committees involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para19"><a name="08062578000076">It is easy to forget lessons learned. There is a saying in the armed forces that generals delight in writing books about lessons learned. Of course, writing books about lessons unlearned would be physically impossible, as there is so much material and history. Time and again, Ministers say, &#147;This is not the IRA. This is al-Qaeda. It&#146;s a new terrorism,&#148; almost as though that sometimes excuses the lessons that we have learned, but there are plenty of similarities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08062578000077">The two are not the same. I do not pretend that their aims are the same or that some of the individuals are the same, but vulnerabilities in counter-terrorism or counter-insurgency are fixed principles that do not change through history. People are vulnerable, whether they are religious fanatics or not. They might be loners, need money or be jealous. Those are all things&#151;the same things&#151;that attract people to being recruited as informers and they do not change. When the state gets its balance wrong and takes shortcuts on terrorism, as with the 42 days, it can damage the resources that have been so good in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="80625h0002.htm_para21"><a name="08062578000078">We should not forget that the IRA used to have more anger than capability. It was good at being angry in the &#146;50s, &#146;60s and early &#146;70s; it was not very good at terrorism. The first time IRA members fired an RPG-7, they fired it from inside a Mini, managing to kill themselves and miss the target. They could not make explosives. Then they stopped, went to university and developed their engineering skills. They changed anger into skills and the IRA became a very effective terrorist organisation.</p>

We must not forget the lessons we have learned, nor think that, because those people are new terrorists, they do not have the same vulnerabilities. All terrorists survive in their communities. If the community does not want them&#151;if it disagrees, wants to expose them and wants them out&#151;and if the Government are prepared to recognise legitimate grievances, if there are any, and to take the right steps, perhaps towards making people feel more British or more involved, we can begin the proper process of counter-terrorism.</p>

In reality, however, we must be more resilient, because we will not always prevent the plots and people will not always survive&#151;terrorist attacks will kill people.

I had that sense of d&#233;j  vu because I was reminded of probably the most intelligent academic I have ever met&#151;a lady called Dr. Franoise Thom, who is a senior lecturer at the Sorbonne. In the days of the Soviet Union, she was a very prominent Sovietologist, and it was a real pleasure to listen to her talking about Marxism and debating communism with Marxists and communists, because she knew far more about the doctrines than the militants who professed to follow them. The same might well apply to my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000087">I put this proposal to the House: the battleground with which we are concerned is the community, the technique used by our enemies is ju-jitsu and the currency of the conflict is ideology. I want to say a word or two about each of those strands. First, the message that the battleground is the community came through loud and clear in the first two speeches. In this conflict, we have the same situation as we had in previous conflicts with militants&#151;namely, in a given community where an attempt is being made to stir up subversion or even insurgency, there is a militant minority and a moderate majority. If we ever reach the point of thinking that we do not have a moderate majority in the Muslim community in this country, we have already lost the battle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para2"><a name="08062578000088">I am sometimes rather worried by some of the messages that we get from people who are well qualified to talk about the issues because they have lived them. In particular, I recall a meeting in the House at which a very brave lady called Ayaan Hirsi Ali addressed MPs who were interested in the subject of her experiences with Islam. Of course, after all that she has suffered&#151;she was persecuted and received death threats in the Netherlands, where she spent much of her life, although she now leads an existence that she well deserves in the relative safety of the United States&#151;it is not surprising that she takes a very jaundiced view of the religion into which she was born.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000089">Nevertheless, I was seriously worried by Ayaan Hirsi Ali&#146;s main message, which seemed to be that the logical consequence of being a Muslim is to be a fundamentalist extremist. I do not accept that any more than I accept that the logical consequence of being Jewish or a Christian is to be a violent extremist. Yet we need only roll back time a few hundred years to see &#147;Christians&#148; burning heretics at the stake, usually because of some relatively obscure doctrinal difference of interpretation of the religion of the day. I believe that there are continuities here, which we ignore at our peril. The main continuity is that this is a classic case of fanatics and militants trying to hijack moderate majorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para4"><a name="08062578000090">I ask those who are old enough to cast their mind back and remember what they read about the Third Reich and what some of us, at any rate, experienced during the cold war. Essentially, there is a continuity: Nazism was about the superiority of one race, Marxism and communism were about the superiority of one class, and what is called Islamism&#151;I shall address that  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="25 Jun 2008">

terminology in a moment&#151;is about the superiority of one religion. Essentially, however, they have one thing in common, which is that the fanatic at the top of those respective movements possessed the one holy grail and the one true doctrine, and that anybody who stands against that, or even criticises it, deserves to be exterminated without mercy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para5"><a name="08062578000091">That continuity has traditionally been met by mobilising the silent majority&#151;an overworked, but nevertheless accurate term&#151;against the militant minority to isolate those people from the majority and so that they can be spat out and neutralised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para6"><a name="08062578000092">I said that the technique&#151;the second strand&#151;is ju-jitsu. The militant minority use that technique to try to polarise as much of the majority on its side as possible, so that when the minority does outrageous things, it does so not only to hurt the wider non-Muslim community, but to try to make that community hate the Muslim community. We fall into that very trap when we overreact to militant outrages by taking it out on the moderate majority and the people in the Muslim community who have nothing to do with those outrages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para7"><a name="08062578000093">How many members are there of the Muslim community in the United Kingdom today? At the very least, there are 1.6 million&#151;that is the figure that I often hear, and it may well be larger&#151;yet the number who have been engaged in outrages, either carried out or all those that have been frustrated, on which we congratulate the police and the security services, is 0.000001 of 1 per cent. of the community. If that statistic does not suggest that engaging in outrages is in part a desperate attempt to try to make us overreact against the moderate majority, thus making those people feel more resentful and therefore more vulnerable to recruitment, I do not know what does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para8"><a name="08062578000094">The third strand&#151;the currency&#151;is ideology. Indeed, the battleground on which the day must be won has to be a counter-ideological offensive, which is where the work of the counter-propagandist comes in. My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe referred to some of the organisations that are beginning to speak out, at last, in favour of moderate interpretations of the Muslim faith, showing that those people who seek to promote what is called violent extremism are distorting that faith.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para9"><a name="08062578000095">There is nothing so valuable in an ideological struggle as people from the target community speaking out against and denouncing, from their direct knowledge of the issues at stake, the misinterpretations by the militants. Who was more effective against communism than the disillusioned Marxists who broke with it and realised its fundamental evil? I pay tribute to those people who were involved in militant so-called Islamic or Islamist groups but who have turned against them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para10"><a name="08062578000096">One aspect of fighting that battle is that we have to be very careful and, indeed, selective about the language that we use to describe it. I sometimes give as an example the attempt that has been made to distinguish between Islamic and Islamist ideology. It is a worthy attempt to try to draw a distinction and say, &#147;When we are talking about Islamism or Islamist extremism, we are not really getting at you, the moderate majority of Islamic Muslim people.&#148; Frankly, that is to make a distinction without a difference. Instead, I ask people to think of the following imaginary parallel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08062578000097">Let us turn the clock back to when there was an upsurge of terrorism in Palestine directed against the  <br>

British Army by organisations such as the Stern gang. If the Government of the day had made a great effort to denounce what they called &#147;Jewish terrorism&#148;, referring to those attacks on British servicemen in Palestine, which was still under mandate, members of the Jewish community in Britain would have felt somewhat defensive, even though they almost overwhelmingly did not support the attacks on UK servicemen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para12"><a name="08062578000098">Would it have made much difference if the Government of the day had said, &#147;Okay, we&#146;ll take care of this by calling it not Jewish extremism or Jewish militancy or Jewish violence, but Jewist violence.&#148;? It would not have been terribly reassuring to the Jewish community in Britain in those days or in that context. Similarly, it is not terribly reassuring to the moderate Muslim community in Britain today to be told that the issue is all about Islamism or Islamist extremism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para13"><a name="08062578000099">I have suggested that we should put our mouth, as it were, where our belief is. Our belief is that such extremism is a distortion and a misinterpretation of the Muslim faith, and indeed, if it is, we ought to say so in the way that we describe it. I believe that the correct way to describe what is going on is un-Islamic extremism. I have suggested that in the past, and I have been quite gratified to see some of the reactions on the internet from various Muslim organisations. They can see that to call something un-Islamic, if that something is being done in an attempt to hijack the Muslim religion, is not in any way insulting to the moderate majority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para14"><a name="08062578000100">We are concerned about preventing an appeal from an extreme interpretation, or misinterpretation, of a great religion from going out to individuals who can be recruited, and who do not need to be recruited in anything other than small numbers, to carry out violent atrocities in this country in the hope of polarising the non-Muslim and Muslim communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para15"><a name="08062578000101">One feature of the people who are recruited is that often they have terrifically low self-esteem and have made a mess of their lives. They are then targeted and given a purpose, a role to follow and a belief that, having been the dregs of society, the outcasts, the criminals or the drug takers, they can suddenly become holy warriors and experience a form of redemption by carrying out some act in the name of something larger than themselves. Totalitarians have played off the vulnerabilities of people with low self-esteem for generations. They did it as Nazis, they did it as communists and now they are doing it as un-Islamic extremists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para16"><a name="08062578000102">One role of the counter-propaganda campaign that we need to promote is setting out positive role models for Muslims in our society. We should be proud of the role that Muslims play in our society and make it absolutely clear that when moderate Muslims wish to stand up against militants, they will have the support of the entire spectrum of British society in that all-important struggle.</p>

debate their professional background. It is an all-party, consensual matter, so it is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), and I congratulate him on securing the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para17"><a name="08062578000104">I was interested in the reference that the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) made to ju-jitsu. When I was living in Hackney about 20 years ago, I thought that I should take it up as a sport, but I very soon came to the conclusion that the person who was at greatest risk was me. I was more likely to get a broken arm or nose inflicted during training than to learn how to protect myself, and perhaps that is a lesson for those who seek to adopt such an approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08062578000105">To get to the meat of the matter, the Government&#146;s clear view, which we support, is that the principal current terrorist threat is from radicalised individuals who use a distorted and unrepresentative version of the un-Islamic&#151;I mean of the Islamic faith. I made a Freudian slip there, but as was said, the threat is very un-Islamic and we should perhaps treat it that way, rather than describe it in another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para19"><a name="08062578000106">We also concur with the Government&#146;s view that the current threat from terrorism is serious and sustained. That is the reason why the monitor in Westminster Hall today shows that we are at a &#147;severe&#148; level in terms of the risk in Parliament. However, we need to look at whether the Government&#146;s Contest programme, which other hon. Members have referred to, is up to the task of addressing this issue. I must say that as I was reading my notes on the train this morning I thought that one aspect of tackling this issue that had perhaps not been covered was being a little more careful with secret documents on trains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para20"><a name="08062578000107">I would like to look at the four aspects of the Government&#146;s programme, focusing principally on the Prevent aspect, which is about tackling the radicalisation of individuals, both in the UK and elsewhere. It would perhaps have been appropriate for there to have been a little nod&#151;only a little one&#151;towards the role that foreign policy can play in preventing terrorism and radicalisation. However, foreign policy is not referred to in the &#147;Preventing Violent Extremism: A Strategy for Delivery&#148; document; it may be that there are references to it in other Foreign and Commonwealth Office documents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para21"><a name="08062578000108">The Prevent strategy is also about tackling disadvantage and supporting reform; deterring those who facilitate terrorism by changing the environment and engaging in the battle of ideas, which hon. Members have referred to on a number of occasions so far; and providing the resources to ensure that this strategy can be delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para22"><a name="08062578000109">It is worth highlighting that the &#147;'Preventing Violent Extremism: A Strategy for Delivery&#148; document advocates a support and prevention agenda, which is very much the &#147;carrot&#148; side of policy. However, the majority of the time that we spend in the House on this matter is much more about the &#147;stick&#148; side of policy&#151;the 28 days versus 42 days argument, for example. So this debate is very welcome in focusing more on the &#147;carrot&#148; side, rather than on the very high-profile &#147;stick&#148; approach that we have seen in relation to the argument about 28 or 42 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08062578000110">The Prevent strategy also refers to societal or social exclusion and routes into radicalisation, but it talks almost exclusively about Muslim communities as separate,  <br>

insular entities. Can the Minister confirm that that is not the case and that Islamophobia plays a part in radicalisation? If so, should the Prevent strategy not also address the views and beliefs of the wider community and their understanding of Islam?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para24"><a name="08062578000111">I do not want to disrespect the very good community projects that are taking place, and clearly a lot of positive work is being done. Regrettably, however, that work does not seem to feed through into the national media in raising awareness of what is happening. That is not entirely the Government&#146;s fault; the media need to pick up on those issues, because it seems that they have not wanted to focus on them particularly. That is regrettable. Page 9 of the Government&#146;s document highlights the fact that</p>
<a name="80625h0003.htm_brev0"><a name="08062578000477"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;communications are of critical importance, to ensure that the way in which we communicate counters, rather than fuels, the terrorist narrative.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para25"><a name="08062578000112">We need to get those good news messages out into the media, so that people understand what is being done in a very positive way through these different community projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para26"><a name="08093054000001">On prevention, the Government are rightly focusing on prison imams and how they can address radicalisation within the prison population. However, I hope that the Minister can say something about what is being done to identify individuals going into prison who may already be radical, and whether there is a way of addressing radicalisation through that route rather than trying, possibly after the event, to halt radicalisation through prison imams, as far as they can do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para27"><a name="08062578000113">I will briefly move on to the Pursue strategy, which is about gathering intelligence and, of course, bringing terrorists to justice through prosecution&#151;an issue that we discussed at great length during our deliberations on the Counter-Terrorism Bill. Some very positive measures will come through from that Bill regarding intercept evidence and post-charge questioning, which should assist in the process of bringing terrorists to justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para28"><a name="08062578000114">There is a role for the seizing and freezing of assets, but we would all acknowledge that the amount of funding needed for home-grown terrorism is neither here nor there. The freezing of assets is not of great importance if we are talking about the purchase of large quantities of very cheap products, such as fertilisers, and the fact is that very little is needed to support that sort of network within the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para29"><a name="08062578000115">The Protect strand is about reducing the vulnerability of the UK and UK interests overseas to a terrorist attack, and specifically strengthening border security. I am sure that the Minister is aware of Lord Carlile&#146;s report, particularly what it has to say about general aviation, and the Association of Chief Police Officers&#146; proposal for a border force. I understand that the latter issue will be addressed in the Green Paper on police reform, which I assume will come out this week; it is coming out in June, so if it is not available this week it will be early next week. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that when he responds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para30"><a name="08062578000116">I also ask the Minister to respond to what Lord Carlile had to say about general aviation. The Government have said in the Department for Transport response that they are looking at the potential threat from light aircraft, and that EU discussions are also under way. Can the Minister update us on the time scale for that EU review, so that we can see whether it will address  <br>

this issue within an appropriate time frame? If he cannot update us now, perhaps he could do so in writing later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para31"><a name="08062578000117">I also hope that the Minister can give us some sort of reaction, if only his personal response, to the proposal from ACPO for a single border police force. I know that that issue will be covered in the Green Paper, but it would be interesting to hear whether he favours that idea and, if so, where he thinks the 3,000 staff for that force would come from and how it would ensure proper co-ordination with other forces and with the UK Border Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para32"><a name="08062578000118">In the Protect strand, protecting key utilities is one of the central roles. I hope that the Minister can say something about any discussions that have taken place with the utility companies since the most recent incident on 27 May, when two power stations went down and it seemed that the rest of the grid could have gone down with them. If mechanical problems can cause the grid nearly to fail in peacetime, there is clearly a need for the Government to look carefully at what might happen if there were a terrorist threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="80625h0003.htm_para33"><a name="08062578000119">Finally, the Prepare strand shows that the Government are working hard on preparing for the consequences of a terrorist attack, ensuring that we train appropriately and know how to respond.</p>

The different strands&#151;Prevent, Pursue, Protect and Prepare&#151;are central to that battle. We support this programme but we hope that, as a critical friend, we can be in a position to improve it, and I hope that the Minister will accept my comments in that vein.</p>

 I am particularly pleased that this debate has been held. First, we have had the opportunity to listen to a magisterial analysis from my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman). The debate highlighted the fact that the Conservative party has an interest and a real professional understanding of this complex issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace) gave us a contribution that drew upon his professional experience and reminded us that there are no quick fixes; in this area, the work must be patient, careful and for the long term. The other distinctive contribution, which was based on a great deal of knowledge, came from my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para0"><a name="08062578000124">On Channel, we need some answers to the questions that my hon. Friend tabled in March, including, among others, those about how individuals&#146; interests will be protected against loose gossip and grudge settling. We heard about the vulnerability of those in prisons and universities, and in particular about a virtual caliphate. Will the Minister tell us how many prosecutions&#151;this is on the enforcement side&#151;of extremist website uploaders or providers have actually taken place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000125">Finally, from my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution, we need to know much more about the Government&#146;s response to preventing violent extremism in education institutions and mosques. How can the moderate side of Islam, if I can put it that way, be disseminated more simply and effectively? My hon. Friend made a point about more intelligent and moderate discourse in our universities and gave the example of how we might be able to fund an institute of British Islam that would provide a bridge between modern western democratic tradition and the moderate Islamic tradition, and how that could be encouraged in practical terms and made stronger by Her Majesty&#146;s Government, because it will not happen on its own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para2"><a name="08062578000126">I would like to flag up a question on the Prevent strategy that has not been raised. It is about measurement. Obviously, the strategy is well intentioned, but widely reported in newspaper articles in autumn 2006 were comments allegedly from the then head of MI5 that there were 1,200 people who posed a terrorist risk to the state. By November 2007, it was being reported that the figure had grown to around 2,000, and there was a warning that the number of potential terrorists living in this country could run up to about 4,000. If those figures are correct, it does not seem that the Prevent strategy to challenge the growth of radicalisation is being terribly effective. Could the Minister comment on those numbers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000127">On the Pursue strategy, I have one simple question about intercept evidence. There is, of course, some limited use of such evidence in control order and deportation cases, but the Opposition have prosecuted a strong argument that its use in court would reduce the pressure for longer pre-charge detention in terrorist cases. Can the Minister rapidly give us the Department&#146;s latest thinking on our proposal on intercept evidence? Where are we on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para4"><a name="08062578000128">I would like to close by touching on another counter-terrorism issue that I believe is important to the public. Are the Government doing enough to deny entry to those whose presence in this country is not in any way conducive to the public good because of their extremist views and preaching of violence? I have in mind what looked like dithering by the Government at the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008 over al-Qaradawi entering the country and the failure in 2007 to stop al-Moussawi from visiting the UK and attending a speaking tour at the beginning of 2008. The Government are unable to get a strong message across to the British public that they will act effectively and decisively to stop such people coming across our borders. We need to hear more about that. Those cases are symbolic. When extremists preaching violence and hatred come into our country, the question the man and woman on the street will ask is why the Government are not doing something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para5"><a name="08062578000129">For all those reasons, we have had a terrific debate. The contributions have been based on a great deal of experience. There were proper contributions from the Opposition but we did not hear anything from Labour Members, which was surprising and disappointing. We have put many questions to the Minister in a spirit of consensus, and I know that he will do his best to answer them.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. I apologise on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, who normally deals with these matters. Unfortunately for the purpose of this debate, he is giving evidence to a House of Lords Committee on the impact of surveillance and data protection. I hope that those who spoke will understand that his absence is not meant as disrespect to anyone. Clearly, this is an extremely important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para6"><a name="08062578000131">I sincerely and very much agree with the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) who commented, as did the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)&#151;the three of us are speaking from Front-Bench positions for our respective parties&#151;on the quality of the debate. I reassure hon. Members that although this is not my area of responsibility, I have been extremely interested in the points that have been made and will ensure that my right hon. Friend reflects on the debate. I will personally discuss with him some of the issues that have been raised. I also agree with the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington who said that often in Westminster Hall we discuss issues and sometimes&#151;not always, but sometimes&#151;get to the core of the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para7"><a name="08062578000132">In saying that, I particularly praise the excellent contribution of the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman). I know how much he works in his constituency on these matters. As he pointed out, he has a significant Muslim community in his constituency. He should be given a great deal of credit for the way in which he tries to learn from that experience and not only represent his own constituents but put matters into the national context and try to influence the debate nationally. As he made clear in his remarks, he has to influence the national debate to serve his own constituents. I agree with his colleagues that it was an excellent contribution, and he is to be congratulated on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para8"><a name="08062578000133">I hope that hon. Members will allow me to make a few general points before I come to some of the specific questions. I have about 600 notes on important points. I will endeavour to deal with some of them in the time that I have left, but, as I promised the hon. Gentleman outside this debate, I will write to him on points that I do not manage to cover. If he agrees, it may be helpful if I provide copies of that information to other Members who contributed to the debate&#151;I hope that that will meet with their satisfaction&#151;and, perhaps, to you, Mrs. Dean, as the Chairman of our proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para9"><a name="08062578000134">Unfortunately, the threat to the UK from international terrorism remains serious and sustained, and the current level is severe. The police, Security Service and intelligence agencies continue to work hard to protect the British people from terrorist attack, and we are grateful to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para10"><a name="08062578000135">The numbers of terrorist cases coming before the courts give an indication of the scale and nature of the threat that we are facing. In 2007, 36 people were convicted in 14 significant terrorism cases, with 21 of those individuals pleading guilty. So far this year, 31 people have been convicted in nine significant terrorist cases. Of those 31, 11 individuals have pleaded guilty. Over the next 18 months, terrorism cases will come before the courts on all but a few days. Faced with that serious and evolving threat, it is the Government&#146;s responsibility to protect the public and our national security, always seeking to find the right balance between individual freedom and collective security. As the Home Secretary said recently, there is no contradiction between pursuing our counter-terrorism objectives and defending our freedoms and civil liberties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para11"><a name="08062578000136">Terrorism is an assault on everyone&#146;s civil liberties, whatever community we are from, and an assault on our democracy and our values. Our response, therefore, must continue to be based on these values and liberties, as the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) said, and must ardently be pursued through our democratic framework&#151;primarily, our criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para12"><a name="08062578000137">Since 2003, the Government&#146;s counter-terrorism response has been governed by the Contest strategy, which aims to</p>
<a name="80625h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08062578000478"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;reduce the risk from international terrorism, so that people can go about their daily lives freely and with confidence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para13"><a name="08062578000138">Both of those aspects are important. The Contest counter-terrorist strategy, for which the Home Secretary is responsible, is divided into four strands: Pursue, which is about stopping terrorist attacks; Protect, which is about strengthening our protection against attack; Prepare, which is to do with mitigating the impact of attacks; and Prevent, which means stopping people becoming involved with or supporting violent extremism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para14"><a name="08062578000139">A major area of work since 2007 has been the refreshing of our Prevent strategy. The new Prevent delivery plan, launched by the Home Secretary with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government on 3 June this year, has five key objectives: first, undermining extremist ideology and supporting mainstream voices; secondly, disrupting those who promote violent extremism and strengthening vulnerable institutions; thirdly, supporting individuals who are vulnerable to recruitment by violent extremists and creating mechanisms for supporting them; fourthly, increasing the resilience of communities to engage with and resist violent extremists; and fifthly, effectively addressing grievances, whether real or perceived.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para15"><a name="08062578000140">This morning&#146;s debate is important, as a number of hon. Members have said, because it gives us the opportunity to look at the Prevent side, as the hon. Member for Wycombe did in his speech, rather than debating some of the other aspects, as we have done over the past few weeks, important though that is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para16"><a name="08062578000141">I agree with the point that the hon. Member for Wycombe made. I hope that other hon. Members will bear with me while I try to answer some of the points made by the hon. Gentleman. The function of the mosque is crucial. We need to support mainstream Islamic opinion. I support some of his ideas, which are consistent with some points that the Government are making about working with Muslim scholars on these issues. As he said, we are looking to establish a United Kingdom board of Islamic scholars and to work with them to see what we can do to combat violent extremism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para17"><a name="08062578000142">I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need to support communities. The Government have, as he knows, committed &#163;45 million over the next three years through the Preventing Violent Extremism programme, the money being given through the DCLG. However, let us be clear that this is difficult territory. If we are to win the battle for hearts and minds, there will have to be robust debate and engagement. Of course, we have to ensure that we do not inadvertently support or fund the wrong people, individuals or groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para18"><a name="08062578000143">We have a robust procedure. We try to ensure that the police are involved in determining where money goes&#151;whether to individuals or groups&#151;but let us be clear that to win this debate we have to support mainstream Islamic opinion and we must be confident that we can win the battle for hearts and minds. As the hon. Member for New Forest, East said, we have to show the distortion of the truth of the Islamic faith and we need to expose that. Judgments are involved in doing that, so we need to try to ensure that robust procedures are in place and the best judgments are made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08062578000144">On the success of the strategy, this year we have agreed for the first time a public service agreement, led by the office for security and counter-terrorism in the Home Office and submitted to the Chief Secretary of the Treasury on 3 April. The reporting period began on 1 April, including measurements, targets and metrics for all strands in the prevent strategy. That should help us. Again, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds made that point. We have a specific PSA target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para20"><a name="08062578000145">In answer to a question asked by the hon. Members for Wycombe, for Bury St. Edmunds and for Carshalton and Wallington, the Home Office is the lead Department and the Home Secretary is the lead Minister. The director general of the office for security and counter-terrorism within the Home Office is the senior responsible official. I hope that that clarifies things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para21"><a name="08062578000146">I assure hon. Members that parliamentary questions will be answered much more quickly. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing has apologised to the hon. Member for Wycombe about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para22"><a name="08062578000147">Work is being done in prisons. Some &#163;6 million has been provided this year for a programme to prevent radicalisation and manage risk in prisons. We are looking to expand that programme into probation. That is important. All prison chaplains are vetted and trained, regardless of their faiths. Again, we are trying to take measures in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para23"><a name="08062578000148">I think that the hon. Member for Wycombe mentioned national indicator 35 on building resilience to violent extremism in communities. He will know that local area agreement negotiations about whether local authorities include NI35 are ongoing. The indication so far is that a substantial number of authorities are taking up NI35 and we are encouraged by that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para24"><a name="08062578000149">The hon. Gentleman raised concerns about the Channel project. We are trying to ensure that, when we try to identify at-risk individuals, we involve not only the police, but all the agencies, including the faith organisations, local people and all types of community organisations. The whole purpose of that project, as he knows, is to try to prevent individuals from slipping into extremism&#151;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I am sorry, Mrs. Dean. I have just received  <br>

I agree with the points that hon. Members made about the need to ensure that we tackle extremism in universities. The police are involved in discussions with universities. Although we are not compromising academic freedom and freedom of speech, we should recognise the responsibilities that all of us have to tackle extremism.</p>

 I am pleased that the Minister was able to rush hotfoot into the Chamber just in time. It would have been a pleasure if the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) had joined us in this debate, but I know that he has other matters to get on with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para32"><a name="08062578000160">I was pleased to secure this debate, which is important for my constituents. Other parts of the country may have an interest in how the Government&#146;s macro-housing targets impinge on the microclimate of their areas and the related planning issues. My purpose is to relate the Government&#146;s macro-housing targets to the reality and challenges of meeting local housing needs in our communities. The background is, as Matthew Arnold said, that it is the desire of a centralised state to render its dominion homogenous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para33"><a name="08062578000161">My concern about the Government&#146;s approach is that although I understand that at the macro level there will be a demand, following Kate Barker&#146;s review and assessment, for 2 million properties to be built by 2016 and 3 million by 2020, the problem is that when one applies that national macro figure to the micro level, I fear that the consequences will be counter-productive for the Government&#146;s intention, which is to address specific housing needs throughout the country, and particularly in local areas such as mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para34"><a name="08062578000162">It may sound counter-intuitive to argue that the best way of meeting local housing needs in many areas is to control the development of housing to a far greater extent than the Government intend, but I shall try to explain why that is so in an area such as west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. The target for Cornwall is for almost 70,000 properties to be built during the planned period to 2026 within the regional spatial strategy, and that figure is incorporated into the local plans for each district in Cornwall and for Cornwall as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="80625h0004.htm_para35"><a name="08062578000163">There are some key questions. First, are there lessons to be learned from Cornwall where high levels of housing growth have not resulted in an improved climate for local families in housing need, or from the Isles of Scilly where a different planning approach has been adopted, as I shall explain later? Secondly, is it appropriate to use the blunt instrument of externally imposed high housing targets, especially in a dysfunctional market? In Cornwall, it operates to reward those who see homes as an investment, or who are fortunate enough to be able to buy more homes than they need, but sends a message to local families who are most in need that they have no right to be living there, and if they do they must expect to endure extortionate rents, poor conditions and tremendous insecurity. Thirdly, are the high house-building rates part of the solution or part of the problem of resolving the extreme, extensive, serious and long-standing housing needs of local families in places such as my constituency?</p>

high house prices. There is also a long housing waiting list, which is available for scrutiny in the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000165">The housing problems are serious and severe for people who stand no chance whatever of getting a property through the local housing register. They are left to the private rented sector, the climate of which is extortionate in the extreme and represents tremendous insecurity. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor) is here today, because I know that the situation is the same in his constituency. Many people who must endure the private rented sector live with six-month shorthold tenancies and uncertainty about what will happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para2"><a name="08062578000166">In advance of this debate, I sent the Minister not only an indication of what I intended to say, but the results of a recent survey of estate agents. It is the third of three that I have undertaken to illustrate how the market operates in west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. I have undertaken it more or less every 18 months for the past few years. Among many things, it illustrates that, last year, three times as many properties were sold to second home buyers as to first-time buyers. That is not a surprise to local people, but may be a shocking statistic to people who do not know my constituency. It shows that the second home market largely dictates market conditions, and that with the migration into the area, the local population stands little chance of being able to purchase properties in the local market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000167">The survey shows a number of other things, which will not be a surprise to the Minister or to other Members of Parliament, where the housing market has more than doubled in price in the past 10 years. However, the survey period was between March and May this year, and estate agents are anticipating a fall in the market of about 3 per cent. over the calendar year. The survey shows many other figures, which the Minister has.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para4"><a name="08062578000168">I shall explain my background to the subject. I am not a Johnny-come-lately. I was a professional working in the sector for many years before being elected to Parliament in 1997, and tried to introduce affordable housing schemes, mostly in rural areas in Cornwall and previously in Devon. I was also engaged with others in the planning process, and wrote a book published 20 years ago&#151;&#147;Cornwall at the crossroads?&#148;&#151;with two more intelligent and articulate people, Ron Perry and Bernard Deacon. It addressed the question then of the relationship between housing and population growth, and meeting local housing need. It raised a number of issues that are pertinent today.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments are extremely interesting. Is not the context of people&#146;s difficulties in finding suitable accommodation the fact that there are about 800,000 empty properties throughout the country, and that the Government should do far more to ensure that they are used for home ownership?</p>

 There is an issue with empty properties. Those in my part of the country are mainly second homes, and offering 50 per cent. council tax discounts&#151;the Conservatives also did that&#151;did not help that general trend. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that there is an issue.</p>

Clearly, it is a dysfunctional market in which the available housing supply does not relate to the needs of the local community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para6"><a name="08062578000172">The first point that I want to emphasise&#151;and one that I have already raised in correspondence with the Minister&#151;is that the application of the top-down high-level housing growth figure is part of the failed strategy of the past 40 years. Cornwall has seen the kind of housing growth that the Government and the Minister desire to see over the next 15 to 20 years. Cornwall&#146;s housing stock has more than doubled over the past 40 years, which is a sustained period of very high housing growth. Cornwall is the third fastest growing place in the UK, so no one can accuse it of being a nimby. We have allowed the development to take place, but at the end of that period, the local housing problems have, if anything, become significantly worse. One conclusion that we can draw&#151;and the Minister may say that it is a simplistic one&#151;is that simply building houses in itself does not resolve Cornwall&#146;s housing problem.</p>

Even with very extreme falls in house prices, which are not currently predicted by most people, prices would still not be affordable. In fact, in the present market mortgages are more expensive and larger deposits are required, which is obviously difficult for first-time buyers, and the drying up in house building is having an impact on the supply of affordable homes, as 60 per cent. of affordable homes are on commercial development sites.</p>

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="08062578000174"><a name="80625h0005.htm_spnew3"><a name="08062578000531"><b>Andrew George:</b>
 My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. I know that, in a couple of weeks&#146; time, he will be informing the Government of that and other related matters. If we had a 3 per cent. fall in house prices in Cornwall in the coming year it would be more than wiped out by the changes in the fiscal arrangements within the housing market and the lending policies of the institutions that provide finance for first-time buyers. I am not persuaded by the idea that a flattening or fall in the housing market will result in the meeting of local housing need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para7"><a name="08062578000175">My first point, therefore, is the failure of successive Government policies over the past 40 years. The second point is the inappropriateness of a south-west Government zone construct as the building block for establishing the house growth figures for an area such as Cornwall. It was clear from my survey of estate agents that the market is affected by the way in which developers market properties in Cornwall. Often they will market family houses as ideal holiday accommodation, and mostly they will be marketing them in the south-east and not in, say, Stroud, Bournemouth or Bristol. The market in Cornwall does not relate to those places at all. In fact, it has almost become a satellite of the south-east rather than being connected to the south-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para8"><a name="08062578000176">My third point relates to the Isles of Scilly. Effectively, the Government are permitting them to adopt a locals-only house-building strategy, which I strongly endorse, as part of their plan. It is essential to sustain an island community. In effect, what is being said is that the only  <br>

house building that will take place there will be to meet the housing need of those who have been living on the islands for 10 years or who are key workers&#151;a key worker, as defined by the islands, could be an electrician or engineer, and not just a doctor or nurse. It seems entirely bizarre that they have to adopt figures that are set out by the regional spatial strategy, which are inflexible, arbitrary, and entirely irrelevant to the Isles of Scilly. It is simply an entirely inappropriate process.</p>

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="08062578000177"><a name="80625h0005.htm_spnew4"><a name="08062578000532"><b>Mr. David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 I cannot talk about the Isles of Scilly, but I can talk about my own constituency in which the RSS is a construct that has come up with site-specific allocations. That cannot be a sensible and appropriate way for the RSS to function.</p>

<p><a name="st_27"><a name="08062578000178"><a name="80625h0005.htm_spnew5"><a name="08062578000533"><b>Andrew George:</b>
 The Government&#146;s planning approach has been created not to cater for a region that has its own internal integrity and community of interest but for the purposes of bureaucratic convenience. It has been defined by the Government and is, therefore, entirely inappropriate. However it is drawn up, the assumption that the regional spatial strategy or the Government zone of the south-west is able to create a community of interest within a bureaucratic construct is clearly bizarre and throws up lots of bizarre consequences, such as the one highlighted by the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para9"><a name="08062578000179">Finally, I have three very quick points. I apologise to the Minister for overrunning on time, but I have had to deal with a number of interventions. What Cornwall really needs is the creation of an intermediate market. It sounds counter-intuitive, but it needs to control house building in order to drive down land prices, and to work with housing associations to build shared-equity and other intermediate market properties. That will not happen while the hope values on land in Cornwall and the house building targets remain sky high, which is counter-productive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para10"><a name="08062578000180">My second quick point relates to the impact of second home ownership. I have had meetings with the Minister&#146;s colleagues and with the Prime Minister. I hope that the door is still open&#151;I have my foot in it at the moment&#151;to consider ways of using planning policy, perhaps through a new use class order, to introduce a method by which we can control second home ownership. I recommend that the Minister uses the Isles of Scilly as a trial base for such a policy. It would be a microcosm of much of the rest of the country and it would not have a knock-on effect on other areas. It would be a very appropriate place for the Government to trial a new planning method to control second home ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para11"><a name="08062578000181">As my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell said earlier, how will the Government respond to a flat or slowing-down housing market and how will that adjust the house-building targets? I am concerned that this top-down approach to planning is counter-productive, and I hope that the Minister has taken on board both the material that I have sent him and the questions that I have raised today.</p>

for St. Ives (Andrew George) on securing the debate. I had the pleasure of working with him earlier this year on the Housing and Regeneration Bill. I have to say that he brought expertise, professionalism, knowledge and insight into the Public Bill Committee that really raised our game and helped to ensure that the legislation went to another place in much better shape, so I thank him for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para12"><a name="08062578000183">Let me mention three broad points that the hon. Gentleman and others have mentioned: the private rented sector; second homes, which are very pertinent in his own region; and housing and planning figures within the confines of the regional spatial strategy process, which will occupy the bulk of my remarks. We had a very interesting debate in this Chamber yesterday on regulation of the private rented sector. Many of the points touched on by the hon. Gentleman were discussed there. I hope that he is aware of the review of the private rented sector undertaken by Julie Rugg at the centre of housing policy at the university of York. Many of the things that she touched on, such as how we raise standards and increase professionalism for landlords, will be considered in the review. I hope that he has had a chance to submit evidence to that review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para13"><a name="08062578000184">One of the things that we discussed yesterday was security of tenure, and I was very taken with what the hon. Gentleman said about that today. The review will consider the issue when exploring what more needs to be done to improve the experiences of private sector landlords and tenants. I mentioned yesterday that some constituents tell me that short-term tenancies do not provide security in their lives and that that insecurity affects their employment prospects. I am sure that he receives similar representations from his constituents. The review will consider that issue and will report to Ministers in October. I look forward to receiving it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para14"><a name="08062578000185">The hon. Gentleman is a strong campaigner and a strong performer in this House on the issue of second homes. I recognise that it is an issue in his area and in that of the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor). It is a matter of concern in the south-west, but that must be put in context. I understand that there are about 50,000 second homes in the south-west region, which is about 2.2 per cent. of the region&#146;s total housing stock. I imagine that the hon. Member for St. Ives might intervene on me on this point. I understand that those 50,000 homes will be concentrated in certain areas of his constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para15"><a name="08062578000186">The hon. Gentleman mentioned his dismay at the Conservative Government&#146;s decision on the discount on council tax. I hope that he is pleased with the steps that this Government have taken on that issue in enabling local authorities to reduce the discount on second homes from 50 per cent. to 10 per cent. I understand that local authorities in his region have responded to that opportunity by levying a 90 per cent. council tax charge on second home owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para16"><a name="08062578000187">On the Housing and Regeneration Bill Committee we discussed the importance of planning policy statement 3 on housing. The planning framework is strengthened by PPS3 because it allows rural authorities more flexibility over requiring affordable housing provision in small developments. In a wider strategic sense, it requires local authorities to consider future housing need and demand in their areas through a strategic housing market assessment. That means considering the issues that the  <br>

hon. Gentleman mentioned, such as what accommodation is needed for families with children and for single-person households and asking what the future demographic needs of the area will be. I think that PPS3 is a powerful tool for local authorities in determining the housing needs in their areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para17"><a name="08062578000188">I now come to the bulk of my remarks, on housing and planning numbers within the confines of the regional spatial strategy process. The hon. Gentleman is aware that we have touched on this issue a number of times during debates in the House. The last time was in an Adjournment debate secured by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) in early May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para18"><a name="08062578000189">The hon. Member for St. Ives knows that I have to disappoint him on a whole range of matters. I understand how important strategic planning for housing is to him and his constituents. I will sum up where we are in the process, but he is aware that because of the quasi-judicial role of the Secretary of State, I am limited in what I can say. He is a strong campaigner for his constituents and he is an excellent MP on the issue of housing, where his knowledge is exemplary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para19"><a name="08062578000190">The function of regional spatial strategies is to determine how much housing is needed and the general location in which it should be built; the priorities for new infrastructure and economic development; the strategy for protecting countryside and biodiversity; and the policy for reducing carbon emissions and safeguarding natural resources such as water and minerals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para20"><a name="08062578000191">Responsibility for the initial drafting of the strategy for the south-west rested with the South West regional assembly, as the hon. Gentleman is aware. The assembly submitted its draft to the Government on 24 April 2006. A 12-week public consultation gave the opportunity to put comments to an independent panel. The panel was appointed by the Secretary of State to test the soundness of the draft regional spatial strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para21"><a name="08062578000192">An examination in public was held between April and July 2007 to discuss and test the draft regional spatial strategy before the panel. The length of the examination in public reflected the level of interest in the draft RSS, with the panel reviewing comments from almost 2,000 different parties. In total, 191 organisations and individuals took part in public hearings held in Exeter. The panel&#146;s report was submitted to the Government on 10 December 2007 and was published on 10 January 2008. It contains recommendations to the Secretary of State on all aspects of the draft regional spatial strategy. However, representations were not invited on its recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para22"><a name="08062578000193">Hopefully, I have set out the background to the draft RSS. However, I hope that hon. Members will understand that because of the nature of the process I am constrained in what I can say at this stage about the detail of it or the recommendations of the independent panel, particularly with regard to housing numbers. In taking quasi-judicial decisions under the planning Acts, there is clear guidance for Ministers based on advice from the Law Officers and first Treasury counsel. A copy of that guidance can be found on the Department&#146;s website and I could provide copies to the hon. Gentleman and others who have participated. The guidance outlines that Ministers should not enter into discussions with interested parties on the changes that might be made to a draft RSS while consideration is being given to the panel&#146;s report. That   <br>

is to ensure that the process is fair and transparent and that representations to the Secretary of State are channelled through the proper statutory consultation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para23"><a name="08062578000194">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members would wish me to explain what the next stages are in the process. The Secretary of State is considering the panel&#146;s report along with all the representations previously submitted, and aims to publish her proposed changes this summer. There will be a 12-week public consultation when the proposed changes are published. That will be the opportunity for those interested in the content of the RSS to make their comments known. Following consideration of the comments and views arising from that consultation, the Secretary of State expects to publish the final regional spatial strategy for the south-west before the end of 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para24"><a name="08062578000195">At the local level, which the hon. Gentleman is very concerned about, the transitional One Cornwall planning team has started work on preparing a One Cornwall core strategy, for submission by the new Cornwall unitary authority, which is due to come into being next year. That approach is supported by the county council and the six district councils in Cornwall. Community involvement in the production of the strategy is likely to start early in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para25"><a name="08062578000196">The core strategy will be the first and most significant development plan document produced in its entirety by the new authority. It will contain a vision for Cornwall, strategic development locations up to 2026 that reflect the emerging regional spatial strategy, and a delivery strategy that integrates policies and programmes including the sustainable community strategy and the Cornwall European convergence programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="80625h0005.htm_para26"><a name="08062578000197">At the same time, detailed planning is proceeding at the two main growth points in Cornwall. The Truro and Threemilestone area action plan is being produced by Carrick district council and aims to produce 3,500 homes by 2016. The Camborne, Pool and Redruth area action plan is being produced by Kerrier district council and aims to provide 3,400 homes by 2016. Both areas are regional priorities for housing delivery and regional convergence. Camborne, Pool and Redruth is a regional priority area for regeneration and has an urban regeneration company, while Truro is a new growth point.</p>

 I accept that the Minister is constrained in what he can say, but does he accept my primary point that despite all the growth, we cannot build our way out of this housing crisis simply by heaping thousands of houses in an area such as Cornwall? Why does he not adopt an approach similar to that which has been permitted by the Government on the Isles of Scilly? That is not a market-led approach, because that would mean that locals would not stand a chance of buying most properties. Instead it is a need-led approach. Why can that approach not be used?</p>

 I am glad to have the opportunity to talk about a subject that is at the heart of the Government&#146;s thinking&#151;education&#151;and to raise the question of under-achievement in inner-city schools, and in particular black under-achievement, a subject on which I have campaigned for many years. I want to talk especially about the teaching work force in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para0"><a name="08062578000203">Given the part of the country that the Minister comes from, he might think that black under-achievement in schools is a narrow subject. However, the majority of children in the inner London boroughs are black or minority ethnic. Given the demographics of London and other big cities, we cannot raise standards unless we address the causes of under-achievement among many of the minorities. Not every minority ethnic group in London under-achieves&#151;some over-achieve. However, in borough after inner London borough, a long tail of Afro-Caribbean boys is bringing down the overall results. That is not only bad for the statistics and for the Government&#146;s stated aim of raising standards, it is a tragedy for those boys, their families and the wider community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000204">Inner-city schools and under-achievement, and black boys and under-achievement&#151;it is a complex matter. There are many issues. They include peer group pressures, gang culture and the disproportionate rate of black pupils excluded from school, which I have mentioned before. Indeed, I wish to follow up the latter subject today because I did not get a satisfactory reply to some of the points that I raised in the earlier debate. There are other issues, such as low expectations. I believe that we still lack a clear, concrete policy line from the Department on how to deal with black under-achievement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para2"><a name="08062578000205">There is also an issue with teachers. Having spoken to many schools and educationalists, and above all to many teachers, I have no doubt that we need more men in the classroom, particularly in our primary schools. We need a more diverse teaching work force. We need a teaching work force in London that looks like London. I do not say that because I believe that only black people can teach black children, or that only Asian teachers can teach Asian children. I believe that if the work force&#151;the staff room&#151;matches the ethnic composition of the children, the team as a whole will have a better emotional and intellectual understanding of the children that they are trying to teach. The best heads in London, whatever their colour, are very positive in trying to recruit a diverse teaching force. They put a lot of energy into that, because they understand that in order to have a team that is culturally literate it must be diverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000206">Before I come to the question of how to achieve a more diverse teaching work force in London, I would be doing the hard-working teachers in London and throughout the country a disservice if I did not first touch on some general issues. I have nothing but admiration for teachers. The Government have put a lot into education. They have increased salaries, and salaries for young teachers are now much more competitive than when Labour came into office in 1997. However, teachers throughout the country are suffering from market forces. There is a decline in pupil numbers in some areas, but large numbers of migrant children arriving in others&#151;often rapidly so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para4"><a name="08062578000207">With the best will in the world, it is difficult for teachers to adapt. I have visited schools that a few years ago were largely Afro-Caribbean and Irish but are now mainly Polish and west African. It is difficult for people not from London to understand the demographic turnover in those schools, which can be rapid. The reality for teachers is that, however committed they are and however good they are, they almost have to deal with a whole new community every five, six or seven years. The schools lose their stability and continuity, and their community and institutional memories, which makes things so much more of a challenge than for the more stable communities that the Minister represents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para5"><a name="08062578000208">There may be issues about turnover and changes in pupil numbers, but there is also the problem of the retirement bulge. Putting it bluntly, a generation of teachers in London who bought their houses in the 1970s, when one could buy a house in Hackney on a teacher&#146;s salary, is now poised to retire. What will happen when that generation of teachers leaves I do not know. Not even on the vastly improved head teachers&#146; salaries for which the Government are responsible can one buy a property in most areas within zones 1 and 2. The retirement bulge will be a real problem, because of what has happened with the housing market in London and other big cities. There is also the changing profile of people coming into teaching, the changing profile of pupil populations, and the serious challenges of community cohesion that many of our schools face in the aftermath of 7/7 and 9/11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para6"><a name="08062578000209">There are other specific issues, and one of the most important in the context of today&#146;s debate is the under-representation of men in the teaching work force. Female teachers represent 88 per cent. of primary school teaching staff. Even in secondary schools, they represent 58 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para7"><a name="08062578000210">No one would expect me to say that female teachers are less good than male teachers. However, I ask the Minister to imagine a young boy living on an estate in Hackney in a single-parent family. The head of the household is the mother; perhaps, for all his friends, women are the head of the household. That boy may never have seen what I used to see every day of my life&#151;a father getting up, going out to work and coming home on the Friday with a wage packet. That boy then has to go to a school run by women. What sense is there of a positive and constructive male role model over and above the gangs that inhabit the fringes of the estate, the street corners and the alleyways?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para8"><a name="08062578000211">Although I wish specifically to address black male under-achievement, many of the issues that I shall raise are relevant to white working-class boys of any ethnicity. What image of the world will they have if they live on an estate and in an environment where they never see working males fulfilling their responsibilities? In school, the only people they see exercising their authority and fulfilling their responsibilities are women. One can meet too many little boys in school who, in a confused way, think that books and education are for girls. What are they to think if nine out of 10 teachers are women?</p>

One cannot buy a home in inner London on a teacher&#146;s salary, not to mention affording all the other costs. The danger is that London schools will rely increasingly on young teachers who start out in London but move on when they want to buy a home and have a family, and on teachers from overseas&#151;New Zealand, South Africa and even the Caribbean&#151;who come but do not stay.

 I want to return to the subject of the disproportionately low number of ethnic minority teachers in London&#146;s schools compared with the pupil population, and the fact that in most inner-London boroughs the majority of children are black or ethnic minority. The latest figure that I saw for the number of black or ethnic minority teachers in London was 12 per cent., I think. For the reasons that I set out earlier&#151;cultural understanding and children seeing people like them teaching and in leadership positions&#151;that is wrong and is not helping any of our children to achieve their best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para18"><a name="08062578000224">I turn to the ethnic imbalance in governing bodies. In 2006, the Institute for Policy Studies in Education researched London governing bodies and found that although those in the study had a gender balance, they were ethnically imbalanced. Ministers, and politicians on both sides, are very keen to talk about empowering parents, which is all well and good when dealing with a stable, homogenous community. In inner London, where people in &#163;500,000 houses live cheek by jowl with some very grim estates, the mix of children in primary schools is fine, but governing bodies are all too quickly captured by a clique of middle-class white parents who are not concerned about the wider issues, as long as their Chloe and Dominic get into the school of their choice&#151;whether fee-paying or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para19"><a name="08062578000225">Tensions have arisen in my own borough that have nothing to do with diversity in schools. In fact, diversity in inner-London primary schools is one of their strengths&#151;all parents value the fact that they can send their children to the best state primary schools in London where they can mix with children of all colours and races, and learn a lot just from that cultural mix. I am talking about governing bodies and how they can be captured by cliques of parents. Owing to the Government&#146;s dogma about empowering parents, they do not understand that in the inner-city they are empowering not parents as a whole, but the loudest and most confident and educated parents, sometimes to the detriment of the Government&#146;s stated aim of raising achievement across the piece.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para20"><a name="08062578000226">A difficult situation arose in a school in my borough when a clique took over a governing body, after which the popular black head teacher left. I do not want to comment on what really happened, but there is a sense in the community that the head teacher&#146;s face did not fit&#151;in the opinion of the clique of lawyers, business people and sometimes even MPs now running the school. Ethnic balance is as important for governing bodies, therefore, as it is for the teaching work force. More needs to be done to train and support governors in the inner city and to make heads aware of the importance  <br>

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point. Some schools in my constituency simply cannot get governors of any sort. Often parents are too absorbed in trying to survive frequent house moves, because they live in temporary accommodation and so on. As a result, head teachers must often carry the entire load with no support at all. I strongly endorse her point, therefore, about training and supporting potential governors, particularly if they are genuinely to represent the local communities.</p>

 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s intervention. My point, which perhaps I did not make properly, is that sometimes the reason why such governing bodies become imbalanced is not, to be fair, the Machiavellian intent of some parents, but the fact that other parents&#151;working-class parents, or parents who are asylum seekers or refugees&#151;are working when they should be at governing body meetings, English is not their first language and generally they feel intimidated by governors who appear to know so much and to be so fluent and confident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para21"><a name="08062578000229">So, even when such parents sit on governing bodies, they do not feel able to say anything, and others like them are frightened of going on such bodies&#151;perhaps unreasonably, but they are frightened all the same. They think that they will be put to shame, because they cannot read all the paperwork and do not understand the big words and the jargon. That is how we end up with skewed governing bodies. As I said, there is not necessarily any Machiavellian intent, and if I gave that impression it was unfair, but skewed governing bodies can lead to tensions.</p>

I want to talk, however, about the plight of black and minority ethnic men and women who go into teaching. The university of Exeter did some research and found that teacher trainees who experienced racism in their placement&#151;sometimes they were placed outside inner London&#151;did not necessarily have anywhere to turn for support. The university set up a diversity resource officer in its school of education, but apparently that is the only such post in the UK. The officer said in a recent interview:</p>

When asked to address issues of institutional racism, they insist on taking it as personal criticism, rather than as an inquiry into how their institution works in practice.</p>

They tended to be older than their counterparts, they had a bigger financial struggle because they were more likely to have young children at home, particularly if they were women, and many of them had part-time jobs while they were studying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="80625h0006.htm_para27"><a name="08062578000235">Those universities recommended easing the situation for mature students through funding, by offering taster courses and specific support as the university of Exeter has, and by removing barriers to international students training in this country. Later, I shall return to the question of international students. Similar results were found by academic research in 2006, looking at the number of minority ethnic trainees who drop out of teacher training courses, and in 2007, looking at the perception of racism in teacher education.</p>

For these teachers, the denial of their professional expertise and status within the profession, and associated neglect of minority ethnic communities&#146; needs is at the root of these groups&#146; disillusionment with the education system and distance from the pursuit of a teaching career.&#148;</p>

Most recently, research by the Institute for Policy Studies in Education at London Metropolitan university found that white teachers with 10 to 15 years&#146; experience were twice as likely to be heads or deputy heads than their black counterparts, and that teacher trainees from the black community were twice as likely to fail their initial teacher training.

The Minister might say, &#147;What does it matter in the west country whether you know how to teach children from diverse backgrounds?&#148;, but in 2008, in an increasingly globalised world, all our teachers, even if they never, ever encounter a child from an ethnic background, which will be increasingly unusual, ought to feel confident that they have been trained to deal with diversity issues.</p>

As a result of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, the General Teaching Council for England produced guidelines for schools in 2008, and since May 2002, schools have specifically been required to have a race equality policy, to assess the impact of all their general policies on pupils, staff and parents, to monitor the impact of policies on race and to take reasonable steps to publish the results of that monitoring. However, the GTC found that not all schools were doing that, and in 2005 Ofsted voiced concern that certain education authorities were not implementing the 2000 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="80625h0007.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000240">In 2006, a GTC report found that only 64 per cent. of teachers knew about their school&#146;s policy on race and ethnicity.

Unusually for a Back-Bench MP, I am calling not for new legislation, but for the meaningful implementation of existing legislation.

They ought to say much more clearly that now, in 2008, it is important to recruit and guide into teaching a much more diverse teaching work force for the reasons that I gave earlier. Minority ethnic teachers tend to be local and to stay, unlike teachers from Australia and New Zealand. However brilliant and inspirational they are, in a few years they will go back to Australia or New Zealand, but the West Indian lady who leaves her job in social work, trains in middle age to be a teacher and goes to a local school to teach will be there until retirement and in some ways represents a better investment of Government money.</p>

If the training does not focus on that set specifically, it says that the system does not value it and, ipso facto, that perhaps it is easier to exclude the naughty black boys when they turn 13 or 14, rather than, earlier in the process, focus on how to engage them in education and raise their standards.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point about overseas teachers. Like her, I welcome the work done by some of the very good, dedicated teachers who come to this country.

The school in Ghana sends a teacher for a year, and the school in my constituency sends a teacher in return. That has been mutually beneficial to both schools. Does my hon.

 That is exactly right. Let me be specific about the research that I want. The problem is that teaching qualifications from the Caribbean and Africa are not recognised as being equivalent to UK teaching qualifications, but teaching qualifications from Canada, New Zealand, Australia, America and eastern Europe are. I would like research to be done to identify which specific aspects of African and Caribbean teacher training are deficient so that Caribbean and African teacher training institutions can address the issue and move towards establishing course equivalence with the UK.</p>

Despite the fact that the Government have put up teachers&#146; salaries and put in more resources, and despite the fact that we have had an excellent academies programme&#151;certainly in my borough&#151;the teaching, social work and guidance role that teachers take on is more challenging than ever.</p>

 I apologise for missing the fist few minutes of the debate. I compliment my hon.

She is particularly supportive of the black community in her borough and across London, and she should be strongly commended for her work on the issue.</p>

Friend, I represent an inner-city London constituency and its problems are very similar to those that she faces in her constituency. I endorse the last point that she made: primary school is the only place of safety and friendship for many children in our constituencies and the only place where they have some space. If a child grows up in an overcrowded privately rented flat or in temporary accommodation, their opportunities for doing homework or any kind of craft at home will be zero because there is simply no space. As a result, their school is their only playground, their only space and the only place where they can stretch their imagination.</p>

I can think of many occasions when I have been in a school to do my Friday advice bureau, which often lasts for six or seven hours in the evening, and I have found a teacher who has been waiting with a migrant family for that whole time to come in and explain their problem, translate where necessary if they are proficient in the relevant language, and show them support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="80625h0007.htm_para24"><a name="08062578000266">That does not happen now. The money that has gone into improving our buildings and buying computers and other equipment is important, and so, above all, is the money that has now been provided for the employment of teaching support staff, learning mentors and all such ancillary and related staff&#151;who, again, are often the butt of jokes on television and in the tabloid press, yet they are essential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80625h0007.htm_para25"><a name="08062578000267">A deeply disturbed child, particularly one of secondary school age, may be involved in an awful lot of very bad and nasty activities outside school&#151;perhaps gangs, knives or even guns. It is all there; it is true. What happens when that child, who unfortunately is usually a boy, comes to school? The misbehaviour continues and the option for the school is to exclude the kid who is disrupting the class. It ends up expelling him and he moves from school to school, being excluded and expelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="80625h0007.htm_para26"><a name="08062578000268">Such children are completely lost to education by the time they are 13 or 14. By the time they are 16 or 17, they are in a young offenders institution, and after 18 they end up in prison. We must do something for the kids who are grossly underachieving in our society. That is what the education system must provide for.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware that a former director general of the Prison Service, Martin Narey, said that on the day a child is permanently excluded from school they might as well be given a date and time to turn up in prison? That is the correlation between permanent exclusion and a criminal career.</p>

 Martin Narey was absolutely right; it was a prescient remark, which I understand, support and endorse. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister said something about rights of appeal against suspension and expulsion from school. I understand that there are elements of behaviour that may be so bad that they lead to suspension. I do not say it should never happen or that no one should ever be excluded. We can never say never, but it should be absolutely the last resort and everything should be done in the meantime to give support. However, the system of justice that applies to a number of secondary school bodies does not bear much examination in terms of natural justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="80625h0007.htm_para27"><a name="08062578000271">The evidence used against individuals who are suspended from school is often very vague, governing bodies are often reluctant to overrule the head teacher on a suspension or expulsion and it is difficult for parents who may not be very well versed in dealing with bureaucratic procedures to represent their case. We need a pretty robust code of conduct to ensure that there is a proper, defendable system of appeal.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that when children are about to be excluded they are often behaving in ways that are appalling and people would not want them in a classroom with their child? Is it not the point that it is better to intervene on behaviour issues much earlier, at primary school age, which is why I want a more diverse teaching work force, with more men? On the whole, they are better placed to intervene on some of the behaviour problems of little boys. Also, what happens after the children are excluded? They end up in pupil referral units, which are just waiting sheds for prison.</p>

 I endorse what my hon. Friend says and fully understand that point. We are not in disagreement, and I do not think that the Minister disagrees particularly either. There must be a system of recognising when boys in particular are underachieving, misbehaving or seeking attention&#151;whatever it happens to be, for there are lots of reasons&#151;and giving them the necessary support very early on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="80625h0007.htm_para28"><a name="08062578000274">Investment in teaching support staff and learning mentors is good investment, and so is taking such children out of class if necessary and giving them special support in school. That is all good practice and good investment. After all, we all have the responsibility to ensure that all the children going through the education system can achieve the best they are capable of. We should give more support to the learning mentor and support systems in schools and be very tough on the question of suspensions and expulsions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="80625h0007.htm_para29"><a name="08062578000275">Taking a youngster&#151;usually a secondary school boy of 13, 14 or 15 who is suspended, excluded or possibly expelled&#151;to a pupil referral unit is not a cheap option. Those pupil referral units are often more expensive than the most expensive private schools in the country, and I am not sure how much they achieve in some cases. As they are very expensive, a question of investment arises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="80625h0007.htm_para30"><a name="08062578000276">I do not want to take up too much time, as other hon. Members are waiting to speak, but I want to make a couple of points about my constituency before saying something about teachers&#146; conditions. There are six secondary schools in my constituency of Islington, North. Because of the system of choice, as it is termed, on moving to secondary schools in our part of north London, the tradition is that children from Hackney schools try to go to Islington, children from Islington schools try to go to Camden, children from Camden schools try to go further out and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="80625h0007.htm_para31"><a name="08062578000277">There is a process of crossing London and moving outwards, which often means that the most able children with the most articulate parents get into selective schools on the outskirts of London, whereas others, who cannot afford to move house to live nearer an appropriate secondary school, or whatever they might need to do, end up going to the local schools. The intake is therefore not a universal local intake, and in the past the local schools have become almost the schools of last resort. I do not want them to be that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="80625h0007.htm_para32"><a name="08062578000278">I commend what the Government have done in investing large sums of money in buildings and other improvements to secondary schools. That has borne a lot of fruit and all six of those schools in my constituency are doing well. They are all getting new buildings, more staff and more support, although they may not yet have all achieved the magic rate of 30 per cent. of pupils achieving A to C GCSE grades. I can well understand the difficulties they have in achieving that, but I was furious when, two weeks ago, the Department announced that three schools in my constituency&#151;Highbury Grove, Holloway and Islington Arts and Media&#151;were on the list of the 643 schools around the country that are of concern.</p>

think, &#147;Is this school a disaster area? Is it failing? Come September, can I entrust my son or daughter to it to be educated? What is going to happen to it in the future?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000280">I have been in touch with all three schools; I have visited two of them and will be seeing the third next week. I had a group of youngsters from Highbury Grove down to the House this morning to do an education Department tour. Those schools are doing well, going places and achieving. I was, therefore, very angry that they should be labelled in such a way. I have written a letter to my hon. Friend the Minister, inviting him to join me on a visit of the three schools. We can start early in the morning, no problem. Any time the Minister can do, we will be there. I want him to see that we have three schools that are trying hard, doing well and achieving. I want him to reassure the staff and the parents on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para2"><a name="08062578000281">During the Division, I was talking to my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), who is similarly angry. Three schools in his area have been named: Mellow Lane, Harlington and the recently developed academy. He feels that the staff have been demoralised. When the Minister replies to the debate, I hope he will explain why the list has been produced. Would it not be far better to support the schools that are doing well, rather than getting involved in naming and shaming schools, which does not do much good in the long run?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000282">My last point concerns the teachers themselves, because they are, after all, the subject of the debate. Teachers in London have a very difficult job. They have to face many problems, the biggest of which is housing, which is incredibly expensive. To buy any kind of flat in my constituency requires at least &#163;250,000. We have had some flats developed specifically for teachers, and we have shared ownership schemes and all the rest of it for key workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para4"><a name="08062578000283">I went to a shared ownership fair last Saturday that was held at the Arsenal stadium. It was interesting, but a lot of those flats were out of reach of teachers&#151;they were just too expensive. When we recruit young teachers to our primary and secondary schools, we need to get them somewhere to live in the community. We also need to help them to remain in the area when they have families and children of their own and need a bigger space. If we do not do those things, our schools will lose out and, as a result, our children will lose out. We need to think through the housing issue and the housing needs of our teachers, because teachers are an important part of the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para5"><a name="08062578000284">Our teachers try very hard. We have children from all over the world, children living in bad housing conditions and children who are growing up in a society in which there is great deal of violence and an awful lot of commercial pressure on schools. We have examples of schools that achieve the most fantastic things and we feel inspired by them. For instance, a group of children were fairly alarmed about a violent poster near their school that was advertising a new DVD. They asked their teacher how they could object to it. The teacher explained that such things had to be done properly and that they had to go to the Advertising Standards Authority. So, a group of 30 children wrote letters, went to the ASA, dragged out someone from its offices, protested about the poster and the whole thing was stopped and withdrawn.</p>

She questioned whether all the issues would instantly resonate with a Minister who represents the South Dorset constituency. She might also have mentioned a shadow spokesman who represents Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and a Liberal Democrat spokesman who represents Yeovil, which is in Somerset.

Certainly, we have seen the effects of a chaotic home environment and the deprivation that can have an impact on many schools, particularly those sited in the toughest catchment areas.

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para12"><a name="08062578000292">The hon.

That is not quite so relevant in Somerset, but her points about the gap in the teaching force in relation to the male-female split are certainly applicable. Many primary and infant schools in my constituency have no male teachers.</p>

 I am not suggesting that head teachers routinely or recklessly exclude or expel large numbers of children&#151;I do not believe that to be the case&#151;but I recognise that there is a problem. I also recognise that it is quite possible for a youngster to be excluded or expelled from school on the basis of an unfortunate concoction of evidence by fellow pupils or things such as that, which could result in the youngster being accused of something that they are not guilty of. Also, there may not be a sufficiently fair or robust system of appeal to the governing body, which should dispassionately examine the evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para17"><a name="08062578000301">I also fear that I only half agree with the hon. Gentleman on the issue of the so-called failing schools. I am pleased that the Government are focusing on schools that have performed poorly, particularly at GCSE level. I am not convinced, given the right resources, leadership and support, that there is an excuse for any school in the country to have more than 70 per cent. of its youngsters failing to achieve the benchmark that the Government have identified. However, I agree strongly with him that the spin behind the announcement that the Government made a week ago, which seemed to have more to do with media management and creating headlines than with improving schools, was extremely unfortunate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para18"><a name="08062578000302">I have received a lot of feedback from schools across the country and they believe that the publicity relating to that announcement was damaging to their efforts to improve. After all, many of the schools that the Government identified last week are academies, which is exactly what one would expect, given that academies are set up in areas that already have underperformance. Therefore, it is unhelpful to label such schools, which the Government have championed, &#147;failing&#148; schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para19"><a name="08062578000303">When the Minister responds, he will tell me that I have got all that wrong and that the media spin put the &#147;failing&#148; tag on those schools.</p>

 Before the Minister cheers too loudly, I refer him to the statement made by the Prime Minister in response to a question from one of his Labour colleagues at Prime Minister&#146;s questions last week. Even the Prime Minister went off-message and referred to these schools as &#147;failing&#148; schools, when they are supposed to be categorised in some other way, which the Minister will no doubt tell us about.</p>

<p><a name="st_51"><a name="08062578000306"><a name="80625h0008.htm_spnew6"><a name="08062578000557"><b>Ms Abbott:</b>
 On exclusions, I wanted only to make the point that I have counselled many a mother whose son has been excluded. They sit before me in floods of tears, because mothers, including black mothers, take exclusion badly. They always insist that their child is as innocent as the day is long, that their son has been the victim of tremendous injustice and that this is the first incident of bad behaviour that has ever happened. However, when I inquire further, I often find a gruesome catalogue of wrongdoing. That is why my emphasis is on diverting those young men and on what we do with them after they have been excluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para20"><a name="08062578000308">We have only a brief time for the debate, so I want to touch on only three or four issues that the hon. Lady raised, and I will do so in short order. However, before I continue, having congratulated her and the hon. Member for Islington, North, I pay tribute&#151;no doubt the Minister will do so at the beginning of his speech&#151;to the progress that has been made in London over the last 10 years, because large parts of London, particularly inner London, produced an appalling performance in terms of school standards 10 years ago. Indeed, some of those areas still have low school standards today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para21"><a name="08062578000309">With the extra financial resources that have gone in, the emphasis on better governance and some work that has been piloted in London on reading recovery and on other areas of education, it is notable that there has been a sharp improvement in London, particularly in some of the poorest performing parts of London, over the last decade. It is good to see that improvement recognised not only through the published statistics, but through the national recognition given to people such as Sir William Atkinson at Phoenix high school in London, who received a well-deserved knighthood a few weeks ago to acknowledge the progress that has been made there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para22"><a name="08062578000310">Once some of those problems have been sorted out, any Government will want to look beyond London at other parts of the country, where the improvement in performance over the last 10 years has not been nearly as impressive. Those are areas where the headline statistics look satisfactory but there are issues about whether their schools are doing anything like as well as they should be, given their catchment areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para23"><a name="08062578000311">The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington raised at the outset the issue of black underachievement. She mentioned that underachievement is also a problem with white working class boys. She also mentioned, quite rightly, the fact that many other ethnic minority communities seem radically to outperform some poorly performing ethnic minority communities and that that is not always related purely to issues of deprivation. As she suggested, sometimes ethnic minority communities with similar apparent disadvantages achieve different results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para24"><a name="08062578000312">I am sure that all Members here who frequently speak to head teachers and others, and who are also aware of the relevant statistics, will be conscious of the fact that not all those differences in performance can be explained away simply by social factors and that there are issues about aspirations in the home environment in different communities. Those aspirations can make a real difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para25"><a name="08062578000313">The Liberal Democrats want greater emphasis on developing a coherent system for funding across the country, which would target disadvantage more effectively than the existing system. It would also help some of the individuals whom the hon. Lady talked about in her speech, who live in parts of London where the deprivation funding does not get through effectively. That may be more of a problem outside London, where pockets of deprivation are more widely dispersed than in some inner-London boroughs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para26"><a name="08062578000314">Nevertheless, there is a need for the Government to reform the funding formula that relates to deprivation&#151;I know that they are looking at that now&#151;and to ensure that the amounts of money that go to disadvantaged youngsters are much greater to help to compensate for some of the great challenges in those communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para27"><a name="08062578000315">The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington also mentioned the issues that clearly do not relate purely to deprivation and economic disadvantage&#151;work force issues and the bias, particularly in primary schools, against men. I agree very much with her comments on the latter issue, and I would like some of the measures that she mentioned to be introduced to encourage more men into the primary school teaching work force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para28"><a name="08062578000316">The hon. Lady also referred to the gap in London between black and other ethnic minority pupil populations and the teaching work force. She was right to make the observations that she made in that regard. I know that she was criticised by some people nationally during her previous campaign on the issue, because their emphasis was on getting good teachers into schools, regardless of their ethnic background. I am sure that she is not suggesting that we should compromise teaching standards to get more black and other ethnic minority teachers into schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para29"><a name="08062578000317">There is a cultural problem with some of our communities and much of that relates to aspirations. That issue is one of the difficulties in many schools, but it is most effectively challenged by good leadership. Therefore, it is important that youngsters in those communities see that going on to teach or to aspire to success in an academic environment are things that individuals such as them ought to be doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para30"><a name="08062578000318">I do not want to hark back too much to Sir William Atkinson&#146;s school, but I recollect that, when I visited it, he had lots of large photographs around the school of youngsters from previous years, with their GCSE performance listed underneath. The message that he is trying to send out by having those photographs around the school is that people like the pupils&#151;with the same ethnic background and from the same community or estate&#151;can achieve to that high standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para31"><a name="08062578000319">I will not go back over all the points that the hon. Lady made&#151;she will be pleased to know that&#151;but she raised a number of issues about how the Government might tackle this particular ethnic minority gap, if I may put it that way, and I hope that the Minister responds to her suggestions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para32"><a name="08062578000320">There are a host of other issues relating to the teaching work force in London that we ought to refer to, but time does not allow it. I hope that the Minister touches on one particular issue&#151;that of teacher shortages. Those shortages are especially acute in London, compared with other parts of the country, and they may become even more acute in this environment of pay restraint.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) on securing this very important debate. Nothing is more important than education. It is the only route out of poverty and the only route to a fulfilled life. It is key to enabling people to enjoy and contribute to the culture of this nation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para33"><a name="08062578000322">From listening to the hon. Lady on &#147;Desert Island Discs&#148;, which was very enjoyable, including the music&#151;there was no Abba, which was good&#151;it is clear that education has been important in her life. She went to a grammar school in Harrow and then on to Cambridge, and went on to break down barriers in the civil service and politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="80625h0008.htm_para34"><a name="08062578000323">The hon. Lady referred in her opening remarks to the long tail of underachievement, and she cited black boys in particular, but the phrase frequently appears in commentaries on and outside audits of the British education system. For example, the Programme for International Student Assessment report talks about the long tail of underachievement in this country, particularly in reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para0"><a name="08062578000324">I regret that I am introducing the phrase &#147;synthetic phonics&#148; so early in my speech, but it is important that reading is taught properly in our primary schools, in reception class and in year one. Synthetic phonics closes the gap between boys and girls, between socio-economic groups, and between ethnic minorities and the rest of the population. It works, and it works particularly well for all those groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000325">The hon. Lady is also right about the gender imbalance in the teaching profession at secondary level and particularly in primary schools. A recent survey by the Training and Development Agency for Schools found that most boys thought that they behaved better with a male teacher&#151;42 per cent. said that they worked harder, and 44 per cent. said that it made school more enjoyable. If we want to encourage men to go into teaching, it is important that we provide anonymity for all teachers when accusations are made against them by pupils, because most of the accusations are false and most are made against men. I am sure that that deters many men from going into education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para2"><a name="08062578000326">It is also important that we do everything we can to assist overseas trained teachers to acquire qualified teacher status, and that they do not lose their job and, potentially, their immigration status as a consequence of the rules that are coming into force shortly. I hope that the Minister will be able to say something about what is being done to assist those people in acquiring QTS. I agree with the reasoning behind the approach&#151;to ensure that we have properly qualified teachers with all the requisite skills&#151;but we do not want to leave our London schools with some 11,000 fewer teachers as a consequence of the new rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000327">The hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) is right when he says that schools in difficult circumstances can achieve. I am sure that they can, and I will come to some examples of that shortly. There is no doubt that London has experienced some serious problems with its school system, and that in some parts it continues to do so today. There is also no doubt that the London Challenge has been successful in raising achievement levels in London schools, with 47.9 per cent. of pupils now achieving five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and maths. But even though the rise in standards in London during the period of the London Challenge has been greater than the rise nationally, it is not acceptable that more than half of London&#146;s 15 and 16-year-olds are still not achieving five or more good GCSEs including English and maths. The children&#146;s plan aims for 90 per cent. of children to achieve five high GCSE grades, which should include English and maths. As the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, in too many schools there is a culture of low expectation that really is not acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para4"><a name="08062578000328">On Monday, I visited the London Oratory school, which is a fantastic school where every child, regardless of their ability or background, is expected to work hard and achieve. I found that behaviour was immaculate, pupils stood up when an adult entered the classroom, they studied the three separate sciences, a modern language is compulsory to GCSE level, extra-curricular activities are extensive, competitive sport is important, the uniform of blazer and tie is strictly enforced, and 96 per cent. achieve five or more GCSEs at grades A to C, including English and maths. One can understand why the former Prime Minister sent his children there.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 121WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para5"><a name="08062578000329">London Oratory is a comprehensive school. Its pupils have a genuine array of abilities and social backgrounds, albeit that it is a Catholic faith school. Instead of obsessing about its intake, we should seek to replicate its approach to education generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para6"><a name="08062578000330">As the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington correctly pointed out, there is a real teacher recruitment problem in London schools, and the teacher vacancy rate is twice the national average. There is also a higher teaching staff turnover rate in London&#151;at 22.3 per cent., it is significantly higher than the national rate. In London, 35 per cent. of teachers have fewer than six years&#146; experience, compared with 29 per cent. nationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para7"><a name="08062578000331">Those problems are not encountered at the London Oratory, where staff turnover is just 5 per cent. That provides the stability that the hon. Lady mentioned during her contribution. The school has no problems recruiting academic specialists in their subject, whether it be physics, French, Latin, history or English, and that is because the school is a happy, well-ordered and calm place where children are free to learn and where the ethos is that pupils are expected to study hard and to do extensive homework every evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para8"><a name="08062578000332">I accept the hon. Member for Islington, North&#146;s point about facilities for doing homework. If children have difficult backgrounds, if there is no place for them to do their homework, and if there is no peace and quiet in the home, the school really should be making provision for them to do their homework at school in homework clubs after school. That is the right approach. There certainly should be no excuse in such circumstances for not doing homework, or for not setting it.</p>

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="08062578000333"><a name="80625h0009.htm_spnew0"><a name="08062578000560"><b>Jeremy Corbyn:</b>
 I am certainly not in favour of schools disregarding homework because of home facilities. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that they have to provide the necessary support and facilities during lunch breaks and after school, and through breakfast clubs and so on. The school must do the best that it can. But I caution him against measuring every school in London against the London Oratory, which is not exactly a community comprehensive school of the sort that I have in my constituency. It takes pupils from a wide range across London. After all, as a faith school, it is entitled to select a proportion of its intake.</p>

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="08062578000334"><a name="80625h0009.htm_spnew1"><a name="08062578000561"><b>Mr. Gibb:</b>
 I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the London Oratory. It is a faith school and it does take in pupils from a wide area of London, but it has a socially diverse mix of pupils. The mix may not be as diverse as some schools but, nevertheless, it is diverse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para9"><a name="08062578000335">The curriculum at the school is very academic. It is based around the foundation subjects, and teachers have the challenge and enjoyment of teaching their subject at A-level as well as to pupils as young as 11 or, in some cases, as young as seven. They also teach less able children in their own subject and children with special needs&#151;there is a special needs unit at the London Oratory. In all cases, the atmosphere is one of good behaviour, respect for others and hard work, and that is why the school has no problem recruiting high-calibre teachers and why its staff turnover is low.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para10"><a name="08062578000336">To take on directly the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, the same ethos applies at Mossbourne Community academy in Hackney&#151;I believe that it is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington&#151;where 50 per cent. of the school&#146;s intake qualifies for free school meals and 40 per cent. speak English as a second language. It has the same focus on academic standards and achievement, the same approach to behaviour and uniforms and the same high expectations for the children. I believe that when GCSEs are taken for the first time next year, the results will approach those of the London Oratory. The only difference between the London Oratory and Mossbourne academy is the age of the school, with the former being more than 100 years old and the latter just four or five years old.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para11"><a name="08062578000337">If we are serious about raising educational standards in London, we need to look at both those schools and ensure that we replicate their approach across all schools in the capital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para12"><a name="08062578000338">The hon. Lady raised some important issues about ethnic diversity among the teaching profession. In London, about 11 per cent. of teachers are from an ethnic minority. The proportion is far lower than the population that they serve: across London, about one fifth of pupils in primary schools are from an ethnic minority. We need to understand the reasons for the discrepancy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para13"><a name="08062578000339">Many teachers from ethnic minorities have reported having to deal with incidents of racial harassment or discrimination. An internet survey carried out by the Teacher Support Network in 2006 found that 61 per cent. of the 238 respondents reported being harassed or discriminated against by managers within the school. That is totally unacceptable, and of course will deter someone from entering the teaching profession. There is also evidence that teachers are encountering racism in the classroom. Raising standards of behaviour in our schools is key. We have to give head teachers the powers they need to exclude persistently disruptive and abusive children. Poor behaviour is one of the prime reasons that teachers give for leaving the profession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para14"><a name="08062578000340">We should also consider whether educational opportunities for many children from ethnic minorities are as available to them as they are to the rest of the population. Schools in the inner cities, which have tended to be weaker and to have lower expectations than schools elsewhere, tend to be the ones that serve poorer populations and those from ethnic minorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para15"><a name="08062578000341">In my view, the school must be regarded as being at fault, not the children. At Mossbourne community academy, 80 per cent. of the children are from an ethnic minority and 50 per cent. qualify for free school meals. However, having visited that school, it is difficult to distinguish it from one of the better performing independent schools: its only distinguishing feature is its modernity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para16"><a name="08062578000342">Despite all that has been achieved in London schools, more needs to be done to raise standards. Some 20 per cent. of pupils are still not achieving level 4 in English at key stage 2; 24 per cent. are not achieving level 4 in maths; 52 per cent. are not achieving five or more GCSEs at grades A to C, including English and maths; and the average A-level score per candidate in London was 259 in 2006, compared with 289 nationally. High expectations and structured, consistent behaviour policies are key to raising standards and being able to recruit high-calibre teachers. We also need to make it easier for new schools to be established by parents and by education  <br>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) on securing this debate. I thank her for raising the important issue of the teaching work force in London and particularly for mentioning the levels of achievement of black boys. She has championed that cause and has real expertise in that area and it is right that she should continue to challenge us on the issue. If she wants to meet me and the Training and Development Agency for Schools to discuss teacher recruitment further, I should be happy to do so to tap into her expertise.</p>

Friend said about the area of the country that I represent, I was brought up in this city, but in outer London rather than inner London. Our capital city is, as she described it, a paradox of wealth and disadvantage in close proximity. It is an international powerhouse of business, innovation and economic success, yet it houses some of the most deprived areas in the country. The Government are committed to treating those pockets and concentrations of deprivation to lift people out of poverty through education, among other things, give them the opportunities to succeed and ensure that those opportunities are for all, not just luck of the draw. That is what this Government stands for: removing the juxtaposition of privilege and disadvantage that exists not only in our London communities, but can exist as a division between our schools, too. I am grateful to all hon. Members for paying tribute to the London Challenge programme, which has gone a long way to making that happen.</p>

Now, London is ahead on both counts, improvement across the capital's schools is faster than anywhere else and we are closing the gap. On the GCSE measure, there has been an extraordinary 24.5 per cent. improvement in inner London schools since 1997.</p>

 Sorry, I mean of course my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn). I am grateful for his kind comments in this regard. It is important that we continue such investment. However, what makes the biggest difference between a good education and an average one is the quality of our teachers. Investing in that human resource&#151;in our professionals&#151;is vital if this country is to become a world leader in education: it is vital for the transformation of local communities, with children in school learning and fully aware of those who live around them, and vital for our young people, who will be given a real chance in life to fulfil their potential, realise their talents and be all that they can be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para22"><a name="08062578000351">We inherited a decline in people taking up teacher training. By 1999, numbers of new trainees had been in free fall for eight consecutive years. We have managed to break that fall by introducing incentives and training bursaries. Now, we have more teachers than ever before. In England, we have almost 2,000 more full-time equivalent regular teachers than last year and more than 40,000 more than a decade ago, which is almost two more teachers for every school in England on average, and in London, local authority schools have 7,500 more than a decade ago, boosted by 6,500 occasional and full-time equivalent unqualified teachers, instructors, overseas-trained teachers&#151;I will talk about those later&#151;and so on. Last year, the teaching sector was the second most popular choice for graduates leaving university, which is a massive step forward from where we were. Recruits are up, vacancy rates are down and even in London the vacancy rate is only 1.2 per cent., against the national average of 0.6 per cent. So I would hardly call it a crisis. However, there is, of course, more to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para23"><a name="08062578000352">In addressing some of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, I start by saying that, of course, my Dorset constituency does not reflect the ethnic make-up of and rich diversity in London. I represent an almost homogenous white community, except for the young offenders&#146; institution on Portland. The vast majority of the inmates there are from London and are black and many of them have special educational needs and were excluded from school. I have visited that institution and talked to the governor and the prison staff, who tell me that some of the problems in London are reflected in the prison, in terms of gang trouble and so on. Talking to the young people there and hearing about the experience of growing up in London reinforces my determination to do more along the lines that my hon. Friend has described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para24"><a name="08062578000353">We need to continue to address underachievement with black boys. The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) was right to say that, after Gypsy and Traveller children, the biggest area of underachievement is actually white working class boys, but there is still a significant issue with black boys that we need to address.</p>

 This is a much-contested piece of statistical information. What we might call the league table varies in different parts of the country, but in London black boys are actually still the lowest-achieving group.</p>

 I do not have the detailed breakdown for London. My hon. Friend may well be right and there is no reason for me to disagree with her on that. Like the hon. Member for Yeovil, I think that it is important that we pay tribute to some of our positive role models, such as Sir William Atkinson at the Phoenix school, whom I congratulate on his knighthood. I was delighted that Tim Campbell, the former winner of &#147;The Apprentice&#148;, who grew up in Newham in east London, is now working with us on promoting the diplomas and is a positive role model. I was delighted today to visit the Guru Nanak secondary school in London, the only Sikh secondary school in the country, which achieves 73 per cent. five A* to C grades, including in English and maths, and almost 100 per cent. of the pupils are achieving at that level despite having English as an additional language. That is a fantastic school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para25"><a name="08062578000356">A lot of the things that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said about his favourite schools, I could say about Guru Nanak and I recommend it to him. It is an example of a school with a high proportion of ethnic minorities doing well, but in that case they are largely from the Asian sub-continent by ethnic origin rather than being black Afro-Caribbean pupils. It can be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para26"><a name="08062578000357">My hon. Friend made some points about governors. We are addressing the matter with a review of governance, and part of our agenda is to examine community cohesion and representation on governing bodies. I am also interested in the role of parent councils. I had a meeting yesterday with some people from Hackney with expertise in parent councils, which have a role in reflecting the parent voice more accurately and the range of parent voices properly to reflect the community</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para27"><a name="08062578000358">The issue of more male teachers is equally important, and my hon.

48 per cent. and there are now 43 per cent. We are concerned about that, and when recruiting we are trying to use more images of men teaching. We are trying in various ways in our recruitment advertising to promote the profession to men without breaking discrimination law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para28"><a name="08062578000359">Similarly, in trying to recruit more minority ethnic background teachers, there is an agenda for widening access, but the figures are more encouraging. In 1999, there were 6 per cent., in 2003-04 there were 9 per cent., and in 2006-07 there were 12 per cent. The latest recruitment figures for initial teacher training have exceeded the 10 per cent. target and we are recruiting close to 13 per cent. into the profession. We take that very seriously with TDA, but I shall be happy to discuss it further with TDA and my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para29"><a name="08062578000360">We can and should do more through public relations and otherwise, as well as with refugee teachers, and my hon. Friend has raised that in the past. The Employability Forum has recommended that refugee professionals wishing to access jobs in education are helped to do so, and we have provided more than &#163;1 million for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para30"><a name="08062578000361">There are issues about overseas-trained teachers, to which I would respond if I had time, because there is a good answer to be had. Issues about housing have been raised and I could respond, but housing costs in Dorset are prohibitive for newly qualified teachers, so the problem is not just in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="80625h0009.htm_para31"><a name="08062578000362">The Government have done more than just address the previous decade&#146;s fall in teacher numbers; we have done more than just redress the balance of reward and recognition; we have included individuals from a more diverse cultural pool; and we have started to shape the educational landscape to help high standards to flourish and to weed out underperformance. We must do more, and I am happy to work with my hon. Friend on that, and to get rid of the juxtaposition of wealth and disadvantage, and of uneven opportunity that London epitomises so that our education society is fairer.</p>

 I recognise that Post Office Ltd faces a big challenge to right-size its network for the 21st century. As we have heard many times, traditional services, including benefit payments, are now available in other ways online or directly through banks. People who were Teddy boys in the 1950s are now pensioners, and as each generation progresses towards retirement, fewer of their number will do things in the traditional way that the Post Office represents. More will want to conduct their business online. There are other pressures on Departments to do things cost- effectively. Indeed, MPs are under pressure from the Treasury and taxpayers, and the wish list for Government support is probably two or three times as long as the public purse will stretch to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para0"><a name="08062578000364">In 2002, we thought that the urban reinvention programme in Plymouth had achieved the right size of post office network for the city. Indeed, for reasons that I shall set out, I believe that we did achieve a sustainable network of post offices for Plymouth. I believe that that remains the case, and that we are being asked to contribute over and above that to the wider network sustainability, which is much more challenging for the rural network, particularly in Devon. I cannot be sure of that because Post Office Ltd does not make the figures available on that basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000365">Plymouth is a special city. It is special because of the particular challenges that it has had to meet over the past decade or so, and the way in which it has risen to meet those challenges, but also because of its ambitions for the future. We maintain a truly extraordinary regeneration agenda, and have growth point status which will be equivalent to a new market town. That regeneration is a response to the situation that I inherited in my constituency when I was elected in 1997. Plymouth, Sutton contained the poorest ward in England according to the index of local conditions. Today, Plymouth as a whole is rated the 76th most deprived local authority in the country, with a high population of low income households.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para2"><a name="08062578000366">As the largest city on the south coast of England, Plymouth is also the largest centre of population in the counties of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. It has a population of about 250,000, but that population base does not give us the critical mass to support the range and quality of facilities found in other major urban areas. There are ambitious and well-laid plans to increase the population from its present level to 300,000 or more by around 2026, with about 30,000 new homes in the next 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000367">The Devon area plan on post offices was launched in May 2008 and is open for consultation until 30 June. Devon currently has a network of 379 post offices. After the review, it will have 333, as 45 are scheduled for closure and a number will be replaced by outreach services. Four of the scheduled closures are in my constituency, leaving 43 in Plymouth, including 14 in my constituency.</p>

should give pause for thought. Some of the developments are going up across the city as we debate; indeed, there are four developments in the catchment area of Pennycomequick post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para5"><a name="08062578000369">There are also other important considerations when it comes to the Pennycomequick post office. The distance to and from alternative post offices is very different from that laid out in the access report accompanying the plan. Cecil street was described as being 0.7 miles away, when it is in fact 1 mile away, or 1.1 miles on the return because of how the roads work. Mutley plain was down as 0.7 miles away, when it is in fact 1.4 miles away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para6"><a name="08062578000370">Cecil street is difficult to reach on foot. Residents must cross Victoria park and face 49 steps and a steep hill to reach the post office. I went to a meeting that was well attended, considering that it was early on a wet Saturday morning, where many people told me of their fears and difficulties. One elderly lady over 80 had been mugged on the way to that post office and now uses the Pennycomequick branch. Several older people expressed similar fears and experiences. The community served by Cecil street post office is deprived, and it is possible that the post office has been protected for that reason. I have visited it. It deals with a number of drug addicts and other difficult-to-serve customers, which is a worry for some of the people who have contacted me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para7"><a name="08062578000371">My survey had a large response. There were more than 500 responses on all post offices from across the city, and half of them dealt with Pennycomequick post office. I also had lots of letters, including some from community groups and sports teams supported by the sub-postmaster, Abdul Terasder. He is clearly popular and well thought of. There were lots of comments about the helpfulness of the staff, who also work with local businesses, which wrote to express their concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para8"><a name="08062578000372">A large new sheltered housing complex is being built at St. Barnabas and new housing in Central park. The report places the post office in the 500-to-749 transactions per week bracket, but I have been there on several occasions recently, and it seems a great deal busier. Beaumont road post office, on which I received about a third of the survey forms, serves and is in the middle of what I would describe as a natural community. There are some 6,100 adults on the electoral register in its catchment area, so it will be like closing the only post office in a town the size of Crediton or Cullompton. As for the other post offices, four out of 10 households in the area do not own a car. It is in the 1,000 to 1,500 weekly transactions bracket, and many customers migrated to Beaumont road when three nearby post offices were closed in the 2002 urban reinvention programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para9"><a name="08062578000373">There is no bus service from Beaumont road to Embankment road. Buses are available to Royal Parade, but post office users would then need to negotiate two busy roads before reaching a very busy post office. In reality, there is no parking for elderly or disabled people at either of the alternative post offices, because parking is on the arterial road to Embankment road. Although a car park is situated on the opposite side of the large city centre roundabout at St. Andrew&#146;s cross, it is almost always full. St. Andrew&#146;s cross is not a sub-post office, but a Crown post office, and is often very busy&#151;10 to 20 minutes in the queue is not uncommon. It is my local post office, so I know that its size means that the personal touch, care and attention shown by David and  <br>

Diana on Beaumont road, about which so many have written to me, is not likely to be possible, even though its staff are hard-working and knowledgeable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para10"><a name="08062578000374">Walking is not an option for most people. It is 0.9 miles to St. Andrew&#146;s&#151;I have checked it and agree with the branch access report on that one. From the top of Mount Gould to the post office is another 0.9 miles, which means a walk of almost 2 miles to St. Andrew&#146;s cross, and 1.7 miles to Embankment road. A sheltered housing development and an Age Concern residential complex are situated within 2 minutes of the branch, as too is Mount Gould hospital, which caters for elderly people and those with learning difficulties. Beaumont road post office works with the hospital as part of its skills development, which is made possible by the ease of access and smaller, friendlier atmosphere of the sub-post office. Neither St. Andrew&#146;s cross, nor&#151;I fear&#151;Embankment road, could offer that, given the access difficulties. I am very concerned about the errors made in the access reports on both branches; it suggests that Post Office Ltd&#146;s homework was pretty sloppy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para11"><a name="08062578000375">Post Office Ltd&#146;s branch access report on St. Levan valley post office points out the lack of bus services between both its suggested alternatives and the St. Levan branch. It also notes that the terrain is very hilly&#151;that cannot be stressed enough. The branch is at the very bottom of a steep-sided valley, with hills that are almost vertical immediately behind the post office, including Ryder road, on which it is situated. The incline is probably 1:3, but when I walk up it, it seems almost 1:2. Will the Minister issue crampons to the post office customers for when they visit that post office? Neither alternative is accessible to elderly or infirm residents, and I have researched further how they manage with their general shopping. They do not tend to shop locally, but are often taken shopping, and removing their local post office will mean that they will have to rely on others for help in collecting their pensions, sending eBay parcels or just buying a stamp. Although parking at Wolseley is easy, parking in Stoke village is not. A couple of spaces are provided on the arterial road, but they are rarely available, and when they are, neither is easy to park in. It is a busy post office with 1,000 to 1,500 transactions per week, and again the care and attention from sub-postmistress Polly and her team is greatly valued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para12"><a name="08062578000376">West Hoe post office is also the local general store&#151;a true general store that is much needed and used by the community. Little other community general shopping is available in the area, which is home to about 1,500 people&#151;the fact that such a small community post office processes 500 to 750 transactions a week demonstrates how well used by the community it is. The demographic for retired people in the area is 19 per cent., which is high, and half of all households do not own a car. Postmaster Ravi is interested in taking on some of the new work that Post Office Ltd is considering, such as biometrics. He is a progressive and enthusiastic operator and would be willing to work with Post Office Ltd. Closing that post office would be a lost opportunity in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para13"><a name="08062578000377">I have also spoken to Post Office Ltd about &#147;Post Office Light&#148;, which is a new concept being piloted that I think would work well in St. Levan valley and West  <br>

Hoe, and which both post offices have mentioned to me as being something that might enable some level of service to continue in their communities, should all else fail. If that becomes the only option, those post offices should be supported to stay open until the new options can be explored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para14"><a name="08062578000378">Finally, it is important to note again that Post Office Ltd has a difficult job. The Government have agreed to a cash injection of &#163;1.7 billion, which is an awful lot of taxpayers&#146; money, into sub-post offices. A condition is that POL must limit&#151;slim down&#151;the network, so that that money is used to create viable post offices, and not be spread so thinly that all post offices are once again put under threat. However, my case to the Minister is that it is uniquely unfair to expect Plymouth and its particularly significant challenge of regeneration and growth&#151;there is not another place in the country that has the extent of that challenge&#151;to be brigaded with one of the most sparse rural networks in the country. Of the 43 post offices proposed for closure, some 13 have weekly transactions above the 500 bracket. That includes seven post offices with fewer than 49 weekly transactions, one with fewer than 100 and four with fewer than 200. How many tiny post offices, escaping this time round, simply cannot be viable in future, whereas in Plymouth we seem to be closing viable ones in a growth area, a lot of them in my constituency? I will repeat, business seems unlikely to migrate&#151;certainly not at the 80 per cent. level mentioned in a recent edition of Post Office Ltd&#146;s news of the network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para15"><a name="08062578000379">I do not think that it is right for the taxpayer to pay the Post Office &#163;17 to issue a stamp, as someone suggested. We cannot simply subsidise every post office without thought for cost. That does not mean that well used, highly regarded post offices should close. I understand the arguments about rural post offices and their importance to villages and small communities, but urban communities also depend on post offices, especially in cities such as Plymouth, where people lead very local lives, with many on low incomes and benefits. As I said, the proposal is to remove one post office serving an area the size of a small market town. I believe that all four of those selected in my constituency are or have the potential to be profitable. They are heavily used&#151;1,000 to 1,500 transactions per week in Beaumont road and St Levan&#146;s valley, and 500 to 750 in Pennycomequick, which is growing, and likewise in West Hoe. Meanwhile, how many of the 1,600 post offices that serve fewer than 20 customers a day, costing &#163;8 for every transaction, will be left under the Devon plan?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para16"><a name="08062578000380">I think that POL could well be cutting off its nose to spite its face when it comes to closing those post offices. A large proportion of the business will certainly not go from Beaumont road to other post offices&#151;it will simply be lost. I think the same will be true of the other post offices, especially Pennycomequick, in view of the particular problems that I spelled out. In the case of Plymouth, Post Office Ltd ought to give us sufficiently detailed figures to allow us to appraise whether our post office network is sustainable when viewed across the city, and how it can become so as our population grows at the fast rate of 2,000 people per year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para17"><a name="08062578000381">Plymouth is of course included in the Devon area plan, which means that we have a city with many deprivation and regeneration growth challenges brigaded with a rural county that must have the biggest of  <br>

sparsity challenges. I have based my arguments not just on the individual value of specific post offices in my constituency&#151;valued though they are&#151;but the overall future viability of the cluster. I honestly believe that, far from providing a more sustainable network, including those post offices in the closure programme will damage the network. Indeed, two of those post offices are among the third in my constituency that I would never have guessed could have been at risk when thinking about it before the programme was announced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para18"><a name="08062578000382">I hope that the Minister can look at the arguments. Better that POL should face up to some hard decisions now than it should seek to lead the Minister into believing that it has done so only to find that, because it loses much more than it gains from the Plymouth closures, it has to revisit the whole idea of closures in the near future. Instead of making the network sustainable, it is making it less viable. Quite simply, the POL&#146;s Devon area plan has, for all the reasons set out, got the balance wrong.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship today, Mrs. Dean. I want to begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy) on securing the debate. She spoke eloquently about the challenges facing the city of Plymouth and the way that it is rising to meet them with ambitious plans for demographic growth. I am also pleased that she acknowledged that life in Britain had changed a lot in recent decades. The image of the Teddy boy pensioner will stay with me, but she is actually right because what we think of as the traditional image of the pensioner is changing over time, due to lengthy and, we hope, more prosperous and healthier retirements for most people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para19"><a name="08062578000384">One of the features of these debates is often the ease with which the Government are blamed for the consequences of the changes in life that my hon. Friend set out. The Government have a duty to respond to those changes, but it would be wrong if they placed themselves in the way of modernisation, choice or change in how people live their lives. She talked in great detail about the individual post office closure plans in her constituency. She will know that, as a Minister, I do not play a role in decisions to close or retain individual post offices. That is quite rightly a matter for Post Office Ltd, after the consultation process that she is currently taking part in, involving Postwatch, local people, MPs and other representatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para20"><a name="08062578000385">What is happening in Plymouth is part of the wider programme that was announced last year by the Secretary of State at what was then the Department for Trade and Industry: up to 2,500 closures, with 500 new outreach services planned alongside. The reason the Secretary of State had to come to such a difficult judgment is that some of the lifestyle changes that my hon. Friend talked about are having a profound impact on Post Office finances. The post office network loses around &#163;500,000 every day and it has lost 4 million customers a week. At the extreme she is right; this involves small rural branches with few customers, where the subsidy per transaction can be up to &#163;17, but alongside that, in urban areas we have 1,000 post offices, with six or more branches  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para21"><a name="08062578000386">Let us look at some of the changes that are taking place. Eight out of 10 pensioners are now having their pension paid directly into their bank account. New services such as car tax online did not even exist a few years ago. One million people a month now renew their car tax online&#151;that is 1 million people a month on one service alone who are no longer going to the post office to carry out that transaction. In addition, there is competition from other networks such as PayPoint, which won the contract for the BBC TV licence. There is lifestyle change in how we expect to receive money, there is technological change in terms of the use of the internet and the way in which people communicate with one another, and there is competition from other networks. Those three things all mean that our post office network faces big challenges in terms of the size of the network and the distribution of the branches.</p>

 I am following carefully the arguments that the Minister is advancing, which are familiar to me. I ask him to consider two points: first, in respect of the BBC licence, am I not right in thinking that PayPoint has perhaps over-extended itself in describing how well it can do that, when the collection of BBC licences is actually going down? There is a value-for-money issue there. Secondly, is the Minister not also concerned about, and will he deal with, the value-for-money issues that I raised? He and the Secretary of State are responsible for the &#163;1.7 billion investment and I do not think that what is happening in Devon represents good value for money.</p>

 The point I am making about competition is that Post Office Ltd can no longer be guaranteed the streams of work that it used to rely on when that competition was not there. That is the point that I make about PayPoint. My hon. Friend asked about the &#163;1.7 billion and she also made a point in her speech about the right size of the network. Before this closure programme began there were about 14,000 post offices in the country. If Post Office Ltd had run just as a commercial network without Government support, the number of branches would be around 4,000. Three out of four post offices run at a cost to Post Office Ltd.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="80625h0010.htm_para22"><a name="08062578000389">My hon. Friend said she thought that the branches in her constituency were profitable. I take part in a lot of these debates and every MP says that the post offices that they are talking about are profitable. However, three out of four post offices in the network are not and rely on subsidy to stay open. Without the high level of Government support on behalf of the public, thousands more post offices would be under threat. The Government subsidy is &#163;150 million a year, which is part of an overall programme of &#163;1.7 billion. Without that support, thousands more branches would be under threat. I accept that that may be cold comfort to somebody affected by post office closures, but given the size of the challenge facing the network, the Government response has been very large indeed.</p>

 It may help my hon. Friend if I outline the loss per branch in rural and urban areas. Average losses range from about &#163;12,000 per year for some rural post office branches to about &#163;20,000 for some urban branches. She said that Post Office Ltd would not give her figures on this matter. My understanding is that it will give figures on the cost per branch to MPs. It is sometimes wary of giving full details of sub-postmasters&#146; pay or other commercially confidential information, particularly given that it is up against competition from other networks for part of its business.</p>

She rightly and understandably talked about distances, transport routes, gradients and so on. Such concerns are precisely the reason for the consultation. It enables the public and hon. Members to make those points to Post Office Ltd. If it has got it wrong, there is a process of review involving Postwatch, which can ask Post Office Ltd to look again at particular branches. I do not pretend that the consultation is just a referendum on whether people want to see post office closures. The decision was announced by the Secretary of State last year. I am sure that Post Office Ltd will have heard the points that my hon. Friend has made today. It is right that hon. Members can make representations about such things.</p>

I am sure that my hon. Friend will argue that her area is unique. Many hon. Members argue that their constituencies are unique in one way or another. Although it is never popular to close post offices, I hope that the area plan process is not unfair to any part of the country.</p>

More than 99 per cent. of customers will see no change or will remain within a mile in road distance of the alternative post office. Although this is a difficult process, most customers will see no change to their local post office.</p>

 As I said, the points that my hon. Friend made about transport and future house building are perfectly fair with regard to a consultation. The consultation exists so that information like that can be fed back to Post Office Ltd, and I think that she will ensure that the Post Office is aware of the things that she has said, not only in this debate but outside the House.</p>

That is a decision for the Department for Work and Pensions, not for me, but I understand how important it is to the post office network. New products and new reasons to come through the door will also be needed. I have set out the position with regard to pensioners, as eight out of 10 no longer collect their pension at the post office. Indeed, that figure is now nine out of 10 for new pensioners, so there have to be new reasons to use the local post office.</p>

Friend is that the Post Office has been making significant progress on developing new products. It is now the largest foreign currency dealer in the country and is expanding its role in car and household insurance. She also mentioned a potentially significant area when she referred to her local sub-postmaster who was interested in biometrics. Although the Post Office, like any other body, would have to bid for the contract properly and win it, it could potentially play a role in relation to the biometric data and information necessary for driving licences, passports and possibly identity cards in the future. That could be a significant area of work in the future, so there are reasons for the Post Office to look forward.</p>

 Part of the future lies in finding new ways to deliver services, and outreach in rural areas has been part of that. What my hon.

I appreciate that this is difficult for my hon.

 I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this vital issue with the Minister today. I shall start by setting the debate in context. Eradicating fuel poverty is not only a moral issue, but a statutory requirement. In 2001, the Government pledged to end fuel poverty for vulnerable households by 2010 and for all households by 2016. They are almost certainly set to fail in that duty and are facing court action from Friends of the Earth and Help the Aged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para2"><a name="08062578000401">Figures released by Age Concern and National Energy Action suggest that around 4.5 million people in Britain are currently living in fuel poverty. NEA also estimates that 12.7 per cent. of households in the east of England live in fuel poverty. However, in some of the more isolated areas of south-west Norfolk that figure might be twice as high. I am hugely grateful to NEA for providing me with those figures. The latest fuel poverty advisory group report reached a scathing conclusion. It stated that</p>
<a name="80625h0011.htm_brev0"><a name="08062578000482"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it appeared as if the Government had given up rather than looking hard at the position and re-assessing its policies in a radical way when the fuel poverty target started to look very difficult.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000402">How does the Minister respond to the charge that the Government have been complacent on fuel poverty? Does he agree that if the Government had taken sensible, positive action when times were good and oil prices were much lower, people would not be facing the difficulties that we are talking about today?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para4"><a name="08062578000403">Media focus has been principally on the rising cost of motoring. In south-west Norfolk&#151;a largely rural area&#151;public transport links are very limited. The private car is a necessity rather than a luxury for many people, and never more so than now, when essential rural services are closing down. We have lost rural banks and shops, and my constituency will shortly lose 15 sub-post office branches. People are forced to use their cars to go to work, and even to buy a stamp, and to go to the bank or buy food at ever-increasing prices. Trips are increasingly expensive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para5"><a name="08062578000404">Constituents are starting to tell me that they cannot afford to drive to work, but they have no other option. Why is fuel at the pump in the UK so expensive? The Government have pointed the finger at growing demand and higher oil prices, but the extortionate tax placed on fuel by the Government also plays a huge part. Before tax, the UK has the second cheapest unleaded petrol and the cheapest diesel in Europe, but we pay the highest fuel tax. A recent report from accountants Grant Thornton indicates that the recent rise in oil prices will generate more than &#163;1 billion in VAT on petrol&#151;more income than the postponed 2p increase in duty. Some estimates have put the figure at nearer &#163;5 billion this year. The rise in duty has been postponed only until October, and hangs like the sword of Damocles over our heads. Is it not time for the Government to confirm that they will scrap that next rise?</p>

already sky-high price increases, we are being warned that gas and oil could face increases of a massive 40 per cent. this winter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para7"><a name="08062578000406">But what about heating oil? Of all the regions, the east of England has the largest number of households with oil-fired central heating because they have no access to mains gas. According to National Energy Action, at least 50 per cent. of households in south-west Norfolk have no access to the gas network, compared with only 10.3 per cent. in England as a whole. The price of heating oil has risen from about 32p a litre last June to over 60p now. People on fixed incomes are being brought to their knees by these rising costs. Recent figures have shown that the poorest quarter of pensioner households saw their income rise by less than 1 per cent. last year. How can they cope when heating oil nearly doubles? Is it a surprise that oil suppliers increasingly have to come to the rescue of those whose tank has run dry because they waited and hoped for a price reduction? Unlike those for gas and electricity users, there are no social tariffs to help heating oil customers. The situation will only get worse as winter approaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para8"><a name="08062578000407">Shockingly, National Energy Action has confirmed that the number of excess winter deaths in south-west Norfolk was almost double the national average in 2005-06. Where are we three years on? I have had stacks of letters from depressed constituents, many of whom are elderly, who increasingly face the dilemma of choosing between feeding themselves and heating their home. One elderly couple wrote to me recently and said that they could no longer afford to heat their house during the winter. Last year they needed to turn their heating down to a temperature well below the recommended level for the elderly. They do not know how they will cope next winter and dread running out of oil. Another elderly couple wrote to say that the husband is disabled and needs the heating on 24 hours a day all year round, but their pension will no longer stretch that far. What are they to do? It is a desperate situation, which calls for viable and effective solutions. We cannot just shrug and blame OPEC or City speculators.</p>

One of the Government&#146;s solutions to fuel poverty has been the Warm Front programme. The Minister is not now listening. If he did, he might hear what I am saying and be constructive in his response, which I want to hear. Why have the Government reduced Warm Front&#146;s budget for the next three years when they will almost certainly fail to meet their legally binding fuel poverty targets of 2001? The reduction amounts to &#163;50 million this year alone, and to set the budget cut in context, the Government receive &#163;400 million a year from VAT paid by domestic energy consumers.

In April, they secured the agreement of the big six energy companies to increase their collective spend on social assistance to &#163;150 million a year by 2010 under the carbon emissions reduction target scheme. I am concerned that those receiving help under the CERT scheme will not receive the same help that Warm Front offers. CERT&#146;s primary remit is to promote reductions in household carbon emissions; it does not aim to end fuel poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para14"><a name="08062578000413">I am not disputing the importance of improving energy efficiency when it comes to fuel poverty, but does the Minister agree that the Government must not allow their focus on reducing carbon emissions to subvert their duty to end fuel poverty? Elderly pensioners who receive improved insulation under CERT will hardly be helped if they then need a new central heating system to take them out of fuel poverty. Interestingly, the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group&#146;s report confirms:</p>
<a name="80625h0011.htm_brev3"><a name="08062578000485"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Policies on climate change will raise prices and will make the fuel poverty targets harder to achieve.&#148;</p>

What are the Minister&#146;s thoughts on that clash of interests?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para16"><a name="08062578000415">The fuel-poor are able to apply for grants under the Warm Front scheme and to receive help from energy suppliers under CERT. However, CERT-registered installers who approach households are not obliged to tell customers that they may also be entitled to a Warm Front grant. Does the Minister accept that more should be done to encourage a joined-up approach between energy suppliers and Warm Front, so that vulnerable households do not miss out unnecessarily? Will the Minister also confirm the marketing policy of CERT-registered installers? It is terribly important to find out, so that people understand the installers&#146; objectives. CERT installers approach households that they believe may benefit from improved insulation, but their approach has left many households in isolated rural communities in my constituency out in the cold. Unsurprisingly, installers are less likely to approach homes that are in severe fuel poverty, simply because it might not be financially efficient for them to do so&#151;they have to travel further, with all the added costs of doing so. Does the Minister accept that the Government must address that problem if they are to continue their shift towards energy supplier-led solutions?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para17"><a name="08062578000416">I should like to cover another Warm Front issue. Constituents have complained that work carried out by Warm Front contractors is often more expensive than work quoted for by local contractors. That seems to be a common complaint throughout the country. As a result, grants given to Warm Front applicants do not cover all the costs, and applicants have to pay the balance themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para19"><a name="08062578000418">In 2001, the Government set high goals for their fuel poverty strategy. They promised to eradicate fuel poverty by 2016. So far, they have fallen short of delivering on that promise. Will the Minister consider the plight of those who live in rural communities, particularly those in my constituency who are up against crippling prices both at the pump and in their home? I also ask the Minister to consider how we can help those on fixed incomes who rely on heating oil to keep warm or even to stay alive, because without help winter 2008 could be devastating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para20"><a name="08062578000419">I hope that the Minister will take this debate in the spirit in which I have presented it, and not come back with a diatribe of what the last Government may have done or Governments before them. As a Member of Parliament, I am dealing with the current Government. If the Minister wants to put it to the country, I suggest that he talks to the Prime Minister. I would like a positive response to a debate on a current issue that has resulted from decisions taken by the present Government.</p>

 I showed exasperation earlier because I have some knowledge of the subject, and I have a sense of history. Although most of my speech will be about what we intend to do, I am proud of our record. I am not complacent about what now needs to be done, but I find it rather difficult to take lectures from a member of a political party&#151;the hon. Gentleman may not know of its record&#151;that when it left office felt it appropriate for single pensioners on income support to survive on &#163;69 a week.

 We are indeed. The hon. Gentleman wants to stir up the politics. I always consider the record when analysing what hon. Members are telling me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para21"><a name="08062578000429">Instead of &#163;69&#151;I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is defending that record&#151;the single pensioner on pension credit now receives &#163;124. To me, that seems to be part of the issue that we are discussing: in attacking what we call fuel poverty, we need to recognise that a number of mechanisms, including income maintenance mechanisms, need to be deployed. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has given me the opportunity to set the record straight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para22"><a name="08062578000430">I am acutely aware of the impact of rising energy prices on the elderly and families on low incomes. I shall say more about the action that we are taking to tackle fuel poverty, but first I shall respond to the points made about energy prices, which is the serious context of today&#146;s debate. The high prices are the direct result of the unprecedented global competition for fossil fuels. That has pushed up gas prices; in the UK, those high gas prices have helped to push up electricity prices, due to the relatively high proportion of electricity generated from gas. Our high prices are also caused, to some degree, by poor liberalisation within the European market. Consequently, the Government strongly support the European Commission&#146;s ongoing efforts to improve competition in the internal market. At the recent Energy Ministers Council in Luxembourg, we were pleased to help the move towards legal unbundling, which is a halfway house to the liberalisation that we in the UK have been seeking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para23"><a name="08062578000431">Increased gas storage can also help to reduce future pressures on UK gas and electricity prices. There are now 10 gas and liquefied natural gas storage projects in the UK that have gained consent and are under, or are awaiting, construction. The Government are taking steps to improve and streamline the regulatory regimes for constructing gas storage facilities through the Planning Bill and the Energy Bill, which are currently before Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para24"><a name="08062578000432">Heating oil is of particular concern. Prices closely track changes in crude oil prices, so the increases can largely be explained by the rises in crude prices of more than 100 per cent. in the past year. Because there is no duty on heating oil&#151;there is 5 per cent. VAT&#151;the Government can do little directly to reduce its cost. The hon. Gentleman will know that our Prime Minister was in Jeddah at the weekend, at the request of the King of Saudi Arabia, attending an international conference to discuss the reasons for high oil prices internationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="80625h0011.htm_para25"><a name="08062578000433">Tackling fuel poverty is a priority for the Government, and we have in place a range of measures to help vulnerable households that are struggling to pay their energy bills. I am certainly not complacent about that. Since 2000, &#163;20 billion has been spent on fuel poverty benefits and programmes. The hon. Gentleman may wish that more had been spent, but I hope that he will concede that &#163;20 billion spent on benefits and fuel efficiency programmes is a great deal of money. Warm Front is the Government&#146;s main scheme for tackling fuel poverty in England: it provides grants to vulnerable households for energy efficiency and heating measures. Funding for Warm Front will be just over &#163;800 million for 2008-11; that is a significant investment in addition to the approximately &#163;1.6 billion that the Government have committed to date.</p>

 I should have said before, Mrs. Dean, that it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship during what has been a fairly raucous discussion so far. I am sure that behaviour will improve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para1"><a name="08062578000437">Since 2000, Warm Front has assisted more than 1.7 million vulnerable households. In addition, the carbon emissions reduction target means that the major energy suppliers are now obliged to meet carbon reduction targets, which will lead to the investment of about &#163;1.5 billion over the next three years to install better insulation, improve heating systems and implement a wide range of other measures to help the elderly and low-income households. I listened very carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said about Warm Front, but the total help available for energy efficiency for the elderly and other low-income households will rise by &#163;680 million, compared with the previous spending period, to about &#163;2.3 billion.</p>

The energy efficiency commitment, which will soon become the carbon emissions reduction target, has a perfectly proper bias towards helping those on lower incomes.</p>

 Will the Minister confirm that the Government have reduced the Warm Front budget for the next three years, with a reduction of &#163;50 million this year alone?</p>

 I was trying to make the point that we need to look at the subject in the round, because with the money committed to CERT, investment in energy efficiency will increase.</p>

 Yes, but the extra money for CERT more than makes up for that. Indeed, we will be seeing enhanced expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para3"><a name="08062578000443">I recognise the particular difficulties for rural communities, which often present greater challenges in tackling fuel poverty. Those without access to mains gas face higher heating bills, and the Government face a challenge in finding ways to help them. Some deprived communities will have encountered difficulties in obtaining gas connections at an affordable price, and it would simply not be economically viable to connect others. Those communities, and the households within them, will be reliant on more expensive or less convenient fuel sources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para4"><a name="08062578000444">The Government have explored the scope, therefore, of helping those communities on two fronts: encouraging gas connections where viable, and considering alternative technologies in other cases. The design and demonstration unit in my Department has successfully developed a model for the provision of gas connections to deprived communities by independent gas transporters. The unit  <br>

has also developed models to provide lower-cost household energy from renewable and other technologies for those deprived communities where gas connections are not economically viable. These approaches are being piloted in deprived communities in the north-east, Yorkshire and Humberside, with the approach chosen being the most appropriate one for the particular community. I should say that the results are very promising and we see scope for rolling out similar projects in other areas.</p>

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="08062578000445"><a name="80625h0012.htm_spnew5"><a name="08062578000592"><b>Christopher Fraser:</b>

 I think that something that I will say shortly will be of some help in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para5"><a name="08062578000447">The work in the north-east, Yorkshire and Humberside suggests that for communities off the gas grid, microgeneration technologies can offer an efficient and cost-effective alternative to mainstream fuels. That is why I recently announced, just a week or so ago, a new pilot project that will create a fuel poverty work stream within what we call the low carbon buildings programme. Some &#163;3 million has been allocated to that pilot, and the work will be undertaken in Wales and in three English regional development agencies to fund the purchase of microgeneration technologies and their installation in households in deprived communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para6"><a name="08062578000448">One of the regions in which we intend to run that pilot is the East of England Development Agency area. I hope that we will see measures that will not only benefit some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents, but show us how we can best use these technologies more widely at a time when we expect the use of renewables in domestic heating to increase considerably. So I hope that that statement will be of some interest to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para7"><a name="08062578000449">It seems to me that in these rural communities, where there are quite isolated households, and given the price of oil, which is at record levels&#151;the price of a barrel of oil has more or less doubled in a year&#151;and the sheer difficulty sometimes of connecting to the grid, microgeneration offers some hope, including technologies such as ground source heat pumps. Through the moneys that we have allocated for the pilot, we wish to test the hypothesis that microgeneration could be a new mechanism to help with fuel poverty. However, the pilot is of course also a mechanism to help other households that are considering which energy technology might suit their particular location.</p>

<p><a name="st_87"><a name="08062578000450"><a name="80625h0012.htm_spnew7"><a name="08062578000594"><b>Christopher Fraser:</b>
 Does the Minister accept that ground source heat pumps require a considerable area of ground to install them in, that a lot of people living in houses in rural areas in my constituency simply do not have the land around them to allow for that sort of technology, and that they therefore have a particular problem that must be overcome?</p>

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="08062578000451"><a name="80625h0012.htm_spnew8"><a name="08062578000595"><b>Malcolm Wicks:</b>
 It is certainly the case that one of the ground source heat pump technologies does require a considerable amount of land, to lay out the pipes as it were, so it is often more suitable for new build. However, there is another kind of heat pump that can be buried in  <br>

the ground, which does not take up so much space. I now recall that they are called vertical ground source heat pumps&#151;I think that my visual suggested a vertical presentation. Such heat pumps could be useful, which is why I want to pilot them in tackling fuel poverty. Before I go on, I am reminded that there are air source heat pumps, as well, which is one of the new technologies around.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para8"><a name="08062578000452">I should add for the record what we are doing on winter fuel payments. We should be proud that the Government have introduced winter fuel payments, which last year helped to keep 11.7 million households in the UK warm in the winter of 2006-07. As alluded to, in this year&#146;s Budget the Government announced an additional one-off payment of &#163;100 to the over-80s, making a total of &#163;400, and another &#163;50 to the over-60s, making a total of &#163;250, which will arrive shortly before winter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para9"><a name="08062578000453">Improving the income of households is another key factor in reducing fuel poverty. That is why we offer benefit entitlement cheques to everyone who applies for the Warm Front grant. In 2007-08 those cheques resulted in an average increase in potential income of over &#163;1,400 a year for those found to qualify for additional support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para10"><a name="08062578000454">The Government announced in the Budget action to investigate and tackle the high cost of energy for those using pre-payment meters. Ofgem is conducting a probe into the energy market and will publish its results in September. If we find that pre-payment meter users are being treated unfairly, we will look to Ofgem and the energy suppliers to provide a solution. If they do not make enough progress by this winter, we are prepared to legislate to reduce the differential between pre-payment meters and other forms of payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para11"><a name="08062578000455">The hon. Gentleman referred to the social tariffs, which the Government have been discussing with the supply companies. Energy suppliers, we believe, have a key role to play in helping to alleviate fuel poverty. They recently agreed to up their collective spend on programmes to help vulnerable customers to &#163;150 million a year by 2010; the spend currently stands at &#163;50 million. Each of the suppliers offers a different form of assistance&#151;for example, social tariffs, assistance with clearing debt, rebates, fixed bills. Our expectation is that the suppliers will continue to provide a wide and varied range of assistance under the new voluntary agreement, but the details are still being discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="80625h0012.htm_para12"><a name="08062578000456">We are working with the energy companies on those proposals, but also on proposals to see how we can access Government data in a sensitive way, so that we can better target programmes on those who need help the most. The Government have data that could help the most vulnerable&#151;perhaps the over-80s&#151;but we are not able to give them to the supply companies for perfectly proper data protection reasons. The Minister with responsibility for pensions is working hard on cracking that problem. We are in ongoing discussions with him and other colleagues.</p>
