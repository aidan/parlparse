 It is a pleasure, Mr. Sheridan, to introduce the 31st annual report of the Commission. It covers the period from April last year to March this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para2"><a name="09120354000008">As always, the report gives some idea of the complexity of the running of the House and, contrary to the impression sometimes given, of the willingness of the House-Members and staff-to do things in new ways. We are always keen to hear Members' views; it is important that there is good communication between the Commission and Members of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para3"><a name="09120354000009">I should point out that the report does not cover Members' pay and allowances, which is essentially a matter for the Members Estimate Committee rather than the Commission, nor the period when allowances became continuous front page news. However, that has had an impact on staff and services, and I shall touch on that aspect in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para4"><a name="09120354000010">Last year's report described greater changes in the internal organisation of the House service than in any year since 1978 or earlier, including the new structure of four Commons Departments and one joint Department with the House of Lords, namely PICT. The vision behind the reorganisation was</p>
<a name="91203h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09120354000121"><ul><p class="tabletext">"to create a unified parliamentary service which provides first class advisory, executive and support facilities to the House, its Members and the public whilst maintaining a world heritage site."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para5"><a name="09120354000011">In the year now under review, changes resulting from the Tebbit review have continued-for instance, filling posts in the reorganised Parliamentary Estates Directorate and unifying human resources and finance teams in the House service-but the emphasis has been on making the new structures work. The most visible example of what a unified service can do is the increasingly popular Members Centre in Portcullis House. Another good example was the handling of the recent sitting of the UK Youth Parliament in the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para6"><a name="09120354000012">The highlights of the year include the following. There was a pilot for the transport subsidy scheme for school visits, something suggested in Westminster Hall debates on previous Commission reports; all 300 slots for the first two terms were taken up on the first day. There have been improvements to the website, including better search facilities and the addition of the YouTube channel. We have also seen the opening of the visitor reception building, progress on improving the technical infrastructure of the parliamentary network, and the technical achievement of publishing a mass of information  <br>

on Members' allowances within a very demanding time scale. There has also been progress on the 25-year estates strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para7"><a name="09120354000013">There are some significant challenges. One is handling the transition to IPSA, the new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which is now coming into operation. We hope to see the smooth transfer of many of the House staff now working on allowances to new jobs in IPSA. The Commission recognises the uncertainty faced by those staff, and hopes that it can resolved as soon as possible. It will be important, and difficult, to maintain services to Members during the transition period, but it is also important to establish a good working relationship with IPSA staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para8"><a name="09120354000014">We have continued the task of trying to make the House more environmentally friendly. In particular, a major environmental assessment has just taken place. That should lead early next year to demanding but we hope achievable reductions in carbon emissions, something in which the House's recent performance has been poor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para9"><a name="09120354000015">The task of maintaining and improving the main building is always a challenging one. The cast-iron roof project is the most visible major project at the moment, as Members will gather from the scaffolding and covers on parts of the building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para10"><a name="09120354000016">A much larger job, but one likely to take place over a longer period, is the replacement of the mechanical and electrical services of the Palace. Members will be aware that a study has been made of whether the two Houses would need to be decanted so that the work could be carried out continuously and efficiently, rather than in recess-sized chunks. The study concluded that the best option would be to decant for some years, but further analysis has established that tackling the main problems and risks aggressively over a number of years means that the larger project could be put off for a period, providing a breathing space for us to plan a more general refit of the Palace, to make it more suitable for a modern Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para11"><a name="09120354000017">The final challenge to be flagged up is that of greater financial stringency. The Commission is likely to insist on substantial savings in the administration budget in the next few years, reflecting expectations on the rest of the public sector. Hard choices will therefore be increasingly necessary, especially if the House decides that it wants additional services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para12"><a name="09120354000018">During the past year, I have answered parliamentary questions on a range of the Commission's responsibilities. They have included questions on freedom of information requests, bottled water, child care, the visitor reception building, encryption software, the countries of origin of meat served here, the recharging of electric vehicles, the restoring of Cromwell's statue and moths in T block.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para13"><a name="09120354000019">I conclude by thanking the staff of the House for all the work they do on behalf of Members. This year, I thank particularly those who have had to deal with FOI requests; they have been under continuously heavy pressure and have faced demanding deadlines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para14"><a name="09120354000020">I also thank the staff who handle Members' allowances. They have had to cope with numerous changes in the allowance system. We had a completely new Green Book and set of allowances on 1 April. That had barely bedded down when fundamental changes were made in May. Since then, increasing demands have been made of staff at exactly the point when the coming into being of  <br>

IPSA put the greatest question mark over the staff. We are indebted to them for keeping going through trying circumstances. If Members find at any point that things from the Fees Office are not quite as fast as they would like, I hope they will understand the immense pressure we have put on the staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para15"><a name="09120354000021">I thank every member of the House staff. I pay particular thanks to the Commission secretary, Dorian Gerhold, who has coped with everything thrown at him over the past year with great calmness and efficiency. I also thank Louise Sargent, who handles parliamentary questions and manages to get answers posted to the right place at the right time. We are grateful to them all; they help the place to work better, and I hope that Members recognise the debt they owe them.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="09120354000022"><a name="91203h0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="09120354000130"><b>Mr. David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b>
 This is not the best attended debate I have seen. It seems wrong that Members who every day, in their private conversations and correspondence, show a lively awareness of the work of the House of Commons Commission and of members of staff working in the House should not have sufficient curiosity to ask questions about the Commission's annual report. It is left to the representatives of the three parties to do so. That is regrettable, but perhaps understandable in the present circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para16"><a name="09120354000023">The understatement of the year and possibly of the century is contained in the first words of the Speaker's foreword to the report:</p>
<a name="91203h0001.htm_brev1"><a name="09120354000122"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Recent months have been turbulent for the House."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para17"><a name="09120354000024">They most certainly have. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) said, the report covers matters that largely fall outside those areas of turbulence. Nevertheless, we owe it to all the staff and Officers of the House to put on record our appreciation of the work they have had to put in under very trying circumstances. I hope that message will be transmitted to those involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para18"><a name="09120354000025">I would also like to thank members of the House of Commons Commission. I do not always say that; I have had my differences with the Commission and with how it sometimes operates, but it has had a particularly difficult row to hoe in recent months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para19"><a name="09120354000026">The other specific issues that I want to cover are few. Some things in the report are good and my hon. Friend has already referred to them. One, the Members Centre in Portcullis House, is a huge improvement on previous arrangements. It has been convenient for Members and, I think, works well. Although, as a slightly old-fashioned Member I feel saddened that people are now corralled behind a glass screen when they visit the Chamber and never really get a sense of what the Chamber is like, I nevertheless recognise that the arrangements for visitors, with the new Visitors Centre at the entrance to the House, have been greatly improved. We should put that on record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para20"><a name="09120354000027">I am not convinced that the website is entirely user-friendly yet, and we need constant feedback on that process. I am sure that I am not the only Member who still sometimes has difficulty finding things they feel they ought to be able to get to, and quickly, and has to use a circuitous route through cyberspace to get basic  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 Dec 2009">

<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>3 Dec 2009 : Column 150WH</b><br>
information about the business of the House, <i>Hansard</i><i></i>and so on. That may be a sign of my inadequacy in using systems, but if so, it is shared by an awful lot of Members and their staff. We therefore need a continuing dialogue to ensure that the website is improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para21"><a name="09120354000028">One thing that my hon. Friend did not touch on is sharing video footage. He knows that there is some interest in that in the House, and that early-day motion 211 on the subject has been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson). There seems to be an almost inexplicable obstacle to sharing material of the kind that is valuable to people and commonly shared in other legislatures. I would have thought that we want to facilitate rather than obstruct such sharing, and I therefore ask my hon. Friend to take that matter back to the Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para22"><a name="09120354000029">As far as the fabric of the House is concerned, it will always be difficult to maintain such a building. It is a singular, unique and fantastical building, with huge maintenance requirements. I am interested in what my hon. Friend said about the decanting contingency plans. Have he, his colleagues and the House looked also at the need to find ways of maintaining the fabric of the House that are consistent with the House's meeting for a rather longer time during the summer months or the early autumn?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para23"><a name="09120354000030">The last time we had experimental meetings in September, it was farcical. It was farcical that so much of the fabric of the House was in a state of refurbishment that it was almost impossible to walk down a corridor, go into an office or even get into the Chamber without falling over something that was under repair. I have dark suspicions about that. I suspect that there was an agenda to prevent us from ever having the effrontery to suggest meeting in September again. However, there is common ground among quite a few Members that the long summer vacation is something that we want to try to avoid-I mean the recess, which is not always a vacation, of course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para24"><a name="09120354000031">There is a case for the House's being able to hold the Government to account during the autumn and before the party conference season. If that is inconsistent with the House's maintenance arrangements, I am afraid that those arrangements will have to change, and I do not think that it is unreasonable to suggest that, even with the constraints of keeping up the fabric of the building. It is possible without effectively closing for business for four months a year. I do not know of any large corporation, or stately home even, in the country that does that to carry out its routine maintenance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para25"><a name="09120354000032">My next point is an important one and was touched on by my hon. Friend. It is that the environmental performance of the House is simply not good enough. I was very disappointed that the House was not prepared to accede to the motion that I and my right hon. and hon. Friends tabled a few weeks ago effectively to sign up the House to the 10:10 campaign to reduce our emissions. I was disappointed that apparently we could not even make that an aspiration. We are moving in the wrong direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para26"><a name="09120354000033">The figures on environmental performance on page 49 of the report show that energy use per square metre is going up, and has gone up substantially since 2004-05. We had a blip in 2005-06 and I am sure that there was a reason for that; there is a reference to a footnote that simply says "figure revised". However, the revised figure  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 Dec 2009">

<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>3 Dec 2009 : Column 151WH</b><br>
is higher than the figures for subsequent years but lower than the figure for this year, which is 362.5 kWh per square metre. We ought and need to do better than that. I wonder whether a large part of the current wastage is related to thermoregulation on the estate. Sometimes we are very cold and sometimes extraordinarily hot; very rarely do we seem to be exactly right. Perhaps a small amount of investment could yield dividends in reduced energy use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para27"><a name="09120354000034">My last point is on IT for Members, and indeed on the IT systems' operation in the House. This is no criticism of the people who work in the organisation, but sadly it is a constant frustration that continual abuse by Members results in machines being put out of action and things not functioning as they should. There is a repertory company among those who work frequently in the House of Commons Library that feels that the machines there are less than we would wish for in terms of performance, and often seem to let us down, normally at critical moments. We can be working against a deadline and desperately need the machine to print something and it refuses to do so, and I think that that is symptomatic of House procurement policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para28"><a name="09120354000035">We seem to have a gift in the House for buying equipment that is not very good or up to date, and which becomes rapidly not so good or up to date. I know that that is often done to save money, and I do not regret the fact that people are being careful to save money in contracts, but most of us are working on equipment that does not have as good a specification or performance as that which we could buy in our local computer store, or even in our local Tesco.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para29"><a name="09120354000036">As part of what is provided by the House, we are forced into having equipment that often does not work in our constituencies. I have just taken delivery of a new PDA and because of the phone company with which we have the contract, it works in only a couple of places in my constituency-not in my home as I get no phone signal there-and it frequently breaks down. If I went to a phone shop, I could buy a phone for a lower price with a higher performance. Regrettably, however, if I do that, I cannot have the parliamentary software that I need to maintain contact with the House. That is just a small moan, but one that is commonly shared by Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para30"><a name="09120354000037">My very last point relates to the report of the Members Estimate Audit Committee, but neither of the right hon. Members who chair the Committee are here today. The report, I think, is less comprehensive than I have seen previously. There is less information in it about the audit activities of the Committee. The function of auditing is increasingly important in the context in which we now operate. I am afraid that one of the outcomes of the Legg review will be to throw into sharp relief some of the inadequacies of internal audit over recent years. It will suggest, I think, that a number of payments have come to light that could not be justified and that should have been picked up at audit. The House needs a comprehensive report of audit systems, and to be satisfied that when a specific topic for audit has been undertaken, it receives a full report, which will be available to Members. I put that as a suggestion to my hon. Friend and hope that it will be put in train.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para31"><a name="09120354000038">I thank the staff of both the Commission and the House for everything that they do to keep this building and those who work in it in some semblance of order. It is a thankless and enormous task, and we are grateful.</p>

 I echo the comments made about the number of people who have taken the trouble to turn up for today's debate. Given that it impacts on everyone who works or operates in and around the Palace of Westminster, it is regrettable that on the one occasion that they have an opportunity to make their views known, they fail to do so. That being said, I thank the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) and the rest of the Commission, who, working with the Management Board, have carried out sterling work in producing this report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para32"><a name="09120354000040">As was mentioned earlier, this has not been an easy year, and to say that it has been challenging is to put it mildly. The media have dominated the headlines with comments about MPs' expenses and allowances and so on. That has directly impacted on the entire community that works in and around the Palace of Westminster. Some Departments have been more affected than others. For example, the people handing the freedom of information requests have had a hard time, as have people in the Department of Resources. It is noteworthy that we put that on record to recognise the enormous stresses and strains that have been experienced by the support staff in this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para33"><a name="09120354000041">Sir Kevin Tebbit's reforms continue to have an impact on the management of the parliamentary estate, and it is good to see that the staff have managed the changes well. Given the economic climate, I was pleased to see on page 36 of the report that the House Service has broadly met its medium-term financial strategy for 2008-09 by ensuring that expenditure on core services was the same as in 2006-07.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para34"><a name="09120354000042">I also welcome the fact that PICT and the House Service will be seeking Investors in People status, which clearly is recognition by this place of the need to adapt and to provide care and attention for its staff in the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para35"><a name="09120354000043">Clearly, one of the important functions that takes place here is support for Members. It is also noteworthy that the role of Members of Parliament in recent years has increased and become more demanding, particularly with the growth of the internet and the use of e-mails. Again, that impacts directly on all those who help us to do our jobs. Let me highlight three or four of those particular Departments. PICT has improved considerably. There is still a little bit to do by way of improvement, but it continues to strive to do better than in the previous year. In that, it has certainly improved compared to last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="91203h0001.htm_para36"><a name="09120354000044">The Library staff continue to impress by meeting the ridiculous demands that we sometimes put on them, especially when they have to provide research and information at short notice. In my case, they have always delivered on time. That view, I think, will be shared by most of us-Members from all parts of the House. The service we get, at short notice, is excellent. I believe that some 99 per cent. of Members have used the Library services.</p>

All the questions have to be processed and dealt with accurately and efficiently. I take this opportunity to say that that task has been well achieved.

We are aware of asbestos in large parts of the estate, but it would be interesting to know whether it is having a direct impact on staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para5"><a name="09120354000050">Accommodation is an ongoing problem for Members and their staff. I am pleased to see in the report that that issue is being addressed and that efforts are being made to secure further accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para6"><a name="09120354000051">One area of concern is the fact that there has not been the reduction in energy use that we would have liked to achieve; in fact, there has been a 6 per cent. increase. I accept that the size of the estate has also increased, but given that all of us in this place are in the business of asking people outside to try to conserve energy, we need to lead by example. Although I accept the reasons for the increase, perhaps we need to consider the matter again so that we can speak and truly set an example.</p>

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="09120354000052"><a name="91203h0002.htm_spnew0"><a name="09120354000132"><b>Mr. Heath:</b>
 I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman is picking up on the same point that I did. However, I do not think that the issue is about the size of the estate, because the energy use is expressed per square metre. There has been a like-for-like comparison.</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="09120354000053"><a name="91203h0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="09120354000133"><b>Mr. Vara:</b>
 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and perhaps the hon. Member for North Devon might be able to say in his winding-up speech whether there is  <br>

any particular reason for the increase-this may be a one-off year. He might also say whether there will be a reduction next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para7"><a name="09120354000054">The security aspects of the House are, of course, tremendously important. I commend the Sergeant at Arms and her team, and all the police and security staff who work so hard in trying to keep this place safe. That being said, we must remain vigilant, and the two rooftop protests in the past year showed that there can be no let-up and that security arrangements must be kept under constant review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para8"><a name="09120354000055">Particularly because of the negative publicity that this place has encountered in the past few months, but also because of the importance of engaging with the public at a time when communications are improving so greatly throughout the globe, it is important that the methods with which Parliament engages the public are always kept under scrutiny. I am pleased to say that the new visitor centre seems to have had much success. As well as providing enhanced security, it offers better reception and information facilities for those people who visit this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para9"><a name="09120354000056">I think that the 1 million-plus visitors who have been through the new visitor centre would certainly have better comments to make about their visit than those who visited under the previous arrangement. Tours of the Palace of Westminster are always popular and 130,000 MP-sponsored tours is certainly no mean feat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para10"><a name="09120354000057">I am also pleased that the exhibitions that we hold regularly in various parts of the estate are continuing. Often, they are sponsored by Members, and they are a valuable way to ensure that charities and similar organisations that would not otherwise receive showcase publicity have the opportunity to receive such publicity when they hold an exhibition on the estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para11"><a name="09120354000058">Education is always a matter of importance. I am delighted that there were 36,000 school visits to the Palace last year, which is an increase of about 25 per cent. It is worth noting that, when it comes to elections, young people aged between 18 and 24 are the most disenchanted group of people and the group least likely to exercise their vote. So, it is important that we try to engage an interest in the world of politics among those young people, because what happens here impacts on their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para12"><a name="09120354000059">I repeat that I am particularly pleased that we have had so many school visits. If the hon. Member for North Devon is able to enlighten us further, I shall look forward to hearing about the progress of the feasibility study for a dedicated education centre. I believe that that centre, if its construction goes ahead, is proposed for 2012-13.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para13"><a name="09120354000060">Furthermore, I very much welcome the travel subsidies that have been provided for schools outside London for visits to Parliament. On the first day that the subsidies were available, it was good to see that they had all been taken up; that is certainly a good sign for the future. Again, it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman said how many schools made use of the subsidies and in what areas they were located, whether in outer London or much further afield. It would also be helpful to  know what types of school-primary, senior and so on-arranged visits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para14"><a name="09120354000061">As always in this debate, I conclude by thanking all the people who really make this place work, in addition to the House of Commons Commission and the Management Board. The list is extensive, but it includes the cleaners, the caterers, the Clerks and the support staff. They are the people who rarely get a mention and who-dare I say it?-perhaps are not thanked as often as they ought to be. Consequently, it was good of the Clerk of the House to invite some people who have served in the House for a long period to an event that simply marked their service. It is no bad thing that, as life gets more complicated, rushed and stressful, all those in a position of seniority take the time to thank all the other people who make their lives that much easier.</p>

 I am pleased to be debating the House of Commons Commission's annual report under your chairmanship, Mr. Sheridan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para15"><a name="09120354000063">This Monday was the 10th anniversary of Westminster Hall first being used as our second debating chamber. In 1998, the Modernisation Committee recommended establishing Westminster Hall for that purpose. I understand that the recommendation was not met with great support across the House. However, I think people feel that this one-time innovation has been a great success, notwithstanding the small number of Members who have joined us today for this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para16"><a name="09120354000064">I, too, congratulate the House of Commons Commission on the hard work that it has put in during what we all recognise to have been a very difficult year. In addition, I thank the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) for representing the Commission in five oral question sessions and for answering 198 written parliamentary questions; it is an impressive amount for the small team dealing with them and for the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para17"><a name="09120354000065">I, too, thank Dorian Gerhold, the Clerk to the Commission. For their work as members of the Commission, I also thank the Leader of the House of Commons, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman); the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), the shadow Leader of the House of Commons; and my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell). Finally, I thank Mr. Speaker for his work as Chair of the Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para18"><a name="09120354000066">The Commission works to ensure that the House of Commons supports the important work of Members of Parliament in serving their communities, and I commend its work. We could not do our work without the work that supports us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para19"><a name="09120354000067">I know that staff of the House and members of the Commission have worked very hard recently. All Members who are present today have touched on the difficulty of resolving the issues related to freedom of information and Members' allowances. I hope that the measures we have already taken, and the measures we will continue to take, ensure that we can rebuild the reputation of the House after the crisis that engulfed us earlier this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para20"><a name="09120354000068">As the hon. Member for North Devon indicated, the report we are debating relates to the financial year 2008-09, which was before the issues related to allowances emerged. The important themes in the report have  <br>

already been referred to, but they are greater accountability in Parliament, better outreach and better engagement with the public. They have been the focus of much of the Commission's work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para21"><a name="09120354000069">The annual report details many successes in that work, from the opening of the new Members Centre-given the comments today, Members are clearly very happy with it-to the efforts to widen access to the House for schools. I will return to the point about schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para22"><a name="09120354000070">On the issue of supporting scrutiny, the annual report refers to the establishment of Regional Select Committees-a new challenge throughout the year. Setting up those Committees established for the first time a means to ensure regional accountability of the work of Parliament. I believe-others may not agree-that those Committees have made an excellent start in their task of scrutinising regional development agencies. The other side of that work was ensuring that the regions were in a good position to tackle the economic downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para23"><a name="09120354000071">Continuing the regional theme, the House agreed to establish Regional Grand Committees. Staff of the House then acted quickly to establish the infrastructure that would allow the work of the Committees to begin as soon as possible. Since March, all but one of the Committees have met and a third of MPs eligible to attend have attended their sittings. We can look at those Committees in more detail in a year's time, but I understand that their overall tone was good-humoured and that there were lively question and answer sessions. I thank the doorkeepers, the Clerks of the House and everyone else who supported those Committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para24"><a name="09120354000072">I commend the approach that the House has taken generally to new ideas and trialling those ideas. It would be easy for a long-established organisation to be bogged down in convention, but the report shows that staff and Committees of the House are always trying new things. For instance, a number of improvements have helped to support the legislative process. The Public Bill Office undertook an experiment in providing explanatory statements on amendments to three Bills in Committee. That trial was extended to all Public Bill Committees in February.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para25"><a name="09120354000073">The Equality Bill, which was considered on Report in the House yesterday, was also the first Bill in the Session to contain interleaved explanatory memorandums throughout the Bill. That important trial was conducted to make Bills more accessible to the public. The other thing about the Bill was the easy-read version-another important innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para26"><a name="09120354000074">Engaging and communicating more effectively with the public are essential to the work of the House, and we must continue to give them high priority. I know that Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Commission, does so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para27"><a name="09120354000075">Other Members touched on the launch of the new website, which was an achievement. Although there are reservations about it, we seem to agree that it is now more accessible and that it should help the public. Just before I came to the debate, I spent a little time looking at some of the new things on it, and it is much clearer. In terms of outreach and extending access, there is much more interesting information on it for the public. A couple of weeks ago, we had the state opening of Parliament, and the website had an interesting item showing the Queen's Speech from 1958. There is also a YouTube video of the Lord Speaker talking about the state opening.</p>

<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>3 Dec 2009 : Column 157WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para28"><a name="09120354000076">The decision to add a YouTube channel was another positive step, which will enable more people to engage with the debates that take place on the Floor of the House and to learn about the different services of the House and the different events and occasions that take place here. As Members will have found, there is great interest in the 150th anniversary of Big Ben, and there is a lot of focus on it. There are some wonderfully informative videos about Big Ben and the clock tower on the website, as well as question-and-answer sessions with Mr. Speaker. Overall, the improvements to the website have made it simpler for Members to use, but there is obviously always extra work that can be done with IT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para29"><a name="09120354000077">On IT generally, I agree with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), but the issue perhaps needs more focus. As the shadow Deputy Leader of the House, the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara), said, PICT has definitely improved its services, although there had been considerable cause for complaint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para30"><a name="09120354000078">I would highlight a number of issues. I agree that we need to get better value for money for our equipment. One evening recently, I was here until quite late and I found two Members from the 2001 intake complaining that the IT equipment in their constituencies was virtually unusable. I felt that the laptop issued to me in 2005 was getting out of date, but I was horrified to learn that they had laptops from 2001. My early career was with IBM, and employees there would not keep laptops for such a long period and expect them to keep working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para31"><a name="09120354000079">With a major contract with one supplier, we must look to get better value for money and more frequent replacements. In the summer recess, my laptop played up to such an extent that I was not really able to get on with much work. If we carry on with the surveys, I think that we will find that there is a continuing complaint about access from our constituencies. My constituency office has not had much access to IT over the whole of the past week and a half. I am not yet a BlackBerry user, but personal digital assistants and BlackBerrys would help to improve Members' productivity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para32"><a name="09120354000080">Like other Members, I want to talk about encouraging access and visits from schools. As an MP from the north-west of England, I would like much more to be done to encourage schools from outside London to visit Parliament. The costs and time required to travel here from the north-west, and the difficulty of fitting in with the visiting hours of the House, make it virtually impossible for schools from my constituency to come down here.</p>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="09120354000081"><a name="91203h0002.htm_spnew2"><a name="09120354000135"><b>Mr. Heath:</b>
 As a Member from the south-west, I am sure that we have many of the same difficulties. One thing that makes visits even more difficult is the fact that so many of the visitor slots are taken by more local MPs. That is particularly true of slots later in the day, which people arriving from the country's further recesses would actually be able to take advantage of. Members who are trying to arrange tours from further afield should have some priority.</p>

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="09120354000082"><a name="91203h0002.htm_spnew3"><a name="09120354000136"><b>Barbara Keeley:</b>
 I very much agree. I really promote visits to the House when I visit schools, but I get a look of blank incomprehension when I describe the details of what they would entail. Only one or two schools  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 Dec 2009">

from my constituency have made it down here. Generally, schools have to leave at four or five in the morning, which is just not possible for young children. We must do something about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para33"><a name="09120354000083">The work of the education service on this issue is important. The Administration Committee suggested a pilot to subsidise school travel to Parliament, and I understand that it was fully booked on the first day, which suggests that there is tremendous demand out there. Indeed, I understand that schools that do not normally visit Parliament have made bookings under the pilot, but we could do a lot more. We need to help young people to learn about Parliament and the work that goes on here. We could and should carry on doing more to improve access from the regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para34"><a name="09120354000084">Like other Members, I want to touch on the recent pilot use of the main Chamber by the UK Youth Parliament, which can only have helped matters. The material, the videos and everything else about the event shows that it was a great success. It was a historic occasion, and the young people were very impressive when they delivered their speeches. I hope that we will enable the young people in our Youth Parliament to make their debates an annual event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para35"><a name="09120354000085">The outreach programme was launched in 2008 to spread awareness of the work and relevance of Parliament. It has involved giving training sessions on the workings of Parliament and on how individuals can become involved, as well as holding exhibitions, and I agree with the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire that that is vital. Those exhibitions and that information need to go around the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para36"><a name="09120354000086">As historic institutions, the Houses of Parliament are the subject of many academic studies. We should also refer to the parliamentary archives, which provide an important service to the large number of visitors that they receive each year. It is important that the wider public understand the historic significance of Parliament, and work such as the collaboration between the archives and the BBC's "Who Do You Think You Are?" programme can only have done wonders for Parliament's profile. That mixing of a popular programme with the work of the archives is key, and I hope that it encouraged more people to visit. The House also continues to give grant in aid support to the History of Parliament Trust, which does vital work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="91203h0002.htm_para37"><a name="09120354000087">The Overseas Office assisted with 124 visits from overseas groups last year, and I recently met a delegation from Vietnam. I also met the Deputy Speaker from Ghana, and it was very interesting to see the different way in which they legislate there. Indeed, the Deputy Speaker gave me a couple of ideas, which I hope that we might take forward. Such visits provide the opportunity to share experience and knowledge from different legislatures, which is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para0"><a name="09120354000088">There have been many changes, and Members who have spoken touched on some of them, such as the opening of the new visitor reception building, which now seems to work very well. However, I want to touch on a few of the many essential services provided on the parliamentary estate. The catering staff provide excellent services and continue to adapt to the needs of Members and their staff. The Tea Room is a vital support to Members' work, particularly during long debates. I particularly single out Noelleen Delaney and her staff, who work efficiently and well. When we feel a bit down  <br>

and fed up and that we would like to go home at nine o'clock in the evening, they can really lift our spirits, which is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para1"><a name="09120354000089">As someone with a restricted diet, I make a plea for better labelling of ingredients and for more wheat-free food options. For some reason, the 2005 intake seems to include a few people with eating problems, and some are coeliacs. When I was buying my wheat-free sandwich in the Terrace cafeteria at lunch time, one of the staff told me that she was also a coeliac. So Members and staff have this issue, and labelling is vital for them, because they have to be careful not to eat gluten or wheat, and that can be a minefield. It is important to say that this is not a question of dietary preferences-of not liking something-but of becoming ill if we eat the wrong thing, so the issue is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para2"><a name="09120354000090">On maintenance, work has begun to replace the 160-year-old cast-iron roof, starting with the roof in the Speaker's Court area. Furthermore, the Department of Facilities has worked hard to put together a detailed feasibility study exploring different options for modernising the mechanical and electrical primary services. There is much debate when such large-scale maintenance or refurbishment is needed, and there needs to be, because it is important that all options are considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para3"><a name="09120354000091">Obviously, the mood of the House is to start looking at when we are sitting and when we should be sitting, and maintenance will have to interleave with us. I mentioned that my career started in information technology at IBM. To start with, people could take over the IT systems, run with them for a couple of hours and tell the users to go home at eight o'clock. Over the years, however, that has become unacceptable, because people expect to have access 24/7, so we increasingly have to find ways of keeping this building open and having maintenance work around us if we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para4"><a name="09120354000092">As a supporter of the 10:10 campaign, I add my voice to those of Members who have touched on concerns about energy consumption. I hope that we can do more: I think that we should, because we shall otherwise be very much pressed to do so by our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para5"><a name="09120354000093">I want to thank all the staff of the House who work so hard to make this place run smoothly. We still sit late on Mondays and Tuesdays and staff should know how much their support to keep us going during those long hours is appreciated. During the snow in February, which could have disrupted things here, staff managed to get into work to enable the House to carry on. We should remember the effort that people made, which even meant that my predecessor, who is now Minister for Europe, was able to lead a debate in the evening. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend thought that that was a good or a bad thing, but everything went as it should.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para6"><a name="09120354000094">The advice and services that enable the House and its Committees to conduct their business effectively are all highly valued by Members. Other hon. Members have touched on a few of those services already, and I want briefly to highlight some. We have already talked about the Public and Private Bill Offices, which made important preparations to support the Regional Grand Committees. We have heard, too, about the Library, which does remarkable work. It produced a comprehensive research paper in time for every major Government Bill and for the private Member's Bills of the first seven Members in  <br>

the ballot. The Library dealt with 18 per cent. more inquiries than in the previous year and had contact with 97 per cent. of Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para7"><a name="09120354000095">The Vote Office successfully operated a no-fail policy in providing papers to support the work of the House, which meant that the correct documents were available all the time. I think that we take such things for granted, and we should not, because it is a remarkable thing that everything works like clockwork, so close to 100 per cent. of the time. I, too, want to thank the Table Office for its handling of the tabling of questions. It is not in the scope of the debate to discuss ministerial answers to parliamentary questions, but the Office of the Leader of the House is working hard to ensure that there is an improvement, and that will continue to receive our attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para8"><a name="09120354000096">My own favourite support service is the <i>Hansard</i> staff, and the shadow Deputy Leader of the House has already touched on its work. Not only do they record what Members say in questions and debates in a way that achieves greater clarity-perhaps they do not have such a hard job now as they used to-but they do so with remarkable accuracy. Last year, they recorded almost 19,000 columns of debate. It is a remarkable service, of which we should be proud.</p>

I know, and other hon. Members all know, how we feel about that, but it affects the staff of the House, too, and we have to change. By this time next year, changes that are now being implemented will have had time to mature and necessary work will have had time to develop. The establishment of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority is a major step forward, and it will bring about vital independent regulation and administration first of allowances and then of pay and pensions. As the hon. Member for North Devon has said, that affects the staff of the House, who will see it as a cause for concern. I had meetings with unions representing staff in the Department of Resources. I could do no more than listen to their concerns about the development of the authority, but it was important to do that. Their concerns are of course listened to, and are being taken forward.</p>

 By leave of the House, I shall reply to the debate. I welcome the fact that the three party spokesmen have made so many positive remarks about the House service and the work of staff. I thank them also for their positive remarks about the Members Centre, the improved visitor arrangements, the visitor reception building outside and the work of other parts of the House service, such as the Library, <i>Hansard</i>, the Table Office, the Public Bill Office and many others. It is clear that there is a lot for us to be pleased with and grateful to our staff for.</p>

raised questions about the website. He described himself as old-fashioned, and although I think that the website is much improved, I fear that I may suffer the same tendencies, because the intranet seems to me to be somewhat counter-intuitive at various points. I dearly wish, when I am struggling to find my way around it and trying to use the search facility, that it would search the intranet and tell me what is on it, instead of searching the parliamentary information management system and telling me what might have been discussed on the topic some years earlier. However, that is a minor point, and the website itself is considerably improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para12"><a name="09120354000101">My hon. Friend referred to the early-day motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson). The House has responded to the great majority of what she has been campaigning for. There is, I think, one relatively minor issue that in her mind remains unresolved; but there is a tension, because if the House agrees to what is being demanded, there is every chance that other production houses will ride roughshod over the continuing and lingering controls over how the Chamber is televised. However, that will continue to be under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para13"><a name="09120354000102">My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome asked about major works, as did the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara), the shadow Deputy Leader of the House. I, too, think that the 11-week summer recess will need to become a thing of the past, but the House must understand that there is a tension between not having that long period for maintenance work and the necessity of holding the Government to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para14"><a name="09120354000103">My hon. Friend said that he could think of no other building-no stately home or other office-that would carry on in the way that the House does, but with respect, that is because the users of those buildings would not insist, in what is frankly an irrational and unreasonable way, that all maintenance must go on when they are not there. If we are to sit in September-I hope that we are, because it is a perfect excuse not to go to party conference, for one thing-we shall have to accept some maintenance going on around us as we work. It is unique that we expect everything to be done out of sight and sound. We shall just have to get into the real world and accept an element of such activity going on around us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para15"><a name="09120354000104">On the potential for the big decamp that the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire asked about, it is impossible to say with any certainty how long it would take, how much it would cost or when it would be done, but all those things are being teased apart at the moment. When it is possible to put information into Members' hands to enable them to understand the issues, we shall certainly do so. However, the longer that we postpone dealing with the huge mechanical and engineering project in question, the greater the risk that something fundamental will break down in a way that cannot easily be repaired. That is a huge, looming project, which cannot be dodged altogether. We must tackle it, and decisions will have to be made.</p>

patchwork, or eventually have a move? For example, if some pipework needs to be dealt with, would it not be helpful to the people doing that work if they knew they needed only to do a good job that would last 10 years, because there would be no point in a Rolls-Royce job, as it would have to be done again? Alternatively, it might help them if they knew at this stage that they needed to do a Rolls-Royce patchwork job, which would have to last a long time. The work that is being done at the moment would be assisted by some certainty.</p>

 I understand the point exactly, but although the sort of work that takes place now on the mechanical and engineering infrastructure is of the kind that the hon. Gentleman would call patchwork, there is no chance of patchwork-even aggressive patchwork-ultimately resolving the problem. There will have to be what could be called the Rolls-Royce option of a complete and fundamental replacement of the infrastructure. The question is, when? If the work is done only over summer recesses, it will cost a great deal more and take a great deal longer, increasing the risk of the whole thing fundamentally conking out. That is why the study we commissioned concludes unequivocally that decant and addressing the project in one go is the best option. What that would mean, when it would occur and how long it would take all need more work. Even the proposal that the House of Commons use the House of Lords Chamber, if the Lords could be persuaded to agree to that and to operate somewhere else for a time, would itself produce a quagmire of diplomacy between the Houses. These things are not imminent, but they cannot be dodged indefinitely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para16"><a name="09120354000107">All Members who spoke rightly mentioned the House's environmental performance, which has been going in the wrong direction and is unsatisfactory, but I reassure Members that both the director general of facilities and the whole Management Board take the issue seriously. Nearly a year ago we appointed someone to the new post of head of environment, charged with tackling the issue. A detailed environmental assessment is being carried out and early next year I expect to see significant recommendations on how we will tackle those issues, including some challenging changes that we will have to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para17"><a name="09120354000108">However, it was not possible to sign up to the 10:10 campaign and state that we could achieve a 10 per cent. improvement during 2010. The Commission considered it and representations were made to us, but we unanimously arrived at the view that we could not sign up to the campaign in all conscience and in good faith because we could not guarantee that we would achieve its targets.</p>

 That is the initial feeling when we look at the 10:10 campaign, but could we not actually just do best efforts? In fact, the campaign is not a commitment to achieve 10 per cent. by 2010, but to do our best towards that. It behoves us to say that we would do the best we can towards that. That is the simple point.</p>

 With respect, although the 10:10 campaign included 10 per cent. as an aspiration, as my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome called it, by signing up to it we had to guarantee to achieve 3 per cent., and we did not feel that we could categorically  <br>

guarantee even that. Our hope is that we will achieve a great deal more than 10 per cent., but in all conscience we could not anticipate that we would do that in 2010. It is no good saying that those targets are simply aspirational, they contained solid commitments and having considered them, we were not in a position to sign up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para18"><a name="09120354000111">There have been criticisms of PICT and IT equipment. PICT has made great strides, and there have been huge improvements in our IT support, and a great deal more is under way. By the end of next year the network will be on a completely new server and all the equipment will go through a refresh programme so that new Members coming in after the election will get brand-new equipment, and returning Members will have new equipment by next autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para19"><a name="09120354000112">Several comments suggested that the equipment is not as new as it might be. IT equipment currently goes through a refresh once a Parliament. As the Minister will know only too well, coming from the world of IT, by the time a desktop or laptop computer is five years old it is probably not as good as those one can buy even in Tesco. We could certainly replace them more frequently if we wanted to, but that would obviously produce a greater drain on the public purse, and we must consider what is reasonable when using public resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para20"><a name="09120354000113">The Minister said that in some constituency offices the equipment in use dates back to 2001. That might be so, but it is not PICT property. It is equipment Members bought in 2001 and have either chosen not to replace, or not been in a position to replace. No PICT equipment dates back further than 2005. Clearly, we could replace things more frequently, but there would be a cost implication in doing so. I am the first to acknowledge that the provision of personal digital assistants-PDAs-is still short of where Members want it to be. I have quietly been a vocal lobbyist of PICT and a critic of some aspects of IT provision. I understand that completely new solutions on mobile computing are on the way and I hope that the offer to new Members arriving after the election will be a significant improvement. It will also be available to returning Members, so progress is  being made.</p>

There would be absolutely no problem with that, but judging by the level of interest even in the amount of information we have put to the House this afternoon, I am not entirely convinced there would be a huge appetite for it. I will certainly draw his remarks to the attention of the Audit Committee and see what arrangements could sensibly be made to put the specific audits to which he referred on the Committee's website or at least make them available to Members in one way or another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para22"><a name="09120354000115">The shadow Deputy Leader of the House mentioned security. Security is not predominantly a matter for the Commission, but one for Mr. Speaker. We need to be alert to the increasing security challenges, and Mr. Speaker, the Serjeant at Arms and everyone else involved needs a lot of support in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para23"><a name="09120354000116">Good points were made about the time of day for school visits. Primary school pupils in my constituency, like those in the Minister's constituency, would have to start out at 4 o'clock in the morning and would still arrive rather breathless to try to make the deadlines for visits. I will do what I can to draw that to the attention of the relevant officials and see whether the time slots could be allocated according to the distance travelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="91203h0003.htm_para24"><a name="09120354000117">My final point is about food labelling. I nearly did not make the debate this afternoon, having tucked into a tasty lunch and discovered half way through that there was something I was allergic to lingering in the food, which had not been mentioned in the description. The Minister's points about labelling are absolutely right, and I will draw them to the attention of the catering department.</p>
