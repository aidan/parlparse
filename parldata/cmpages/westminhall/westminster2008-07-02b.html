 I am glad to have the opportunity to lead this debate, remembering those who died in the Piper Alpha tragedy in 1988, their families and loved ones, the survivors and all who were involved in the tragedy and its aftermath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08070259000011">I shall say a little about the background to the disaster. Over the past 40 years, we have seen a dramatic change in the city of Aberdeen. It has moved from having a rural economy, with a shipyard and some light engineering on the side, to being one of the oil capitals of the world. The city is a model of how a community can make the transition from a rural economy to one based on oil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08070259000012">Oil was first discovered in the North sea in 1965, and was first produced in 1975. Aberdeen has grown and thrived. It became the main supply base for the offshore oil and gas industry, and it is now a world-class oil centre in its own right. Many oil companies and oil-related businesses have headquarters in the city. Oil facilities around the world&#151;in Africa, Asia and Europe&#151;are run from offices in Aberdeen. We have a higher concentration of IT companies than anywhere else in Britain. The centre of the world&#146;s sub-sea technology industry is now based in Aberdeen. The city exports its knowledge and expertise around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08070259000013">There have been several phases in the development of the oil industry. I like to think of the first as the Klondike phase. Once oil was discovered in sufficient quantities to justify investment, everyone was anxious to get the oil out of the ground. The Government wanted the tax revenues. The companies wanted to recover their investment, which was often billions of pounds, and then wanted a return on it. Safety was lax, and there were many accidents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08070259000014">The Department of Energy was the safety regulator in the North sea. It was also the Department responsible for producing the oil. There was a clear conflict of interest, but no one minded so long as the oil was produced. As a young solicitor dealing with personal injury cases in the north-east of Scotland, I saw many cases in which safety came behind production.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08070259000015">The beginning of the end of the Klondike phase came at the end of the 1985, when Aberdeen experienced its first price collapse, which was almost the opposite of what is happening now. The oil price fell quickly from $32 a barrel to $8 a barrel. The industry&#146;s response was immediate. All new investment stopped. Production continued while operators came to terms with the new situation. Most affected was the routine maintenance of platforms and facilities. More than 20,000 jobs were lost in the north-east of Scotland, and about 50,000 were lost in the United Kingdom. It was a terrible time in the city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000016">One of the earliest platforms, and one of the largest, was the Piper Alpha platform, then operated by Occidental, an American company owned by Armand Hammer. The oil field was discovered in 1973, and production of oil began in 1976. The peak of production was 274,000 barrels a day. I did a quick back-of-the-fag-packet calculation and discovered that at today&#146;s prices it would have been worth nearly &#163;40 million a day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08070259000017">Piper Alpha was no different from other platforms in the North sea, in that the priority was to recover oil and gas and get it to the mainland. In addition to its oil and gas production facilities, the Piper Alpha platform also hosted several gas pipelines that transmitted natural gas from other fields to the shore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08070259000018">Towards the end of 1987, an oil worker died on Piper Alpha in an accident. Following that death, there were inspections of the platform and its safety facilities, the latest being in June 1988. Department of Energy inspectors pointed out some faults, but none of the more serious safety problems was even noticed, far less rectified. A month later, Piper Alpha was destroyed in the worst offshore oil and gas accident ever seen. The industry was about to enter what I now think of as the post-Piper Alpha period. Indeed, it is most commonly referred to by that name.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08070259000019">On 6 July 1988, there was a significant leakage of gas on the platform. We now know that the leak came from a gas compressor that was missing a safety valve. At about 10 pm, the cloud of gas ignited. At 10.20 pm, 10.50 pm and 11.20 pm, there were further huge explosions, caused by ruptures in the pipelines connecting Piper Alpha to other platforms, principally the MCPO1 operated by Total, and the Tartan platform operated by Texaco.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08070259000020">Observers on the nearby stand-by vessel, the Silver Pit, likened the scene to a huge Bunsen burner, with a massive supply of gas burning at temperatures in excess of 700Â° C. The effect was catastrophic. The platform was destroyed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08070259000021">There were nearly 230 men on the platform. Most of them died. The vast majority followed the standard safety instructions: &#147;In the event of fire or explosion, go to your muster point and await the rescue helicopter.&#148; The fire was so fierce that the helicopters could not get anywhere near the platform. The 59 men who survived had ignored the standard instructions and followed their instincts. Most of them escaped within half an hour of the first explosion. They made their way to the water by climbing down the platform to the lowest point, some using ropes, and then dropping into the water. Five men jumped from the helicopter deck, 175 ft above the water. Three of them died from injuries received on impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08070259000022">There were many stories of bravery and courage on that evening. The survivors had to swim significant distances from the platform to the rescue vessels, but it was not an ordinary swim. They had to stay clear of debris being thrown from the platform by frequent explosions. Worst of all, bubbles of gas were exploding as they rose to the surface. Bob Ballantyne, an electrician who survived, told me that he had to constantly duck his head under water, because his hair kept catching fire. Some reached safety with horrific burns. Others never reached the stand-by vessels. On the rescue vessels, Silver Pit and Tharos&#151;the latter was a custom-built  <br>

fire-fighting vessel&#151;there were many stories of bravery. Two members of the rescue crew were killed when their rescue craft caught fire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08070259000023">One hundred and sixty men died, most from suffocation on the platform or later in hospital from terrible burns. Fifty-nine survived. The victims came from all parts of the United Kingdom, underlining the fact that the North sea oil and gas industry was a UK industry. In the early days, workers had been recruited from the old smoke-stack heavy industries&#151;the coal mines, the shipyards and the steel works. They came from Lancashire, Teesside, Merseyside, Lincolnshire, north and south Yorkshire, Berkshire, Sheffield, Stafford, Manchester, Wales, Essex, Peterborough and London. The majority came from Scotland. From my previous constituency and the constituency that I now represent, a total of 22 men were lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08070259000024">On 6 July 1988, the UK oil and gas industry changed for ever. So did Aberdeen. The city was forced to come to terms with the fact that although huge rewards and benefits come from being a host to the oil industry, it can levy a terrible price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08070259000025">Tonight in the Lemon Tree theatre in my constituency, we will see the first performance of a short play written to commemorate the Piper Alpha victims. One line in the play is this:</p>
<a name="80702h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08070259000412"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I have never heard a city cry before, but I heard Aberdeen cry today.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08070259000026">That accurately reflects the pain that the city felt, and still feels strongly today. One of the questions most asked in Aberdeen this week is, &#147;Where were you when the Piper went up?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08070259000027">On 6 July 1988, I was a young inexperienced MP. I had returned to my flat after a late-night sitting, and I first heard on the midnight news that something serious had happened in the North sea. The following morning, I went to the House early and phoned Cecil Parkinson, who was then Secretary of State for Energy. I asked for a briefing, and he told me to come immediately to his office. From then on, and for the next few years, I became very involved with Piper Alpha, the survivors, the families, and the consequences, particularly for offshore safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08070259000028">As a solicitor, I had seen my fair share of death and tragedy, but never on such a scale. I saw anger and despair. There was grief and bitterness. There was a driven urge to find out who was responsible, who was to blame. There was a need to hide from the world. There was a lack of comprehension. There was a need for support, there was a need to be alone. The magnitude of individual grief was made that much greater because of the collective grief felt throughout the country, but particularly in the north-east of Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08070259000029">Of course, every aspect of the tragedy was played out, over and over, in public. The world&#146;s media came to Aberdeen, and its eyes were everywhere, peering into every nook and cranny. Real grieving was impossible, until the media eventually moved on to the next disaster zone. Families whose only connection was the loss of a loved one started to come together, sometimes as mutual support, sometimes to grieve. Later, a focused, painful journey was undertaken by many families as they tried to understand what had happened. In that period, I  <br>

attended many meetings of the Piper Alpha families and survivors group, a mutual support organisation set up by the families and survivors themselves. They were supported by a team of counsellors, led by Ann Bone, a local social worker who did remarkable work with individuals and the group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08070259000030">The 1980s was a bad time for public disasters and the Piper Alpha group made contact with the groups established following the King&#146;s Cross fire, the Bradford football stadium fire, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, the Clapham rail disaster and others. Meetings with representatives of those groups allowed people to share experience and knowledge, and provided mutual support. Many of the relatives attended the inquiry into the disaster, and had to endure some very stressful days of evidence, sometimes listening to discussions about the circumstances of a death, or, on other days, listening to evidence of the neglect and lack of proper safety systems that led to those deaths&#151; grief one minute, anger the next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08070259000031">It was a particularly hard period for those families for whom the body of a relative had not been recovered. In all, 32 bodies are still missing. I remember arranging for a group to visit London to meet Cecil Parkinson, who was still Secretary of State. It was an extremely difficult meeting and it became very angry. The problem was that Cecil Parkinson was not being direct with the families, to which they reacted very badly. Later, the families were provided with evidence that attempting to recover the bodies would put divers&#146; lives at serious risk because of the dangerous condition of the wreckage. Difficult though it was for them, no one wanted to see any more lives lost, and they moved on but, of course, the aggravated sense of loss remains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para22"><a name="08070259000032">It was obvious that there was a number of failures in the safety system, one of the most obvious being safety regulation, which was carried out by the Department of Energy. Despite defending the arrangements, the then Government agreed to set up an inquiry under the chairmanship of Lord Cullen, a senior Scottish judge. No one has ever questioned the thoroughness of the inquiry and the importance of Lord Cullen&#146;s report. It changed the safety culture, not only in the North sea, but in industry around the world. His report made 106 recommendations. Among the most important was that responsibility for safety should be transferred to the Health and Safety Executive. He also spelled out the shortcomings of the safety systems on Piper Alpha, which included a weak permit-to-work system, inadequate fire walls, which were incapable of withstanding explosion, the failure of the deluge system, inadequate safety training, poor safety auditing by Occidental, the operating company, and inadequate risk-assessment procedures. Despite a lengthy and serious list of defects and faults, there was no criminal prosecution of the operators or any individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para23"><a name="08070259000033">Since Piper Alpha, there has been a real improvement in safety offshore. Injury and death rates have fallen and the industry continues to invest significant sums of money and other resources in safety. However, I cannot ignore the fact that concerns have been growing in the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="08070259000034"><a name="80702h0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="08070259000457"><b>Miss Anne Begg (Aberdeen, South) (Lab):</b>

to forget and to become complacent? This anniversary serves as a timely reminder of the importance of safety offshore. There are now new challenges in what is a mature province, and we have an ageing infrastructure. We need to address those issues.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="08070259000035"><a name="80702h0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="08070259000458"><b>Mr. Doran:</b>
 My hon. Friend is exactly right. It is a dangerous industry and safety needs to be at the highest level. As the province matures, that becomes a more pressing problem.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="08070259000036"><a name="80702h0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="08070259000459"><b>Angus Robertson (Moray) (SNP):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. The lessons are important for his constituents and mine, and not only regarding the North sea. An ever-growing number of them work around the world, from Azerbaijan to Sakhalin island. Many of the lessons have been fully implemented in the North sea, but is he confident that they have been learned in oil-producing regions around the world?</p>

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="08070259000037"><a name="80702h0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="08070259000460"><b>Mr. Doran:</b>
 As I said earlier, Lord Cullen&#146;s report was taken up by the oil industry around the world, not only in the UK. I was fortunate enough two or three years ago to host a reception in the Palace for offshore safety authorities from around the world. I had an opportunity to hear how seriously they were taking the issue. Of course, many of the companies that operate in the North sea operate in other areas, and they transport their safety systems, so I am optimistic that the lessons that have been learned in the North sea are being applied elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="08070259000038"><a name="80702h0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="08070259000461"><b>Malcolm Bruce (Gordon) (LD):</b>
 This debate is timely and the hon. Gentleman has given us a powerful account of how terrible the Piper Alpha disaster was. I am sure that he would agree that for those of us who live in the area, it is routine when one meets a service company or operating company to have a safety briefing before one is briefed about other issues. Nevertheless, has he heard the concern that has been expressed to me&#151;that some routine maintenance programmes and shutdowns are being delayed or postponed to maximise production at the current, high price of oil? That is a problem if it compromises safety.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="08070259000039"><a name="80702h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="08070259000462"><b>Mr. Doran:</b>

 One of my friends was on Piper Alpha and fortunately survived the disaster. The hon. Gentleman has paid tribute to the survivors for the way in which they set up self-help groups, but will he also pay tribute to them for the way in which they ensured, through their dogged fight with the Government, that safety was increased, not for the people who sadly died, but for those who currently work on oil rigs throughout the world?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman referred to a mutual friend, I believe, and I shall mention him later. Again, initially, I think that there was shock everywhere, including in Government. I had a lot of contact with the then Secretary of State and his Minister, Peter Morrison, whom I eventually shadowed through some of that period. It took some time for the Government to focus  <br>

on how they should respond to the disaster. Of course, the survivors and the relatives have played a major part in helping them to focus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para24"><a name="08070259000042">The Cullen report is a jewel that needs to be protected. I said that concerns have been growing in the past few years. They started with the deaths of two workers, who were killed by a gas leak on the Brent Bravo platform in 2003. In the criminal proceedings and the fatal accident inquiry that followed, serious shortcomings on maintenance on the part of the operator were highlighted, but the problems are not limited to one company. Between 2004 and 2007, the HSE offshore safety division carried out an asset integrity programme involving targeted inspections of nearly 100 platforms. The report, which is known as the key programme 3 report, had some worrying things to tell us about the lack of maintenance of platforms and the effect on work force morale. Some of the problems related to the commercial environment in which the industry operates. In particular, problems arise when platforms are scheduled for transfer or disposal and are shifted from one operating company to another and maintenance is not kept up to scratch. In any case, the report has had a profound effect on the industry and investment is now being made in reaction to it. It highlights the need for the most intensive vigilance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para25"><a name="08070259000043">Like some in the oil industry and the trade unions, I am concerned about some employment practices in the industry. There is what is known as the NRB culture, which stands for &#147;Not Required Back&#148;, by which a worker can be removed from a platform without any right of appeal on the say-so of one official. The industry has also resisted the implementation of the working-time regulations in the offshore industry. There is a lack of a common permit-to-work system. At the root of almost every significant accident in the North sea oil and gas industry, including Piper Alpha, there is failure in the permit-to-work system. That system needs to be reviewed so that there is a common system offshore. Earlier this year I introduced a ten-minute Bill to address some of those issues. It would have reformed safety representative and committee rules offshore and provided an element of independence in the system. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views on those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para26"><a name="08070259000044">The roll-call of honour for Piper Alpha is long. It takes in the survivors; the rescue crews who operated in such difficult conditions to bring both survivors and bodies home; the medical teams who waited in Aberdeen for the helicopters to bring in the most seriously injured, who worked incredible hours, who were fiercely committed to tend to them, and who in some cases spent years repairing the damaged bodies; the crews of the lifting vessels who recovered from the wreckage the accommodation module that contained the bodies of many of the victims; the police and others who went into the module after it was removed and brought ashore to recover the bodies; and the psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and counsellors who worked not only with the survivors and the families, but with many of the rescuers. Many others in the public and private sectors made a contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="80702h0001.htm_para27"><a name="08070259000045">The survivors are left with memories not only of lost friends and workmates, but of a horrifying experience, and those memories will never leave them.

At this time of year, that sense of loss grows, and on an anniversary such as this, it is even more intense. A number of events have been arranged in Aberdeen this weekend, and there will be a memorial service in the St. Nicholas kirk on Sunday. Our thoughts today are with all those involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para0"><a name="08070259000048">When we turn on the gas tap at home, switch on the lights at night or fill our car with petrol, we take for granted just what has gone on to make that possible. These things are out of sight and out of mind in the North sea, but people are working in a hostile and dangerous environment 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every week of the year to ensure that it is easy for us to get the energy that we need. We need to remember those people and the challenges that they face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para1"><a name="08070259000049">I should remind hon. Members of my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests, because I am a shareholder in Shell, but I have far more of a constituency interest in the debate. My constituency is just outside Aberdeen, and many of my constituents, like those of the hon. Gentleman, live with or work in the industry, and others have relatives who do so or who work offshore. However, the House often forgets&#151;this is particularly true of the offshore work force, as the hon. Gentleman highlighted&#151;that many of those in the work force commute from elsewhere in the country. The challenge that we face therefore touches the whole country, and hon. Members should not forget that they might have constituents who have connections with the North sea or who work there. All hon. Members should therefore take an interest in what is happening to that major industry, which is on our doorstep. As I say, we often take it for granted because it is out of sight and out of mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para2"><a name="08070259000050">A lot of lessons have been learned, but we must not be complacent. Today&#146;s debate and the 20th anniversary remind us what those lessons were and ensure that they  <br>

are kept up to date and reinforced. I, too, pay tribute to the work of Lord Cullen, because his report was a major way of ensuring that the lessons that could be learned were learned and that a culture of safety spread around the world, as the hon. Gentleman said. With the passage of time, however, there is a danger that we will not remember those lessons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para3"><a name="08070259000051">One of the easier lessons to learn&#151;the hon. Gentleman touched on this&#151;was how to deal with the human safety elements. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) said, we get safety briefings whenever we visit anyone operating in the North sea. Indeed, safety onshore is also an issue, and the culture in the companies is very much about safety. It was perhaps easier to deal with the human safety elements&#151;the individual accidents and falls&#151;because they were easier to measure. They were also possibly easier to tackle by training people and altering the safety culture. There is an apocryphal story that a lot of people at BP joke that staff have to hold the handrail when they go up and down stairs. Tragically, however, a neighbour of mine fell down the stairs at night a few years ago and was killed. The simple safety lessons are therefore just as important as the big ones.</p>

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="08070259000052"><a name="80702h0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="08070259000466"><b>Malcolm Bruce:</b>
 My hon. Friend is making an important point, but does he agree that one of the most significant arguments in the Cullen report was that we should place a responsibility for safety on the operators, instead of producing a tick-box culture? That effectively precludes them from getting away with saying, &#147;We&#146;ve done all these things&#148; when an accident happens, and ensures that they are still responsible&#151;whatever else they have done&#151;because they did not anticipate the accident.</p>

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="08070259000053"><a name="80702h0002.htm_spnew2"><a name="08070259000467"><b>Sir Robert Smith:</b>
 My right hon. Friend makes an important point about the safety case. We should put the onus on companies to think about safety across their whole operation, so that they do not feel that they have done their duty just because they have ticked the boxes. People should be thinking about safety all the time; whenever they look at a process, an investment decision, a change to a way of operating or the installation of a new piece of equipment, they should ask what the safety implications are. How will such things affect the integrity and working of the platform? As the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North said, the permit-to-work culture is an extremely important way of reducing risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para4"><a name="08070259000054">A few years ago, I went to a construction yard that was building a platform for the North sea. The platform&#146;s operator had said, &#147;We want the same level of safety when you are building the platform onshore as will apply when we operate it.&#148; The construction industry&#146;s initial reaction was, &#147;Construction is inherently dangerous. We won&#146;t be able to achieve that.&#148; However, by taking the lessons that had been learned offshore into the construction yard, it was amazed to see how dramatically it improved its own safety regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para5"><a name="08070259000055">Indeed, that also improved financial efficiency. There should not be seen to be a conflict between a good safety regime and a company&#146;s financial operation, because having an efficient and effective understanding of safety processes can also benefit a company&#146;s financial understanding of how it operates. Anyone who thinks that finance should be a barrier to safety should take note of a quote from the airline industry, where someone  <br>

said, &#147;If you think safety is expensive, you should try the alternative.&#148; It really is important to keep the importance of safety at the forefront of people&#146;s minds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000056">As others have said, the layman might think that the high price of oil would be a good thing because companies would make more money and could invest more in safety, but the issue poses a real challenge. With a high oil price, the desire is to keep the oil flowing as fast as possible because that is where the profit comes from. Companies find the oil when it is cheap and produce it when it is expensive; they do not want to turn the tap off for routine maintenance if they can delay doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para7"><a name="08070259000057">The HSE&#146;s KP3 report contains a timely reminder of the importance of physical structures, and this goes back to my point about it being easier to deal with individual human safety incidents. Safety-critical devices, and other devices, which do not look safety critical, but which could play a crucial role if a piece of safety-critical equipment fails, need to be monitored to ensure that they are up to standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08070259000058">People think that the North sea has run out of oil and gas, but it is still very much alive, and the industry is still vibrant. Only the other week, we had the celebration of 21 years of the Alwyn field. When the platforms there were built, people believed that the field would have been shut down by now, but they are now talking about another 21 years. At that celebration, the engineer who worked on the platform&#151;he had come back from retirement&#151;was thanked for over-engineering it and giving it a structure that would allow it to sustain another 20 years of life. A lot of infrastructure&#151;pipelines, compressors and other equipment&#151;that was expected to be coming to the end of its life is now crucial to the economic development of the North sea and will need a much longer life. It is therefore vital that we maintain the structural integrity of those physical features to ensure that they are up to scratch and can endure the stress that they will be under.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08070259000059">The other vital challenge, I suppose, concerns skills in the industry, which we often talk about. The work force is ageing, and if production and new investment are to be maintained, many new people will have to come into the industry. When people have been in an industry a long time, the culture has grown up with them, but if a whole new generation is brought into operations, the safety culture must be fully inculcated in the training of those people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08070259000060">OPITO, the oil and gas academy in Portlethen in my constituency, has set standards for training around the world, which ensure a good foundation for anyone entering the industry. However, the skills shortage is also a challenge for the HSE, which needs people who understand the industry to work for it. We need the HSE to be fully resourced so that it can compete in a very competitive market and secure the skills to ensure that it can monitor what happens offshore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08070259000061">The vital lessons that were learned in the disaster must not be forgotten. There is a challenge, as we extend the life of the North sea oil field and as new fields are tied back to old platforms, to ensure that the integrity of safety-critical parts of those platforms is fully maintained. As a new generation of workers, many of whom may not have been touched at all by knowledge of Piper Alpha, comes into the industry, we need to   <br>

 I want to make only a short contribution, and to pay tribute to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran), not only for obtaining the debate, but because over the years, in all his incarnations in and out of the House, he has been closely involved with the safety of people working offshore in the North sea. His commitment is recognised, and his knowledge and understanding of the issues are well regarded. The House should appreciate the presence of an hon. Member who can bring that expertise to bear on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para12"><a name="08070259000063">The part of the city of Aberdeen that I represent contained the headquarters of Occidental Petroleum, which stood as a pretty stark reminder of the disaster, not only for the people of the city, but for the company, which was effectively&#151;and rightly&#151;drummed out of the North sea afterwards. The building stood empty for several years. On the other hand, and by sharp contrast, the North sea headquarters of BP is also in my constituency. The company has just moved into new offices, and by its own admission has had to re-evaluate its commitment to the North sea because of changing circumstances&#151;not just the oil price but the amount of oil still to be produced. What is impressed on anyone who goes there is that there is an ageing infrastructure and there are difficult technical and financial challenges offshore, but BP is determined not to compromise safety. It is right that we should have debates such as today&#146;s, so that it knows it is operating in a climate of focused interest and concern about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08070259000064">I just want to reinforce the point that I made in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith). Apart from the very specific recommendations of the Cullen report, there was a debate at the time about whether the right approach would be to set out in detail the safety rules that should be applied, or&#151;this was where the debate settled&#151;to make the operators responsible for safety in every way, requiring them to demonstrate to the HSE that they had a fully tested and viable case for the safety of their installations. That cultural shift is hugely beneficial, because the culture is built into every minute of every day, and every aspect of every operation. We must maintain that approach at the heart of things, and it is worth reinforcing that now.</p>

The fire, the heat, the smoke, the bravery and the fear of what was about to happen to those men who were still alive are memories that will stay locked in many minds forever.

Too often we hear that the price being asked for a gallon of petrol is too high, but we do not think what the price has really been for those working to produce that gallon of petrol or a barrel of oil. It is right that this debate should be held today for a number of reasons, many of which have been touched on, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran), not only on securing the debate, but on the measured and thoughtful way in which he dealt with a difficult issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para15"><a name="08070259000067">I also want to mention the speeches of my hon.

Members who cannot be here today, and they include my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael), in whose constituency a large part of the oil industry is based. He feels strongly about the issue and would have liked to be here, but unfortunately other parliamentary business has kept him away. The speeches that have been made show that right hon. and hon.

As well as remembering the ones who did not survive, I pay tribute to those without whose help more people would not have returned to their loved ones. It is right to remember those who lost their lives working in an industry that has given us so much that has made our country what it is today. Learning lessons from history is one way to make the future better and to take the actions that will ensure that workers and their families will never again experience what unfolded 20 years ago&#151;in the North sea, or wherever in the world companies work to extract oil and other oil-related products. We must never rely on luck to ensure the safety of those who work in the industry; no one should risk their life on a daily basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08070259000070">What happened on the night of the disaster is well documented and the subsequent inquiry under Lord Cullen detailed the safety shortcomings and a range of recommendations for the way forward. There is no doubt that the repercussions, notably the recommendations of the Cullen report and the huge investment that followed, have completely changed the industry. Investment in safety measures including maintenance, improved regulation and the greater priority given to training have all helped to make the industry far safer today than it was 20 years ago. However, today&#146;s debate, as well as providing an occasion to mourn and remember those who lost their lives and celebrate their bravery, must also mark a point of reflection for the industry.</p>

that is undoubtedly the case&#151;there were only two deaths in the oil industry in 2006-07 compared with 77 deaths in the construction industry&#151;there can be no room for complacency. The Offshore Industry Liaison Committee/National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union is not alone in arguing that a number of incidents since Piper Alpha could have led to multiple fatalities on a similar scale, with only luck preventing an escalation. If there are still changes to be made, we have to make sure that we identify and act on them, without the need for another major incident to focus the mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08070259000072">The nature of the oil industry dictates that there will always be risk. However, that does not mean workers being at the mercy of the risks in that industry. Piper Alpha opened the eyes of the industry to specific risk factors, while the Cullen report offered a blueprint for action. The industry is now fully aware of the dangers and how to mitigate them. Accidents will happen, but there is no excuse for not taking every precaution. Indeed, if any reminder were required of the inherent risks in the oil industry, the fire on the Thistle Alpha platform off the coast of Shetland just seven months ago should serve as a timely reminder. The cause, a leaking pipe in a 30-year-old system, clearly illustrates the vital importance of properly maintaining existing platforms and machinery. The fatal accident inquiry into the Brent Bravo incident, in which two men tragically died, cited substandard maintenance practices by Shell, while the HSE&#146;s key programme 3 report, to which many members have referred, raised worrying questions about declining standards of maintenance, particularly on ageing platforms that may be likely to change ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para21"><a name="08070259000073">We must ensure that the renewed focus on fresh exploration in the North sea does not detract from the proper maintenance and upgrading of existing platforms. I am sure that all hon. Members would agree that the interests of safety should not be influenced by the fluctuating fortunes of individual oil companies or the oil industry as a whole. If another Piper Alpha is to be avoided, the industry must not adopt the attitude of the frontiersman. I welcome the Minister&#146;s view on the prospects for extending external scrutiny of safety systems, particularly in terms of the Health and Safety Executive&#146;s role and scope in ensuring that safety representatives can operate independently when carrying out offshore checks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para22"><a name="08070259000074">We have heard about the regulations in place as a result of the Piper Alpha tragedy. However, it is worth pointing out that regulations work only if they are followed by both management and employees. Regulations make a big difference, but it will always come down to the individuals charged with their implementation. Effective and appropriate training is essential. We all know that corporate memory can fade quickly without proactive work from the industry. I commend the work of Oil and Gas UK in teaching the lessons of Piper Alpha to younger technicians in the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para23"><a name="08070259000075">Along with appropriate training, the morale of the offshore work force must not be neglected. Historically, communication between employees and management and between the oil industry and the offshore contractors&#146; staff who typically provide the bulk of the work force has not been as good as it could be. Some issues have been handled poorly, and the &#147;not required back&#148; feature of the industry poses an enduring risk of fostering a culture of grievance among some workers.

industry, low morale can be disastrous. It is particularly worrying to read reports of instances where staff have raised safety concerns with management that do not appear to have been properly investigated or acted upon. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s thoughts on that.</p>

We are all extremely grateful. As the only English Member speaking in the debate, it is important that I put on record that this is a UK-wide issue. It is certainly not just a Scottish issue. The whole United Kingdom benefits from North sea oil, and every Member of the House should rightly and properly be concerned about the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para25"><a name="08070259000078">The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North was right when he said that the primary purpose of the debate should be to remember and pay tribute to those who lost their lives or suffered severe injuries&#151;he mentioned burns and so on&#151;in that terrible tragedy on 6 July 1988. It must also involve more than that. We must ensure that we never become complacent about offshore safety, and we must do all that we can to prevent a similar tragedy occurring. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) reminded us, another major industry-related fire took place only seven months ago in Shetland, so ongoing vigilance is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="80702h0002.htm_para26"><a name="08070259000079">We have heard the accounts of what happened on that terrible night of 6 July 1988.

It is a tremendously difficult time for the relatives of the dead as we approach the 20th anniversary. Children still mourn parents, wives and partners still mourn their loved ones, and people still bear the effects of terrible burns and injuries from that night 20 years ago.</p>

It is important to recognise that all 106 of its recommendations were accepted by both the industry and the Government. Lord Cullen chaired the official public inquiry, which consisted of two parts. The first established the causes of the disaster, and the second made recommendations for changes to the safety regime. The final report was published in November 1990.</p>

Responsibilities for implementing the recommendations were spread across the regulator and the industry. The Government accepted the recommendations in full and committed themselves to reforming offshore health and safety legislation. By 1993, all 48 recommendations for which industry operators were directly responsible had been acted upon and substantially implemented. The Health and Safety Executive had also developed and implemented Lord Cullen&#146;s key recommendation: the introduction of safety regulations requiring the operator or owner of every fixed and mobile installation in UK waters to submit a safety case to the HSE for acceptance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para2"><a name="08070259000083">Parliament has not been idle since that terrible night. It has ensured that the appropriate primary and secondary legislation has been introduced to back up the recommendations of the Cullen report. The Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations came into force in 1992. By November 1993, a safety case for every installation had been submitted to the HSE, and by November 1995 all safety cases had been accepted. The regulations require the operator or owner, known as the duty holder, of every fixed and mobile installation operating in UK waters to submit a safety case to the HSE. The safety case must give full details of the arrangements for managing health and safety and controlling major accident hazards on the installation. Parliament quite properly revised the regulations in 2005, in light of 13 years&#146; experience. The objective of the revisions was to improve the effectiveness of the regulations while reducing the burden of three-yearly resubmissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08070259000084">In addition to the application of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, particular hazards in the offshore environment may need special consideration. Major sets of UK regulation therefore apply to the industry&#146;s operations. The Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 1992 are underpinned by more detailed regulations. The Offshore Installations and Pipeline Works (Management and Administration) Regulations 1995 set out requirements for the safe management of offshore installations, such as the appointment of offshore installation managers and the use of permit-to-work systems. The Offshore Installations (Prevention of Fire and Explosion, and Emergency Response) Regulations 1995 provide for the protection of offshore workers from fire and explosion and for securing effective emergency response. Lastly, the Offshore Installations and Wells (Design and Construction, etc.) Regulations 1996 are aimed at ensuring the integrity of installations, the safety of offshore and onshore wells, and the safety of the offshore workplace environment. That is what Parliament has done on the regulatory front since that terrible disaster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para4"><a name="08070259000085">It is important to look at the safety record in the offshore industry since the Piper Alpha disaster. The latest officially sanctioned and agreed fatal and major injury figures for offshore workers are for the year 2006-07. There were two fatalities during that period, compared with two in 2005-06, none in 2004-05 and  <br>

three in 2003-04. Sadly, it is still a dangerous industry that takes workers&#146; lives, although, thankfully, in much smaller numbers than in 1988. Some 39 major injuries were reported during 2006-07, representing a fall of more than 20 per cent. from the 2005-06 figures. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) made the interesting point that the industry is not declining: in 2006-07, there were an estimated 28,100 offshore workers, which represents an increase of 22 per cent. on the 2005-06 estimate of 23,000. His point was very well made indeed.</p>

 It is also worth putting on record that the industry has come up with a range of estimates of what is yet to be produced from the North sea, which could be nearly as much as the amount so far produced. It will certainly continue to produce for the next 30 years, contrary to widespread opinion that the North sea&#146;s oil and gas-producing days are over. We are still 90 per cent. self-sufficient in oil and 70 per cent. in gas. People will have to continue to work there for many years on what is a mature infrastructure, so it is really important that safety standards are maintained.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is right to put on record that there is far more oil out there than we all thought 20 years or so ago. Furthermore, that oil is more difficult and technically challenging to bring to the surface than that extracted in earlier years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para5"><a name="08070259000088">In 2006-07, the rate of fatal and major injuries among offshore workers was 145.5 per 100,000 workers, compared with 225 in 2005-06, so there has been an improvement. Let us consider briefly the major types of accident. Slips, trips and falls, being trapped or struck by or striking against equipment, and injuries associated with lifts, pulleys and swinging loads account for 83 per cent. of injuries. We have preliminary and strictly provisional figures for 2007-08, which will be subject to a full and detailed analysis, and possibly revision. Given the importance of the issues, however, as much up-to-date data should be put on record as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000089">According to those provisional figures, the HSE does not think that there has been a deterioration this year. There were no RIDDOR&#151;Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995&#151;reportable fatal injuries in 2007-08, for which we can all be extremely thankful, and the number of major injuries sustained was similar to that in 2006-07, 39, which was the lowest recorded figure since 1995-96. The combined fatal and major injury rate for 2007-08 is expected to be similar to that for 2006-07, which was 145.5 injuries per 100,000 workers. It is certainly pleasing that the overall figures for fatalities and major injuries in the offshore industry do not appear to be following a worrying trend, although there are no grounds for complacency, as all Members have said. Current statistics indicate a combined total of 74 significant hydrocarbon releases, although we await further details from a few duty holders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para7"><a name="08070259000090">It is important, however, to look at the current state of the industry, and I have a number of questions, some of which have been posed already today, that I too would like to put to the Minister.

answers, perhaps she could write to me and other Members present with the Department&#146;s view. That would be entirely acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para8"><a name="08070259000091">A few years ago, the general secretary of the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee&#151;an independent union&#151;said that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para9"><a name="08070259000092">which is a worrying comment. However, we have heard from several Members this morning about the concerns that the pipelines and compressors are old and were perhaps intended to last for 20 or 25 years only. Is the Minister satisfied that the inspection regime, particularly for pipelines and compressors and other such vital infrastructure, is up to the job? What reassurances can she provide that she is confident in and satisfied with the inspection regime? Many of the pipelines and compressors were not expected to last for a further 10 or 15 years. We need reassurances on that very important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para10"><a name="08070259000093">The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North suggested that we introduce independent safety inspectors. The Minister will know as well as I do that there is a long tradition of workers within the coal mining industry appointing, perhaps through trade unions, their own safety representatives. I do not know the view of the then National Coal Board when that was introduced, but it has proved incredibly successful in the coal industry and has given real confidence to the work force, because they are working alongside, and have nominated, those supervising, or having a major input into, their safety. There might be valid practical reasons why that would not work, or be applicable, in the offshore oil industry, but if so, I would like to hear that from the Minister. I would also be interested to know whether she thinks that that could be explored to ensure that the safety statistics that I outlined continue to follow a downward trend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08070259000094">Finally, while researching this debate, I learned that the HSE had imposed a target to reduce by 2004 the number of offshore hydrocarbon releases to 50 per cent. of the 1999-2000 baseline figure, but I could not find out whether that target had been met. Perhaps the Minister, or one of her officials, has the answer, but if not, will she be kind enough to write to me?</p>

Certainly he brought back for me many of the images from that day, and many of us will have watched from the safety of our own homes and workplaces as those terrible events unfolded.

know what was happening out on Piper Alpha. I also recognise his contribution to the promotion of health and safety standards in the North sea. He has campaigned inside and outside this House, and after listening to him this morning, we all appreciate why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para13"><a name="08070259000097">It is important that we remember with sympathy those who lost their lives in that terrible disaster, 20 years ago, the families of those people, and those who were injured in the disaster. As colleagues have said, it has had a lasting effect, and there is a dark memory and image of it across many communities in Scotland and beyond. I think that it was the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) who highlighted, in an intervention, what my hon. Friend was saying: the focal point was undoubtedly Aberdeen and the north-east, but the disaster touched communities all over the country. In my town, three men lost their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para14"><a name="08070259000098">The message from this morning&#146;s debate is that we never want to see a repeat of that disaster. It was a wake-up call both for the offshore oil and gas industry and, as my hon. Friend pointed out, for the then Government. I know that he held many meetings with Ministers at that time. The cost of the disaster was very large in terms of the number of lives that were lost or shattered, and it cost &#163;2 billion in damage and lost production. It also emphasised, in the starkest possible way, the importance of the oil industry to this country and the importance of having a strong safety regime offshore for the viability of a key sector of the UK economy. The industry employs 30,000 people and supports hundreds of thousands more jobs onshore. There are billions of pounds&#146; worth of offshore investment, and there is likely to be even more investment with the introduction of carbon capture and storage. All that is at risk if safety standards are not given the highest priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para15"><a name="08070259000099">Many hon. Members have mentioned the Cullen inquiry. We agree that one result of the disaster was one of the most radical reforms ever made to a regulatory regime. Lord Cullen&#146;s 1990 public inquiry report made 106 far-reaching recommendations, which have been mentioned, all of which have been implemented&#151;some by the Government and some by the industry. There have been major achievements since then, such as the transfer of responsibility for regulating health and safety in the offshore oil and gas industry from the Department of Energy to the Health and Safety Executive in 1991&#151;a move that was welcomed across the board. Another major achievement was the replacement of the earlier, prescriptive health and safety regime with a new goal-setting series of regulations that were made under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para16"><a name="08070259000100">The cornerstone of the new regime is the Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 1992. As the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) said, those regulations came into effect in 1993, and they have since been revised and modernised. They implemented Lord Cullen&#146;s key recommendation that offshore duty holders should systematically identify major offshore hazards, assess the risks, set out the necessary controls in a safety case and submit it to the HSE. No installation can operate in UK waters unless the HSE formally accepts a safety case for it. It is not just about regulation: the industry&#146;s whole approach to health and safety was galvanised after Cullen. The  <br>

offshore industry spent more than &#163;2 billion on health and safety improvements between 1988 and 1998, and has spent much more since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para17"><a name="08070259000101">Certainly, the aftermath of the Piper Alpha disaster saw a huge and necessary improvement in health and safety standards offshore. In the 20 years since then, there has been a significant reduction in health and safety risks and the industry has come a long way. I pay tribute to the work of the HSE in setting the regulatory framework and in leading the industry and other players towards having a better health and safety record offshore. However, as colleagues have pointed out, there are still issues affecting the industry&#146;s health and safety performance that need to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08070259000102">The North sea and other offshore areas remain hazardous places to work. I do not know if you have ever been offshore, Mr. Bercow, but even on a short visit, one has to go through the safety procedures and must understand that it is not a jaunt in a helicopter and that one is going out to a hazardous work regime. Like many hon. Members, I have done that. If one did not appreciate before that it is a difficult area in which to work, one realises it afterwards. Even visitors need to be alert to the health and safety issues and to their responsibilities as individuals, and the industry has to ensure that they not only get out there safely, but get back safely too. There are hazards from the hostile environment and from the possibility of helicopter crashes, ship collisions, structural collapse, explosions, fires and well blowouts. The potential for a major accident remains, and control of that risk demands constant and close attention from duty holders and the HSE, as the industry&#146;s health and safety regulator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para19"><a name="08070259000103">The industry is dynamic and constantly changing. It is highly innovative, and develops cutting-edge technology to solve both old and new problems. Innovation is potentially good for health and safety, as well as exploration and production, because it provides opportunities to design out risks. The HSE is responsive to changing circumstances and is very happy to work with the industry to develop solutions that improve efficiency and raise safety standards. Health and safety should not be a costly afterthought; it should be an integral part of managing offshore operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para20"><a name="08070259000104">The risk of a major offshore incident is ever present. Even given the huge strides forward on health and safety over the years, it is essential that vigilance is maintained and that the lessons of Piper Alpha are not forgotten. The incident at BP&#146;s Texas City refinery is a recent example in the sector of the disastrous consequences that can occur when safety issues are not given the highest priority. We must all redouble our efforts to avoid a similar occurrence in UK waters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para21"><a name="08070259000105">I should like to recognise the industry&#146;s efforts to improve health and safety through Oil and Gas UK, the Offshore Industry Advisory Committee and Step Change in Safety. In addition, the Government-led forum, PILOT, is concentrating on health and safety offshore, which I welcome. At last week&#146;s PILOT meeting, I called on the industry to raise its game on health and safety still further. I called in particular on people at the top of the industry to show greater leadership to raise those standards. I am doing that because of some of the worrying messages that flowed from the HSE&#146;s &#147;Offshore Asset Integrity and Inspection Report&#148;, which was published in November, on key programme 3. My hon. Friend  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="2 July 2008">

touched on many of the issues that the report raised. As those elements are safety critical, any failure could result in a major incident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para22"><a name="08070259000106">The results are worrying because even after 20 years of giving high attention to health and safety issues, the report drew attention to a number of weaknesses. The report reached several conclusions, such as that the offshore industry&#146;s poor performance and lack of progress in improving areas of asset integrity raises the concern that senior managers may not fully appreciate the implications that that could have on safety and business performance. It concluded that many senior managers do not make adequate use of integrity management data and do not give sufficient priority to ongoing maintenance. It said that the most senior management levels in companies need better key indicators of performance to inform decision making and to focus resources, and it found that many management monitoring systems tend to be overly biased towards occupational risk data at the expense of major hazard precursors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08070259000107">The report also concluded that a key element in balancing priorities is ensuring that the engineering function has sufficient authority to put forward the case for major hazard control and to act as a backstop against degraded safety-critical elements and safety-related equipment and structure. It concluded that the influence of the engineering function has declined in many companies, and that there is poor communication not only between companies&#151;my hon. Friend mentioned that&#151;but between installations within companies. The industry is not effectively sharing good and best practice. It also found that cross-organisational learning processes and mechanisms to secure corporate memory need to be improved. Although there has been progress, such matters show that we still need a renewed and continuing emphasis on sustained improvements, not least given the number of people who work offshore and the likelihood that that may be expanded in the future, as the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) and others have highlighted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para24"><a name="08070259000108">As the offshore division of HSE conducts its regulatory oversight, it will use some key factors to hold the industry to account. Much of the offshore infrastructure is at, or has exceeded, its intended design life, which is an issue that has been identified this morning. Ageing offshore installations, changing ownership and management, worker inexperience, lack of corporate memory by managers, increased use of contractors and competition are among the growing challenges facing the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para25"><a name="08070259000109">Increased work force involvement in safety-critical issues is vital if the offshore industry is to improve its health and safety record. Incident statistics have plateaued over the past few years, and the UK is now reported to rank in the middle on an international basis, yet we have always aimed to be the best with regard to health and safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para26"><a name="08070259000110">Taking account of those and other factors, I am pleased to advise my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North and other hon. Members that the Secretary of State has commissioned the HSE to review the industry&#146;s progress on the issues identified by the KP3 programme. The issues include focusing on industry leadership to create a stronger safety culture in which the involvement of the work force, including the industry&#146;s  <br>

trade unions, will be critical. We expect the review to be completed by April 2009, and the report to be published soon after. That report will be put into the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="08070259000111"><a name="80702h0003.htm_spnew2"><a name="08070259000474"><b>Mr. Doran:</b>
 I am grateful to the Minister for her statement. Will she confirm that the review will also consider the structure and the operation of the safety committees and the safety representative system?</p>

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="08070259000112"><a name="80702h0003.htm_spnew3"><a name="08070259000475"><b>Mrs. McGuire:</b>
 That is why, in the last element, I particularly emphasised the involvement of workers and trade unions. In any of the conversations that I have had, both with the unions and with the industry, there was a strong recognition that workers, either through their organised trade unions or in other ways, must be totally involved in managing safety issues. After all, they have the most intimate knowledge of some of the issues that impact on this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para27"><a name="08070259000113">I am glad to tell the House that the industry, in partnership with HSE, has already agreed to focus on three priorities to address the key issues from KP3 and the safety concerns of the offshore division of HSE&#146;s hazardous installations directorate. At the PILOT meeting, I impressed on the industry that Government attach great importance to progress on those fronts, and I am glad to report a shared understanding of the importance of that issue. The industry has agreed that its health and safety priorities are leadership, installation integrity and work force involvement. I want to say a few words on each of those fronts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="80702h0003.htm_para28"><a name="08070259000114">First, it is unquestionably the case that health and safety can be improved and standards maintained through strong leadership from the top of organisations. That was the theme of a recent HSE conference entitled, &#147;Leading from the top&#151;avoiding major accidents&#148;. My second point covers installation or asset integrity. I have said that the offshore installations are ageing, and that comment has been reflected in much of what we have heard this morning. Much offshore equipment is now past its original intended life. If the offshore industry is to have a long-term sustainable and safe future and the benefits of offshore oil and gas are to be maximised for the nation, the assets must be properly maintained. There is now a widespread recognition within industry that that is a major issue.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is a little bit sour about that matter. It is not the case that we will wait until 2009. Constant work is being done by the offshore division of the HSE, the industry and the unions. As I hope I have reflected in my short contribution, that was a major item of discussion at last week&#146;s PILOT forum in which the industry, Government and the unions came together to discuss the issues. Therefore, it is not a case of nothing being done until April 2009. I hope that he will recognise that this is a matter that the HSE takes very seriously, and has taken very seriously since it took over the regulatory obligations in 1991.</p>

 The Minister has rightly emphasised the HSE&#146;s important role in the offshore safety regime, but with the skills shortage facing the industry, and the HSE having to recruit from the same pool of available people in a climate of competition around the world, how easy is it for the HSE to find the right skilled people to operate that safety regime effectively?</p>

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="08070259000118"><a name="80702h0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="08070259000479"><b>Mrs. McGuire:</b>
 I hope that the HSE continues to carry out its obligations and recruit the right people for the right job. Anybody who has dealt with our officials at HSE level, particularly in our offshore division, will recognise that we have some good people who understand the industry and know how to challenge it over health and safety issues. Obviously, we must recognise that there is always competition for high-quality people, and the HSE will keep the matter under review.</p>

They are closest to the hazards and often best placed to alert managers to problems and to ways of improving safe practice.

in an atmosphere in which everyone is encouraged to have an open discussion on health and safety problems and solutions. Evidence suggests that there is still some way to go before we can ensure a fully effective safety culture in all companies that work offshore. I want to see those at the top of the industry giving more support to safety representatives. I want them to create an open environment in which those people who work on the rigs and the offshore installations can openly discuss some of the health and safety issues that are of concern. I made that comment last week as well. If I have not dealt with any specifics, I will certainly will get back to hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para2"><a name="08070259000121">In conclusion, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North for raising this matter this morning. The offshore oil and gas industry remains crucial to the UK economy, but we must ensure that our health and safety standards are the highest in the world. The industry must raise its game and I welcome its commitment to address the issues through the three priorities that I have already mentioned. If we get this right, there is no reason why the industry should not enjoy a long, safe and prosperous future.</p>

With your permission, Mr. Bercow, I think that it would be appropriate for this House to fall silent to remember the 167 men who died, their families and those who were injured rather than to continue to fill the allocated time. That would be a suitable and appropriate memorial for those who died on Piper Alpha.</p>

 I have instigated this debate because I, like many others, believe that the suffering of the Palestinian people is both a terrible humanitarian disaster and the cause of continuing instability and anger across the Arab and Muslim world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para5"><a name="08070259000125">I agree with all those who argue that the best way to bring relief to the Palestinian people and to calm the bitter anger of the middle east would be to implement a two-state solution with the Palestinians establishing their state on the lands that belong to them in international law. That would mean a Palestinian state based on the 1967 boundaries, with East Jerusalem as its capital. That proposal was accepted by the Palestine Liberation Organisation as part of the Oslo peace process and is the basis of the current peace plan supported by the whole Arab League. I believe that if the international community were willing to uphold international law and insist that Israel honour it, peace could be assured on that basis in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000126">Unfortunately, when we examine the Israeli wall, its route and the associated infrastructure of control in the Palestinian occupied territories&#151;closures, settlements, settler-only roads and so on&#151;it is absolutely clear that Israel has no intention of agreeing to the establishment of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state in accordance with international law. We should be clear that that is the policy of successive Israeli Governments, whoever the leader or whatever the party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para7"><a name="08070259000127">Israel made 14 reservations to the road map, which is the supposed route to peace behind which the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia are combined. Reservation 5 states, among other things:</p>
<a name="80702h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08070259000414"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The provisional state will have provisional borders and certain aspects of sovereignty, be fully demilitarized...without the authority to undertake defense alliances or military cooperation, and Israeli control over the entry and exit of all persons and cargo, as well as of its air space and electromagnetic spectrum.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para8"><a name="08070259000128">Clearly, that is not a description of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para9"><a name="08070259000129">It is important to be clear that although Israel insisted that the PLO, before entering the Oslo process, recognise the right of Israel to exist, and that although Israel and the international community insist that Hamas should do the same before rather than after negotiations, successive Israeli Governments have not recognised the right of the Palestinians to a sovereign state. They mention &#147;certain aspects of sovereignty&#148; in reservation 5 to the road map, and other phrases used are &#147;autonomy plus&#148; and &#147;state minus&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para10"><a name="08070259000130">If we are clear about that and then examine the route of the wall, or security fence&#151;in some places it is a wall and in others a monstrous fence&#151;it is clear that Israel is intent on confining the Palestinian population to a series of cantons or enclaves that are intended to perform the same function as did the Bantustans under the South African apartheid system. Israel seeks to control the whole of Palestine from the Mediterranean to the Jordan river&#151;the confiscation of land along the Jordan river is truly shocking but little discussed. It seeks to control the whole territory and confine the Palestinian  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para11"><a name="08070259000131">The wall separates Palestinian villages from their land, surrounds Palestinian towns, separates East Jerusalem from the west bank and incorporates massive illegal settlements within Israel. The more than 300 permanent closures and the settler-only roads mean that Palestinians cannot move about their territory. They are hemmed in and humiliated whenever they wish to travel. Their economy is shrinking and thus unemployment and poverty are growing and will continue to grow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para12"><a name="08070259000132">The point that I want to put to the Minister today is that everybody knows that such behaviour is a complete breach of international law. Israel is incorporating territory taken by force in breach of the UN charter. Its settlements, collective punishments, failure to provide decent conditions for civilians in the occupied territories and treatment of prisoners are grave breaches of the Geneva convention, yet the UK Government, the European Union and the United States of America are doing absolutely nothing to uphold international law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para20"><a name="08070259000140">President Bush has made his position clear, and I hope that today the Minister will make clear the position of Her Majesty&#146;s Government. President Bush, in his letter of 14 April 2004 to Prime Minister Sharon, basically spelled out that the Israeli proposal was acceptable. He made it clear that Israel&#146;s illegal settlements would not have to be handed over and that the 1967 boundaries need not be honoured. He also made it clear that, as progress was made, Israel would continue to control the borders and access to the sea and air.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para21"><a name="08070259000141">I am afraid that we cannot comfort ourselves by arguing that that was the view of an unpopular President whose term of office is about to end, because two months later the House of Representatives endorsed those commitments in a vote of 407 to nine, and the Senate endorsed them the next day in a vote of 95 to three. As might be expected, Prime Minister Sharon called the vote supporting the Bush letter one of the greatest diplomatic achievements in Israel&#146;s history. However, it is a setting aside of international law&#151;a very serious matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para22"><a name="08070259000142">We must also be clear that it is not just the US that is tearing up international law and accepting the idea of the outcome of the peace process being a Palestine that is a series of cantons or Bantustans without any control over its borders. The EU has not uttered such words, but it has a trade treaty with Israel that gives it privileged access to EU markets. It contains human rights conditionalities, but the EU has not seen fit to invoke them to uphold international law in the occupied territories, despite the ICJ making clear the binding nature of its judgment and the duty of all states to comply with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para23"><a name="08070259000143">My conclusion is pessimistic. As I said, I agree that the best way to bring relief to the Palestinian people and a just peace to the middle east would be a two-state solution that, in time, leads to an opening of borders and the integration of Palestine and Israel into the region. But the facts on the ground and the realities of international diplomacy tell us that what is to be offered to the Palestinians is a series of Bantustans and no control over their borders, within which they are to be offered autonomy. Furthermore, according to President Bush&#146;s letter, those Bantustans will also be obliged to accept all the refugees. No responsible Palestinian Government can accept that and any that did would not have the support of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para24"><a name="08070259000144">The conclusion has to be that we are facing years, if not decades, of terrible suffering, bloodshed and conflict. We will see, as Prime Minister Olmert has said, a campaign growing again&#151;it is starting&#151;for one united Palestine for all its people; it will be the second great anti-apartheid campaign. That will be the consequence of the reality on the ground, which is that the prospect of a realistic two-state solution is being destroyed. This is a recipe for endless conflict and bloodshed. In addition, the situation spells out that might is right and that international law can be set aside when it suits. That endangers wider international stability and feeds the justification for the use of violence by non-state actors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para25"><a name="08070259000145">My questions to Her Majesty&#146;s Government, through the Minister, are as follows. First, do they accept the International Court of Justice judgment on the war? Secondly, if they do, do they accept that that judgment is binding on the United Kingdom and that the UK is bound to take action to see it implemented? Thirdly, do the Government not agree, therefore, that they are  <br>

obliged to take action to ensure that the judgment is implemented and that, as a first step, they should surely invoke the human rights conditionalities in the European Union-Israeli trade agreement and refuse Israel&#146;s application to become a member of the OECD, which has conditionalities about respect for international law?</p>

 I congratulate the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) on securing this important debate. The middle east peace process continues to be a high priority for the Government as well as a topic of great interest to the House. We have had many debates on the subject and will continue to do so. The United Kingdom is committed to supporting Israel and the Palestinian Authority in their attempts to negotiate a peace agreement. We need one. We have heard not only the right hon. Lady&#146;s descriptions of the tragedy that has been this conflict for so long, but this morning we heard of more deaths in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para27"><a name="08070259000148">We recognise that huge challenges to the peace process remain. The Israeli barrier, and specifically the route of that barrier, is one such challenge. The right hon. Lady is right to highlight that. I would like to take this opportunity to set out the Government&#146;s legal view on the barrier; to say something about its impact on Palestinians; and to set out what the Government are doing to influence the Israeli Government&#146;s actions in relation to the barrier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para28"><a name="08070259000149">The Government agree with the conclusion of the International Court of Justice that building a barrier along the current route is unlawful. Building the barrier on occupied land is contrary to international law. The Government therefore supported the United Nations General Assembly resolution that acknowledged the ICJ&#146;s advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of the barrier in occupied Palestinian territory. While we recognise fully Israel's right to self-defence and agree that, if it decides that it wants to build a barrier it should be able to do that, we call for the barrier to be built either on or behind the green line. I take this opportunity to reiterate that call, which I have made many times in this place and in other places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para29"><a name="08070259000150">The Government are seriously concerned about the impact of the barrier on the lives of Palestinians, and deplore the destruction of Palestinian homes and the confiscation of Palestinian land associated with its construction. We are concerned about the effects of building the barrier on the Palestinian community and its access to agricultural land and water. I have seen for myself the impact that the barrier has had on the daily lives of Palestinians. During one of my visits to the occupied Palestinian territories, I met a family who, prior to the erection of the barrier at the end of their road, which was previously the only access, could get  <br>

into work in about five minutes and drop their kids off at school. Both parents were doctors working at the local hospital. Now, as a result of the construction of the barrier, that same journey takes them about 40 minutes on a good day, but that depends on how people feel at the checkpoints and whether they are obstructive or in a good or bad mood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="80702h0004.htm_para30"><a name="08070259000151">It is abundantly clear that the barrier has had a huge negative impact on the daily lives of many ordinary Palestinians. Nevertheless, as the right hon. Lady knows, the barrier is popular among a lot of Israelis. They have seen a huge decline in the numbers of suicide bombings and, as a consequence, a decline in the number of innocent people who have died at the hands of murderers and terrorists. That is, in a sense, the essence of the problem. The barrier is popular inside Israel and unpopular almost everywhere else.</p>

 The Minister refers to the number of Israeli civilians who have been killed by terrorist action&#151;of course, any attack on civilians is always an offence in international law&#151;but I hope that he will acknowledge that far more Palestinians suffer as a consequence of collective punishments that are also a breach of international law. The Israeli and Palestinian people, whenever they are asked, say time and again, in all surveys, that they support a two-state solution. To quote the popularity of the wall is to quote something that undermines what they really yearn for: a just peace, which can only come through two states.</p>

<p><a name="st_27"><a name="08070259000153"><a name="80702h0004.htm_spnew4"><a name="08070259000483"><b>Dr. Howells:</b>
 No, I disagree with that analysis. I think that it is possible for people to yearn for justice and a two-state solution and to acknowledge that the barrier has made life safer inside Israel. I would not deny for one moment that Palestinians and Israelis have been killed needlessly and horribly as a consequence of this conflict. I think that I have mentioned to the right hon. Lady in previous debates that even old friends of mine inside Israel&#151;she would recognise the phrase &#147;old lefties&#148;&#151;who believe that there ought to be one country, a fully integrated region, where people would live in peace with each other, acknowledge that they feel a lot more sanguine about their children going out at night or visiting restaurants in downtown Tel Aviv or wherever they happen to live. The wall is one of the reasons that it has been much more difficult for suicide bombers to get inside to kill people. Although I understand and acknowledge what she says about the medium and longer-term aspirations of people on both sides of the barrier who yearn for justice and peace, there is, nevertheless, a mentality inside Israel that the wall is protecting them from suicide bombers, and we must take that into account when discussing this subject.</p>

that point for her. Nevertheless, I stick to my argument, which is that, in the meantime, since parts of the wall or barrier have been built, that mentality has grown up inside Israel and is a new factor that we must take into consideration. I am not trying to justify the stealing of any land as a consequence of the wall&#146;s construction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para0"><a name="08070259000158">As the right hon. Lady knows, there are major impediments to access and movement on the west bank&#151;she mentioned some of those difficulties&#151;and Palestinians&#146; ability to move on the west bank has deteriorated significantly in recent years. Checkpoints, curfews, road blocks and the permit system have all contributed to that. The permit system has resulted in delays for some of our consulate staff in Jerusalem&#151;I experienced that when I was there&#151;as well as for people going to and from work daily. The permit and checkpoint restrictions have isolated west bank residents from east Jerusalem, which is an important consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para1"><a name="08070259000159">The Government continue to make it clear to Israel that it should halt the construction of the barrier on Palestinian land. When explaining that to the Israeli Government, we have made it clear that they should not create facts on the ground&#151;that is what they are&#151;which will prejudice future final-status negotiations. The route that the Israeli Cabinet approved on 20 February 2005 takes in a number of Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law. This morning, I asked Foreign Office officials how much land has been encompassed, and was told that it was 10 per cent. of the Palestinian territory. That is a huge amount of land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para2"><a name="08070259000160">The barrier also contributes to the fragmentation of the west bank. I have a map which shows the mess. I am not sure whether it looks like a Swiss cheese, which is how President Bush described it, but one can see why the right hon. Lady made the point about cantonisation or bantustans. It has always disappointed me to hear all sorts of excuses when I have spoken to Israeli Ministers, about how someone from Bethlehem, for example, can get to Ramallah, which is not far away. The whole area is tiny, but the journey involves going the best part of the way to Jericho, and back up the road to Ramallah. They have sometimes said that they will build tunnels, but that is not good enough and does not address the aspirations of Palestinians who live in the area, and it means the cantonisation of the sovereign state that we want to be created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para3"><a name="08070259000161">The route does nothing to enhance the move towards the creation of a two-state solution, and we will continue to raise that&#151;we do so regularly&#151;with the Israeli Government. In our discussions with Israel, we have focused on those parts of the barrier&#146;s route that we believe are most problematic. They include the settlement of Ariel, which cuts 20 km deep into the west bank at a point where it is only 45 km wide. At Ma&#146;ale Adumim, the barrier threatens territorial contiguity between the northern and southern parts of the west bank.

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para4"><a name="08070259000162">We have also raised with the Israeli Government our concerns about Israeli policies in Jerusalem, which threaten to cut off east Jerusalem from the west bank. Those policies include the routing of the barrier on occupied territory, settlement activity both within and around east Jerusalem, and increasingly restricted access to Jerusalem for Palestinian residents. We have also worked to raise those issues through the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para5"><a name="08070259000163">It is vital that we take this opportunity to focus on the wider picture&#151;this debate has an important bearing on it&#151;and notably the opportunity that the Annapolis process has provided to move the peace process forward. Since November&#146;s Annapolis conference, for the first time in seven years, we have been able to talk about a real process&#151;perhaps not progress, but at least a process. At the conference, we saw substantial political movement from both sides. President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert committed themselves to fortnightly meetings, and both restated their commitment to their road map obligations, meaning improved Palestinian security and a freeze on Israeli settlements. The US undertook to monitor the process, and all parties agreed to conclude negotiations by the end of 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000164">The conference was a signal of renewed international commitment to the peace process, and was remarkable for the strong Arab attendance, showing that the Arab world is prepared to be meaningfully involved in the process. The UK is deeply committed to supporting the peace negotiations. The Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister have been engaged in supporting the process, and both have spoken regularly to the key actors involved and have been very clear in their message. We expect all parties to fulfil their road map obligations. That means that Israel must freeze all settlement activity and that the Palestinians must work to improve their security sector. I believe that the Palestinians are trying to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para7"><a name="08070259000165">As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said in the House on 18 June, it is essential that Israel</p>

On 2 May, London hosted the ad hoc liaison committee and a meeting of the Quartet. Those were the first meetings on the middle east peace process in 2008. Since then, the Foreign Secretary visited Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian territories on 8-9 June, which was his second visit this year. More recently, I met Palestinian Prime Minister, Salam Fayyad, and the Foreign Minister on 23 June on the margins of an important peace conference in Berlin on Palestinian security.</p>

I tried to convey to Minister Herzog the Government&#146;s great concern at news of the planned construction of yet more illegal dwellings on Palestinian occupied territory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para10"><a name="08070259000168">I want to make it clear to the right hon. Lady that we do not believe that a series of bantustans or a fragmented parody of a state will do. Palestine must come out of the process as a sovereign state in every sense with control of its external borders. If that does not happen, the conflict will continue, as the right hon. Lady said, because the aspirations that have so often been voiced will not have been met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para11"><a name="08070259000169">In the couple of minutes remaining, I want to say that we have been working hard to try to help the Palestinians to increase their ability to guarantee security within the west bank. That is more difficult in Gaza. As the right hon. Lady said, the situation there is terrible, and we have pressed the Israelis, now that a peace process has been brokered by the Egyptians between the Israelis and Hamas, to ensure that where crossings in Gaza are open, albeit partially, many more goods are allowed to cross in and out. We shall keep pressing for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para12"><a name="08070259000170">I do not know what effect today&#146;s tragedy in Jerusalem will have, but usually such crossings are closed for a while. There is undoubtedly great suffering there. We have seen from a number of Palestinian factions, not just the Palestinian Authority, an  attempt to abide by the agreement that they made for the calm, or the peace process, to try to stop rockets being fired into Israel with the inevitable retaliatory consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para13"><a name="08070259000171">I have run out of time, but I want to tell the right hon. Lady that we are extremely concerned about the matter. We will continue to press the Israeli Government on it because it is important. We will also continue to work through the EU and every other channel to try to ensure that the terms of the Annapolis talks are abided by and that the road map is adhered to.</p>

 It is a pleasure to see you chairing our proceedings this afternoon, Mr. Bercow&#151;I am most grateful to you for enabling me to debate this important issue. I am also grateful to the Minister for being here to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para15"><a name="08070259000174">As hon. Members will be aware, NATS, which provides air traffic control services in the United Kingdom, has recently conducted a consultation on its proposed redesign of terminal control north airspace. The sheer demand for air travel has brought about the need for fresh consideration of flight path access to our airports and I therefore fully realise that there is a challenge that needs to be addressed. The consultation ended on 19 June and a feedback report will be published on NATS website towards the end of this month. The report will then be forwarded to the Civil Aviation Authority for approval by the end of the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para16"><a name="08070259000175">The proposed plans concern a large part of southern and eastern England, which incorporates my constituency. I would like to make it clear that I am fully aware of the benefits that air travel brings. There can be no denying that it is essential to the success of the UK economy and that it is an important part of modern life. Aviation provides some 200,000 direct jobs and a further 600,000 jobs are indirectly supported. The industry directly contributes more than &#163;11.4 billion to UK gross domestic product and visitors who arrive by air contribute a further &#163;12 billion a year to the UK tourism industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para17"><a name="08070259000176">In 1970, 32 million passengers passed through UK airports and last year the figure was 241 million, which is a 653 per cent. increase. A similar pattern emerges if we consider each individual London airport. In the past 10 years, the number of passengers who have passed through Heathrow has increased by 22 per cent.&#151;from 56 million passengers in 1997 to 68 million in 2007. There has been a 31 per cent. increase in passengers at Gatwick&#151;from 27 million in 2002 to 35 million in 2007. The number of passengers passing through Stansted airport has increased by 344 per cent.&#151;up from 5.4 million in 1997 to 24 million in 2007&#151;and Luton has also had a substantial increase in the number of passengers going through its terminals. In 1997, 3.2 million passengers passed through Luton compared with 10 million in 2007, which is a 212 per cent. increase. Finally, in the past five years, the number of passengers who have passed through London City airport has increased by 82 per cent.&#151;from 1.6 million in 2002 to 3 million  in 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para18"><a name="08070259000177">According to the latest published forecast, the number of passengers passing through UK airports by 2030 will be between 450 million and 530 million, which is twice the number it is today. More than half of the total UK demand that is forecast for 2030 is for airports in the south-east of England. Stansted will have between 51 million to 60 million passengers passing through its terminals, which is a 150 per cent. increase. In the past 10 years, air transport movements have increased at London airports by 35 per cent.&#151;from 739,000 movements in 1996 to 994,000 in 2006. At Stansted, there has been an increase of 153 per cent. in air transport movements in the past 10 years&#151;from 75,000 in 1996 to 190,000 in 2006. BAA wants to increase flights on the existing runway to 260,000 and then open a second runway to accommodate 500,000 flights a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para19"><a name="08070259000178">Although it is important for London to continue to be a hub for air passengers, it is also important to ensure that a balance is achieved. The biggest change proposed for the Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and north-east Essex area is to increase the number of holds for Stansted and Luton arrivals from two to three. The two Stansted holds would be south of Newmarket between Hadleigh and Stowmarket. One of the main factors that NATS considered when designing the proposed changes was to try to avoid populated areas at lower heights. However, in doing that, the proposed changes would have an unfair and disproportionate impact on rural areas. The Campaign to Protect Rural England is concerned that the plans will mean that planes are rerouted over areas of natural beauty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para20"><a name="08070259000179">Under the proposals, aircraft will descend in spirals to 7,000 ft before breaking out of the holding pattern to make their approach to Stansted. Areas to the south of Newmarket and Bury St. Edmunds, including some areas close to Newmarket that are presently not normally over-flown at all, would be over-flown by as little as 4,000 ft. That would lead to noise levels of between 58 to 73 dB, which is against the Suffolk local transport plan objective to improve the ambient noise climate within the county.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend aware of the strong opposition to the NATS proposals expressed by the Chilterns conservation board&#151;the statutory body for the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty? Under the proposed regime, many of my constituents who live on hill-top villages fear that they will be a great deal closer to more frequent and lower flights than is currently the case.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out because the Chilterns are, of course, an area of outstanding natural beauty in this country and people choose to live there because of the tranquillity. That is likely to be destroyed under the proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para21"><a name="08070259000182">Picking up on the point made by my hon. Friend, NATS has simply shifted aircraft noise to those rural areas that currently experience very little background noise. Many of my constituents have complained to me that the Civil Aviation Authority seems to have chosen to ignore the guidelines set out by the Department for Transport in the terminal control north consultation. In its guidance to the CAA on environmental issues relating to airspace, the Department for Transport requires the Directorate of Airspace Policy to</p>
<a name="80702h0005.htm_brev1"><a name="08070259000421"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Pursue policies that will help to preserve the tranquillity where this does not increase significantly the environmental burdens on congested areas.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para22"><a name="08070259000183">I would be grateful to know whether the Minister has the same view on that as my constituents. West Suffolk already suffers from virtually continuous aircraft noise from the US air force bases located in Mildenhall and Lakenheath, just north of Newmarket in my constituency. The proposed changes will further put at risk the tranquillity of that area. I have had an avalanche of letters from concerned constituents who live in the villages around Newmarket, particularly to the south of the town.</p>

<a name="80702h0005.htm_brev2"><a name="08070259000185"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;this is of particular concern as Hargrave will experience a much lower minimum height of 4,000 feet than the other holds.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="st_35"><a name="08070259000187"><a name="80702h0005.htm_spnew4"><a name="08070259000491"><b>Mr. Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon) (Con):</b>
 My hon. Friend mentioned aeroplanes leaving the stack, which would probably be at about 6,000 or 7,000 ft. That applies to Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire, and is the issue about which we are concerned. People are saying that the NATS consultation is confusing in relation to the stack and the area around the stack, as some diagrams show that planes can also fly at 6,000 or 7,000 ft&#151;if it relates to the stack itself, the number of planes would be restricted to eight, but if it relates to a much wider area, there could be dozens of planes. That confusion is upsetting people who live in rural areas.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for intervening and I totally accept his point. The whole consultation process has been extremely confusing and non-specific, and I shall now talk about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para25"><a name="08070259000189">Mr. and Mrs. Ambridge would like to know why the consultation document does not provide a meaningful explanation for why the stack and dog-leg are located so far away from the airport and why the dog-leg that is connected over Hargrave is necessary at all. Another of my constituents, Mr. Rous of Newmarket, is worried about the visual impact of aircraft flying at heights as low as 4,000 ft in the area. He has forcefully argued that at peak times, aircraft movements will be as many as 33 an hour, or one every two minutes. Mr. and Mrs. Fish of Higham made a very serious point in their submission to NATS when they asked why the consultation document does not explain why the lowest height limit being set over the whole area is 4,000 ft when the other proposed holds have a lowest height limit of 6,000 ft. I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister can answer those queries from my very anxious constituents.</p>

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="08070259000190"><a name="80702h0005.htm_spnew6"><a name="08070259000493"><b>Mr. Tobias Ellwood (Bournemouth, East) (Con):</b>
 My hon. Friend is making a powerful argument. Does he agree that although there is a move to shift aircraft to stack over the countryside, people tend to notice aircraft noise more when they are in the country than when they are in cities and urban areas? I am aware of that as someone who lives not only in London, which is obviously very busy, but in the country. Has my hon. Friend probed the Minister on what other alternatives have been put on the table, or is the current proposal the only solution that the Government have offered?</p>

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="08070259000191"><a name="80702h0005.htm_spnew7"><a name="08070259000494"><b>Mr. Spring:</b>
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that any noise in an area that is essentially quiet is much more noticeable. I will certainly come to the issue of the alternatives in my remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para26"><a name="08070259000192">There is a desperately serious potential threat to a hugely important commercial activity in the area that I am discussing.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para27"><a name="08070259000193">Let me illustrate what I mean. The racing industry is a substantial contributor to the British economy. It generates expenditure of &#163;2.9 billion a year and raises &#163;282 million in tax revenues for the Government. The thoroughbred horse racing industry produces sales of more than &#163;150 million annually in the United Kingdom and has export revenues of &#163;160 million. There are about 9,500 active racehorse owners, and overall some 50,000 people are involved in racehorse ownership through various types of co-ownership. It is, then, no surprise that racing is second only to football, measured by revenue and spectator numbers, with total race course attendance in 2006 being just under 6 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para28"><a name="08070259000194">Newmarket, in my constituency, is at the heart of all this. Originally, Newmarket found fame as the world headquarters of racing during the reign of Charles II, so racing has been central to the life of the town and the surrounding area, and indeed the whole country, for more than 300 years. As well as being one of the most tranquil areas in the east of England, Newmarket contains the largest concentration of stud farms, racehorses, trainers, stable staff and racing organisations in Europe, shared between my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para29"><a name="08070259000195">Situated in Newmarket are two of Britain&#146;s leading race courses, more than 2,900 racehorses in training, 89 licensed trainers, 62 stud farms, 2,800 acres of training grounds, the original home of the Jockey Club, the National Horseracing museum, the British Racing School, the National Stud, the Animal Health Trust, the Horseracing Forensic Laboratory, the Thoroughbred Breeders Association, the International Racing Bureau, Racing Welfare, the Federation of Bloodstock Agents, the UK&#146;s top support services and Tattersalls&#151;the oldest and most successful bloodstock auctioneers in the world. Today, there are 40 race meetings a year&#151;in the summer on the July course and in the spring and autumn on the Rowley Mile. That unique part of Britain provides breeding and training facilities for up to 3,000 horses, accounting for one fifth of all racehorses in training in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="80702h0005.htm_para30"><a name="08070259000196">The racing industry also significantly contributes to the local economy. It is estimated that 33 per cent. of jobs in Newmarket are directly related to horse racing, with the breeding industry paying &#163;15 million to its employees. Newmarket&#146;s stud farms and racehorse trainers directly spend more than &#163;150 million a year in the area on wages, goods and services. They indirectly spend more than &#163;100 million locally, with turnover of horse racing sales, training and stud farm businesses greater than &#163;500 million. A survey of Newmarket Stud Farmers Association members showed that an estimated 85 per cent. of their expenditure goes to businesses and individuals within a 20-mile radius of Newmarket.</p>

That is no coincidence. A further  <br>

survey conducted by the Newmarket Stud Farmers Association, completed by 30 of the leading studs, showed that Newmarket&#146;s peaceful business environment was considered one of the greatest attractions of Newmarket after the availability of equine services and land with ideal soil and topography. It is clear, then, that because of the tranquillity of the area, it is a very attractive location for the industry&#146;s activities and a significant reason why investment continues to flow into the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para1"><a name="08070259000198">We nearly lost the racing industry with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1993, because our VAT rate of 17.5 per cent. was hugely higher than the special low rate negotiated by the French and Irish. That was a potential catastrophe for my constituency&#151;I was a new Member of Parliament at the time. Mercifully, we found a way round it, something that racing has not forgotten. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for his role in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para2"><a name="08070259000199">Sadly, the breeding industry is once again on a knife-edge. Many fear that the horses will react negatively to the increased noise. Let me spell this out in crystal clear terms. Thoroughbred racehorses are hugely expensive to breed and rear, and very sensitive to the prevailing atmosphere. That particularly applies to young foals. Every racehorse trainer will say that a peaceful and calm atmosphere is the fundamental prerequisite for successful breeding and training, so the threat is both to human beings and their tranquillity and to livestock.</p>

Deer, like racehorses, are highly sensitive to aircraft noise, and Mr. Michael Gliksten, owner of the estate, predicts that, as a result of the noise, the deer</p>
<a name="80702h0006.htm_brev0"><a name="08070259000423"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;are likely to spook, resulting in extreme stress and possible abortions.&#148;</p>

Elaine Taylor of Newmarket makes a valid point in her submission to the consultation process, in that there is no clear indication of the number of flights that will use the hold, how often it will be necessary for planes to fly at 4,000 ft, and what the intention is after 2014.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000203">Altogether, 33 per cent. of the population in the south Newmarket area will see a difference as a result of the proposed changes. More than 7,000 thoroughbreds are cared for by 2,000 people on stud farms underneath the proposed stack. It is estimated that 90 per cent. of the stud farm area around Newmarket will be affected by the planned changes. According to a survey of Newmarket Stud Farmers Association members, 77 per cent. of studs expect some change to their businesses as a result of the NATS recommendations.</p>

As he rightly points out, considerable foreign investment in horse racing in the region is threatened by the proposals. As well as  <br>

discouraging potential new investors from investing in the area, there is the real possibility that one or more of the big global players will withdraw their investment. Five of the largest studs account for 83 per cent. of the stallions. The racing industry depends on the tens of millions of pounds that the big racing owners invest in Newmarket each year. Stallions can be worth many millions of pounds each, with additional income coming from stud fees. The temptation for them to redirect their investments and move to France, Ireland, America, Australia or the middle east may prove irresistible. Most worrying is the fact that 63 per cent. of the studs surveyed believe that the NATS proposal will influence their future investment decisions. Make no mistake, the French and Irish continue to bid hard for breeding activity to be located in their countries. Any decision to withdraw investment would be disastrous for the British breeding industry as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para8"><a name="08070259000205">The racing industry is inextricably interlinked. The breeders, trainers, auctioneers and the ancillary activities all work together in Newmarket. The departure of one element would have an impact on everything else. When I met NATS, it was clear that no consideration had been given to the problem. Racing in Newmarket is a brilliant success story, giving much pleasure to many. It is tragic that the future of such an important employer and exporter, a great British success story, should be put at risk. It is essential that NATS comes up with an alternative solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para9"><a name="08070259000206">NATS must reconsider the location criteria so that areas of tranquillity are preserved. No alternative location for the holds have been proposed. NATS should consider stacking over the North sea, raising the lowest level of the stacks to a higher altitude or introducing direct flight paths. Frankly, there was no field-based evidence for those areas of potential impact. The criteria appear to have been based on desk-bound analyses alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para10"><a name="08070259000207">Many of my constituents cannot understand why the option of stacking over the sea was not seriously considered. A campaign for that has been commendably led by the save our silence action group. A large proportion of the routes into Stansted come from continental Europe, which presents an opportunity for adjustments to take place over the sea. As Mr. and Mrs. Warner of Newmarket said, the coast is less than 50 miles away. The Newmarket Horse Racing and Breeders Group, under the chairmanship of Alastair Watson, has also recommended a number of viable alternatives, which were submitted as part of the consultation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para11"><a name="08070259000208">I have received many letters from constituents who believe that genuine public consultation has not taken place. Many have told me that even though they live directly under the flight paths they did not receive notification that consultation was under way. Many parish councils tell me they were not fully informed; they did not receive adequate information. Although I have held meetings with representatives of NATS, parish councils were apparently denied the opportunity to meet NATS officials. I believe that that was the pattern everywhere.</p>

 I shall be brief, as I know that other hon. Members have a clear constituency interest. I shall concentrate on the consultation with regard to the Heathrow flight paths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para14"><a name="08070259000212">The NATS proposals for Heathrow narrow the flight paths. As a result, it calculates that 39,000 fewer people will be affected by noise. There will be an overall fall in numbers. The estimate from NATS is that the number of people in the 50 dB area around Heathrow would fall&#151;these are precise figures&#151;from 442,651 to 249,057. That is to be welcomed, but the problem is that there will be a more intensive use of those flight paths, and as a result those under the narrower flight paths will suffer more. The more intensive use of the air space will result in more noise. That will cause problems for a number of constituencies in London, including mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para15"><a name="08070259000213">However, there is a fear that that coincides with Government thinking on the development of Heathrow. In advance of any development of a third runway or a sixth terminal, the question of runway alternation is being examined. If the idea of runway alternation is to be abandoned as an incremental development, in advance of a major decision on a third runway or sixth terminal, I would welcome a full and extensive consultation on the implications by NATS, to be instituted by the Government. The Cranford agreement on runway alternation at Heathrow provides respite for the constituents of many west London MPs. The shifting use of the two existing runways at least enables some of our constituents to have a break from the noise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para16"><a name="08070259000214">Hon. Members may think that they have problems now, as a result of the present consultation, but if the third runway and sixth terminal go ahead those problems will pale into insignificance because of the scale of projected growth. Growth at Heathrow is predicted to rise from the present capped level of 480,000 aircraft movements to more than 700,000, and some predict that it may rise to more than 800,000. With expanded flight paths, and with the runways being used more intensively, predictions are that the number of people suffering noise would increase by at least 150,000. As a result, those people and others would be subjected to an aircraft passing overhead every 90 seconds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para17"><a name="08070259000215">My concerns are about noise and air pollution, but after our recent experience at Heathrow I am concerned also about safety. It was a near miracle, when the last aircraft came down early at Heathrow, that it did not cause a major accident and that there was no injury or loss of life. Increasing the intensity of flight paths and narrowing them will bring us to the edge of asking questions about safety itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para18"><a name="08070259000216">My main concern is about the development of Heathrow, the third runway and the sixth terminal. From what we know of the Government&#146;s consideration so far, that  <br>

development will not go ahead if it does not meet the strict environmental limits set by the Government and the European Union. However, we now know more about the impact of air pollution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para19"><a name="08070259000217">On the potential expansion of Heathrow, will the Minister confirm that the Government are preparing to seek derogation from the European Union limits on air pollution, which will enable them to expand Heathrow without conflicting with those limits? Because it comes into the calculation on flight paths and the scale of development, I also ask whether any assessment has been made of the cost of the damage to local communities, the cost of compensation resulting from the impact of noise, and the relocation of homes, schools and communities that might be affected by the expansion? What consultations have taken place or are planned on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para20"><a name="08070259000218">I have sympathy with hon. Members who have raised points about stud farms, but in my area we do not breed horses. We occasionally back them, but we do not breed them. There is a clear need for much more detailed analysis and research into the health consequences of the intense movement of aircraft above people&#146;s heads and the resulting noise and air pollution. I ask the Minister whether further studies have been commissioned on the health impact of such an extensive development, in connection with expansion at Heathrow and existing operations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para21"><a name="08070259000219">I caution hon. Members about the process. If we take Heathrow expansion as an example, the concern that we have expressed over the years about consultation is that, even if we feel that we are getting verification of the figures about the intensity of use of the flight paths, and even if we feel that we are getting substantive information, we have always found that calculations about expansion have been severely underestimated. The consequences of expansion and the more intensive use of flight paths have never really been taken into account when considering the impact upon our local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para25"><a name="08070259000225">My involvement in the matter dates back to the publication of the NATS consultation.

preferential routes in the proposals would go through my constituency and between the towns of Tring and Berkhamsted, covering villages such as Northchurch, Aldbury and Wigginton. The article noted that the area of the country that would suffer most was the one that I have the privilege of representing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para26"><a name="08070259000226">I immediately looked through the proposals in the consultation document and wrote to NATS. To be fair, it responded very promptly, and I had a meeting with senior representatives in March. I told them&#151;they did not particularly doubt my analysis, which extrapolated from the figures in the consultation&#151;that the proposals would disadvantage many of my constituents in the towns and villages that I mentioned. I include Tring and Berkhamsted because although they are not overflown by the noise preferential routes, they will none the less suffer as a result of a number of the changes. The representatives of NATS accepted that there was an issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para27"><a name="08070259000227">I warned NATS that my constituents were an able and articulate lot and that they would address the proposals in a thoughtful and intelligent way, and I am pleased to say that my constituents have lived up to that prediction. In a relatively short period, the various groups have come together, and there is now an umbrella organisation called the Chiltern countryside group. I pay tribute to the work that it has done in producing a detailed analysis of the proposals&#151;we are not talking about a knee-jerk reaction, with people saying, &#147;This is bad news. We don&#146;t like it.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para28"><a name="08070259000228">The Chiltern countryside group contains people with the most extraordinary expertise, who come not only from my constituency, but from that of my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), and I dare say that one or two also live in the constituency of Buckingham, Mr. Bercow. They include former air traffic controllers, pilots and people with great expertise regarding the Chiltern conservation area. The group has analysed some of the proposals, and I will return to that in a moment. It has made some quite constructive suggestions, and I hope that its technical submission will be examined by NATS and, where appropriate, the Civil Aviation Authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para29"><a name="08070259000229">The consultation raises one or two issues, one of which is the timing. I am pleased that the end of the consultation period was extended from 22 May, as in the initial proposal, to 19 June. In my constituency&#151;I suspect that this is not untypical&#151;there has been a build-up of momentum as public interest has increased. There are certainly criticisms that NATS did not publicise the initial consultation as well as it might have. I have, as I have said, been involved in the issue from an early stage in my area, and have publicised it in the local newspaper. The <i>Hemel Hempstead Gazette</i> has done sterling work in publicising it, and public awareness has increased. There has been a range of meetings in Tring, Berkhamsted, Northchurch and Wigginton, some of which I have had the opportunity to attend. I wonder about the adequacy of the time frame, even if extended. There have been some excellent submissions from local groups, but I wonder whether more time would have allowed a stronger response to be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para30"><a name="08070259000230">I want to make a couple of technical points about the consultation document. First, the question of the depiction of heights was touched on by my hon. Friend the  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="2 July 2008">

<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>2 July 2008 : Column 272WH</b><br>
Member for West Suffolk. There is great uncertainty. Various height figures are given in the document, generally designating ranges such as 3,000 ft to 4,000 ft. However, it is not entirely clear what is being talked about. Paragraphs 11.6 to 11.9 state that the heights of routes are</p>
<a name="80702h0006.htm_brev2"><a name="08070259000425"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;measured in different ways depending on where they are&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para31"><a name="08070259000231">They go on to state that the measurement is taken</p>
<a name="80702h0006.htm_brev3"><a name="08070259000426"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;from ground level at an airport, while further away from airports the measure is taken from sea level&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para32"><a name="08070259000232">That is somewhat ambiguous, and it is a significant point, because by and large the flights that are of concern to my constituents are those that depart from Luton. Luton is 525 ft above sea level, but the villages that I represent tend to be higher. Wigginton, for example, is 690 ft above sea level. In the case of Wigginton, are the relevant heights measured from sea level, in which case the actual minimum height will be 2,310 ft, or should we be considering the Luton figure, in which case it is 2,835 ft? At such levels, there is quite a big difference between the two&#151;a difference of 500-plus ft or so. One way or another it is quite significant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para33"><a name="08070259000233">Another criticism of the NATS proposals is that it is not obvious that it has taken into account ground levels when assessing particular routes. That point was touched on in the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury. He also represents several villages that are very high up. Clearly flights overhead will create more noise for those villages than they will for villages at the bottom of a valley. That is a significant practical point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="80702h0006.htm_para34"><a name="08070259000234">My other criticism about the consultation document is about the issue of decibel levels. Several projections are included, but they appear to be very wide. It is helpful that the consultation document gives some examples of the noise level to which various decibel levels relate. I do not know about other hon. Members, but I do not really know what 60 dB means. One example in the document is that 85 dB is the equivalent of the sound made by a heavy diesel lorry at 25 mph, 23 ft away. That is precise and helpful. Another example is that a busy general office makes noise at a level of 60 dB. There is clearly a wide gap between those two noise levels. However, the noise range for flights by the noisiest aircraft at a height of 3,000 ft to 4,000 ft is 65 dB to 83 dB. There is clearly a big difference between the noise from a busy general office and that from a heavy diesel lorry 23 ft away travelling at 25 mph. Yet the ranges given, from which people are to assess what the noise levels from the flight paths will be, are not far short of a comparison between those two noise levels. That makes it difficult to assess what the impact will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para0"><a name="08070259000235">As my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk said, there is much to be gained from flights. It is a fact of life and much of the concern about flights arises simply because there is an increase in their number. That point was made by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell). However, that is not the issue that is to be decided in the consultation, or the specific issue faced by my constituents in the areas I have mentioned. The concern is that, although there will be more flights, whether or not the flight paths change, aircraft will, under the proposals, be flying lower over my constituency. The reason is that as a rule the change in routes has meant flights moving further south than previously. As  <br>

a consequence they are caught up in Heathrow traffic and are kept lower to allow flights from Heathrow to fly above them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para1"><a name="08070259000236">I have two suggestions to make about that. First, greater consideration could be given to the idea of simply moving flights further north. Work on that issue has been undertaken by the Chiltern countryside group. The point of the suggestion is not simply to move the problem into someone else&#146;s back yard&#151;I say that with some nervousness, knowing who represents the constituency to the north-west of mine; once flights are moved a little further north they can climb more quickly. That is beneficial not just for noise pollution but environmentally. Once a flight has moved quickly up, it is more efficient. I am not aware of any disagreement on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para2"><a name="08070259000237">The second possible solution to the problem involves the question of moving what is described as the Bovingdon stack. Bovingdon is a village in my constituency where arrivals for Heathrow are stacked. I have spoken to residents and the concern in Bovingdon is not particularly noise from the stack, which flies several thousand feet above; the impact is that flights departing from Luton are kept lower than they would otherwise be. I know that the question of moving the Bovingdon stack is being considered, and, indeed, if the third runway at Heathrow were ever to be implemented, it would have to happen. That is not an argument one way or the other, but given that the work has been done it is a pity that NATS has not included in its process the possibility of moving the Bovingdon stack. If it did, that might solve some of our problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para3"><a name="08070259000238">That leads me to my final criticism of the consultation document, which is that it does not offer alternatives. It is very much a question of &#147;Take it or leave it; here are our proposals&#148;. Those are either to stay as we are, which is not ideal for the purpose of dealing with flights over populated areas&#151;a move is clearly in the best interest of such places as St. Albans, Hatfield and parts of Hemel Hempstead&#151;or to go with the proposals. The detailed work done by NATS suggests that there are alternatives that would benefit those areas over which there are currently many flights, which would not result in more low-flying planes over the likes of Tring, Berkhamsted, Wigginton, Aldbury and Northchurch. It is therefore possible that we can do better. I hope and urge that NATS will be prepared to look again for improvements&#151;and if the Minister can influence it in any way I ask him to take whatever action is necessary. There may be detailed technical points that it would not be appropriate to make today, and which it would be difficult to deal with without benefit of a map. However, changes could be made that would address my constituents&#146; concerns and, I hope, reduce flight paths over other constituencies.</p>

As the shadow Minister for tourism and for gambling, I take a particular interest in our flight paths, not only because of who is inside them and how people can get from the plane through the airport to their destination efficiently, but because we have one of the best horse racing industries in the world. We can say proudly that we hold eight of the top 12 international races. As my hon. Friend mentioned, those will be threatened if we are not careful about protecting the industry. It is the sport of kings; I hope that it does not become a sport of the Government to ignore that important industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para5"><a name="08070259000241">The industry is important not just in the Newmarket area, but across the country, as my hon. Friend explained with some clarity. There are now some 60 horse racing tracks in the country. It is a thriving sport, but it is under threat. He mentioned football. From a betting perspective, racing is growing in popularity, as are international events abroad. If we do not harness, look after and nurture the racing industry, it will disappear. What has been identified today is Departments&#146; lack of thinking about the knock-on consequences of avoiding considering the bigger picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000242">We have had issues with the Tote, the levy and on-course bookies. The Government could be accused of not taking horse racing particularly seriously. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to rectify that, and say that he is interested in learning more about the impact on the racing industry of flights over the Newmarket area and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para7"><a name="08070259000243">I should put it on record that I am a pilot. I am not a commercial airline pilot&#151;I would have to declare that in the Register of Members&#146; Interests&#151;but a private pilot. I am aware of the issues of stacking, the length of flight paths and how long it takes to go on to finals to land at a runway. Like many other pilots around the world, I am flabbergasted that the UK decided to base our main international airport downwind of our capital city. That is madness, because it means that almost every single flight must go across the capital, upsetting the city every time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para8"><a name="08070259000244">The frequency with which flights now land at international airports, particularly Heathrow, has increased. Landings now take place every 60 seconds. We saw the chaos caused when a little fog crept into the UK only a year or so ago. There is no more capacity at Heathrow. Perhaps there is a bigger debate to be had about why we are investing so much money in particular airports and not looking at the bigger picture. The future is to spread out passenger and cargo airlift requirements more evenly around the country. It is not Conservative policy, but I would like to see an airport along the Thames estuary, where aircraft can land at will, upsetting no one but a few fish and birds. However, as I said, that might be for a different debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para9"><a name="08070259000245">My hon. Friend focused on the impact on horse racing and raised some important questions about the consultation. I reiterate: what other options were placed on the table? What other considerations were put forward? We might be able to say, &#147;Maybe Newmarket isn&#146;t the answer. Maybe we could consider something else as  <br>

well.&#148; From my experience of the airlines, there is nothing wrong with having a stacking system over the sea. It could easily be done. Planes would simply have a long ride-in time on finals. It would not be a problem, but we do not even know whether that was considered, because the consultation does not allow it. I hope that the Minister will heed our requests to see the full set of evidence, so that we can make that judgment ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para10"><a name="08070259000246">The future was mentioned. If things are busy now, where will they be in five to 10 years&#146; time? We must consider that in advance, not just for the sake of the horse industry but for Britain as a whole. I have huge concerns about the lack of long-term planning. The plans are based around airports, without any thought for what other advanced countries, such as the United States, have done in building new airports. JFK in New York, for example, is that city&#146;s main international airport, but additional airports have been built to take extra capacity, so that everything does not happen at one airport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para11"><a name="08070259000247">That also has security implications. If something happens at Heathrow&#151;whether it be natural, like the fog, or a security alert&#151;London comes almost to a standstill, because there is no capacity to shift flights elsewhere. The matter is critical for our tourism industry. According to surveys of the business and international community, the biggest concern is what is now called the Heathrow experience. It is so frustrating to come through Heathrow that people deliberately avoid it to come through other airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para12"><a name="08070259000248">I plead with the Minister to consider what is happening, to be honest about aspects of the consultation and to be aware of the importance of the racing industry to the UK. In my intervention, I stressed that it is much easier to be aware of noise in the countryside than in urban areas. That factor must have been considered in the consultation, but as I said, we are not fully aware of what evidence was presented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para13"><a name="08070259000249">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. I hope that things do not end here. I hope that the Government will begin to open their eyes to the bigger picture and take evidence from other parts of the industry, instead of simply arguing that tucking away stacking locations in rural rather than urban areas upsets fewer people.</p>

 I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) on securing this debate on such an important issue. Although I am not from London, I spent four years at university living under the flight path, including some time in the constituency of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell). I am well aware of the significant impact of flights on people living around London, and I believe that more can and should be done to reduce noise and air pollution from aircraft.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para14"><a name="08070259000251">On the recent consultation by NATS, I want to make one point clear. Moving the flight paths around London will not solve the problems caused by air traffic. Aircraft will not produce any less noise or pollution, and their impact on people and the environment will not change.  <br>

<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>2 July 2008 : Column 276WH</b><br>
It will simply move the problem from one area to another. According to the November 2007 Government study &#147;Attitudes to Noise from Aviation Sources in England&#148;, 2 million people live within the 50 dB area for Heathrow. According to the World Health Organisation, 50 dB is a noise level that causes annoyance. However much the Government want to distance themselves from the study&#146;s results, it shows that 2 million people live with annoyance-causing noise levels. An estimated 258,000 residents experience Heathrow noise levels of 57 dB or above, the level at which Government restrictions on noise begin and which constitutes serious annoyance according to the WHO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para15"><a name="08070259000252">However we look at it, noise is a significant and growing problem that the Government must take seriously. As the number of flights has grown in recent years, the problem has become more annoying, disturbing and intrusive. In Luton, for example, the number of noise complaints tripled between 2005 and 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para16"><a name="08070259000253">I am sure that all hon. Members are concerned about the effect of aircraft noise on our young people, and I am conscious that many schools under flight paths are greatly disrupted by the constant impact of aircraft noise. In 2005, a team from Barts and the London NHS trust found that each 5 dB increase was linked to children being up to two months behind in their reading age. Surely that alone should convince the Government that they cannot shut their eyes to the effects of noise pollution on the population, and that strong regulation is needed to ensure that schools are protected from excessive noise pollution. Will the Minister confirm what plans are under way to tackle that problem?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para17"><a name="08070259000254">I am very sceptical about claims that the plans will reduce the noise burden from aviation on the capital and its surrounding areas. The proposals state that moving the approach for London City airport will increase the number of people affected by noise by up to 11 per cent.; that changes at Stansted will affect 9 per cent.; and that many will suffer from more noise owing to the more intensive use of airspace&#151;a point made by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington. The dilemma is that although the proposed changes to airspace use will undoubtedly benefit some people, others, especially those living in quiet rural areas with very little background noise, will suddenly have aircraft flying above them. Owing to the relative tranquillity of those areas, the new disturbance will arguably be more noticeable&#151;a point made by other hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para18"><a name="08070259000255">The Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty, which has been mentioned already, is an area of particular concern. Should not the skies of that beautiful area be protected as well as the ground? We therefore support the campaign to require aircraft to fly at higher altitudes over the AONB to limit the impact of noise and air pollution, or to be rerouted altogether. We are also concerned that the redrafting of airspace above London might be designed simply to create more capacity in our skies to allow for expansion on the ground. Under the proposals, Stansted would have two stacks rather than one. Do the Government envisage that Stansted will need two stacks because its planes will not be able to fit into the one it has already? Is it a coincidence that the air capacity of Stansted is planned to be increased  just as BAA submits its planning application for an additional runway?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para19"><a name="08070259000256">Wherever planes go there will be disruption and increased noise. Unless we stem the growth in the number of flights being taken, we cannot make a significant dent in the noise and air pollution that areas will have to suffer because of aircraft noise. The inescapable fact is that tinkering with flight paths does not solve the problem. If there is further expansion in the south-east, the number of planes, and therefore noise, will continue to increase significantly. That is why the Liberal Democrats oppose expansion of airports in the south-east. Clearly the Government disagree and continue to pursue the &#147;predict and provide&#148; policy with airports that the UK used to have towards roads. The history of that disastrous roads policy should indicate to us that using the same principles for airports will have the same effects. Of course, if airport space is provided, it will be filled. By increasing capacity in the airports and the sky, the Government are encouraging the generation of more flights, and the emissions that they cause&#151;at a time when the Government have pledged to reduce our carbon emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para20"><a name="08070259000257">We are against further airport expansion in the south-east, but I should make special mention of the Heathrow expansion. We have put it on record previously, but it does no harm to reiterate that the Liberal Democrats are unequivocally opposed to the third runway, to the sixth terminal and to the end of runway alternation. The Government&#146;s proposals to use mixed mode would create 60,000 extra flights passing over London each year, while a third runway would increase the number of flights by 50 per cent. to 720,000, both of which would be contrary to the Government&#146;s promise that flight movements would not increase above 480,000. The noise that extra flights at Heathrow would create would place an additional, and in some cases unbearable, burden on the residents under flight paths. The abolition of runway alternation and introduction of mixed mode alone will take away the respite from passing aircraft.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para21"><a name="08070259000258">We are all now aware of the reports that the consultation paper on the Heathrow expansion was reverse-engineered and that evidence was chosen and &#147;reforecast&#148; to obtain the results that the Government wanted&#151;that a third runway would not adversely affect the air or noise pollution. Even the Environment Agency does not believe that the Department for Transport&#146;s consultation document is robust enough to support the construction of another runway. If the figures have been fiddled on that paper, how are we to know that future consultation papers dealing with airport expansion will not be changed in the same way?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para22"><a name="08070259000259">The fifth terminal was given permission on the understanding that it would not lead to a third runway, but already&#151;only a few months after the terminal has opened&#151;proposals for another runway have been put forward. The Government are quick to talk about sustainability, but when it comes to standing up to BAA they seem to lack conviction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para23"><a name="08070259000260">Our position on the expansion of Stansted is the same: we cannot and should not sustain more planes in the south-east. Stansted handles about 190,000 flights a year, but BAA wants to increase that to 260,000 on the existing runway and then, by opening a second runway in 2015, raise the capacity to more than 500,000 flights a year. Again, the impact of those flights on the  community around Stansted should not be underestimated.   <br>

Thousands of people will have their quality of life damaged by increased numbers of overhead flights, and much more needs to be done to protect their interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para24"><a name="08070259000261">Although the rest of the Government&#146;s policy is designed to drive down carbon emissions by making a 60 or 80 per cent. cut by 2050, aviation is not included in that target. We firmly believe that it should be. Air transport already produces about 5.6 per cent. of emissions, and the proportion of carbon emissions from aviation has doubled since 1990 and is well on its way to producing a quarter of UK emissions by 2038. If urgent action is not taken now, air traffic will prevent the UK from reducing its carbon emissions to tackle the urgent problem of climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="80702h0007.htm_para25"><a name="08070259000262">As I stated at the beginning of my contribution, only by taking a stand against unlimited expansion can we tackle the problem of air traffic over London and its surrounding countryside. The NATS proposals do not do enough to protect residents around London. While recognising that there will always be some disruption caused by air traffic, the Government have a duty to ensure that communities get a fair deal that minimises the impact of aircraft noise and ensures that noise and pollution do not continue to make their lives unbearable.</p>

Work started in 2004 when it was assessed that current capacity was unlikely to be able to accommodate the future growth of air traffic within the region. NATS itself says:</p>
<a name="80702h0007.htm_brev0"><a name="08070259000267"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The region is one of the most complex areas of airspace in the world, with routes in and out of major airports including Heathrow, Stansted, Luton and London City as well as smaller airports such as Southend and RAF Northolt&#148;.</p>

Friend the Member for West Suffolk gave a detailed account of the statistics for aviation growth in the south-east as a whole and, in particular, from Stansted and Luton. I shall not repeat all his statistics, but like him I admire the aviation industry. Aviation contributes more than 2 per cent. of our gross domestic product and employs 200,000 people directly and a further 600,000 indirectly. It remains one of the few areas of engineering in which UK plc still has a world-leading presence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para0"><a name="08070259000269">Air travel is an integral part of the lives of the vast majority of people in the UK, like downloadable music and community-based websites such as Facebook. The availability of cheap air travel has brought the world to our doorstep and allowed our citizens to enjoy a degree of travel inconceivable a couple of generations ago. However, the current rate of aviation growth cannot continue. The gap between the 5 to 6 per cent. that people were predicting, pre-recession, and the 1.5 to 2 per cent. that we could achieve in annual carbon dioxide emission savings has to be closed somehow. The Government&#146;s predict and provide approach to airports, which the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech) mentioned, is part of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para1"><a name="08070259000270">We all know that NATS has a huge responsibility. The great growth in aviation in the south-east means that our skies are becoming more crowded, so everyone accepts the need for a re-examination of the issue. However, I wonder whether NATS was the right body to undertake a consultation of that size and complexity. It has carried out a number of consultations before, but never on that scale. Putting to one side the grossly confusing name, terminal control north, which means very little to most people, the relevant area affects a population of up to 12 million people&#151;more than with the Heathrow consultation, in which NATS had only a subsidiary role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para2"><a name="08070259000271">As my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk has explained in some detail, the proposals in the consultation would create areas in which there will be multiple stacks over land&#151;in some cases, as low as 4,000 ft&#151;with aircraft to Luton crossing over aircraft for Stansted. In some cases, crosses will occur as frequently as once a minute. An immediate contrast with the Heathrow consultation is that, for all its unsatisfactory nature, the Heathrow consultation at least involved alternative proposals. As all my hon. Friends have said, it is extraordinary that this document contained no alternative proposals. We know that NATS considered alternative proposals, but none of them has been published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para3"><a name="08070259000272">I was grateful for the opportunity to meet representatives from NATS, and I asked them about the alternative of stacking over the sea. They said that it would have implications for efficiency and military flying, which was mentioned earlier, and that it would involve pushing large numbers of aircraft out to the limits of airspace. I am not sufficiently well qualified to comment on that, but if NATS had at least published, as an alternative, the option of stacking over the sea, people who have specialist advisers would have had the opportunity to evaluate the pluses and minuses. What about other options over land? NATS has not consulted the general public; it consulted only so-called key stakeholders such as MPs, local councils, airport consultative committees, environmental groups, business organisations and airlines, of course. The process then relied on an indirect dissemination of information to local people, if at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para4"><a name="08070259000273">My hon. Friend mentioned that large numbers of people who will be affected have heard nothing about the matter. I am told that NATS has been reluctant to provide paper copies of the consultation document, and that people could get hold of it only online&#151;although that version worked only for those with broadband&#151;or by visiting their local library. People have had problems  <br>

with trying to reply to the NATS website consultation and with the postcode finder. There were also errors in the consultation. For example, figure G50 has been labelled as referring to Luton, but it actually refers to Stansted. There have also been technical problems with online responses. For example, the &#147;Stop Stansted&#148; campaign tells me that respondents were not allowed to be neutral on the question asking whether arrivals should fly by &#147;direct flight path&#148; or by &#147;specified routes&#148;. People might have strong views on some aspects of the consultation but have no view on that, but if one did not express a view on that point, the system crashed and one was taken back to the start of what was a very complicated process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para5"><a name="08070259000274">I am not being frivolous when I mention the complications that have occurred when people have tried to respond to that process, because they come on top of the fact that this area is technically complex and difficult to understand. One gentleman who was kind enough to brief me showed me why some of the diagrams were quite difficult even for him&#151;a retired airline pilot&#151;to interpret. They had confusing colours that printed out differently from how they appeared on the screen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000275">Will the Minister tell us how many paper copies of the Heathrow consultation have been handed out and how many public meetings have been held? How many of the 12 million people who might be affected by the plans have been able to respond?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para7"><a name="08070259000276">Flying is vital to our country, but there are two great environmental problems linked to it: climate change and noise. Of course, with noise, there are also issues to do with NOx&#151;oxides of nitrogen. Many people who live close to airports and along flight paths, or who are potentially affected by the changes, feel that decisions are consulted on after they have been taken. They feel that they have absolutely no real say over something that has the potential to blight, or that already blights, their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para8"><a name="08070259000277">The Government have sought to stifle intelligent debate on serious aviation issues such as flight-path reorganisation or the expansion of Heathrow, Stansted and regional airports. The NATS consultation, like the Heathrow one before it, has done nothing to reverse that sense of &#147;them versus us&#148;&#151;the aviation industry and the Government versus the citizen. What we need is proper co-operation. In this case, the production of a reasonably understandable document that contained clear alternatives, showing the pluses and minuses, and that was much more widely available, could have taken us some way towards that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para9"><a name="08070259000278">I have said repeatedly that the Conservative party would like a commercial flights officer position to be created. The post-holder would act as an ombudsman for formal complaints about noise, whom people could approach via their MPs. The ombudsman would have the power to compel NATS, airports and other bodies that are concerned with the movement of aircraft to co-operate in investigations. The ombudsman would have powers to name and shame, to monitor quality and to publish details of noise abatement and compensation schemes. That simple and extremely cheap measure would give people a voice&#151;it would not be used irresponsibly because MPs would have to be part of the process&#151;and a feeling that their views and concerns matter.</p>

Many people have complained that they did not hear about the proposal until it was too late. NATS claims that 20 per cent. fewer people will be affected by noise from departing aircraft flying below 4,000 ft, but the consultation document confirms that the number of people affected by noise levels of 57 dB, which the Government consider to be a level that causes significant disturbance, will more than double near to Luton, and will increase by 9 per cent. near to Stansted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para11"><a name="08070259000280">The Government have tied the hands of NATS, showing once again what a mess they have got themselves into over aviation and the environment by adopting a predict and provide approach to aviation expansion. The document states:</p>
<a name="80702h0008.htm_brev0"><a name="08070259000427"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Whilst NATS recognises that aircraft above 7000ft...may well still be audible, increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions has taken priority over the overflight of population centres&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para12"><a name="08070259000281">That basically means that we are going to sacrifice aircraft noise considerations for climate change considerations, instead of looking at the issue in the round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para13"><a name="08070259000282">The Government have again ignored their own ANASE&#151;&#147;Attitudes to Noise from Aviation Sources in England&#148;&#151;report, which was mentioned earlier. As several hon. Members have said, that report makes it absolutely clear that people in quiet areas are inherently much more aggravated by noise than those in noisy areas. We sometimes hear planes going over the House of Commons, but the disturbance is mitigated by the noise that is already here. In contrast, in an area with low ambient noise&#151;the Government&#146;s own study confirms this&#151;people are much more heavily affected by aeroplane noise. The consultation document is very blunt, and effectively bins the report. The Government guidance says:</p>
<a name="80702h0008.htm_brev1"><a name="08070259000428"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Government policy will continue to focus on minimising over-flight of more densely populated areas below 7,000ft&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para14"><a name="08070259000283">In other words, shift it to rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para15"><a name="08070259000284">Under the proposals, perhaps fewer people will be overflown, but the guidance forces a disproportionate blight on those living in rural areas. Peaceful areas such as the Chilterns have been mentioned by my hon. Friends. For the first time, the historic city of Cambridge will hear the roar of jet engines overhead. I was relieved to hear that Oxford, so far, remains untouched.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para16"><a name="08070259000285">The fate of Newmarket race course and the concentration of world-class stud farms around it have played a pivotal part in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk. As he rightly said, they account for a third of all jobs in Newmarket. However, the impact is not just on Newmarket. As the hub of Britain&#146;s highly successful racing and bloodstock industries, the proposals have the capability to strike at a highly successful local, regional and national industry.</p>

 Indeed, Mr. Bercow. Given that such an important issue is being so badly handled, is it any wonder that the aviation debate has polarised? We need a proper consultation with published alternatives, and one that does not devastate an industry.</p>

 It is pleasure to see you presiding today, Mr. Bercow, and thank you very much for the protection. However, I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), and I know that his usual protocol would be to give to the Front-Bench spokesman an equal share of time in which to respond to this very interesting and useful debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para17"><a name="08070259000289">I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) on securing the debate and thank him and other hon. Members for their contributions. I will make some opening remarks and then try to respond to some of the points that were made, because it is important to put the Department&#146;s position on the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para18"><a name="08070259000290">The Government&#146;s commitment to sustaining economic growth and protecting the environment is at the heart of the Department&#146;s aviation policy-making process. As the hon. Gentleman recognised, there is a balance to be struck between tackling environmental challenges, enabling people to fly, and allowing the industry to compete internationally. The role of any decision-maker in relation to airspace changes is to find the right balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para19"><a name="08070259000291">The terminal control north airspace change proposal is subject to consultation response analysis under the Civil Aviation Authority&#146;s independent airspace change process. As part of that regulatory process, the CAA might seek the Secretary of State&#146;s approval for the change. It would, therefore, be premature of me to offer comment on the specifics of the proposal while it is subject to the rigours of this independent regulatory process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para20"><a name="08070259000292">However, I will give some background to the proposals and the current consultation, and explain the process by which changes to UK airspace are made. As many hon. Members have said today, the airspace known as terminal control north is among the most complex in the world, with routes in and out of major airports, including Heathrow, Stansted, Luton and London City, as well as smaller airports such as Southend and RAF Northolt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para21"><a name="08070259000293">Increasing air traffic has led to congestion in the airways, resulting in delays and extra fuel burn. The proposed changes are designed to reduce delay, maintain safety and improve environmental performance. I must stress that the proposal is not associated with, and does not assume, future development at Heathrow, Stansted or any other airport. I know that Heathrow and Stansted have featured quite strongly in the comments from some hon. Members this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para22"><a name="08070259000294">It is business as usual for NATS which, under the terms of its operating licence, is obliged to make the most efficient use of overall airspace. The consultation by NATS&#151;it is not the Government&#146;s consultation, as the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) said&#151;on terminal control north is the largest of its kind to be undertaken. As the hon. Member for Canterbury said, the affected region has a population of 12.6 million. NATS directly consulted more than 3,000 primary  <br>

stakeholders, including MPs, county, borough, district and parish councils, environmental organisations, and chambers of commerce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para23"><a name="08070259000295">Before the launch of the consultation, NATS arranged briefings for local MPs and national and regional media. To make information accessible for the general public, NATS divided the consultation region into five areas. Consultation materials for each area were colour-coded to help people locate the information relevant to them. Materials included a consultation document, an information DVD, summary leaflets for each of the five areas and a dedicated website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para24"><a name="08070259000296">In response to concerns that there was not enough time to consider the details of the proposals, NATS extended by four weeks the consultation period, thus giving interested parties a full 17 weeks in which to consider the proposals and register their views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para25"><a name="08070259000297">NATS is now examining the consultation responses. I understand that some of the key areas of concern that have been highlighted are the proposed route changes west of Luton airport and over the Chilterns, the proposed new holds near Newmarket and Southminster, and changes to noise-preferential routes north of Stansted airport, all of which have been mentioned by hon. Members this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="08070259000298"><a name="80702h0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="08070259000506"><b>Mr. Ellwood:</b>

 If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I will continue with my responses to the points that have been raised. If I have time after that, I will be very happy to take interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para26"><a name="08070259000300">NATS is looking in detail at those and other concerns and investigating whether adjustments can be made to accommodate them. It might be helpful if I now explain the procedure for making changes to airspace in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para27"><a name="08070259000301">Airspace planning and regulation is the responsibility of the independent regulator, the CAA. The process for making changes to airspace is governed by the CAA&#146;s airspace change process. A change sponsor is responsible for developing and consulting on a proposal for an airspace change, ensuring that it satisfies and/or enhances safety standards, improves capacity and mitigates, as far as practicable, any environmental impacts in line with the Department&#146;s environmental guidance to the CAA, as mentioned by the hon. Member for West Suffolk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para28"><a name="08070259000302">Informed by the consultation, the airspace change sponsor must then submit its proposal to the CAA. It is the CAA that then assesses the formal proposal against regulatory requirements, including environmental objectives, and either approves or rejects the proposal. If the CAA considers that a proposal could have a detrimental effect on the environment, it is required to advise the Secretary of State for Transport. It must refrain from making the airspace change without first securing her approval. Therefore, airspace changes are made only when it is clear, after consultation, that an overall environmental benefit will accrue or where the airspace management considerations and the overriding need for safety allow for no practical alternative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para29"><a name="08070259000303">The hon. Gentleman raised the issues of aircraft noise, air quality and visual impact. Let me assure him that I recognise that, at a local level, those are issues of significant concern. That is why the CAA&#146;s guidance on the airspace change process includes substantive guidance on a range of environmental requirements, including noise, air quality, tranquillity and visual intrusion. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members will appreciate that the development of UK airspace has to take place within a number of immobile constraints, such as the geographic location of airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para30"><a name="08070259000304">The hon. Gentleman is also rightly concerned about the impact of the proposal on the horse-racing industry. Let me say that we fully recognise the importance of that industry and its value to the local and the UK economy. I know that representatives of the industry have submitted their concerns to NATS in response to their consultation, and that NATS will give them due consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para31"><a name="08070259000305">I come now to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points regarding the height and location of the proposed new holds. As I have already said, I am unable to comment on the detail of the NATS proposal, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that it is right that local residents were given the opportunity to raise those concerns in response to the consultation. NATS is now analysing all the responses received and considering whether any changes can be made to accommodate them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para32"><a name="08070259000306">My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) raised the question of the Heathrow consultation and alternation as well as mixed mode, the Cranford agreement and adding third runway capacity. The consultation on Heathrow already covers alternation and mixed mode. Obviously they will be examined in the consideration of the responses that have been received. As he knows, the responses are now subject to independent analysis. An airspace change consultation by NATS would have to follow any decision to produce with mixed mode or a third runway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para33"><a name="08070259000307">My hon. Friend also asked about derogation of EU quality limits. I can tell him that the EU is likely to seek derogation. I will write to him with the exact details. However, that derogation is in line with derogations being sought by many other EU member states and it has nothing to do with the Heathrow added-capacity situation and will be resolved by 2013-14, well in advance of any additional capacity that may arise out of the Heathrow consultation. As I say, I will write to him with the details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="80702h0008.htm_para34"><a name="08070259000308">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) raised a question about the lack of clarity in paragraphs 11.6 to 11.9. I can reassure him that the CAA will assess the NATS proposal, including the documentary evidence against regulatory requirements, and it is also for the CAA to consider the adequacy of the consultation material, as well as the issues that are submitted. He also expressed a hope that the Chiltern countryside group submission would be looked at closely by the CAA and I hope that I have reassured that that submission will certainly be taken into account.</p>

debate on aviation. However, if he looks at the material that we produced for the Heathrow consultation and the 2003 White Paper, he will certainly find the answers to a number of the questions that he put. The air transport White Paper committed us to making the best use of capacity at regional airports. A number of options were suggested by the industry prior to the White Paper; we agreed that there should be new runways in the south-east at Heathrow and Stansted, subject to meeting environmental conditions.</p>

Member for Canterbury that this is some kind of &#147;predict and provide&#148; policy&#151;there were bids for 15 runways, and the Government approved only four, only two of which were in the south-east.

Our view is that NATS is equipped to carry out the consultation. Yes, it is the biggest consultation that it has ever carried out, but, as I have said before, if the CAA considers that the proposal might have a significant detrimental effect on the environment, it must advise the Secretary of State of the likely impact of the plans.

 I was very pleased to secure this debate, in which I would like to mark international polar year 2007-08. International polar year will involve more than 200 projects taking place in the Arctic and Antarctic, and more than 60 nations will participate. Those projects will focus on environmental change in polar regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000321">International polar year continues an important tradition of scientific advance through international co-operation. The first international polar year took place back in 1882-83 and notable progress was then made in the second international polar year, 1932-33, when the work undertaken brought advances in meteorology, magnetism and atmospheric science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para7"><a name="08070259000322">I also bring to this debate a personal interest in polar regions. Last year, I undertook a trek to the Arctic to raise money for the Children&#146;s Society and to see for myself the effects of climate change on the Arctic. I will never forget being in the middle of nothing but snow and sky. In February, when I went, the sun seems to spend most of the day getting up, finally rising just in time to go back to bed, and so we seemed to always be in the midst of changing skies, with the snow a pink colour in reflection. Nor will I ever forget the northern lights, the silence of the place or its absolutely ethereal beauty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para8"><a name="08070259000323">However, the effects of global warming on the Arctic are already all too visible. Crossing the Arctic circle, we saw reindeer and spoke to the people who herd them. Life there is getting very difficult. The reindeer are unable to reach the moss and lichen they need, because rain falling on the snow creates a thick layer of ice on top and the reindeer are unable to break through the ice to reach their food. The reindeer scratch away at the ice with their hooves, until the hooves are completely worn out. They are forced either to migrate or simply to starve to death. Further north than we were, the problem only gets worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para9"><a name="08070259000324">The Minister will have seen last month&#146;s reports that this summer, for the first time in human history, it may not be possible to plant a flag at the North Pole, as the ice there will have simply melted away. Scientists reckon that there is at least a 50:50 chance that it will soon be possible to sail a boat across it.</p>

The vast majority of the ice that now covers the area is thin one-year-old ice, which melts very easily. The problem of melting ice gets progressively worse as more sea is exposed. Dark ocean absorbs more heat than reflective ice, which leads in turn to a further increase in temperatures. Scientists expect that this process will result in a tripling of the rate of warming in the coming years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para11"><a name="08070259000326">The disappearance of thick perennial ice in the Arctic is not only a visual sign of the dramatic increase in global warming but presents a massive threat to many unique Arctic species. For many people, the symbol of the Arctic is the polar bear. However, scientists predict that, by 2050, more than two thirds of the 25,000 polar bears in the Arctic will have disappeared.

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para12"><a name="08070259000327">It is not just global warming that threatens the survival of those creatures. The US has recently announced that, for the first time in 15 years, it will auction off prime oil and gas reserves in the Chukchi sea between Alaska and Siberia. That process would reduce even further the precious little habitat that polar bears have. Although I am pleased that the US Government have placed the polar bear on their endangered list ahead of the auction of those sites, I remain concerned that the legal responsibilities associated with the listing may not be fully respected. Carter Roberts, who is head of the World Wildlife Fund in the US, has said:</p>
<a name="80702h0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08070259000429"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;While we applaud the announcement, many concerns remain. The 360-page listing document comes with numerous caveats, which we have yet to fully analyze. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne was quite explicit in saying, for example, that continued energy production in Alaska remains a priority.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para13"><a name="08070259000328">Is there anything that the UK can do to put pressure on the US Government to ensure that short-term American energy needs do not threaten the long-term survival of this polar treasure?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para14"><a name="08070259000329">I am sure that the Minister is also aware that the Arctic is known by many of us as the land of the unicorn. The existence of this fabled beast is widely attributed to the appearance of the Arctic narwhal, when it washed up on British beaches. In mediaeval times, narwhal tusks were passed off as unicorn horns, which were supposed to have had magical, disease-curing properties. Queen Elizabeth I reportedly paid &#163;10,000, which was the cost of building a castle, for a single narwhal tusk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para15"><a name="08070259000330">But narwhals, too, are in rapid decline. They are finely attuned to the Arctic environment and ill prepared for rapid climate change. They rely on dense Arctic pack ice for shelter, and dwindling fish stocks mean that they are running out of food. Narwhals are intensely hunted by the Inuit people of Greenland for their ivory tusks. Over the past 30 years, as restrictions on the trade of ivory have become tighter, the price of narwhal tusks has increased markedly, yet plenty of Japanese and Swiss are prepared to spend large amounts of money to buy them. The narwhal is an important source of cash for the Inuit people, but we must ensure that there is fair regulation to ensure its survival. It is thought that the population is now down as far as 25,000. Is there anything that the Government can do about the situation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para16"><a name="08070259000331">Perhaps I should now talk about Antarctica, at the other end of the world. It is very different in character from the Arctic and presents very different challenges&#151;and, of course, part of it is British. The British Antarctic Territory has been an overseas territory of the UK since 1962, and 2008 is the centenary of the granting of its letters patent. The year will be marked by the issue of the British Antarctic Territory&#146;s first ever legal coin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para17"><a name="08070259000332">The British have a long relationship with the region, which began with James Cook&#146;s voyage around Antarctica between 1773 and 1775. Our love affair continued with the expeditions of Ernest Shackleton, Captain Scott and Sir Vivian Fuchs. 2008 also marks the centenary of Shackleton&#146;s Nimrod expedition to Antarctica, and this year a group of descendants of the expedition members will go to Antarctica to follow in their footsteps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para18"><a name="08070259000333">International co-operation is key to preserving this unique region. Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the Antarctic treaty, which defused tensions in the area over sovereignty. It also ensured that Antarctica is demilitarised and nuclear-free, and it enables international scientific co-operation. The treaty now consists of five international agreements which together are known as the Antarctic treaty system. The system includes the protocol on environmental protection to the Antarctic treaty which came into force in 1998. The agreement prevents development and provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment. It prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except those that involve scientific research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para19"><a name="08070259000334">I congratulate the British Antarctic Survey on the hugely important work that it does. It provides a focus for internationally co-ordinated research programmes. It has committed itself to becoming, by 2012, the leading international centre working to achieve new insights about the Antarctic and the surrounding Southern ocean. A recent expedition by BAS found more than 700 previously unknown creatures, including carnivorous sponges, worms and crustaceans living in the dark depths of the Weddell sea. Those new species will provide vital clues about evolution and are a testament to the ecological richness of the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para20"><a name="08070259000335">The dedicated team of scientists live an unorthodox life, especially on 21 June, which is mid-winter in the Antarctic. They celebrate with a nude run in the snow. I understand that the female scientists keep the time of their streak confidential to avoid unwanted attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para21"><a name="08070259000336">However, those unique sights are all under threat from climate change. Global warming in the Antarctic region is occurring five times faster than anywhere else in the world, and we are quickly approaching a point at which the region will no longer be able to sustain itself. Today&#146;s Antarctic ecology was only made possible when, 40 million years ago, the seas around the peninsula cooled. Many predatory crustaceans such as crabs were driven northwards, off the Antarctic shelf. That allowed an ecosystem of thin-shelled creatures such as ribbon worms, brittle stars and sea spiders to survive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para22"><a name="08070259000337">However, in the past 40 years, the sea around the Antarctic has warmed up by more than 1Â° C as a result of global warming and the release of ballast water from ships. If sea temperatures rise another 1Â° C, all the predators that were forced out of the region will come back. They will eat everything and decimate a raft of unique, defenceless species, thereby depriving other species of much-needed food sources. If the water temperature rises another 2Â° C, molluscs will be unable to bury themselves in the sea bed and scallops will no longer be able to swim. Scientists predict that that is not only a possibility, but a probability within the next 100 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para23"><a name="08070259000338">Unfortunately, the popularity of some Antarctic creatures has contributed to their demise as increasing numbers of tourists visit the region every year. Penguins have been adversely affected by climate change. The population of Adelie penguins, which I am sure the Minister will recognise as the ones with the mass of feathers over their bill, has dropped by 65 per cent. Dwindling krill supplies, which I will say more about later, have meant that the numbers in some Gentoo colonies&#151;I believe that I heard her say from a sedentary position that they are the speedy ones, the ones that can get up to 25 miles an hour&#151;have dropped by 30 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para24"><a name="08070259000339">Emperor penguins, which are the stars of the film, &#147;March of the Penguins&#148;, have been struggling to find nesting grounds on thick ice and are increasingly forced to use thin ice. That is dangerous and potentially tragic, as thin ice frequently breaks off from the main pack ice and many chicks and eggs float away into the ocean. The chicks are not old enough to survive on their own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para25"><a name="08070259000340">I crave the indulgence of the House to explain a little more about krill, which I mentioned earlier. They are truly fascinating creatures. In case Members do not know, the Antarctic krill is a crustacean that grows to around 6 cm. It has a translucent body and black eyes. A single krill weighs as much as a paper clip, but the combined biomass of all the Antarctic krill is approximately 500 million tonnes. That is roughly the weight of all the human beings in the world. Shoals of the creatures can be up to a kilometre wide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para26"><a name="08070259000341">Krill is the major food source for numerous Antarctic creatures. They are the lifeblood of the Antarctic. They convert plankton to food sources suitable for whales, penguins, seals, albatrosses, petrels and all sorts of other animals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para27"><a name="08070259000342">Krill not only provide Antarctica with food, but they are a vital tool in the fight against climate change. They have evolved their very own carbon capture technology. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by eating carbon-rich food near the surface and then excreting it in the depths. Every year, that process sequesters an amount of carbon equivalent to the emissions of 35 million cars.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para28"><a name="08070259000343">However, Antarctic krill populations have declined by 80 per cent. since the 1970s. Global warming has led to an overall loss of ice coverage in the Antarctic, too, which has meant a decrease in the habitat available to the plankton and algae that they feed on. Krill are also coming under increasing threat from new fishing techniques. Suction harvesting, which literally vacuums them up from the water and removes huge numbers at a time, places a real strain on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para29"><a name="08070259000344">Krill are increasingly being used as food for fish farms and in health supplements. They provide food for the Antarctic, they provide their own carbon capture system, and we reward them by turning them into cod liver oil. Although the number of krill being removed from the oceans is well below the levels allowed by the current quota cap, I would be grateful if the Minister could provide assurances that strict quotas will be set and enforced to ensure that krill are protected as demand for them grows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para30"><a name="08070259000345">The unique nature of the region, along with reports of naked scientists, is attracting more and more tourists. It is predicted that up to 42,000 visitors will come to Antarctica this year. That is a huge increase since 1997-98, when 9,600 tourists went to the continent. A growing influx of people to such an important and fragile place poses significant problems, including the introduction of alien or invasive species and the expulsion of ballast water from ships. I understand that a self-regulatory framework has been established by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, but could the Minister tell the House what progress has been made to put its regulations on a statutory footing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para31"><a name="08070259000346">The use of ships that have not been adequately ice-strengthened threatens the safety of passengers as well as the surrounding area. In the last two years alone, six  <br>

vessels have gone aground or drifted in the Antarctic. Some 95 per cent. of the tourism takes place in the British Antarctic Territory&#151;UK sovereign territory&#151;so I would be interested to hear from the Minister what is being done, and what can be done, to limit the impact of tourism in Antarctica.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) on securing this debate. The polar regions are incredibly important for us. This issue is rarely discussed in Parliament, so this is a useful, important debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para33"><a name="08070259000349">As my hon. Friend said, it is timely to focus on the polar regions now, in the middle of the international polar year, which has seen scientists from more than 60 countries mobilised in international collaborations to initiate a new era in polar science. The polar regions are of undoubted global significance: they have a profound effect on the world&#146;s climate and ocean systems and are a unique laboratory for the study of global processes, including, as she set out so well, climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para34"><a name="08070259000350">The United Kingdom has a long history with the polar regions. As my hon. Friend mentioned, this year is the centenary of the UK&#146;s claim to the British Antarctic Territory, which is by far the oldest claim to Antarctica, and it is almost 100 years since the heroic age, when Scott and Shackleton first set out on their Antarctic expeditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para35"><a name="08070259000351">Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the Antarctic treaty. The UK was the first state to ratify that treaty and, half a century on, the UK remains one of the leaders within the Antarctic treaty system because of the strength of our commitment and the size of our presence in Antarctica. The success of the Antarctic treaty in maintaining the continent for peace and science cannot be overstated. It is a valuable example of the international community&#146;s working together. We intend to mark the 50th anniversary by reaffirming the UK&#146;s commitment to the treaty and, in particular, the implementation of its protocol on environmental protection, which includes an indefinite prohibition on Antarctic minerals-related activities, except for scientific research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="80702h0009.htm_para36"><a name="08070259000352">Both Antarctica and the Arctic face considerable challenges over the coming decades. My hon.

The resulting increase in melt has caused dramatic impacts on local environments and their ecology.

It is vital that we enhance our  <br>

understanding of the consequences of that, both on the polar regions themselves and the rest of the globe. The work of British scientists is extremely important in this endeavour. The Natural Environment Research Council and particularly its British Antarctic Survey provide world-leading scientific understanding of the polar regions. We should surely aim to ensure that the UK continues to command such a position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para1"><a name="08070259000354">Climatic changes in the polar regions are also causing shifting social and economic pressures on their management and governance. Turning to Antarctica&#151;I am dealing with the regions the opposite way round to my hon. Friend&#151;increasing summer temperatures and decreases in sea ice cover have facilitated greater access to the continent, notably by fishermen and tourists. The effective management of these activities, in line with the principles of the Antarctic treaty system, is one of the major challenges for the future preservation and conservation of Antarctica.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para2"><a name="08070259000355">My hon. Friend mentioned tourism. The number of tourists visiting Antarctica has more than trebled in the past decade. Those lucky enough to make the trip often return determined to play their part in the future protection of the continent and their more immediate environment. However, as she rightly said, with an increasing number of people keen to visit the continent, it is vital that the continuing growth in tourism activities is carefully planned and monitored. The UK is encouraging the Antarctic treaty parties to agree a future vision for the development of Antarctic tourism. As part of that, we aim to ensure that all tourism activities in Antarctica are conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para3"><a name="08070259000356">The sinking of the merchant ship Explorer last year was a salutary reminder that Antarctica remains a distant and inhospitable place. Although we cannot pre-empt the formal investigation, it is clear that the reasonable proximity of other tourist vessels played a large part in ensuring there was no loss of life during that incident. The UK already requires British cruise ships to demonstrate that they are not operating in isolation while in Antarctic waters and continues to encourage other Antarctic treaty parties to do likewise. We are also actively engaged in the work of the International Maritime Organisation to amend the existing guidelines for ships operating in Arctic ice-covered waters in order that they are equally relevant for both the Arctic and Antarctic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para4"><a name="08070259000357">Accurate hydrographic charts are also vital to the mitigation of shipping incidents in Antarctica. More than 95 per cent. of Antarctic cruise vessels operate in the waters of the British Antarctic Territory. Yet less than 10 per cent. of these waters are charted to modern standards. HMS Endurance, the Royal Navy&#146;s ice patrol ship, plays a crucial role in gathering the relevant hydrographic data to support the production of charts by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office. Back in January 2007, HMS Endurance was also involved in supporting the evacuation of passengers from another cruise ship that grounded in Antarctica. Having HMS Endurance working in Antarctica each summer not only reinforces the British presence in Antarctica, but also directly contributes to the safety of British nationals visiting the continent. We should be justly proud of this unique British ship and its crew.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para5"><a name="08070259000358">My hon. Friend rightly mentioned fisheries. Fisheries management in Antarctica is also covered by the Antarctic treaty system, specifically through the convention on  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="2 July 2008">

the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources, which aims to provide comprehensive protection and conservation of the Antarctic marine environment, while allowing for sustainable harvesting of Southern ocean fish stocks. As an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, the South Georgia Government implements the convention requirements around South Georgia as a minimum, although there are also tougher restrictions in some aspects of the fishery. South Georgia&#146;s ensuring such a high standard of sustainable management has achieved Marine Stewardship Council accreditation for South Georgia toothfish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000359">Climatic impacts on the Southern ocean are, however, likely to influence its fish stock levels. In addition, longer summer seasons are providing greater access to the fishing grounds. Illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities remain prevalent in the Southern ocean and present the greatest threat to sustainable management. We must be robust in ensuring that all our international partners continue to strive towards the greatest levels of sustainable ecosystem management in Antarctica. I give my hon. Friend the assurance that we will continue to keep this under close review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para7"><a name="08070259000360">Turning to the Arctic, the environmental impacts from climatic changes there are even starker than in the Antarctic, as my hon. Friend said. Reduced sea ice is opening up vast areas of ocean for the first time. Increased hydrocarbon interest and shipping access has followed, all of which are having a profound effect on the Arctic environment and its peoples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para8"><a name="08070259000361">The UK has major economic, political and social interests in the Arctic. However, unlike the Antarctic, there is no Arctic treaty. The issues of importance to the UK are largely covered by a raft of bilateral and multilateral agreements and a suite of international treaties. Most significantly, the United Nations convention on the law of the sea provides the framework for the management of the Arctic seabed. The UK also engages actively with the Arctic Council as a state observer. We regard that as an important forum for dialogue with the Arctic rim states on issues of mutual importance.</p>

Friend delighted us with her stories and confirmed that many of the species that we hold dear are in danger&#151;even if we do not know all the different types of penguins. My trip to the Falkland Islands helped me somewhat with identifying penguins. She is right to ask what will happen if we do not protect these beautiful, precious species. We have recognised that the polar bear is threatened in the wild and, although we have no remit to intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states, as I am sure my hon. Friend knows, we are committed to co-operating with the international community to address the threats to its conservation. One way we do that is through membership of agreements, such as the convention on biological diversity and the convention on international trade in endangered species. We will continue to work with all other states to try to ensure the preservation of these precious species.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow.

I am pleased to say that the then Paymaster General, the right hon.

Of the 29 offices included in the review, the proposals recommend the closure of 19. My constituency suffers particularly badly from the review, with all three offices proposed for closure. They are in Dunoon, Rothesay and Oban.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para15"><a name="08070259000369">The proposals outlined in the consultation document are fundamentally flawed for many reasons, which I shall discuss in turn. The first is the loss of jobs in fragile communities. Secondly, I believe that the proposals will make HMRC less efficient, rather than more efficient. Thirdly, taxpayers will find it more difficult to get help with filling in their forms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para16"><a name="08070259000370">I shall speak first about jobs. The proposals involve a reduction in the number of jobs in the offices outside urban centres in Scotland from 1,900 to 1,350&#151;a loss of 550 jobs in small towns throughout Scotland. That is at a time when HMRC is not the only Department cutting back on jobs in small towns throughout the country. The Department for Work and Pensions is also transferring jobs from jobcentres in small towns to large centralised offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para17"><a name="08070259000371">In my constituency, the three HMRC offices marked for closure employ 23 people, but that does not tell us the whole story because those offices have already seen significant job losses in recent years. The Rothesay office, which has seven staff, employed 16 just five years ago, and the Dunoon office, which employs 14 staff, has seen similar losses, so my constituency has already seen substantial job losses without consultation. The centralisation of those jobs reverses years of successive Government policy to disperse jobs from big cities to other parts of the country. Now, the policy seems to have gone into reverse, and jobs are being moved from small towns to giant offices in cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para18"><a name="08070259000372">Those job losses might not sound large if they were in a large town or city, but the communities that I am talking about are small with fragile economies, particularly Rothesay, which is on a small island. The jobs that are being lost are relatively well paid compared with most jobs in those small remote towns. People who are made redundant will struggle to find jobs locally that require the same skills set, and the job opportunities will be lost to the community for ever. As well as the direct loss of jobs, there will be a loss of purchasing power with a knock-on effect for other local businesses. It is important to remember that the work force are overwhelmingly female and women are more likely than men to have caring responsibilities. They will therefore find it difficult to commute the long distance to the nearest remaining office in Glasgow or to relocate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para19"><a name="08070259000373">The consultation paper considers the feasibility of staff commuting daily to the nearest remaining office, but it accepts that the nearest remaining office is too far away to be within reasonable travelling distance. Staff will have to choose between moving house or redundancy. It is important to stress that people who live in remote communities pay their taxes in the same way as people who live in cities. The local communities in these areas should be able to benefit just as much as those in cities from a share of public sector jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para20"><a name="08070259000374">I would like to draw attention to the Wick office, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso). He wanted to make an intervention today, but he is hoping to catch the Speaker&#146;s eye in the Chamber. He asked me to stress that the area around Wick is within the travel-to-work distance of Dounreay, where there will be substantial job losses during the coming years and that the loss of jobs in Wick is therefore very serious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para21"><a name="08070259000375">The second matter that I want to mention relates to my doubts that the proposed changes will make HMRC any more efficient. The thrust of the proposals is that HMRC can do its job just as well with a lot fewer staff. I would like to draw hon. Members&#146; attention to what the Treasury Committee found when it investigated HMRC as part of its 7th report of the current Session. Paragraph 119 of the report states:</p>
<a name="80702h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="08070259000430"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are concerned that the current VAT gap, the direct tax and National Insurance underpayments, and the deterioration in the Self-Assessment filing performance may be linked to the headcount reduction under the efficiency programme.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para22"><a name="08070259000376">The Committee went on to recommend that the Government should explain how they</p>
<a name="80702h0010.htm_brev1"><a name="0810014000001"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will ensure that any further efficiency savings are not made at the cost of further deterioration in HMRC&#146;s performance.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para23"><a name="08070259000377">In paragraph 128 the Committee states:</p>
<a name="80702h0010.htm_brev2"><a name="08070259000431"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There have been considerable problems with delays in VAT registration for small businesses. We have repeatedly been assured that the headcount reductions and efficiency programme as a whole would not cause a decline in the quality of HMRC&#146;s services. We ask the Government to explain why there has been a deterioration of service in relation to VAT registrations and what measures it will take to bring HMRC back on course.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para24"><a name="08070259000378">Will the Government explain why, despite all the problems identified by the Treasury Committee, they think the problems of underpayment of tax can be solved while shedding large numbers of staff?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para25"><a name="08070259000379">Another saving that it is claimed HMRC can make is in relation to property costs. Why is HMRC proposing to get rid of property in small towns rather than in cities? It is obvious that property costs in small towns are significantly lower than in cities. I do not see how it is a saving to move people from a low-cost office in a small town to a high-cost office in a city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para26"><a name="08070259000380">Computers and electronic communications mean that processing work can be done just as easily in a remote location as in a large city office. The ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne is a successful example of a company that has modernised its procedures while still keeping jobs in remote communities. Rather than centralising its booking system in one call centre, CalMac set up a dispersed call centre so that when a customer dials the number to make a booking their call is directed to one of many ports. The staff are therefore available to answer the phone in the same way as they would in a  <br>

call centre, yet they are still located in various ports and can deal with local face-to-face inquiries, as well as with inquiries made over the phone. I ask HMRC to consider having a model such as that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para27"><a name="08070259000381">Another type of job being moved is that of compliance officers. I find it difficult to understand how compliance will be improved by centralising compliance officers in big city offices. Moving compliance officers out of local communities will mean a loss of local knowledge and losing that valuable local knowledge will surely make the job more difficult. The Oban office consists of a detection officer and a local compliance officer. Will the Minister explain how those jobs will still be done effectively from Glasgow?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para28"><a name="08070259000382">I understand that if someone&#146;s tax affairs are being investigated, they can insist on the interview being held near to where they live or work. That will mean increased travelling times for compliance officers and extra costs for HMRC as it will have to pay officers for driving their car or sitting on a train or a ferry, whereas at the moment the compliance office lives and works locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para29"><a name="08070259000383">I am also concerned about the job of dealing with local inquiries. HMRC still proposes to keep inquiry offices at Dunoon and Rothesay, but we have already seen cuts in the opening times of the Rothesay office. The opening times have just been reduced from 8.30 am until 5 pm to 10 am until 4 pm, which obviously makes it more difficult for people working during the day to visit the inquiry office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para30"><a name="08070259000384">I have some questions about the how the new inquiry offices will operate. How many staff will be employed in each office? At the moment in the Rothesay office, one member of staff deals with nearly all the inquiries, but if they are off sick or on holiday, other staff are on hand to deal with inquiries. In addition, experienced back-office staff are on hand to assist the front-line officer with complicated inquiries. If only one member of staff is employed in the new inquiry office, what will happen when he or she is on holiday or off sick? If another officer has to travel from Glasgow to cover for holidays or sickness, surely that adds to costs, rather than making the system more efficient. Will there be health and safety implications if only one person is employed in an office? Will people still be able to turn up at any time during the working day or will they have to make an appointment? In addition, will a freephone number be available for telephone inquiries or will the taxpayer be expected to pay the cost of the call to receive advice? At the moment, people can receive free advice by turning up in person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para31"><a name="08070259000385">Until recently, the staff in Rothesay and Dunoon made regular visits to remote communities and held tax surgeries there. That was a valuable service. As the tax system&#151;particularly in relation to tax credits&#151;is becoming more complicated, HMRC should be reinstating such a valuable service, rather than moving staff yet further away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para32"><a name="08070259000386">I have talked about costs, but what about carbon emissions? Has HMRC done an environmental impact assessment of the extra carbon emissions that will be created by staff commuting further to work in cities or by travelling from their city office to carry out compliance work elsewhere?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para33"><a name="08070259000387">I have outlined where I think the HMRC proposals are wrong. Valuable jobs will be lost in fragile communities  <br>

 It is a pleasure to join you this afternoon, Mr. Bercow, to debate this issue. I am sure there will be further debates on the matter as we move through the consultation period&#151;probably after the recess as there are no announcements made during that time. There will be an opportunity for hon. Members to make representations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para35"><a name="08070259000390">I compliment the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) on securing today&#146;s debate. He has made a forceful case on behalf of his constituency and the people whom he represents. Hon. Members&#146; interest in the reorganisation of HMRC in Scotland has already been brought to my attention through letters, questions in the House and debates such as this, in addition to contributions to the consultation process that HMRC has developed. I am grateful for all the representations that I have received. I have also had the benefit of meeting hon. Members on several occasions regarding their concerns and those of their constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para36"><a name="08070259000391">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute will be aware that as a result of pressures that Ministers have placed on HMRC in addition to those arising from the Gershon report and other reforms, HMRC is being required to increase its effectiveness while at the same time making efficiencies. Following the merger of Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue in 2005, HMRC has, patently, too much office space and too many buildings for its business needs. HMRC estimates that along with the expected reduction in staff of about 25,000 between 2004 and 2011, it will be able to release up to 40 per cent. of its office space by 2011 or 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="80702h0010.htm_para37"><a name="08070259000392">As a Minister, I have gone through various Departments in which modernisation, improvements and reform have taken place that have required the disposal of office space and, in some cases, magistrates courts, and it is remarkable how otherwise insignificant and unnoticed buildings suddenly become the beating heart of the community in which they are located. I am not making light of the representations that I receive about the importance of what are, I acknowledge, good-quality, white-collar jobs that are rare and precious in many of those communities. However, it is clearly not a good use of taxpayers&#146; money to keep paying for 40 per cent. more office space than HMRC can use. HMRC has already saved more than &#163;35 million a year on accommodation costs&#151;money that will assist it to improve customer service and provide better value for money for the public purse.</p>

organised criminals were trying to defraud the Exchequer. The measures that HMRC put in place to counter that have had a very significant effect, and registrations are now meeting the standard that we set and that we expect in relation to businesses applying for new registrations. Yes, HMRC got knocked off course in terms of performance, but that was as a result of a specific attack.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="80702h0011.htm_para1"><a name="08070259000394">One of the constraints on HMRC being able to respond as quickly as we would have liked to the situation was the fact that it had so many different offices that it could not reallocate the staff as swiftly as it wanted to in order to switch them from doing one form of process to another. Unfortunately for hon. Members representing small offices in their constituencies, that has merely borne out HMRC managers&#146; case&#151;that to achieve the maximum benefits and improvements from reform and change, they need to bring staff together in larger units so that they can not only drive up standards and the ability of staff to get the tax and the processes right, but ensure that they maximise the use of public resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="80702h0011.htm_para2"><a name="08070259000395">I will take into account the representations that I receive about the impact of closures, but HMRC has to balance that with the requirement to be as efficient as it can be. Although it is right for HMRC to keep its network of inquiry centres, it is also right for HMRC&#146;s senior management to examine its back-office operations. They must ensure that those are run as efficiently and effectively as possible. In some work areas, that is best done by concentrating work in large units, but in others, a more mobile work force is seen as the best solution to customer needs. There must be an emphasis on improving compliance by focusing resources on the risks that HMRC deals with regarding different taxes and customer groups. Within HMRC, there is a better understanding&#151;an improving understanding&#151;of the risks to the Exchequer and the response that needs to be put in place to deal with those risks. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that HMRC places great value on the face-to-face contact that the public appreciate, and it is determined to maintain that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="80702h0011.htm_para3"><a name="08070259000396">That said, I recently visited one of the biggest and busiest inquiry centres in Northern Ireland and made careful note of the fact that it was remarkably quiet on that particular morning. That was rather embarrassing for the staff working there, who were clearly very skilled and well able to deal with inquiries about all sorts of tax matters. When I look at the footfall in inquiry centres, I am not sure that we are using in the most productive way some of the best and most capable staff that HMRC employs. When no members of the public are in the office, those members of staff are given processing work to fill up their time, whereas we might be able to use them better by sending them out of the office. I am talking about taking HMRC advice out of a confined office and perhaps to local markets on particular market days. Such an innovative way of using staff is a better approach, and that is the kind of thinking that I am encouraging HMRC to follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="80702h0011.htm_para4"><a name="08070259000397">I can give the hon. Gentleman a number of reassurances.

daily travel distance. There is an established process for managers and staff to discuss options for their future employment following the announcement of HMRC&#146;s decisions to vacate offices. That process is open, transparent and accessible to trade unions. It has stood the test of time, in that we have been going through the process for about 18 months and I have not had any serious complaints that the process is flawed. Impact assessments are carried out before a final decision is taken to vacate an office. Those assessments consider the possible effects of closure on staff, customers and the wider local community, while recognising HMRC&#146;s need to restructure its business and estate in the most efficient way possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="80702h0011.htm_para5"><a name="08070259000398">If we look at where Dunoon, Rothesay and Oban are on the map, it will pose significant problems not only for the staff but for HMRC to meet the commitment that staff will not be required to commute beyond a reasonable travelling distance. A great deal of thought must be given to how staff there can respond to the decisions that HMRC might recommend me to take. That will involve a very close and detailed consultation with each member of staff. That is a consultation that HMRC does with every member of staff, but in the case of the offices in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency and other offices in far-flung places in Scotland, careful thought will need to be given to it. Work is under way. I cannot go into the sort of detailed examples that the hon. Gentleman gave, but I assure him that HMRC managers take the time to talk to staff and find out about an individual&#146;s detailed personal circumstances. Consultation with about 1,900 staff in the remaining 29 HMRC office buildings in Scotland began on 11 June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="80702h0011.htm_para6"><a name="08070259000401">I recognise, as does HMRC, that some offices proposed for vacation are in areas that are too remote for the staff reasonably to travel every day to another HMRC office&#151;for example, the 15 or so staff working in the Dunoon office in the hon.

HMRC to maintain that agreement, but there sometimes comes a point when the individual has the right to receive compensation for losing a job, as it will allow the person to move on and make a new start in another job elsewhere. We are not at that stage yet, but I need to consider carefully the implications for staff of closures of that nature. We would not do anything without the fullest consultation with the trade unions involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="80702h0011.htm_para9"><a name="08070259000404">I shall speak briefly about the range of offices across Scotland, as it will illustrate the work that HMRC is undertaking. The consultation involves staff, trade unions, Members of Parliament, Members of the Scottish Parliament and local authorities. All have been invited to contribute, and to provide information on travel routes, economic and socio-economic interests in the various localities and the position of other employers and Departments. HMRC plans to announce decisions on the locations toward the end of the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="80702h0011.htm_para10"><a name="08070259000405">I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern about the possible impact on rural locations. Those factors are important, and I will take them into account. However, as I said earlier those factors have to be weighed against HMRC&#146;s wider need to restructure its business in the most efficient and effective way. The changes that HMRC has gone through since the merger have resulted in increased tax revenues, and the measures taken to reduce the tax gap have already reduced annual underpayments of tax by more than &#163;5 billion compared with five years ago.</p>

to the UK, and I believe that the arrangements will continue to bear fruit. The changes were in line with what tax authorities in every other developed economy in the world are doing. I realise that we are taking customs out again and putting it in the new UK Border Agency, but that will prove beneficial, and certainly the staff involved welcomed the announcement when it was made some little while ago.</p>

On occasions such as this, I like to put on record the Government&#146;s appreciation of the quality of the work that HMRC staff do, and of their dedication and commitment. The 15 members of staff in the hon.
