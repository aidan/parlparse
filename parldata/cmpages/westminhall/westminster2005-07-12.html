<p><a name="st_0"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Mr. Heppell.]</i>
</p>


<a name="time_0">
<a name="50712h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50712h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Keith Simpson  (Mid-Norfolk)</b>  (Con): It is a pleasure, Mr. Olner, to be under your gimlet eye. I am pleased also that the Minister of State will be replying to the debate. For many of us&#151;I say this in the most positive way&#151;discussing United Kingdom farming and the European Union sugar regime has something of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, but I am pleased that he is here; it shows that his Department takes the debate seriously.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para0"><a name="stpa_0">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate the subject. Sugar beet is obviously important to farmers and to the food industry in my constituency of Mid-Norfolk. Several thousand jobs in Norfolk depend directly on farming and food processing. British Sugar has a beet factory at Cantley in my constituency; and many other people, including road hauliers, depend on that business. Sugar is important to my constituents in a wider sense, not only as consumers but as people with concerns about the environment and the developing world, which has been the subject of a nationwide debate over the past few weeks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para1"><a name="stpa_1">The timing of the debate is apposite, given that the UK took over the EU presidency on 1 July. The EU Commission proposals for reform of the EU sugar regime were published on 22 June. The timetable for consideration of those proposals was set by the UK. Consultation will take place during the summer and autumn, with the Council of Agricultural Ministers on 21 and 22 November taking a decision on the EU&#039;s position for the World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in Hong Kong that will take place between 13 and 18 December. I regard today&#039;s debate as part of the consultation process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para2"><a name="stpa_2">One of the purposes of the debate is to outline some of the concerns about the EU proposals that have been expressed by UK farmers&#151;particularly those in my constituency&#151;and to press the Minister on what he believes will be the main issues that will determine UK policy. I hope a little later to put some specific questions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para3"><a name="stpa_3">Reform of the UK sugar regime will go far beyond the narrow position of UK farmers. It will have a direct impact on the wider UK food industry, which does not necessarily speak with one voice on the subject. Indeed, I note that in recent oral questions to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, some hon. Members have taken a different position on sugar processing and free markets. Reform will not only affect consumers but will have a major impact on sugar producers in the Caribbean; some of them rely on sugar as a staple product, and it is their main earning power for overseas currency. It will also have an impact on access to EU markets by many developing countries. Reform goes beyond narrow UK farming interests.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para4"><a name="stpa_4">Over the past few years, farmers have been pillorised as fat cats by the UK media because of the EU subsidies that they receive, particularly those for sugar beet. That is unfair. Many British farmers would not be able to continue without such subsidies. It is unfair to think of them as selfish fat cats. There may be some like that, but the overwhelming majority of farmers in my constituency do not see themselves like that; they believe that they have been unfairly caricatured. They believe that they are putting something back into the community by caring for the land and the environment. They are also conscious that in the past&#151;this could apply in the future, too&#151;they were concerned about security of food supply in a changing and, at times, threatening world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para5"><a name="stpa_5">Consumers in the UK are ambivalent about farming and food. They want UK farming to be compassionate, environmentally friendly and free of subsidies and additives. At the same time, they want the cheapest possible food. They want food that has not been grown or bred abroad under inhumane or environmentally poor conditions; they want food that has not been transported thousands of miles and they want food that is not frozen rather than fresh. We have to square that circle. I do not knock UK consumers; we might find that attitude in our own families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para6"><a name="stpa_6">However, there is a down side to all the plus positive things that we want for our food. One of those is that the very market forces that we wish to open up will close down some of the most efficient, environmentally conscious, humane farming in the world, here in the UK. While I do not wish to exaggerate the problem, it is a sad fact, as the Minister knows only too well from previous debates, that some of the food that we consume in the United Kingdom&#151;perhaps labelled with a Union jack&#151;does not come from the United Kingdom but was produced under inhumane and environmentally horrendous conditions. We should be conscious of that in this debate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50712h01_spnew1"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood)</b>  (Lab): The hon. Gentleman knows the difficulties that remain to be debated. Given what he has just said, is it not important to try to get a political agreement on the sugar regime during the British presidency while we have more opportunity to influence change?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para7"><a name="stpa_7">Is it not important to push out the more inefficient producers in Europe; those in places such as Greece and Finland? Thirdly, in any de-coupling mechanism, is it not right that the compensation arrangements that must surely follow are the same across Europe, so that there can be no unfair competition?
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50712h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Simpson </b> : I was very happy to take that intervention from the hon. Gentleman, who knows the subject well&#151;several years ago, we served together on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. In fact, I am beginning to think that there is some sort of spy camera in my office, because he seems to have read parts of my speech that I thought were known only to me&#151;it seems that Labour Whips have become more efficient over the years. He is absolutely right that the presidency represents an opportunity for the United Kingdom. It has to show Uberparteilichkeit&#151;that is my one bit of German for the day; to be above party politics. At the same time, farmers and consumers are 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 189WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
looking to the UK to take a position. He is right that whatever happens must happen across Europe. Why should some of the most efficient, environmentally conscious farmers be put out of business while others continue? I shall come back to that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para8"><a name="stpa_8">Looking back over debates in the past few years about the common agricultural policy, in particular those on the EU sugar regime, I am struck by the fact that there seems to have been a general consensus that subsidies either need to be phased out or are going to be. Even farmers who do not want to consider that possibility accept the likelihood that they will go, and the majority think that it is inevitable. However, the devil is in the detail, and there are real concerns about how it will be achieved without wrecking UK farming and possibly damaging the agricultural economies of many developing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para9"><a name="stpa_9">Moving from a protected, subsidised farming economy to a free trade economy is not necessary. When the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) and I were members of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, we visited New Zealand to see how it had moved from subsidies to a free market. Obviously, there is no direct analogy with the United Kingdom, and New Zealand is not a member of the EU. It took the New Zealanders about 15 years to develop a new farming economy. Many farms went out of business, and there was much hardship on the way. I left with the impression that it had been nip and tuck whether they would produce the free trade farming economy that they now have.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para10"><a name="stpa_10">United Kingdom farmers face a similar journey, possibly over a similar time scale. I am concerned that the Government have not yet produced a strategic road map to navigate the UK farming industry from where it is now to where it might be in the next 10 or 15 years. About 36 per cent. of the national sugar beet crop is grown in Norfolk, and it is regarded as the county&#039;s cornerstone crop. Getting changes wrong will have a serious detrimental impact on farming in Norfolk and particularly in my constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para11"><a name="stpa_11">What are UK sugar beet growers&#039; concerns about the EU proposals? First, the timetable for implementing the price cuts is too short and will cause a shock to the industry. Interestingly, that view was endorsed by Oxfam, which argued for shallower price cuts and a longer implementation period than that proposed by the Commission, precisely because of the damaging impact on some of the world&#039;s poorest economies. Are the Government considering proposing to other member states that the timetable be shortened, for the reasons that I have advanced?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para12"><a name="stpa_12">Secondly, there is the extent of the price cuts. A 42.6 per cent. cut is too drastic and goes far beyond what is required to achieve a balanced market that ensures production in the EU&#039;s most efficient regions&#151;the very point made by the hon. Member for Sherwood. The price cuts threaten production, even in the EU&#039;s most efficient regions, which obviously include the United Kingdom.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50712h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. John Greenway  (Ryedale)</b>  (Con): My hon. Friend has come to the point in the new proposals that causes 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 190WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the gravest concern. Although they are considerably better than the EU&#039;s first draft, does my hon. Friend agree that the objective of taking 5 million tonnes out of production does not require a cut in the proposed reference price of the scale proposed by the European Commission? For all the Government&#039;s support for change, is it not important that they embrace that thought?
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50712h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Simpson </b> : My hon. Friend has made a good point, which I absolutely support. I look to the Minister to address it in his reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para13"><a name="stpa_13">Is the Minister aware of the work done by the sugar beet expert Martin Lainsbury of the Arable Group, which is based at Morley, near Wymondham, in Norfolk? Mr. Lainsbury has calculated the financial implications of the proposed price cuts for the average sugar beet grower in Norfolk. He estimates that growers&#039; income would slump by more than &#163;750 per hectare&#151;from a gross &#163;712 to a loss of &#163;40 per hectare. In other words, we are going straight into deficit. If correct, that would have a devastating impact on farmers. At the very least, it would persuade many to get out of sugar beet; in some cases, it would persuade them to get out of farming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para14"><a name="stpa_14">Thirdly, it seems that highly efficient sugar beet producers such as the United Kingdom will be treated exactly the same under the proposals as the most inefficient producers in EU countries such as Greece and Finland, as the hon. Member for Sherwood said. Surely, the logic should be to close the least efficient producers down and compensate them. Why drive out efficiency rather than inefficiency?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para15"><a name="stpa_15">Fourthly, there is the merging of the A and B quotas. Implementing a 42.6 per cent. price cut on an amalgamated A and B quota disadvantages small proportional B quota member states because, as the Minister knows, the price of B beet is lower than that of A beet. The UK&#039;s status as a relatively small B sugar producer means that our growers are likely to face an additional price cut of 2.3 per cent. over and above the 42.6 per cent. proposed by the Commission. Do the Government intend to oppose cutting prices on an amalgamated A plus B quota?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para16"><a name="stpa_16">Fifthly, since the Government began their partial regulatory impact assessment on 30 June, they have concluded that if sugar beet prices fell to &#8364;25 a tonne, the majority of UK sugar beet growing would be unprofitable. I understand that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not expect the price to fall that low and states in the assessment that &#8364;30 a tonne is more likely. A &#8364;5 margin is not that great. Can the Minister explain on what basis DEFRA made that calculation, and what will happen if the calculation is wrong and the price falls to &#8364;25 a tonne?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para17"><a name="stpa_17">I could continue to ask a whole raft of questions, but I am conscious that other Members wish to speak. The EU Commission has failed to recognise the legitimate rights and interests of growers. There appears to be no explicit provision for growers to have a say in the process of deciding whether to purchase additional quota or to relinquish quota under the restructuring scheme. I do not think that growers have any more right than any other group in EU; but they certainly have a right per se to be heard, given that at the end of day their 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 191WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
livelihoods are at stake and they are potentially the cornerstone of UK farming. Does the Minister agree that there should be explicit provision for growers to have their say in the consultation process?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para18"><a name="stpa_18">Sugar beet growers would have more confidence if there had been a serious policy decision to consider an alternative crop to sugar beet that might help provide financial stability and be environmentally friendly. I refer, of course, to biofuels. Biodiesel is made from vegetable or animal oil, mixed with a small quantity of methanol. Bioethanol is a simple alcohol that is produced by the fermentation of plant co-products&#151;straw, wheat, potato and sugar beet tops.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para19"><a name="stpa_19">Over the past few years there has been a long, exhausting debate about biofuels. I would like to acknowledge my former colleague and good friend Baroness Shephard, who has now transferred to another place and whose presence hovers in this Chamber even as I speak. As a former Minister with responsibility for agriculture, she knew the issues only too well and has led the charge on biofuels. Her successor, my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser), will continue with that and hopes to catch your eye later, Mr. Olner.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para20"><a name="stpa_20">The serious point is that hon. Members have won the argument with the Minister and his Department. However, although it would be churlish not to acknowledge that the Treasury has lowered the duty on biofuels, it is not until we get a zero-rated duty that those interested in investing in them will be prepared to do so. We are in a Catch-22 situation: the Treasury say that if duty were lowered to zero, we would be flooded by biofuels from the continent, yet if we do not do so, we are ultimately still likely to be flooded.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50712h01_spnew5"><b> Paddy Tipping </b> : It is very good of the hon. Gentleman to give way again. Let me associate myself with his remarks about the noble Baroness Shephard. He mentioned the Treasury, but what about the Department for Transport and the notion of a biofuels obligation, which is already in legislation? What has happened to that work? Why is the Department for Transport not moving forward on it? A stepped-up obligation would avoid the import of Brazilian ethanol.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50712h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Simpson </b> : Once again, the hon. Gentleman has made a strong point and although I do not necessarily expect the Minister to answer on behalf of another Department, the point should be passed back. Developing biofuels not only would provide a staple crop for many farmers but would be environmentally friendly on the whole and answer the increasing problems caused by the import of fuel. I recognise that there are many difficulties en route, but I would like to think that the Government were considering the issue strategically. Such behaviour would be a form of what used to be called joined-up government&#151;I do not know whether that phrase has now gone out of fashion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50712h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Greenway </b> : I am very grateful to my hon. Friend; he has evened up the score of interventions with the other side.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para21"><a name="stpa_21">With regard to a strategic view from Government, is my hon. Friend aware of the significant research project into the production of bioethanol from sugar at the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 192WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Central Science Laboratory in my constituency? I am assured that that work is virtually complete. We could launch that initiative very soon.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50712h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Simpson </b> : A lot of research has come together. Norfolk MPs recently had a presentation from people from the north-east who are involved in looking at developing the industry. I am ashamed to say that they seemed to be far ahead of those of us in Norfolk. Lots of things are coming together and the Government must surely get on with it as quickly as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para22"><a name="stpa_22">My debate has been about UK farming and the EU sugar regime. We tend to debate that at the strategic level and we rarely come down to the individual farmer and his family. I am only too conscious that in my constituency the majority of farmers are not large commercial groupings. It is frequently the farmer and his business partner, who is usually his wife. Most of them manage to farm under the most difficult conditions, not least the blizzard of rules, regulations and computer failures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para23"><a name="stpa_23">I want to close with a short quote from a farmer who wrote to me on 4 July, when he heard that I had initiated this debate. He writes:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;I have now had an opportunity to work through the figures and the impact on my business. I am a small farmer in Norfolk looking after 600 acres. Financially the impact is devastating to the economics of the farm, in fact the only sensible option is to cease beet production altogether. Looking to the future I will have to radically change the way I farm to the complete detriment of the environment I have spent 10 years building up. I currently grow 40 hectares of sugar beet (a spring crop) 50 hectares of linseed (a spring crop) and 30 hectares of spring barley (another spring crop). This spread of winter/spring cropping gives a good balance of environments to all wildlife. I feel particularly proud of my 30 pairs of Grey Partridges and 2 pairs of nesting Barn owls. Without sugar beet the only way I will be able to remain financially viable will be to pursue a Wheat/Oilseed Rape/Beans rotation. This will maximise my gross margin and I hope allow me to remain in business. These are all autumn sown crops and so will offer little in the way of diversity to wildlife. Overwintered stubbles will be a thing of the past, granted I have planned for some skylark plots in my ELS application, but will a dozen 12 square metre plots make up for 60 hectares of stubble or 40 hectares of lifted beet debris, both of which support an enormous diversity of wildlife. I know the impact this will have on the wildlife&#039;s environment. I just feel very sad that wildlife is again going to be the main loser in man&#039;s pursuit of a fractionally cheaper Mars bar. If this is the implication on my farm, I wonder what impact cutting down vast tracts of rain forest in Brazil to produce sugar cane will be?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para24"><a name="stpa_24">I have not come here as an advocate or to make a special plea for UK farmers. We are beyond that. I believe, however, that UK farmers have a right to look to the Government to see what their policy will be in terms of the EU Commission&#039;s proposals. Have the Government thought through the road map to get us from where we are now to where they would like us to be in five or 10 years? If they do not, other colleagues will be debating the disappearance of UK farming in this Chamber in a decade&#039;s time.

can sit in the middle and if there are not many Members on one side or the other, I get called early. So, I am grateful to you, Mr. Olner. I also grateful to the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) for raising the issue, because I have just had a meeting with some National Farmers Union members in my constituency and this debate allows me to put all my questions directly to the Minister, who I am pleased to see present, rather than writing to him at some length.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para25"><a name="stpa_25">Sugar beet in Wyre Forest is not of nearly the same significance as it is in Mid-Norfolk, but there are at least 20 farmers who, on average, produce 1,000 tonnes a year. Because the farms are much smaller than the Norfolk farms and are on tight rotations, at least a third of their land is taken up in that way. So they are very vulnerable to changes in the price. Of course, the price that we are being quoted is unviable for many of them. As the hon. Gentleman has said, the timetable is far too short.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para26"><a name="stpa_26">One point that has been raised repeatedly with me is the compensation deal. Apparently, the compensation deal involves the Government and not the growers, whereas in some of the continental countries, compensation is going straight to the growers. It is crucial that compensation goes where it is needed. In my area, there is a larger producer, who has bought the incredibly expensive harvesting equipment, which he then lets out to the rest of the growers in the area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para27"><a name="stpa_27">I know of the Minister&#039;s interest in wildlife, and he knows of mine. At least we still have lapwings and skylarks in Wyre Forest. We cannot manage corncrakes or pink-footed geese, but I can still hear skylarks. Not to be able to do so would be a huge loss.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para28"><a name="stpa_28">Alternative uses have been referred to, and I can only support the comments on getting bioethanol from beet. It is so obvious that there is another use. Why the dickens can we not pursue that? I am sure that many of the farmers in Norfolk, Scunthorpe and certainly in Wyre Forest are joining the specially chartered flight to Brussels on 18 July to lobby the meeting there. As the hon. Gentleman said, this debate is very much part of the consultation and we want to convey the message that our farmers are desperately worried.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para29"><a name="stpa_29">I shall talk briefly about diversification, because that is the way sugar beet farmers are having to look. Producing biodiesel from oilseed rape has been mentioned. It seems ridiculous that we export the rape to Germany to be processed and then reimport it to this country. Is that due to subsidies or because there is no processing capacity? Could we not produce the biodiesel in this country?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para30"><a name="stpa_30">On niche marketing, high-quality poultry is produced in my area and sold directly to small butchers and farmers&#039; markets. However, the farmers who do that have come up against a tremendous problem. There are apparently eco-friendly poultry houses. They are low-profile, on skids and mobile, and they have solar panels, but they do not fit in with any of the local planning guidelines. The local planning committees do not know how to pass them. Somehow, planning rules are not keeping pace with the aims of diversification.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para31"><a name="stpa_31">Another interesting niche market is asparagus. One of the farmers who is growing asparagus and selling it directly has found that the bashed-up fragments are 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 194WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
much better than the high-quality stuff, because people buy them for soup. Sometimes he has to bash up his good-quality asparagus just so that he can sell it for soup.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para32"><a name="stpa_32">Another problem that was raised with me relates to environmental stewardship. Even getting in at the entry level is difficult because of the problem in obtaining the digital maps. One farmer applied on 17 January and still has not got them. I am sure that all hon. Members have seen them and know the amount of detail that has to be completed. We are talking about every field, every hedgerow, arable scrub and woodland. Every tree that measures more than 30 cm in diameter at chest height has to be entered. So the farmers cannot even start until they get the digital payback.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para33"><a name="stpa_33">One bit of good, purely local news that we raised in the Chamber last week concerns neighbourhood policing. There will be trials of that in the area that I represent. As the farms in the area are close to the towns, it will give local farmers a direct phone number to call when the local ne&#039;er-do-wells are invading.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para34"><a name="stpa_34">How can the Minister protect the growing of sugar beet in this country? I am sure that, following the trip to Brussels, he realises the strength of feeling. I expect that some of his farmers will be on that trip. It is vital that compensation to growers really gets there. I also want to ask about diversification&#151;converting beet to bioethanol and oilseed rape to biodiesel&#151;and about the planning rules. How can those rules be brought up to date so that they keep pace with diversification? Finally, I would like to know about the digital maps for environmental stewardship.

Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) on initiating the debate, which is important. I represent The Wrekin, which is in Shropshire and in which is situated the Allscott sugar beet factory. At peak periods, the factory employs 150 people. It is supplied locally by 600 farmers, of which 200 are in my constituency. Therefore, sugar beet, and the sugar industry in general, is important to The Wrekin, and to Shropshire as a whole.

When those people get their pay packet, they go off to local retailers and take their families to local leisure operators. Therefore, the future of the Allscott factory is of great importance. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that he has held discussions at the most senior level with British Sugar and to reassure me and my constituents that there will be no threat to jobs at Allscott.

<a name="50712h01_para36"><a name="stpa_36">I have some concerns on the specifics of the proposed changes to the sugar regime. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk mentioned the reference price. It seems to have slipped. In the White Paper, the reference price was &#8364;421. The proposed change now makes it &#8364;385, which is a considerable and extremely sharp drop from the existing price of &#8364;632. We know now that, for sugar beet specifically, there is a proposed price change to &#8364;25. That is unnecessarily severe. It is a huge drop in price. Many farmers have telephoned me to express their concern about the issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para37"><a name="stpa_37">We have heard about food security. There is a real issue about how it will affect the supply chain. Can we be confident that farmers will not say, &quot;Well, supplying

<br>&nbsp;<br>
sugar beet is just not profitable anymore and I can&#039;t continue to do it&quot;? If that happens, we may find ourselves importing far more sugar beet, despite the fact that we have been producing a huge amount for our own needs, never mind those of other people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para38"><a name="stpa_38">We heard from the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) about compensation. I agree with him that compensation needs to be equitable and that there needs to be a level playing field throughout Europe. He touched on compensation going directly to beet growers. I also agree with him on that point. The rules on the origin of sugar beet need to be transparent and secure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para39"><a name="stpa_39">My key point is about diversification and bioethanol. It is a real opportunity for the Government to produce a strategy that protects farmers and gives them a new outlet for sugar beet. It would enable the Government to say, &quot;We are actually doing something to try to meet our Kyoto and climate change targets.&quot; I was in the Chamber when the Minister who led the debate on climate change and made the winding-up speech kindly agreed to consider the issue of bioethanol. I hope that he will comment on any progress that the Government have made during the past two weeks. It is a real opportunity for Britain to lead the way in Europe. It is said that others, such as Germany, are leading. Well, we can catch up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para40"><a name="stpa_40">Why is it that in Brazil 23 per cent. of cars use some form of biofuel? Why is Brazil leading the way? It is a fine country, but we should be leading the way. We have the technology, the innovation and the capability to establish a leading biofuels industry. Of course, it must be led by the Government, and they need to provide tax breaks and some sort of preferential loan, so that the capital investment can be made by those who wish to be involved in the industry. I hope that the Minister will comment on whether he discussed that issue with oil companies and with the Petrol Retailers Association, because the fuel companies appear to be dragging their feet. They appear to be reluctant to get involved, while everybody else wants to.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para41"><a name="stpa_41">I have a couple of facts to impart before I close my speech. I note that bioethanol can be produced from UK-grown sugar beet and wheat. Bioethanol produces at least 50 per cent. of the carbon emissions produced by petrol. Surely, that is attractive. Use of bioethanol by 5 per cent. of cars in the UK would provide the equivalent carbon saving of taking 1 million cars off the road. Surely, that is attractive. I hope that the Minister will be able to inform us of the progress that the Government are making.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para42"><a name="stpa_42">Allscott is a vital part of the community in The Wrekin. In 2007, Allscott will celebrate its 80th birthday, and I hope that it will be a happy birthday, not an unhappy birthday. There is an issue about the 350 lorries from the plant that travel through my constituency at peak time, and I held discussions with the plant manager on Friday. The company is aware of the issue, and it is addressing some of the local residents&#039; concerns that I raised. However, we welcome Allscott, the jobs that it provides and the spend that it provides in the local community. It is an integral part of Shropshire life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para43"><a name="stpa_43">This is not a matter of either/or; the changes do not mean in extremis the potential demise of the sugar beet industry, its growers and its producers. Let us turn the

matter around and consider it as an opportunity. The change is dramatic, and British Sugar will inevitably make cuts somewhere in the United Kingdom. However, let us be proactive rather than reactive, and let us use this change as an opportunity to diversify into biofuels. Let us do it early and do it now, so that in the transitional period between now and 2008, when there is sadly no review, and up to 2015, there are no casualties among farmers, and in particular, farmers in Shropshire.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50712h01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Christopher Fraser  (South-West Norfolk)</b>  (Con): First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) on securing this debate on a subject on which my predecessor, the right hon. Baroness Shephard, also secured several debates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para44"><a name="stpa_44">The recently announced European Union proposals on reform of the sugar regime will, as my hon. Friend said, have a significant impact on Norfolk and particularly on my constituency. I endorse his comment that the proposed cut in sugar prices will seriously undermine the profitability of many sugar beet growers. The Government&#039;s partial impact assessment on the proposals states that, at &#8364;25 for a tonne of sugar beet, most United Kingdom sugar beet growers will be unprofitable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para45"><a name="stpa_45">I shall repeat the questions that my hon. Friend asked the Minister. How certain are the Government that the sugar beet price will not fall to &#8364;25 a tonne? From the Government&#039;s conversation with British Sugar, how likely do they think it is that British Sugar will pay higher prices to maintain consistency of supply? How many sugar beet growers do the Government believe will remain in the UK after the implementation of the reforms? The EU proposes to compensate growers for 60 per cent. of the price reduction in a single farm payment. It is hoped that that will cushion the impact, but the Minister needs to answer several questions before we know the full implications of those payments. Will the Government guarantee that the sugar beet compensation payment is paid solely to sugar beet growers and not to other farmers, or do the Government intend to dilute the compensation by putting it into the general funds for the single farm payment? How many UK sugar beet growers will remain if the compensation payment is diluted? Does the Minister agree that a fully decoupled payment paid directly to beet growers should be implemented throughout the EU? Will the UK Government prevent other countries from obtaining a competitive advantage by retaining an element of coupled payments?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para46"><a name="stpa_46">In addition to the large number of beet growers in my constituency, there is also the Wissington processing plant, which is one of six such plants operated by British Sugar. That plant, and others at Bury St. Edmonds and elsewhere, process nearly half the UK&#039;s beet crop. Out of the six plants, the Wissington plant is the biggest employer. It directly employs 240 people, but is considered to support another 2,300 jobs indirectly. The EU proposals, however, might threaten the future of that plant and the livelihoods of many people in my constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para47"><a name="stpa_47">British Sugar is the most efficient processor in Europe. It has the lowest processing costs, and might seek to use the restructuring funds offered to reorganise itself. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 197WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Given lower beet supplies and smaller margins, it might seem uneconomic to have six factories. Indeed, without restructuring funds, British Sugar might witness a &#163;90 million fall in annual income. The Government&#039;s own assessment states that British Sugar might want to close one or two of its factories. There might be opportunities in the future for processing raw sugar cane, but the likely location for those processing factories will be alongside ports and waterways and that might benefit the British Sugar plants elsewhere in the country. That puts into question sites such as Wissington.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para48"><a name="stpa_48">What support will the Government provide to people who lose their jobs in the processing industry as a result of these reforms? As has already been mentioned, the future of many beet growers will be determined by whether we can stimulate a domestic bioethanol industry in this country. The new EU payments for energy crops are an important aspect of that. Payments of up to &#8364;45 a hectare would certainly help many of the sugar beet growers in my constituency. That payment, however, is limited throughout Europe to 1.5 million hectares, after which aid is reduced. Will the Minister clarify how much of that payment UK sugar beet farmers are likely to be entitled to? Will countries such as Germany and France take the lion&#039;s share? The Government have reduced the duty on bioethanol, but much more is required to stimulate demand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para49"><a name="stpa_49">The renewable transport fuels obligation will provide an enormous boost to demand for biofuels and bioethanol. There are, however, questions that need to be answered about that. When do the Government expect to make a decision on the renewable transport fuels obligation? Could the Government clarify the pilot project that is due to be introduced in 2006 on duty incentives for encouraging the use of biomass in conventional fuel? What progress have the Government made on deciding whether to use an enhanced capital allowance scheme to encourage biofuel processing plants?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para50"><a name="stpa_50">It is clear that new markets for sugar need to be found. The Government should do all that they can to achieve that. Jobs are at stake, but so too are aspects of the local and wider environment, which the Government appear not yet to have considered.

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50712h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. John Greenway  (Ryedale)</b>  (Con): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) on securing the debate. I confess that I did not expect an opportunity to speak this morning. If the Minister will forgive me, I must chair another meeting, which starts at about five to 11, and I may therefore have to leave just before he concludes his remarks. However, I regard the issue as so important that I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words on it, and to support my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson). I am disappointed that more Labour Members are not here to debate an extremely important issue for UK agriculture and the Government&#039;s whole agriculture policy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para51"><a name="stpa_51">I recognise that the Commission&#039;s proposal in the latest draft policy is a significant improvement. I pay tribute to all those who lobbied vociferously against the

<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 198WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
original proposal, which would have applied quota cuts across the whole of EU production, when no quota cuts could possibly be justified in the United Kingdom.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para52"><a name="stpa_52">It is worth bearing in mind that we have a balanced market in the UK. Roughly 50 per cent. of our sugar needs are met from our domestic sugar beet growing and producing industry, and the other half are met from cane sugar imports that honour obligations that go back generations. It is vital that, as the Government consider what to do about the EU proposals, we should bear in mind not just our farmers&#039; interests but those of the cane sugar producing countries that will equally lose if the price of sugar collapses and the market is made up by imported sugar largely from Brazil.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para53"><a name="stpa_53">We should also keep in mind the fact that there is a difference, as we have been discussing in recent days in the light of the G8 summit, between free trade and fair trade. We should keep in mind what happened in connection with coffee growers. A free trade regime was introduced about a decade ago and many third world producers&#039; economies were decimated. I do not believe that anyone in the Government or the Commission wants that to happen with sugar.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para54"><a name="stpa_54">We should equally recognise that there is a problem. The European Union agriculture industry produces 5 million tonnes of sugar a year more than we need. That is exported, with the benefit of export subsidies, and many of the exports take the form of manufactured products such as confectionery and biscuits. That is unsustainable and must change. The Commission, supported largely by representations that have been made by the industry, has devised a scheme, which it considers provides a realistic prospect of taking out the 5 million tonnes of excess production. Under the restructuring scheme, whole sugar-processing factories will be closed and growers will be compensated proportionately and appropriately.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para55"><a name="stpa_55">It will be difficult, however, to ensure that the efficient industry in the UK and in other member states is maintained while inefficient production is lost. The proposed reference price of &#8364;25, which has been one of the key points of this debate, will not keep efficient UK farmers in production. I endorse entirely what has been said by my colleagues. Sugar beet growers in Ryedale, of whom there are many, say that it is simply uneconomical to grow sugar beet at a price of &#8364;25 per tonne&#151;absolutely insane. They recognise that there must be a cut, but the price needs to be higher than that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para56"><a name="stpa_56">I hope that the Minister will take from this morning&#039;s debate the views of our growers. This debate is important because, while we recognise that the proposals are better than what we had before, they are by no means a perfect solution. Work on the reference price is absolutely vital.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para57"><a name="stpa_57">I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk said and, from a sedentary position, I supported the views in the letter that he read out. Many similar things have been said to me by sugar beet growers in my constituency. The crop not only has provided financial stability for two or three decades during this long period of instability in UK agriculture, particularly for growers, it has also benefited wildlife considerably. The way that we farm our landscape ought to reflect the need for biodiversity as well as the drive for more efficiency, lower prices and greater fairness in world trade.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 199WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para58"><a name="stpa_58">I have time to endorse another couple of points and to raise an issue that has not yet been mentioned. Last week on the Floor of the House, the Foreign Secretary made a statement about the outcome of the EU Council of Ministers and the obvious rows about the future of the common agricultural policy. I said that there must be mandatory decoupling of the restructuring scheme and the compensation arrangements across the whole EU. We must not have the problem that arose with the last round of CAP reform when, in particular, the French took the compensation and paid it to their farmers because of the lower price but then allowed them to continue producing at a lower price.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para59"><a name="stpa_59">If the aim of the proposals is to decrease production by 5 million tonnes, the surplus must be taken out where it is being generated, and that is mainly in France. As I said to the Foreign Secretary, I do not in any way underestimate the political difficulties in doing that, given the current climate. Naturally, the French Government will take a view that is completely contrary to the one that has been expressed this morning. They will speak up for their farmers in the same way that we speak up for ours. They do not want processing plants to close down or growers to be put out of business any more than we do. However, I come back to the fact that, by and large, that is where the surplus is being generated and that is where the problem must be addressed. Therefore, there must be mandatory decoupling of the compensation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para60"><a name="stpa_60">Another issue that has been alluded to is the need to change the reference years proposed by the EU. Because of some of the past restructuring in this country, they would disadvantage our farmers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para61"><a name="stpa_61">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk referred to the proposal to merge the A and B quota&#151;I shall not reiterate the point. That proposal would be very disadvantageous to our farmers, but no one has mentioned an associated issue, which is a thing called the C quota. It is proposed that none of the sugar produced under the C quota should be allowed to be exported, which prompts the question: what on earth are we going to do with it? I hope that the Government accept at least that C quota sugar exports should be allowed up to the European Union&#039;s World Trade Organisation volume ceiling, which is, I believe, just over 1.27 million tonnes. Without that, the market will destabilise further. As we saw last year when there was a drought, the amount of sugar produced can drop below that of average years. Who knows what will happen this year? The size and sugar content of the crop varies from year to year, and the system must be flexible enough to deal with that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para62"><a name="stpa_62">I hope that all these points will be taken on board by the Minister and the Government as they embark on the negotiations, which will surely be complex, detailed and difficult. I hope that our comments today will help the Minister and his colleagues in those negotiations.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) on securing the debate on this issue, which is extremely important not just for his constituency, but for the majority of the farming community in East Anglia. I represent the fens of Cambridgeshire. The whole of the fens region, stretching from the Minister&#039;s constituency in north Lincolnshire down to Cambridge, is the primary beet-growing area of the country. Anything that jeopardises the successful growing of sugar beet in that region strikes at the economic hearts of farmers there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para63"><a name="stpa_63">Our farmers want to ensure that the Minister and the Government will negotiate as vigorously as possible on their behalf, and to ensure that our interests and growers&#039; interests are paramount in their thinking. I understand that the issue must be seen in the context of the Government&#039;s overall position on CAP reform, but it makes no sense for my constituents seriously to affect the economic viability of beet growing in our region if by decimating that local growing, we encourage the decimation of rainforests in places such as Brazil to grow cane sugar. Of course, that would not even benefit local growers there, because it would be funded by foreign money&#151;probably American bank money&#151;and would lead to other severe problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para64"><a name="stpa_64">I have received many letters from my growers, many of whom are in despair. Mr. Bill Burton of White Fen farm in Benwick wrote to me saying that having perused the proposals for sugar reform, he believes that British growers will get the worst possible deal all round, and that it could well signal the death knell of our sugar beet industry. The Government must give some sort of encouragement to our farmers that they will be even-handed in their negotiations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para65"><a name="stpa_65">I have a letter from Lord Whitty that was written before the recent negotiation position&#151;when he was the Minister for Food, Farming and Sustainable Energy&#151;in which he replies pretty positively to questions about discrimination against UK growers. I hope that the Minister will endorse that view in his response. In the letter, Lord Whitty says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;We will certainly be looking for reforms which result in fair terms of competition for all concerned and give UK growers the opportunity to benefit from their relative efficiency . . . But we will seek to ensure that any necessary reductions&quot;&#151;</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;are made on a rational and transparent basis consistent with our wider reform objectives.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para67"><a name="stpa_67">The letter goes on to say that DEFRA commissioned independent economic research that suggested that some 20,000 people are employed throughout the industry. I dispute that figure. It is not clear whether those people are directly employed in the production of beet, or whether the figure includes everyone who works on a farm that grows the crop.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para68"><a name="stpa_68">The research also found that the impact of lower prices would be offset by the ability of many growers to switch to other crops and to increase productivity in a more genuinely competitive market. I do not know where that research came from&#151;it would be interesting to have it published&#151;but farmers in my constituency would oppose that switch very strongly. Arable farmers are under incredible pressure, and have been for the past few years, from changes to the CAP, the price that they receive for their wheat and the strong pound. I could go on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para69"><a name="stpa_69">Sugar beet is a fundamental cash crop for many arable farmers. If it is removed from the equation, arable farming as a whole will be under severe pressure. The Minister must tell us and farmers what future they have if that fundamental cash crop is taken from them. There is every sign in the present negotiated position that our farmers will be the ones who will carry the can. They believe that that is unfair.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para70"><a name="stpa_70">It has been suggested that the French, who produce 150 per cent. of their sugar needs, should be the ones under closer scrutiny, but our farmers, who produce only 50 per cent. of our sugar needs, are the ones who seem to be carrying the can. It will therefore be interesting to see how the Minister answers the many questions that we put to him today. I hope that he will give some reassurance to the growers in my constituency.

Members of my agricultural entry in the Register of Members&#039; Interests, although there will have been substantial changes in the climate and economy when we start growing sugar beet in the area that I represent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para71"><a name="stpa_71">I place on record my admiration for the remarks made by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) and his resolute defence of the sugar beet industry in his area. Whatever the faults of the sugar regime, it should be said that the farmers who have operated under it and the processors who have processed the beet have done so most efficiently, and that the industry has become one of the most efficient sugar beet industries in Europe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para72"><a name="stpa_72">The hon. Gentleman mentioned food security, a subject that is close to my heart but one that has been unfashionable for several years. Food security is the reason why sugar beet was first established in this country. People are impatient for sugar. Indeed, they become very irritable if they do not have their sugar. It was important for this country to produce at least a certain amount of sugar, although we are still a net importer of it, unlike France and other countries in the European Union.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para73"><a name="stpa_73">Food security will be of concern when political instability and climate change do not allow us to predict how much food this planet will produce in the next 10 or 20 years. Any Government will take great care to ensure that at least a certain amount of the food that this nation needs is produced here in this country by the farmers who have shown in the past that they can produce it and who will, I am sure, show that they can do so in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para74"><a name="stpa_74">In the past few frenetic weeks, it has seemed that one could propose any reform, renegotiation or even abolition of the agricultural policy and that it was bound to be a good thing. It would help the environment, the consumer, the third world and almost any other organisation that cared to be interested in it. Yet as soon as there is fundamental change to a particular regime, such as the sugar regime, it quickly becomes apparent that certain aspects of our life will suffer, whether it is the farmers who grow the sugar beet or the processors who process it.

<p>
<a name="50712h01_para75"><a name="stpa_75">Indeed, they are part of an interdependent economic unit, because without the sugar beet growers, there will be no factories, which would obviously lead to unemployment. Other interests will suffer, too, and that is certainly true of the environment. As several hon. Members have said, sugar beet is an important spring-summer crop, which contributes to the over-wintering of several important bird species.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para76"><a name="stpa_76">The changes will also affect those ACP countries that entered into the sugar obligation a long time ago. They knew that they had a ready market for their sugar in the UK and the EU and that the price was profitable. The reduction of that price puts their standard of living and their prospects of developing their industry under threat.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para77"><a name="stpa_77">This is a convoluted problem. CAP reform is a complex issue, as we can see from the sugar regime, and the Minister would do well to follow through some of the consequences. The National Trust noted only last week that the profitability of its tenanted farms in the national parks was under great threat, so we could lose landscapes and biodiversity, too. The Minister must follow through the consequences of the proposed action.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para78"><a name="stpa_78">I, too, am concerned that we should keep a viable sugar beet industry in this country. We have been told that a 30 per cent. price reduction could be just about bearable for British beet growers, but that depends very much on the monetary and exchange rate circumstances, and small changes in them could make sugar beet completely unviable in this country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para79"><a name="stpa_79">We need more time to ensure not only that sugar beet growers and processors in this country can adjust to the proposals, but that third world countries&#151;particularly those involved in the sugar protocol&#151;can adjust to them. I therefore have a two-pronged request for the Minister; let us make sure not only that everyone agrees to the changes in the sugar regime, but that the people whose interests are bound up with those changes are taken into consideration.

It is also very timely, because the long negotiation process will begin next week at the Council of Agriculture Ministers. This is a critical time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para80"><a name="stpa_80">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) that the price is too low; that is the most fundamental problem that we face. The issue goes back some time. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk is a military historian and will know that the naval blockade that resulted from our success at the battle of Trafalgar, which we celebrated last week, led Napoleon to heavily subsidise sugar beet in France.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para81"><a name="stpa_81">Our message to the Government is that the UK is the good guy in this. We produce only 55 per cent. of what we consume and take the rest from the less developed countries, so we are not the problem. It is the EU that has an obvious problem because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale said, the present arrangements are unsustainable. Under the Uruguay round, the WTO 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
allowed Europe to export 1 million tonnes of sugar, but it has been exporting 5 million tonnes. It is not us who have been producing that surplus; it is the French, and it is they who should take the pain. As my constituent Mr. Frank, from Morton, near Oswestry, said,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;we only grow 55 per cent. of our needs of sugar, whereas countries such as France grow well over their sugar requirements&#151;thus swamping the world market . . . Surely if there are cuts to be made, they should come from countries that are over producing.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para82"><a name="stpa_82">If we are not to reduce quotas and are to depend entirely on the price mechanism, we must have a level playing field, something that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk mentioned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para83"><a name="stpa_83">With respect to France, what assurances can the Minister give us that in his negotiations he will consider the lack of a level playing field? Already, French farmers have significant benefits. There are soft loans; French farmers&#039; co-operatives do not pay corporation tax; there are significant grants. Above all, they have not decoupled. It is nonsense to go through the reform if France has not decoupled and if we treat sugar as purely a food product in an open market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para84"><a name="stpa_84">I should be grateful if the Minister dealt with that point. In recent years sugar has been the only profitable crop for arable farmers. They have not made money on grain, but they have on beet. How many farmers does the Minister think will be able to make a profit at &#163;17 a tonne, when many of my constituents tell me that &#163;18 is the absolute minimum break-even price?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para85"><a name="stpa_85">I am concerned about details of the proposal, which is better than what was presented to us originally. I agree with my hon. Friends that the price change is too drastic, and too quick. That view is even endorsed by British Sugar, which buys the material. It says that &#163;25 for beet is unnecessarily severe to meet the EU&#039;s objectives and would risk damaging even the most efficient industries in Europe, of which we are one, of course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para86"><a name="stpa_86">One of the details that I do not understand is a production levy, which was originally charged to help exports in the event of excess. As I understand the proposal, we shall not be exporting excess. Why is there still a production levy? There is a flexibility clause allowing for a further 10 per cent. reduction in the minimum beet price. Why is that still in the proposal? Why does the Commission not give real recognition to the legitimate interests of growers? Why are they not involved in the restructuring scheme?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50712h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk)</b>  (Con): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way; he is making an extremely strong case. Is he aware that in Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire many of the growers are running not large farms but small farms? Many are county council smallholders in my constituency and in that of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss). They would go out of business if the proposals were to go through in the shape that we fear they might take if the Government do not listen.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50712h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Paterson </b> : I endorse that comment, coming as I do from Shropshire, where there are also many small growers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para87"><a name="stpa_87">The point that I am making is that although the process that we are considering is inevitable&#151;it is inevitable that the world sugar price will be approached 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 204WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
by EU growers, and the export of the excesses is not sustainable&#151;the move that is proposed is one huge hit. This one sudden move will cause enormous damage across British farming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para88"><a name="stpa_88">The matter of the A and B quota was mentioned. Again, I want to know why we will be hit by that. What will the Minister do in negotiations to ensure that we are not discriminated against on the price change and the jiggling with the quotas? I endorse the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale; what will happen to the C quota production now? Where will it go?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para89"><a name="stpa_89">I want quickly to discuss the fact that there are other things that one can do with sugar. What discussions has the Minister had with the monopoly processor? It is set to benefit from many of the restructuring arrangements. What is to stop it closing down production here and importing molasses or half-processed material from other countries? We know that British Sugar has invested quite heavily in Poland and is already producing 200,000 tonnes of sugar there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para90"><a name="stpa_90">Will the Minister comment on the EU animal feed regulations? Until recently, sugar beet pulp has been a profitable product. It has now become a cost to the processors and has to be cross-subsidised by sugar production. A further consequence of new regulations is that beet washings have become excessively costly to remove. What discussions has the Minister had with the Commission about that? It is another extra cost that makes processing in this country less interesting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para91"><a name="stpa_91">As to the position of the processors, I am as concerned as my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) about the future of Allscott, which is now the only plant on the western side of the country. If Allscott is not to have a role in the production of sugar and given the Government&#039;s history with Milk Marque, which was smashed up although it had only 38 per cent. of the market, in comparison to British Sugar&#039;s 100 per cent., what will the view of the Government be should farmers&#039; co-operatives be set up with a view to taking over processing plant and possibly getting into biofuel?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para92"><a name="stpa_92">It is extraordinary that the Government have not grasped the chance to get into biofuel; they would have all-party support if they did so. We do not have to eat sugar, we can do other useful things with it. The former Energy Minister Brian Wilson pointed out in an interesting recent article that Tesco is bringing in biofuel, but is transporting it in carbon-fuelled vehicles. Would it not be more sensible to produce it here, in plants that are currently producing a food product?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para93"><a name="stpa_93">I am pleased to say that my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), who is at the great Yorkshire show today, is to press the Government again for the introduction of a road transport fuel obligation. Sugar beet is part of a broader picture. I do not understand why the Government are holding back on doing something that would have very wide support, instead of pouring money into wind farms. The average 2.2 MW turbine gets about &#163;438,000 subsidy a year, a dramatic subsidy for a system that is only 30 per cent. or so efficient. It has been done in Sweden. I am told that in Stockholm, biofuel cars are not subject to congestion charge and attract reduced vehicle excise duty and fuel duty. Such a measure would have overwhelming support, and would be a legitimate use of the beet product.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para94"><a name="stpa_94">If I may touch on the technology that dare not speak its name, have the Government considered the merits of planting GM beet as a fuel crop, strictly for non-human consumption? What would be the savings on inputs? Figures given in <i>Farmers Weekly</i> a couple of weeks ago showed that major savings could be made. If it were used strictly for fuel rather than for human consumption, would there be merit in it? Have the Government a view? Have they discussed the issue with the Commission?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para95"><a name="stpa_95">Moving on to the environment and picking up the East Anglian connection, I think that &quot;Turnip&quot; Townshend, who established that a break crop is needed, came from that area. There are real benefits for the environment. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds points out that half the world&#039;s population of pink-footed geese winter in north-west Norfolk and on the broads, and they depend on grazing the tops of sugar beet after harvest for winter food. It also mentions lapwings, skylarks and other birds.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50712h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Bill Olner  </b> (in the Chair): Order. The hon. Gentleman must give the Minister a chance to respond.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"><a name="50712h01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Paterson </b> : I shall be brief. There is a clear environmental benefit in growing sugar beet. There is also a distant environmental benefit in that we would not damage rain forests such as the Cerrado, as mentioned by the RSPB.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para96"><a name="stpa_96">In brief, we have a good story to tell. We do not contribute to the surplus, we have a crop that provides employment&#151;as we heard from Allscott&#151;and a food, which is required but which could be used in other ways. What the Minister is proposing to the Commission is too drastic and too quick. We all know where we want to get to, but he should consider the amenity benefit&#151;people go to Norfolk to look at the birds&#151;and the general environmental benefit. All that would be thrown away if reform were too hurried and too drastic.
</p>


<a name="time_8">
<a name="50712h01_time8"><h5>10.48 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_23"><a name="50712h01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Climate Change and the Environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley) </b> : I will do my best to respond to what has been a wide-ranging and very knowledgeable debate. The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) has a great interest in the issue, and put his case very well and comprehensively. As many hon. Members have mentioned, the matter is complex and as it has arisen under the UK presidency, we want to address it and to make progress. The debate is timely because many of the issues have not yet been resolved, even within the framework of the Commission proposals, which I, like the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), welcome. They are a considerable improvement on previous ones.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para97"><a name="stpa_97">To pick up on what the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said, it is important for our growers that the Commission has moved away from compulsory quota cuts&#151;that would disadvantage a country such as this, which is not producing a surplus of beet sugar&#151;and towards voluntary exits, with compensation. The more efficient growers will have the greater opportunities. That is exactly what we want from the changes. Our

<br>&nbsp;<br>
sector is efficient, so if the regime is based on efficiency, our sector should benefit from it. That should be one of the central tenets of the reorganisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para98"><a name="stpa_98">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping), who apologised that he could not stay to the end, that there needs to be an equal approach across Europe and that there should be decoupling, as other hon. Members said. That is a sensible suggestion and the Government are sympathetic to it. The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said, quite fairly, that there were differences of view on the sugar regime. Although it has been beneficial to many farmers, including those in my constituency in north Lincolnshire, there has been a downside to the sugar regime, particularly on the processing side. We have heard the views of other hon. Members who represent processing areas, especially where confectionery is involved, about the impact that a world price of sugar three times the average has on processing in this country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para99"><a name="stpa_99">It is important to remember that the existing regime is estimated to cost EU consumers and taxpayers nearly &#163;5 billion a year, less than half of which is transferred as benefits to beet growers and processors, which is one of the problems with the common agricultural policy. The result is a welfare loss to the EU economy of about &#163;3 billion a year. In the UK, the net annual economic cost is estimated to be more than &#163;500 million. Therefore, although I do not dispute that there are potential impacts on the sugar beet sector, as is outlined in the regulatory impact assessment by the Cambridge university study that DEFRA commissioned, there is a balance to be struck. We must try to seek that balance, taking into account the impacts on the sugar beet industry and the growers, as well as on the wider economy and our aspirations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para100"><a name="stpa_100">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk mentioned moving to a free market, which, as I said, will benefit our growers. He also mentioned biofuels, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood and the hon. Members for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard), for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser), for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) and for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson); a wide spread, which demonstrates the interest in the issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para101"><a name="stpa_101">I am enthusiastic about biofuels. As the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk knows, we are in a climate change review, which is considering the various methods, policy options and economic tools that we can apply in this country to achieve our target, which is a 20 per cent. reduction of CO <sub>2</sub>  by 2010. Biofuels feature in that review. Also, the Department for Transport is conducting a detailed review on the workings of a biofuel obligation. That report will be published in the not-too-distant future, and will guide and inform the overall climate change review, which will be published in November. We take the issue seriously and are considering the options.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para102"><a name="stpa_102">Even with the reforms suggested, however, the price of sugar will still be twice the world average. That is probably not helpful to our sugar beet growers serving the biofuel industry, because they will be competing with ethanol, which will be entering the country at lower prices. It is important that we should have an 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 207WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
infrastructure of processing and sales that will help our growers to enter that market, which I believe can be done. However, the risk of large-scale imports into this country remains, which is why I would say that, in answer to the questions about the study and the biofuels obligation, we must consider the implications. We would not want the obligation to be pitched at a level that would shut out our domestic market and allow imports to dominate. Things will difficult enough as it is, but we want our producers to have a share of that market. That is part of the studies that are being conducted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para103"><a name="stpa_103">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest asked about the wider issue of CAP changes. He asked about planning, and we are certainly trying to address that in terms of diversification. He also mentioned problems with digital maps. We accept that there are problems and we are trying to resolve them as quickly as possible, as it is important for those applying for the new entry level schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para104"><a name="stpa_104">The hon. Member for The Wrekin asked whether we were talking to British Sugar. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have contact with the company at the highest level. He will understand that it is not for me to say what will happen; the provision of factories and jobs are matters for British Sugar. Factory closures are not a new phenomenon in the sugar sector. Rationalisation has been going on for many years; for instance, it resulted in the loss of the factory at Brigg in my constituency. Those are commercial decisions for the company.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"><a name="50712h01_spnew22"><b> Mark Pritchard </b> : I wonder whether the Minister feels that the proposals are more or less likely to lead to casualties and factory closures. If he thinks it more likely, will the sword be likely to come down on the east coast or the west coast?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50712h01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : As I said, that is a matter for the company, not the Government. They are commercial decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para105"><a name="stpa_105">The impact of reform on prices, too, is largely hypothetical. I return to the fact that reform that is open and transparent, and based on the efficiency of growers, should be in the UK&#039;s interests. That is what we want to pursue. Representations on the time scale are a matter

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
for consideration, but the WTO has made a ruling on the sugar regime and we are under some obligation to deal with it. We want to deal with it in a way that is sustainable rather than impose a fix that might last only two or three years. If we did the latter, we would have to do it all over again; that would not be good for the industry either. It is far better that we address the issue properly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para106"><a name="stpa_106">Many hon. Members asked about compensation. It was rightly said that growers will be compensated by 60 per cent. of income. I might have misheard the hon. Member for North Shropshire, but I can tell him that the production levy will go. In some cases that can be 40 per cent. of the cost; it is a high proportion, and it will make a big difference. The proposal is that compensation will go into the single farm payments. It has not yet been decided how it will be structured, so we have the opportunity to take account of various factors. We will of course be listening to the industry and taking account of its views.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para107"><a name="stpa_107">Several hon. Members, including the hon. Members for Ryedale and for North-East Cambridgeshire, spoke about Brazil. It is often said, wrongly, that the regime will not change the arrangements on tariff access for sugar from Brazil. I emphasise that the changes in the regime will not necessarily bring any more imports from Brazil, nor will they have further detrimental effects on what Brazil is doing in relation to its rain forests. The tariffs will not change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para108"><a name="stpa_108">An action plan will be put in place to assist ACP countries with the transition. However, even with the reforms, sugar will still be twice the world average price. For some countries&#151;for instance, Swaziland has featured recently&#151;sugar is still a big earner. There will still be opportunities for such countries. Indeed, the reforms will allow increased access for those who can take up the utilisation of other ACP countries that will be withdrawing from the scheme; that will give further opportunities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h01_para109"><a name="stpa_109">Time does not allow me to answer all the points that were raised this morning, but I hope that I have dealt with the key issues. It is a timely debate. Much discussion and negotiation about the exact shape of the reform will take place under the EU presidency, and the knowledgeable and perfectly reasonable points that have been made will be taken into account in those negotiations.

<a name="50712h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Women and Pensions</h3>
<a name="time_9">
<a name="50712h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50712h02_spnew0"><b> Vera Baird  (Redcar)</b>  (Lab): Since 1997 women&#039;s equality with men has improved by leaps and bounds. We have seen the introduction of the minimum wage, much improved maternity pay and longer leave, and flexible working and child care, and soon there will be a duty on public authorities to promote gender equality. That has been done in pursuit of a genuine commitment to fairness and gender equality, which is part of our Government&#039;s commitment to equalities as a whole. Those ideologically driven developments have established an economic and social matrix that is fairer and more equitable than it was. Pensions are now the last untackled gender inequality issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para0"><a name="stpa_110">The state pension scheme is unfair to women. It treats women differently from and worse than men specifically because they are women. It is unbelievable that in the 21st century in the UK, after eight years of our own Labour Government, that highly discriminatory pension system left over from an earlier era still exists. It forces the majority of women, who constitute, of course, the majority of pensioners, to survive either on a dependency income of 60 per cent. of their husband&#039;s income, or on what they can get back if, despite the discrimination inherent in the system, they have managed to pay national insurance at some time during their lives, which are characteristically split between working and caring. The net consequence is that many women are in poverty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para1"><a name="stpa_111">It is excellent that pension credit has brought 1.3 million women pensioners out of poverty, but they were able to be brought out of poverty only because they were in it in the first place. Two thirds of pensioners are    women, so we are discriminating against the majority of pensioners, because women&#039;s income in their pensionable years is two thirds that of men. One huge reason why that is so, and what I want to speak about today, is that whereas 92 per cent. of men retire with a full basic state pension, only 16 per cent. of women have a basic state pension in their own right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para2"><a name="stpa_112">That figure swells somewhat if we consider the dependency element. If a woman is widowed, she can replace her national insurance record with that of her husband. However, a woman who is divorced at the time she retires can replace her paltry NI record with her former husband&#039;s only for the years that she was married to him. A woman who is widowed and remarries loses the dependency benefit from her first husband and takes on only the NI credits of the second husband for as long as they are together. If a woman is never married, she gets nothing at all unless she managed to build up some sort of record of her own, but only 16 per cent. of women are able to do that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para3"><a name="stpa_113">That is one example of how the Beveridge system&#151;the discriminatory system that I am talking about&#151;has always been inequitable to women, assuming as it does a male breadwinner and female dependent carer. Entitlement is haphazardly linked to life events that are out of one&#039;s control. In today&#039;s modern society, that dependency model does not work, as the figures show. Many women are in poverty in retirement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para4"><a name="stpa_114">More women work now, but their working lives are far more complicated than those of men and the Beveridge model of a working person, which requires 44 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 210WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
years of unbroken full-time service&#151;or very near to that&#151;for a man and 39 for a woman does not fit women any better than the dependency model does. In fact, there is no model of modern pension provision in UK society that fits the patterns of women&#039;s lives. That is precisely why the current system is discriminatory.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para5"><a name="stpa_115">In a recent article in <i>The Guardian, </i>Jackie Ashley stated the problem this way:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;Women have . . . entered the labour market and are vigorously encouraged by politicians to do so. Yet they have rarely been callous enough to shrug off all their traditional caring roles, for children and elderly relatives, and so they tend to work shorter hours than men, and . . . for a mix of different employers, with catastrophic effects on their . . . pension entitlement.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para6"><a name="stpa_116">These days women are carers and workers at the same time. An Equal Opportunities Commission poll earlier this year showed that four out of five people asked felt that carers should have the same state pension rights as if they had been in paid work throughout that period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para7"><a name="stpa_117">There has, of course, been an attempt to give credit to people&#151;overwhelmingly women&#151;who care for children. Home responsibilities protection was brought in by the late, great Barbara Castle in 1978. However, it is not a weekly credit that gives the equivalent of a stamp for every week that someone looks after a child. What it does is reduce by a year the number of years for which a person must work to qualify for a basic state pension. It works only for full years, so if someone with a child at home thinks that it is time that she tried out a job and works for a couple of weeks but does not like it, she might make NICs for those weeks, but the price is that she loses her HRP, because that works only in terms of a whole year. Similarly, if a woman goes back to work 10 months after having a baby, as people are urged to do, she might get some stamps for the couple of months left in the year for which she worked, but she does not get home responsibilities protection because she has not been not working for a whole year. The problem arises in all kinds of situations. Children often need transitional support, as when they are changing schools and so on, and women are frequently in and out of work. Often the net effect is that for many years they are theoretically covered by the credit, but in fact they are receiving little credit and paying some NICs but not enough.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para8"><a name="stpa_118">If the child is ill or disabled, they need even more support and the woman&#039;s work pattern is likely to be even more fragmented. That brings me on to carers, not just of children but of older people. A quarter of women between the ages of 45 and 64 are carers and 90 per cent. of carers are women. There is something called carer&#039;s credit, but that, too, is imperfect. It works by being passported to the carer through disability living allowance, which is available only to a person who needs 35 hours of care a week. So the person being cared for gets the DLA if they need 35 hours care a week and then passports the carer through to get their carer&#039;s credit. But what if the disabled person needs 30 hours care a week, or 20 hours, or if, as is often the case, two sisters share the care of a disabled parent? What if there are two parents to care for and one woman moves between the two? What happens then is that she gets no carer&#039;s credit. If a woman does part-time caring and has a part-time job because&#151;no matter how skilled she is&#151;she is unable to do a full-time job because of her caring, or if she earns below the lower earnings limit, to which I will

refer in a minute, she will not make a contribution to her pension through national insurance, she will not get a credit from the state because she is below the lower earnings limit, and she will not get carer&#039;s credit, despite the fact that it is the caring that prevents her from working full-time. Indeed, it does not matter if the woman is caring part-time and doing two part-time jobs because earnings cannot be aggregated to bring earnings above the lower earnings limit. So, even though she may be working far more than 35 hours a week, she will not be able to get a contribution to her pension.

<p>
<a name="50712h02_para9"><a name="stpa_119">Let me explain what I have just implied about the lower earnings limit. If a person works in a job that pays below the lower earnings limit, that person is not credited with a contribution and does not pay a contribution. The real hardship arises because, first, the limit is probably set too high and, secondly, if a person is working in two jobs, the earnings from both jobs cannot be aggregated to bring their earnings over the LEL. That is a common pattern, at least in Redcar: large numbers of women work on things such as school dinners while the kids are at school and then, when their partner comes home in the evening, they go out to work in a convenience store or a pub. Those women have two jobs and also care for the children. They are very much employed full-time but it is to the peril of the accrual of their pension contributions.

How can it be changed so that the full pension is obtained more frequently? There is a provision that states that contributions by an individual adding up to anything less than to 10 years&#039; worth are simply not counted. A person can contribute for nine and a half years and get no pension whatever. How can that be made better?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para11"><a name="stpa_121">I suppose that home responsibilities protection could be changed to a weekly credit, so that while a woman was caring for a child aged under 16 the credit would genuinely replace the contribution through national insurance that she would be paying if she worked. I suppose that the quarter or the 10 years could be counted, given that there is no reason to leave it out&#151;it used to be said that it was difficult to add up such small amounts and that the effort was not merited. I suppose that the LEL could be lowered. What I say to the government is: will they do all three, please? And will they do so now, without prejudicing any future plans?

<a name="50712h02_para12"><a name="stpa_122">Solving the carers problem is much more difficult, as the examples I have given show. What is a carer?

meal every night and I take her to the hospital a couple of times a week, does that make me a carer? It is difficult to find a way of getting better credits for carers, because of the difficulty of defining a carer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para13"><a name="stpa_123">The other problem with trying to improve credits so that more women can obtain a full basic state pension is that such a change would take effect from only now on. If we changed the credits today, it would be 39 years before a woman could accrue a full basic state pension on the same basis as a man, because she would be receiving credit weekly while she was working or caring. That is a long time&#151;a couple of generations&#151;to wait. Between 2010 and 2020, the pension age will be increased by a further five years, so women will have to wait 44 years before those changes come into effect and give them a fair crack of the whip.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para14"><a name="stpa_124">The other side of that coin is that unless we change the system, when the change to the pension age is introduced between 2010 and 2020, women will have to go on for five more years before they can draw their measly pension, and they will have the same inadequate opportunities as they have now to put one together. At the latest, we must improve women&#039;s pension rights by the time that change occurs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para15"><a name="stpa_125">If it is difficult to see how to put the credits right, if it is necessary to do so retrospectively in order to be fair so that I and the other women present can benefit, and if it is difficult to see how we can possibly do that for carers, what do we do? If we decide to credit in the men and women who are carers and the people&#151;overwhelmingly women&#151;who care for children, as the public think we should, who do we decide to leave out of the group who receive a basic state pension? Although I appreciate that the contributory system is well respected and highly thought of, should we get away from the contribution system as the basis of pension eligibility and instead consider some sort of universality?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para16"><a name="stpa_126">I pay tribute to the pension credit for having helped 1.3 million women, but it helped them because they were poor. There are even problems with that system for women, however. First, it is means-tested, and women who have worked their whole lives, or who have been in and out of working and caring, should not need to be means-tested. Secondly, the pension credit is unfair to savers. As people know, if somebody receives a full basic state pension and has &#163;20 a week income from other savings, they are allowed the pension credit up to &#163;109 a week; however, they receive the pension credit from &#163;79 of the basic state pension right up to &#163;109, and therefore lose the benefit of their savings, because that amount is paid to them through the pension credit and they would receive the same amount even if they did not have their savings capital. In addition, there is a taper, so that all savings above the basic state pension level are kept in some proportion that tapers away but that does not happen to savings below that level. If I, a typical woman, have 70 per cent. of the basic state pension&#151;about &#163;50&#151;and have the same &#163;20 a week from some other income that I manage to scrape together despite my hardship, I will rightly and properly be paid from my &#163;50 right up to the pension credit level, which will be welcome, but I will lose the entire benefit of my &#163;20 savings income because the taper does not work until savings are above basic state pension level, so they just disappear. That is a final injustice.

<p>
<a name="50712h02_para17"><a name="stpa_127">A further point is that people are starting to appreciate more widely that pension credit cannot go on for ever. More and more people will get it because it is, commendably, earnings linked, whereas the basic state pension and many private pension pots are not. Therefore, more people will be drawn into means-tested benefits&#151;probably a distortion&#151;and the way forward is likely to be seen to be some sort of shift to improve the basic state pension. However, unless the availability of the basic state pension is broadened to include the women of whom I speak, that will be of no use to them.

<a name="50712h02_para18"><a name="stpa_128">If the Tories had won the last election, they would have index linked the basic state pension to get people out of pension credit, but they would not have index linked the pension credit; they would have linked that only to the cost of living, which would have meant that women, who are far and away the major recipients of pension credit, would become poorer and poorer for want of that basic state pension. The BSP is the foundation on which to build whole retirement provision. It is the only way in which realistically to redistribute income to pensioners and is the only clear route to obtaining pension coverage for time spent out of paid employment to raise children and care for others.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para20"><a name="stpa_130">My hon. and learned Friend gave a comprehensive account of an extremely technical issue. Sometimes when discussing pensions we become so frustrated by the necessary use of statistics and technical jargon that we lose sight of the real importance of the debate. The reality is simple: we are talking about poverty among older people in our society&#151;people who by definition are not in a position to change their income structures or to establish new pension rights, and who are often unable to continue to support themselves through the normal means of work because such opportunities have disappeared as age, and sometimes health, dictate that the world of work is no longer accessible to them.

scandal. Women&#039;s retirement income is, in round terms, only half that of men. That is such an enormous disparity in our society that it makes even figures about the pay differential seem almost trivial&#151;although I do not want to trivialise the gap between men and women&#039;s pay. Pensions show an enormous gap, which we need to begin to do something serious about.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"><a name="50712h02_spnew4"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): Does my hon. Friend agree that poverty among women pensioners is strongly linked to the inequitable treatment of women in the workplace? In full-time work women earn 82 per cent. of what men earn, and in part-time work that figure is 60 per cent. In her working life, a woman of average skills will earn &#163;240,000 less than a typical man. That figure rises to &#163;380,000 if she has two children during that period. Pensioner poverty starts in the workplace.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"><a name="50712h02_spnew5"><b> Tony Lloyd </b> : My hon. Friend is right. In fact, he invites me to move immediately on to a subject about which I would have said a little later. In the end, one of the fundamentals of eroding the pensions differential is eroding the pay differential and making sure that future generations benefit from equal pay and proper equalisation of the opportunity to provide for pensions. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar has already clearly pointed out, even if we do something now, it will take 40 years for the effect to be seen. We have to do something not only about the pay differential, but about existing pensions and the people who have been in the pension system throughout their working or caring lives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para22"><a name="stpa_132">My hon. and learned Friend made an interesting point about the role of women throughout their adult years. The traditional view of the role of women has changed enormously in modern society. I say with all charity to my hon. Friend the Minister for Pensions Reform that one of the difficulties of plotting out how to resolve the problem is that we are dealing with people whose lifestyles over a period of 40 years have become increasingly complicated. No longer do we have the stereotypical housewife who stays at home looking after the kids, or perhaps looking after elderly relatives, but neither do we have the brave new world of the total career woman. Neither exist. The reality in Manchester, Central, as in Redcar, is that many of my constituents have lifestyles that are much more complicated. At least one friend of mine is a double carer, who cares for two different relatives and tries to do some part-time work. She falls foul of all the rules&#151;the lower earnings limit and the 35 hours caring threshold&#151;because such things are not cumulative. A serious attempt to join up people&#039;s contributions in life would consider people who care but do not hit the requisite number of hours. It would acknowledge that people who work in more than one job are not untypical, particularly in the more socially deprived parts of modern Britain. If we could make some efforts in that respect, we could make a significant and material difference to the incomes, and therefore the lifestyles, of many of our fellow citizens.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para23"><a name="stpa_133">My hon. and learned Friend has set out the subject well.

schemes, and less time in the sort of work that earns pension entitlement. Those things will not go away. Women will not stop being carers, and although we should be trying to make real progress, we are not going to solve the pay differential or give equal access to labour market overnight. However, it would be dishonest to say that we have to wait for those problems to resolve themselves before we deal properly with pensions. We need pragmatism and early hits in pension entitlement.

It is important that the subject be considered at the very top of the political system, but I urge the Government to deal with it now.

<a name="50712h02_para25"><a name="stpa_135">Pension equalisation is long overdue. It will take a long time to achieve it, but we must regard it as a national priority. It is a scandal that so many people who have contributed to our society for many years and who are emotionally and rationally valuable to our political systems live in poverty. We have practically abandoned them because of the incompetence of our pension regimes in the past. We must deal with the situation now. We have the opportunity to do so. The political space exists, as does the Government&#039;s interest. If we do not ensure that women and pensions are an integral part of the pension changes on which the Government are consulting, we will miss an opportunity to resolve the issue in this era and for a long time to come.

She set out very clearly the scale of the problem and the huge inequality in pension provision for current women pensioners, which is likely to be pretty similar for women who are now over 50 and are therefore likely to be pensioners within the next 15 years.

<a name="50712h02_para27"><a name="stpa_137">I shall not repeat the points made by my hon. and learned Friend, but shall instead highlight the fact that the problem will continue for women who are currently aged under 50. The Government seem to believe that, although there is a problem for current women pensioners and for women over 50, the changes occurring in the labour market will mean that the problem will gradually diminish as women gain better access to the labour market.

<p>
<a name="50712h02_para28"><a name="stpa_138">I do not want to downplay the effect of the changes introduced by the Government to improve equality for women. The equal pay legislation, the outlawing of discrimination against women, the increased provision for maternity leave and maternity allowance, and the whole emphasis on improving child care provision, which helps parents&#151;notably women, but not exclusively so&#151;have all helped women to balance their working and domestic commitments better.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para29"><a name="stpa_139">All those things are incredibly important, and they are likely to mean that the gap in male and female earnings, which is still large, should improve in time. Even with all those changes, however, I do not believe that the gap between male and female earnings will be closed in the foreseeable future. That is because caring responsibilities, although they are now shared between men and women more than they were in the past, are not shared equally; nor are they ever likely to be. Caring responsibilities are the major contributor to the fact that women&#039;s earnings are less than those of men.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para30"><a name="stpa_140">Women in full-time also work earn less than men. The figure that I have is 75 per cent., although my hon. and learned Friend had a higher figure. We will not argue about the precise numbers, however, because we both agree that women in full-time work earn less than men in full-time work. One contributory factor is that women who take time out to have children are disadvantaged when they return to work. They tend to have poorer promotion prospects than men because their working career is shorter and they often take time out at crucial points in their career, when their male counterparts are just beginning to mount the promotion ladder. Women who take time out therefore find it difficult to get back in again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para31"><a name="stpa_141">Another major factor in reducing women&#039;s earnings is that 45 per cent. of women in work are part-time. Notwithstanding the greater protection that part-time workers have been given, part-time working tends to reduce promotion prospects. Obviously, those who work part-time also earn less than somebody who works full-time, even if they are paid the same hourly rate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para32"><a name="stpa_142">Women are concentrated in part-time employment partly because girls are still not attaining the same level of achievement as boys and are therefore unable to access work for those who are well qualified. I hope that we shall be able alter that over time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para34"><a name="stpa_144">Let me quote again from a DWP document. The Department recently conducted an analysis of women&#039;s attitudes to pensions, which shows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;There is some evidence of a cultural shift over time. Younger . . . women . . . seemed more likely to value a degree of financial independence. They recognised that many partnerships do not endure.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para35"><a name="stpa_145">Marriage breakdown is important in explaining why women often finish up with lower pensions. They rely on their male partner to provide the pension for both of them, but the relationship then breaks down, and they are left with no pension or a with a very diminished one.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para36"><a name="stpa_146">The document goes on to say that women feel that it is important for them to make pension provision in their own right. However, elements of traditional gender roles and financial dependency persist in the lives of many young women, particularly those who are married or who have children. It notes that

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;the effects of changing values and expectations are often diluted by other factors. This tends to perpetuate the pension gap.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para37"><a name="stpa_147">The DWP is therefore well aware of the fact that younger women still tend to put their caring responsibilities, or their potential caring responsibilities, ahead of making proper provision for a pension for themselves in their own right.

I agree with all the suggestions that have been made about ways in which pension provision can properly recognise and compensate for the caring contribution. I want the Government to do all that has been suggested and to ensure that the system is as effective and comprehensive as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para38"><a name="stpa_148">Without a future Government becoming incredibly intrusive into the detail of people&#039;s lives, and women&#039;s lives in particular, it will never be possible to devise a credit system that will fully compensate for women&#039;s caring responsibilities. To take an example like the ones cited by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar, what of a woman who, for example, picks up her grandchildren from school at the end of the school day, looks after them for an hour or so and gives them their supper before their parents pick them up for the evening, and looks after parents and parents-in-law, making sure that they are safe, visiting them several times a week, and taking them to hospital or on other journeys?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para39"><a name="stpa_149">That sort of caring responsibility is a mix of relatively small individual caring responsibilities, but they add up to a quite big caring responsibility.

not full-time but part-time. That is why we should support the model for future pension provision that has been put forward by a group of organisations fronted by the Equal Opportunities Commission and including Age Concern and the TUC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para40"><a name="stpa_150">The suggestion is that there must be a common entitlement to a basic pension for every individual, regardless of household circumstances, which is not based on a contribution record through the national insurance system. Some residence qualification is obviously necessary, but over and above that the entitlement should be available to everyone regardless of circumstances. That should be backed up by a flexible state second pension that would encourage everyone to accumulate additional entitlement, with a private or occupational pension or savings. That is the model that seems to me best to match the extreme complexity and flexibility of a woman&#039;s working life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para41"><a name="stpa_151">I shall say something briefly about occupational pensions. Because women in work tend to earn less and because they have an interrupted work record, they also tend to have a much poorer occupational pension in their own right than a man does. In particular, there is a tendency for their earnings to drop more than a man&#039;s earnings as they approach retirement age; a woman&#039;s responsibility for her children tends to lessen at that time&#151;although as a parent of adult children I note that they seem to call on one&#039;s time, and indeed finances, considerably&#151;but other caring responsibilities, for elderly relatives, increase as a woman reaches retirement age. As a result, the proportion of women over 50 in full-time employment is smaller than the proportion of young women in that category.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para42"><a name="stpa_152">Those circumstances affect contributions to women&#039;s occupational pension schemes. That is why&#151;although I know that the suggestion is divisive and many people find it threatening&#151;we need to move away from final salary pension schemes. Such schemes favour men, who are more likely than women to have continuous employment records and to have been promoted to higher levels by the time they near retirement. Occupational pension schemes that take into account lifetime earnings rather than just earnings as a person nears retirement are likely to be more favourable to women and need to be considered.
</p>

She has revealed the inequalities in the present pension system and shown how difficult it is for women to qualify for a full state pension. She has detailed knowledge of how unfair the credits system can be and of the difficulties faced by women with a variety of working patterns. She set out clearly, for us and for the Government, what needs to be done.

<a name="50712h02_para44"><a name="stpa_154">I do not think that any Labour Member is critical of the pension credit. It is an important measure that has lifted 1.3 million women out of poverty and has made a huge difference to people&#039;s lives. I am sure that, like me, hon. Members found during the general election campaign that women pensioners were delighted with what the Government had done for them. On more than one occasion, women said to me that they had never been so well off in their lives. The fact that they are feeling well off on &#163;109 per week plus housing benefit and council tax benefit reflects how badly off they were during their working lives. None the less, the pension credit has done the business for women who had been almost completely left out of the pension system.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"><a name="50712h02_spnew12"><b> David Taylor </b> : I too encountered good numbers of women during the general election campaign who said just that. However, that could be merely anecdotal evidence. Exit polls showed that, sadly, the greatest loss in our party&#039;s support was among women aged over 55. There is a discrepancy, is there not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"><a name="50712h02_spnew13"><b> Miss Begg </b> : I have not looked at the figures for my   constituency, where there are many middle-class women who did not benefit from the pension credit because of the dependency model of the basic state pension&#151;many of them were doing all right because they had inherited their husbands&#039; contributions and were therefore better-off widows. However, in working-class areas, particularly among those living in sheltered housing complexes, most of the women felt that the Government had done a great deal for them and they came out to vote Labour with great enthusiasm. The fact that I am here is a tribute to that. I have a marginal seat and had they not done so, I would not have won it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para45"><a name="stpa_155">The debate is not about criticising what the Government have done: they had to take action in the short term if they were to fulfil their promise to end pensioner poverty, and the savings element of the pension credit has had a huge impact. The debate is about looking forward. How do we ensure, as we move through the 21st century, that the state pension system and the occupational and private pension systems are fit for their purpose? How do we begin to tackle the inequalities of the last century that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar so ably laid out?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para46"><a name="stpa_156">I accept the point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) and for   Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey). The Government say that things will get better as more women work, and work longer hours&#151;that that will somehow fill the gap and solve the problem&#151;but it will not. Women who work do so for less pay than men and they generally work fewer hours and in lower-skilled jobs than men.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para47"><a name="stpa_157">Aberdeen happens to have the largest gender pay gap in Scotland and one of the largest in the United Kingdom. In Aberdeen, women&#039;s earnings are 60 per cent. of those of their male counterparts. There are two reasons for that. First, our work is dominated by the oil industry, a high-paying industry with jobs in the offshore sector filled predominantly by men. Secondly, we have a large number of people in work&#151;a large gender pay gap tends to coincide with high employment rates. We have high employment in Aberdeen, but women generally work in the service industries&#151;in the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 220WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
caring sector and in companies that service the oil industry, often cleaning or similar work. A large gender pay gap is therefore inevitable, and when the women retire it will inevitably translate into a pensions gap.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para48"><a name="stpa_158">My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said that many women have different work patterns from their male counterparts simply because that is how they choose to live their lives. We have made huge strides forward in equality and women have the chance to compete equally in the jobs market, but despite 30 or 40 years of feminism women are still under pressure. Women cannot always choose how to live their lives. They still bear the burden of the caring responsibilities, both within and outwith the home, and I doubt that that will change. If it was going to change dramatically, it would already have done so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para49"><a name="stpa_159">Jackie Ashley, whom my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar quoted, pointed out the fact that although women now expect to have full-time jobs, they still have caring responsibilities. Unfortunately their male partners do not always take the equality agenda as seriously and shoulder the full burden of care and responsibility. They might pick the kids up from school from time to time or do the washing occasionally, but in most partnerships it is predominantly the woman who does those jobs. Women are trying to juggle lots of different balls to ensure that they are both earning and fulfilling those responsibilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para50"><a name="stpa_160">We face a demographic time bomb not only in this country but across the whole western world, because people are living longer. As a result, the caring responsibilities of women are changing. Once, a woman might have cared for the children, then gone to work, and then cared for an elderly relative for a few years, but elderly relatives now live 20 years or more longer. It is interesting to note that the women who turn 60 this year are the first of the baby-boomer generation to reach retirement age. Looking forward, they can see their elderly relatives, who are now in their 80s, having difficulty accessing care from outwith the family structure. They are especially concerned about the quality of the care homes that their elderly relatives are in and they are determined that that will not happen to them, but at the same time they are looking back to their daughters, who, like them, have been caught in the trap of not being able to build up enough credits and who will be unable to build up a full entitlement to the basic state pension. Beyond that, those baby-boomer women might also be considering their grandchildren&#151;perhaps picking them up from school and undertaking other caring responsibilities. In that way, three generations of caring fall on to one generation of women, who are reaching their 60s. That burden will not ease as more women go into work and as people, particularly women, live longer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para51"><a name="stpa_161">We have a chance to change things. The debate is timely&#151;the Turner commission will report later this year. The Government should now consider the shape of the pensions industry, both state and private, to find the best model to take us through the next 50 years. The Beveridge model has done us well, but it was a model of its time. It was right in 1950, but is not right for 2005 and it will not be right for 2050. Society has changed, as has 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 221WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the way in which people live, particularly women, who no longer expect to be dependent on a husband, partner or other person for the whole of their lives, as may have been the case when Beveridge set up the original state pension system. We are looking for a new Beveridge model: something as imaginative and forward-reaching as that model was, which will take into account how our lives have changed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para52"><a name="stpa_162">It is important that we get away from the dependency model. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar was absolutely right about pension credits and how they could be made more flexible. With such a complex system, the question at the end of it is: who do we leave out? Today, we think that no one should be left out, which means that the only answer is that the basic state pension should be universal, but not in the way in which the citizen&#039;s pension proposed by a number of people is universal, because that proposal does not get away from the dependency model.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para53"><a name="stpa_163">The Government have the chance to be much more radical and forward looking. Rather than tinker with the pension system to solve inequalities, as we have done up till now, we need to create something fundamentally different. They should certainly consider the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West about building up a second pension and the universal nature of the basic state pension. It is only by being that radical and visionary that we can end once and for all the inequalities that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar so amply illustrated.

<a name="50712h02_para58"><a name="stpa_168">I hope that now that he has moved to the Department of Trade and Industry he will be able to address some of the problems mentioned today&#151;the pay gap and the nature of women&#039;s work&#151;which feed into the pensions problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para59"><a name="stpa_169">Adair Turner produced a welcome chapter on women&#039;s pensions in his recent report. Although it was a sound analysis of the problem, there were disappointingly few realistic or positive suggestions on how the problems could be addressed. Perhaps we will see more in future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para60"><a name="stpa_170">The reality of the present position has been outlined by hon. Members and the facts are stark. One in five single women face poverty in retirement; many women have no occupational pension; half receive less than the full basic state pension; and, on average, for every pound received by a man in a pensioner couple, the woman receives just 34p. The Government have made welcome efforts to address the problem, but the take-up of the minimum income guarantee and pension credit is not good. Government figures show that in 2002&#150;03 as many as 550,000 single female pensioners were below the poverty line because they did not claim the minimum income guarantee. I will return to that point later.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para61"><a name="stpa_171">The reasons that women lose out have been highlighted. It is worth remembering that the pension system was designed in the 1940s, when women&#039;s lives were very different: by and large, they did not work, they did not divorce and there was an assumption that they would be looked after by a man. Life is different today, and it seems obvious that we need a different pension system to reflect that. Another problem is that child care and other caring responsibilities are not recognised by   the current system. The pay gap has also been mentioned: the average woman earns &#163;241,000 less over her lifetime than a man in an equivalent job&#151;provided that she does not have children. If she has two children, her earnings decrease by a further &#163;140,000. If women work, they often work in low-paid sectors, where it is not common to have access to occupational pensions. Finally, older pensioners are poorer and more likely to be female.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para62"><a name="stpa_172">We have to approach the problem in two ways. First, what can be done in the short term to help women who have retired or are close to retirement to maximise their income? That is a sticking-plaster solution, however, and we need to think more about whether we have to change the system for the long term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para63"><a name="stpa_173">We have mentioned the low uptake of benefits. Quite simply, means-testing is incredibly unpopular. If we are stuck with that situation, more has to be done to encourage pensioners to take up the benefits to which they are entitled. The big problem is that they do not. I am aware that pensions advisers are spending a lot of time on the phone, ringing people up and trying to make sure that they are claiming their benefits. However, not everybody is on the phone&#151;it is an expense that some cannot afford. Recently, local pensions advisers have been prevented from going out into the community, from talking to groups in sheltered housing schemes or other pensioner groups, and reaching other people in that way. It seems to me that although hitting the phones may be effective to an extent, the women&#151;and men&#151;in the greatest poverty are probably not being reached.

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="50712h02_spnew15"><b> Miss Begg </b> : Will the hon. Lady pay tribute to the Pension Service in Aberdeen, which has been doing as the hon. Lady suggests? Advisers have been going into    communities to contact the hardest-to-reach pensioners, with some success.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"><a name="50712h02_spnew16"><b> Sandra Gidley </b> : The hon. Lady has described what should be happening. I am surprised that it still happens in Aberdeen, given that the people who were doing it in Romsey have been stopped because of cuts in the DWP work force. I should be interested to know whether it is still being done, because the Romsey changes were made a few months ago and were quite unpopular with those who had to put them into practice. It might be a local decision, although I understood that it was national; perhaps the Minister can clarify that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para64"><a name="stpa_174">For the current generation of women the married woman&#039;s stamp is another problem, which has not been mentioned today. Many women say that they were unaware when they opted for it that it could significantly affect their personal pension entitlement. The Government must inform all women who pay the stamp of its implications and allow a longer period in which to pay fuller contributions so that women will have a pension in their own right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para65"><a name="stpa_175">Carers&#039; credits have been mentioned. We can talk at length about systems of carers&#039; credits, reducing the number of years&#039; contributions that are required if someone is to benefit from a pension, or even reconsidering the lower earnings level. However, those are all sticking-plaster solutions that will help pensioners in the short term but will not tackle the fundamental problems. For the future we need a pension that takes account of caring responsibilities and values them. We need a pension that takes account of gaps in employment, helps to tackle the inequalities caused by women&#039;s lower pay and&#151;keeping in mind the 1940s system&#151;takes account of the reduced reliance on the man as provider.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para66"><a name="stpa_176">During the general election the Liberal Democrats proposed a citizen&#039;s pension system. While I was listening to the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) I realised that she was talking about something not too dissimilar to Liberal Democrat policy. A consensus seems to be growing that an entitlement to a pension in one&#039;s own right, based on residency rather than national insurance contributions, is the fairest way to go, and should be considered.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"><a name="50712h02_spnew17"><b> Miss Begg </b> : I understood that the Liberal Democrats&#039; proposal for a citizen&#039;s pension still contained a dependency element: it proposed one pension for a single person and one for a married couple. On our side of the argument we see that dependency model as the old model, which we should be getting away from.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"><a name="50712h02_spnew18"><b> Sandra Gidley </b> : The hon. Lady is right about the difference between the single person&#039;s and married person&#039;s pensions, but our philosophy was to take one step at a time. Entitlement was the first step. Personally, although I cannot speak for the rest of the party, I would support something without the dependency element. If we bear in mind the fact that fewer women are now marrying and the divorce rate is higher, that may become less of a consideration over the years. Nevertheless, it is still a consideration now.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para67"><a name="stpa_177">The advantages of a universal entitlement or a citizen&#039;s pension include recognition that child care and other caring responsibilities are just as valuable to society as paid work. Many of the caring behaviours that people adopt save the state significant amounts of money and it seems perverse to penalise rather than recognise people who willingly and voluntarily look after their loved ones. If the system provided a universal entitlement, there would be no need for complicated carers&#039; credits. That would also eliminate the need for means tests, which are unpopular and degrading. Even if the citizen&#039;s pension were introduced at the age of 75, as highlighted in the Liberal Democrat manifesto, 2.8 million women would benefit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para68"><a name="stpa_178">To sum up, the 1940s system is out of date and needs reviewing. Ministers have hinted that the problem should be examined and that some sort of citizen&#039;s pension or universal entitlement is the way to go. I hope that the Minister for Pensions Reform can reassure us on that point.

<p><a name="st_45"><a name="50712h02_spnew19"><b> Mr. Nigel Waterson  (Eastbourne)</b>  (Con): It is a great pleasure to take part in the debate, which is the latest in a series called by the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird). I congratulate her on securing this debate and the several previous ones. She has been a doughty and persuasive campaigner on women&#039;s issues, particularly women&#039;s pensions, so it must be all the more disappointing to her that the Government have made so little progress on the subject. Indeed, the Minister had better be careful, because I am not sure that I did not detect in her final comments a veiled threat to sue the Government over the apparent problems of gender discrimination inherent in the present system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para69"><a name="stpa_179">We all accept that the system was designed for a very different era. It was not some Tory plot prior to 1997 to do down women pensioners; it was, as the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) said, a system that was designed in and for the 1940s to accommodate the social systems that were in place at that time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para70"><a name="stpa_180">In her excellent opening speech, the hon. and learned Member for Redcar spoke to some extent about pension credit. As the hon. Member for Romsey said, there must be a high proportion of women among the 1.5 million or so people who are eligible for pension credit but who do not yet claim it. That, of course, is the great problem with a means-tested system. I think that we can all agree with the previous Secretary of State for Work and Pensions&#151;now the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry&#151;and many others who have said that this is one of the great untackled inequities in the pensions system. As I said, its causes are historical, but that does not make it defensible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para71"><a name="stpa_181">Like the hon. and learned Member for Redcar, I was present at the launch some time ago of a report called &quot;One in Four&quot;, which was produced jointly by Age Concern and the Fawcett Society. The report makes clear the problems of the many women who are forced by their lack of pension provision to live in poverty. I shall not rehearse the statistics and the facts, because that has been done very ably and comprehensively already, but the report does cover several cases, including that of Christine Dunn, who is one of my constituents.

for many years, before taking a break to bring up her children. She then had all sorts of problems with her pension provision, but she is one of the many women who have worked their way out of the problem to a large extent. Aged 40, she went on to retrain as a teacher at her own expense and she has now built up an adequate second pension. She says:

<p>
<a name="50712h02_para72"><a name="stpa_182">It is fair to say that significant numbers of women in that situation have been able to requalify and develop their own occupational pension in later life, but far from all women&#151;indeed, far from most women&#151;have been able to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para73"><a name="stpa_183">It is interesting, if not slightly amazing, that we debated an enormous piece of pensions legislation at great length last year, but that nothing in the Pensions Act 2004 really began to tackle the issues that we are debating. That gives us an interesting take on the Government&#039;s priorities. The hon. and learned Member for Redcar referred, rightly as always, to the concession that was wrung out of Ministers in Committee for the Department to produce an annual report on women and pensions. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us when the first of those much-foreshadowed reports will hit the streets. It is also worth recalling that it was the hon. and learned Lady&#039;s amendment, supported by my hon. Friends and me, that forced the Government to make that concession: it had not been their intention to produce such a report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para74"><a name="stpa_184">I am proud and pleased that my party went into the general election with some thought through policies on how to better the lot of women pensioners. We do not need to jettison the contributory principle to deal with the patent inequity of women&#039;s pensions. We have heard a lot about the citizen&#039;s pension or the universal pension. One of the problems with that, apart from the difficulties of making it work, let alone paying for it, is that people often talk rather glibly about it, but each of them means something different by it. I do not know what happened in Romsey, but I am pleased to say that when I explained to my constituents in Eastbourne during the election campaign that the Liberal Democrats wanted to junk the contributory principle, I found that that was not a popular policy&#151;albeit not quite as unpopular as local income tax. It was not popular because people have an affection for the contributory principle. How often have people come to our surgeries and said, &quot;I have paid my stamp but I cannot get this or that.&quot;? We believe that there are more targeted ways of dealing with the issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para75"><a name="stpa_185">Had we won the election, we would now be doing four things. First, we would abolish the 10-year rule on national insurance contributions. Secondly, we would offer better pensions to those who take time out of the labour market&#151;predominantly women, as we have said&#151;via a much more flexible weekly credit. The present system, as all speakers have said, is inflexible and unfair. Thirdly, we would make it easier for people to buy back the years when they failed to make national insurance contributions. It is interesting that the Government&#039;s new rules on private pension saving are much more flexible than those that apply to the state pension and its entitlement. Finally, we would lower the

bar for state pension rights, currently &#163;79 a week, to give access to a state pension to people on very low earnings, such as those on &#163;60 to &#163;79 a week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para76"><a name="stpa_186">All those are practical, common-sense and targeted ways of dealing with the problems that have been described in this debate. We do not need to throw out the entire contributory system to tackle the unfairness.

That would involve the sort of intrusiveness that I suspect the Conservative party would oppose most strongly.

Whoever is in power if and when the matter is addressed will also have to address the issue of cost. I have seen it estimated that people who voluntarily care for members of their families save the Treasury up to &#163;60 billion a year. There would have to be a definition of what constitutes caring. At least the flexibility of a weekly credit would be a step forward.

It also recognises that we do not have to lose the contributory principle in order to deal with the issue, and calls on Ministers&#151;particularly the Minister for Pensions Reform&#151;to consider the plight of poorer female pensioners when considering further reforms to the state and private pensions systems.

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="50712h02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Pensions Reform  (Mr. Stephen Timms) </b> : I too begin by congratulating my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) on securing this debate and on the consistent way in which in recent months she has led a sustained campaign to improve pension provision for women. The campaign in Parliament has been important in building the wider concern that has been reflected in this debate, and it is playing a prominent part in the national debate to consider the kind of pensions that will be needed in future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para78"><a name="stpa_188">Women pensioners are significantly more likely than male pensioners to be living in poverty. A number of speakers have pointed out the reasons for that, which include time taken out of the labour market, conditions in the labour market, the greater incidence of part-time work among women, straightforward discrimination in conditions and more varied patterns of working. All of those provide challenges that we need to address.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para79"><a name="stpa_189">This morning I met the chief executive of the Pensions Advisory Service. He told me about the women and pensions helpline set up in November and December 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
last year. It received 8,000 calls, and seven out of 10 of those callers were not making any private pension savings. A lot of callers had queries about the reduced rate married woman&#039;s national insurance contribution, to which the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) referred, and many were confused and uncertain about the value of home responsibilities protection, which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar mentioned. It is important to address all of those issues in this debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para80"><a name="stpa_190">I shall outline action that has been taken to address some of the problems. They have certainly not been ignored, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) suggests&#151;as well as the action that we want to take to make further progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para81"><a name="stpa_191">When we came to office, our priority was to tackle the bad legacy of inequality for today&#039;s female pensioners highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd). The introduction of pension credit has particularly helped women. I had the same experience as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) during the general election campaign when speaking to women who had been helped substantially by the introduction of that measure. Two thirds of the recipients of pension credit&#151;2.18 million people in all&#151;are women. There is more work to be done to increase take-up, although that has risen dramatically in the past year as a result of the kind of initiative that my hon. Friend described. The latest estimates indicate that up to 90 per cent. of single women pensioners entitled to the guarantee element of the credit now receive it. A smaller proportion receives the savings credit, and we need to do more to further increase take-up. There is no doubt that the majority of those who stand to benefit most from pension credit are now doing so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para82"><a name="stpa_192">The hon. Member for Romsey referred to some local difficulties. I shall be happy to write to her about what is happening in her area. In my experience around the country, joint teams of Pensions Agency and local authority staff have been very active in encouraging pension credit take-up, as is happening in Aberdeen. Alongside measures such as winter fuel payments and the tax and benefits changes, the pension credit has lifted 1.3 million women pensioners out of absolute poverty since 1997. As a result of the changes, pensioner households will, on average, be &#163;1,500 better off this year than they would have been under the 1997 system and the least well off third will be an average of &#163;2,000 better off. That is an achievement that we can all welcome.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para83"><a name="stpa_193">We have also taken steps to tackle the underlying causes of pensioner inequality and poverty. As we heard, when the state pension system was established in the 1940s, those with caring responsibilities were inherently disadvantaged. That is why, when she was Secretary of State for Social Services, the late Barbara Castle took the initiative to introduce home responsibility protection in 1978. I note the advantages, to which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar drew attention, of a flexible credit system rather than the present inflexible form of home responsibility protection. Other Members touched on that as well. It is a point that we need to consider carefully as we look at the future shape of the system. I assure my hon. and learned Friend that a woman will not lose HRP 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 228WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
protection if she does a few weeks work in a year. If she is entitled to child benefit for the full year, she will benefit from HRP if she does not otherwise have a qualifying year through contributions or credits. The difficulty with HRP is that the year in which the child is born is typically not covered by HRP. There are other inflexibilities as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para84"><a name="stpa_194">In introducing the state second pension, we have, for the first time, given carers the ability to develop rights to a second pension in the state system. That is a significant improvement. Nearly all the 1.9 million carers being helped by the state second pension are women, as are two thirds of the 5.8 million low earners. The state second pension means that the proportion of women who accrue significant state second pension entitlement is similar to the proportion of men who do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para85"><a name="stpa_195">We have also taken steps to help parents to balance work and family life, including the working tax credit, child tax credit and increased access to affordable and good-quality child care. Couples with children are now able to claim the 30-hour element of the working tax credit if they jointly work 30 hours or more. That makes it easier for families to share work as best suits them. It also means that women are more likely to have the option of going to work and accruing a pension than used to be the case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para86"><a name="stpa_196">As we heard, women have tended to be in lower-paid jobs than men. One of the disadvantages of that is that state pension rights may not be accrued under a threshold level of income. We have addressed that problem in two ways. First, the introduction of the national minimum wage has benefited more than 1 million people, of whom 70 per cent. are women. The Low Pay Commission estimates that that has had the biggest impact on increasing women&#039;s pay of any measure since the Equal Pay Act 1970. Secondly, the separation of the lower earnings limit from the primary threshold level means that low earners can start to accrue state pension rights at a lower income than that at which they start paying national insurance contributions. That has been an improvement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para87"><a name="stpa_197">Women are also more likely to be in part-time work than are men. The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 and the Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (Amendment) Regulations 2002 ensure that 6 million workers, the majority of them women, are not treated less favourably than comparable full-timers in their terms and conditions, including access to occupational pension schemes. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central made an interesting point about aggregating different part-time streams of income that are earned concurrently. I imagine that that would be difficult, but it is an interesting point that we should consider to see whether we can help more people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50712h02_spnew22"><b> Tony Lloyd </b> : My hon. Friend is trying to be helpful. Does he take on board the associated points about the needs of carers who are part-time workers in more than one job and who fall foul of the present threshold on carers&#039; hours?
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"><a name="50712h02_spnew23"><b> Mr. Timms </b> : There are a range of issues relating to carers that require thought and reflection in the context of the debate. We have established the women and work

<br>&nbsp;<br>
commission to consider how to close the gender, pay and opportunities gap within a generation. I hope that that will lead to some important proposals. Finally, we have taken action to address the issues of the flexibility and portability of pensions, in particular through stakeholder pensions. I should say to the hon. Member for Eastbourne that aspects of the Pensions Act 2004 have helped, for example by aiding portability through helping people who have been in jobs for only a short period of time to take a cash equivalent transfer value of their pension rights to another scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para88"><a name="stpa_198">Due both to changes in society and the measures that we have taken, improvements are being made. However, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar and the other hon. Members who have spoken in this important debate have made a strong case and I willingly acknowledge that we need to do more to ensure fair outcomes for women and carers in the future. That is why fair outcomes for women and carers is among the key principles of pension reform that we set out in February. It will certainly be one of the principal criteria in the public debate against which the Government&#039;s proposals, when they are introduced, will be measured.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para89"><a name="stpa_199">In the background is the changing demographic picture. Over the past 20 years, women&#039;s life expectancy at birth has increased by about three months every year. That is a dramatic change in longevity. It is wonderful and to be celebrated, but it adds to the challenges faced by the pensions system. An ageing population with an increasing dependency ratio needs a sustainable and affordable pension system that can provide a long-term solution for everybody, not just a quick fix for pensioners today and in the immediate future. That is why we have launched the national pensions debate. As broad a consensus as possible is crucial to a long-term solution to the pensions challenge. We want to involve Members of this House from the different parties, as well as industry groups, trade unions, interest groups and the public.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para90"><a name="stpa_200">The Equal Opportunities Commission wrote to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions last month outlining the desired outcome for women and carers of any reform of the pension system. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 230WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
That letter was signed by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar and a wide range of organisations and individuals. We share the aspirations set out, such as better recognition of unpaid caring work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para91"><a name="stpa_201">The women and pensions report will aid the principle of assessing options against how they will provide fair outcomes for women and carers. The report was announced in response to an amendment tabled in Committee by my hon. and learned Friend during the debate on the Pensions Act last year. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced this morning, when speaking to the Fabian Society, that we will publish that report later this year at an event in the national pensions debate that will focus on how to make our future pensions system work well for women.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"><a name="50712h02_spnew24"><b> Miss Begg </b> : If my hon. Friend gets it right and is up to the pensions challenge, instead of talking as I was this morning of a new Beveridge, perhaps in 50 years&#039; time our successors will be talking of a new Timms. That would certainly secure his place in history.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"><a name="50712h02_spnew25"><b> Mr. Timms </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There might be other contenders for the Beveridge crown, but I will certainly have a go.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h02_para92"><a name="stpa_202">There is a lot of work, a lot of reflection and a lot of discussion on pensions at the moment. The concerns that have been raised in this debate will be among those that are most prominent in the debate that will follow the publication of the Pensions Commission report in November. I should say to the hon. Member for Romsey that, as intended, the first report was analysis; the second report, which will follow later this year, will contain proposals. Many people will want to assess those proposals against the benchmark of the concerns that have been set out in this debate and will be aired in the months ahead. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and I met representatives of the Equal Opportunities Commission two weeks ago, and I shall be meeting Fawcett Society representatives later this month. I am anxious to ensure that we engage effectively with a range of people who are concerned about the specific issues that have helpfully been raised today.

<a name="50712h03_time0"><h5>12.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_53"><a name="50712h03_spnew0"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b>  (LD): I am particularly pleased to have secured the opportunity to debate the Government&#039;s policy on regional government. I am especially pleased to debate the matter with this Minister. We have experience of close team work on the football field, and I hope that today we can demonstrate that constructive team work can result in a beneficial outcome. It did so for both of us on the football field, when I laid on a number of goals for him to score for the parliamentary football team. I hope that if he were to follow my critique and analysis of where the Government&#039;s policy is going and where it should go, I might be laying the ball on for him to score some goals and improve his career prospects in the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para0"><a name="stpa_203">My Liberal Democrat colleagues and I strongly support the Government&#039;s proposals to devolve power, which have been successful in Scotland, Wales, London and, we hope in time, Northern Ireland. The Government know that we have given them strong support during the development of that policy. Many who were keen to promote the continuing devolution of power to the nations and the regions of the United Kingdom are concerned to ensure that despite the referendum in the north-east in November last year, this flagship policy does not fall off the radar, is not kicked into the long grass and does not become a policy that the Government would rather forget.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para1"><a name="stpa_204">I intend to analyse the status of the Government&#039;s policy, to offer a critique and a constructive approach, to mention Cornwall&#151; I would not want to let anyone down, nor surprise them&#151;and to raise several questions. I have already furnished the Minister&#039;s office with those questions, admittedly only yesterday afternoon; however, I have given him advance notice of some of the questions I intend to ask.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para2"><a name="stpa_205">With regard to the status of the Government&#039;s policy, we must look back to the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s statement from 8 November last year. The no vote in the north-east referendum was disappointing but clearly overwhelming. I shared the disappointment of others, including the Deputy Prime Minister, at the outcome. He said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;our ability to hold referendums based on the current soundings exercise runs out in June 2005.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para3"><a name="stpa_206">In other words, there will be no more opportunities to hold further referendums, because as of the end of the last month, the soundings exercise effectively is no longer a basis for them. He also said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;If and when, in the future, a region wants to move ahead with a referendum, the House will have plenty of notice of that event.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 8 November 2005; Vol. 426, c. 588.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para4"><a name="stpa_207">Further, in response to a question that I asked about whether the Government were giving up on devolution as a result of the no vote in the north-east, he replied that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;I am not giving up, and I hope that I do not give that impression.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 8 November 2005; Vol. 426, c. 603.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para5"><a name="stpa_208">However, the Government have shown every sign of giving up. There have been no new Government proposals to address the democratic deficit regarding the need for directly elected regional assemblies to take on the responsibilities of decision-making powers in the

<br>&nbsp;<br>
regions. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Regional Affairs, which is always keen to consider new subjects, but the Government need to bring such subjects forward. The Committee has not been called since last November. Despite this issue having been raised by me and others in business questions, there are no proposals for the Committee to debate the aftermath of the north-east referendum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para6"><a name="stpa_209">The Government will come unstuck if they continue to see devolution as something over which they can have absolute control and to think that they can determine the agenda completely. Fundamentally, devolution is about letting go, rather than holding on for dear life. One needs to understand why we devolve power. The problem with the Government&#039;s approach is that they want to dictate precisely what, how, where and when. What powers, organisations, structures, membership; how to proceed, resolve local issues and reorganise local government; where the boundaries should be. They want to dictate these absolutely, as well as the timescale of it all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para7"><a name="stpa_210">I offer an alternative approach, for which the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003 could be used as a basis, in which the Government propose a menu of powers and invite regions, as defined by themselves&#151;that would mean local authorities and community groups coming together&#151;to propose business cases to the Government arguing for referendums to bring powers to their regions. That differs from the Government&#039;s zone approach, in which the Government decide the zones and dictate how and when bodies come together, what powers they have and when referendums are held.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para8"><a name="stpa_211">If the process were one of letting go and allowing regions to define themselves and to come forward with business cases, based on the limitation of a menu of powers set out by the Government, and of recognising that the whole thing is a process, rather than a single event, I suspect that there would be a different response. Such a process would engage regions and allow them to bring forward proposals, rather than mean them responding as they did in the north-east to what they feel are entirely Government-sponsored proposals. There was quite a strong reaction against that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para9"><a name="stpa_212">It would be remiss of me not to mention Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. I know that several city-region proposals are being worked on in other areas. Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly is seen as a region for European funding purposes; it is an objective 1 region. With a population of just over 500,000 people, it is not a large region. The Cornish constitutional convention has produced some excellent proposals and several policy documents, all of which have been circulated to the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para10"><a name="stpa_213">In November, the Deputy Prime Minister responded to the cynicism of the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) about not getting a positive response in the south-west by saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;if the vote . . . were held solely in Cornwall, I wonder whether she would be so confident about the result.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, </i>8 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 600.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para11"><a name="stpa_214">That shows his confidence that if a referendum were held in Cornwall alone, the Government would have a far better result than in the north-east.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 233WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para12"><a name="stpa_215">Critics will inevitably say, &quot;Well, you couldn&#039;t possibly have regions the size of Cornwall,&quot; but all we have to do is raise our eyes above the narrow horizon of the British Isles and look internationally at the many successful regions and nations elsewhere in the world with populations of a similar size to Cornwall&#039;s or even smaller.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para13"><a name="stpa_216">Size is not the most important feature, but the Government have developed an obsession with reaching critical mass to deliver a number of services. Cross-boundary partnerships need to be established and transport networks need to be planned for. We are not talking about cutting ourselves off, but about working in partnerships and establishing joint boards. Wherever we draw the boundaries between one region and another&#151;with transport arrangements, for example&#151;we still need the ability to hold a dialogue with other places.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para14"><a name="stpa_217">The need to establish that level of planning could be addressed and is well articulated in the plans and proposals from the Cornish constitutional convention. Not only that, but two years ago local people were invited to sign declaration sheets. More than 50,000 people signed in favour of a Cornish assembly, which represents more than 10 per cent. of the adult population in Cornwall. A small number of supporters were people who were visiting Cornwall, but the figure still represented more than 10 per cent. of the adult population.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para15"><a name="stpa_218">There is a question of whether it will be possible to review the boundaries of the Government zones. I prefer to call them zones instead of regions, because the internal integrity does not really exist in the south-west, although for all I can tell it might do in the north-east. Paragraph 6.5 of the regional assemblies White Paper of 2002 says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;The Government has not completely ruled out in the longer term the possibility of adopting boundaries for regional assemblies that do not follow the existing boundaries.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para16"><a name="stpa_219">There were proposals in that White Paper and the Government have acknowledged that in the longer term there might be opportunities. I urge the Minister in the review of policy to allow for the opportunity to consider again the integrity of the Government zones and whether the boundaries are appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para17"><a name="stpa_220">I said that I had a number of questions for the Minister and they are as follows. What plans do he and   the Government have following the north-east referendum to devolve power to the remainder of the UK? With the benefit of hindsight, which factors would he say primarily contributed to the heavy no vote in the north-east referendum? Does he share my critique and does he have any response to my alternative approach? What assessment has he made of suggestions at business questions and in another place to recall the Standing Committee on Regional Affairs to debate that very subject? Perhaps it should hold a series of debates to assist the Government explore the opportunity of resurrecting plans for the devolution of powers to regions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para18"><a name="stpa_221">What departmental&#151;in other words the ODPM&#151;or Cabinet-level reviews have taken place on Government policy on devolution since the north-east referendum? If 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 234WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
there have been any such meetings, will the minutes be published in the interests of open government? Why was the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) sacked as Minister with responsibility for regions in the post-general election reshuffle and what can we interpret from that? I thought that he did an excellent job and, clearly, was engaged in the process. He did not entirely agree with me on everything, but he was sincerely behind the cause itself.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para19"><a name="stpa_222">No doubt the Minister and his Department are aware of the proposals for city regions and of the many papers published by the Cornish constitutional convention. What assessment has the Department made of them? What plans does it have to address the democratic deficit at regional assembly chamber level? Can he confirm that there will be no further attempts to siphon off powers to unelected regional bodies at Government level as was the case with, for example, strategic planning powers? Finally, will he agree to meet a delegation from Cornwall to discuss the emerging plans and the need for devolution of powers to a region such as Cornwall?

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="50712h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick) </b> : What a pleasure it is to see you, Mr. Marshall, presiding in the Chair today. I thank the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) for his kind words about my football skills and our previous experiences playing together. I am not sure that we are playing on the same team today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para20"><a name="stpa_223">I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising the question of regional government, particularly in Cornwall, and for giving me an opportunity to restate the Government&#039;s continuing commitment to decentralising and devolving power wherever we can. This Government have made radical changes since first being elected in 1997. London now has a city-wide government and a Mayor powerful enough to run a global city. The Scottish Parliament enables the people of Scotland to make key decisions without recourse to Westminster for the first time in hundreds of years. The Welsh Assembly has given the Welsh people a powerful new voice in the creation of jobs, prosperity and social justice. Each of those new bodies was voted for by the people and has since proved to be very popular.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para21"><a name="stpa_224">The Government have followed a programme of devolution and decentralisation in England. For a decade or more, it has been recognised that some issues must be dealt with at a regional rather than a national level, but need to be co-ordinated over an area larger than any single local authority. The Government offices for the regions were established in 1994 when the work of three central Departments was brought together. They now do work for 10 Departments and have a programme budget of nearly &#163;7 billion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para22"><a name="stpa_225">This Government created regional development agencies in 1998 as economic powerhouses for the regions. The English RDAs have created or safeguarded more than 160,000 jobs in the past two years alone and have played a major part in reshaping our regional economies. Following the outcome of the referendum in the north-east last November, the Government indicated that they would not proceed with the introduction of the Regional Assemblies Bill and set out why they were not proceeding with referendums in the north-west and in the Yorkshire and Humber regions.

<a name="50712h03_para23"><a name="stpa_226">In response to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question, it is not the Government&#039;s intention to recall the Standing Committee on Regional Affairs. We do not believe that a post-mortem would be that valuable as an exercise in furthering future policy. However, there are many challenges ahead. When the Committee meets again, it can focus on them and look forward to how improvements to the regional architecture can be achieved. Of course, it is open to Members to propose subjects for the Committee to consider, and I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House would be prepared to consider them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para24"><a name="stpa_227">The Electoral Commission said that there should be no further electoral pilots using the new model until at least September 2005, but that in the meantime, under the legislation, our ability to hold referendums based on the sounding exercise would run out in June 2005. That would have created a long period of uncertainty for local government in the regions. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and the Government did not believe that that was acceptable. If and when a region wants to move ahead with a referendum, the House will be given plenty of notice of it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para25"><a name="stpa_228">In each of the eight regions outside London, there are now regional assemblies that are comprised of members from local government, business, trade unions and other representatives of the wider community. By bringing people together from across the region, such assemblies are able to provide a focal point for regional activities and to act as a voice for the region. They have an important influence on housing, planning, transport, economic development, skills and training in their region. They are involved in a range of regional strategies, so that their broad interests can help to ensure that there is consistency between them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"><a name="50712h03_spnew1"><b> Andrew George </b> : Is the Minister therefore saying that the Government would carefully consider any proposal advanced by an assembly in one of the eight Government zones to hold a referendum for a democratically elected regional assembly if it so wished, and that they might concede to it? What time scale does the Minister envisage, given his earlier remarks? Is this likely to happen within the next 12 to 24 months, or are we talking about four or five years away?
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"><a name="50712h03_spnew2"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I am not sure of the exact time scale, but everything is always under review, as the hon. Gentleman knows. I shall refer later to future suggestions for devolution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para26"><a name="stpa_229">Questions have been asked about the legitimacy of the voluntary assemblies. The members are not directly elected to assemblies, but up to 70 per cent. of the membership are from the local authorities in the regions. That gives the work of the regional assemblies a measure of democratic accountability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para27"><a name="stpa_230">All the regional assemblies have been appointed as the regional planning body for their region, and are responsible for producing the regional spatial strategy, the objective of which is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. Each RSS provides a broad development strategy for its region for a 15 to 20-year period. Regional spatial strategies set out the strategic policies and proposals, including infrastructure proposals and management polices, that

<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 236WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
govern the future distribution of regionally or sub-regionally significant activities and development in a region.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para28"><a name="stpa_231">The strategies also provide a spatial framework to inform the preparation of local development documents, local transport plans, and regional and sub-regional strategies and programmes that have a bearing on land-use activities, including air quality, education, energy and health, and on strategies to adapt to the effects of climate change. This is a two-way relationship, as the RSS should also take account of the strategies and programmes as they evolve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para29"><a name="stpa_232">We recognise that regions are actively responding to pressures where appropriate. In the south-west, for example, we have launched the &quot;The Way Ahead&quot;, under which the South West of England Development Agency, the Government Office and the regional assembly will work to meet the particular needs of the region.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para30"><a name="stpa_233">The advisory group has held its first meeting as a step towards refining and delivering the proposal set out in &quot;The Way Ahead&quot;. That document was a significant step towards a regional vision for growth, and the Government will continue to work closely with the RDA and regional assembly as they continue to develop it into a coherent strategy for linking economies in the region.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para31"><a name="stpa_234">The successful &quot;Northern Way&quot; initiative, launched last February, is a good example of the benefits of that joint approach. The RDAs and their partners in the three northern regions are working together to create more jobs, more prosperity and greater social justice. The initiative has been warmly received, and has energised the people in the three northern regions. It is one example of how regional structures and initiatives will continue to work throughout the country for the benefit of the regions with the full support of the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"><a name="50712h03_spnew3"><b> Andrew George </b> : I respect what the Minister is trying to do, but he is not answering my questions. I appreciate that &quot;The Way Ahead&quot;, the &quot;Northern Way&quot; initiative and various other &quot;ways&quot; might well be doing their own thing for all these various quangos and unaccountable bodies to which they work, but will he say when and how there will be referendums, and how we will solve the problem of the democratic deficit in these so-called regions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"><a name="50712h03_spnew4"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to continue, I hope to answer at least some, if not all, his questions later. If I miss any, I will write to him to try to address any deficit in my responses to his questions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para32"><a name="stpa_235">We have a continuing agenda of reform and modernisation. In our election manifesto, we stated our commitment to devolving

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para34"><a name="stpa_237">We have done a lot, but as the hon. Gentleman said, more can be done. The Government recognise the unique position of Cornwall; we support the Cornish language and have taken action to assist in its continued development. Only last month, my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government announced the level of financial support for the Cornish language.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para35"><a name="stpa_238">I note that, in previous speeches, the hon. Gentleman called for Cornwall to be given more regional identity, and today he mentioned the high level of support for a Cornwall Assembly. The Government have always said that, to be viable, proposals for an elected assembly must cover more than one local authority area. I realise that the people of Cornwall consider that they have a separate identity, but that alone does not justify creating an assembly for Cornwall. Cornwall already has a county council. That body covers the whole county, and it can speak on behalf of the people of Cornwall. In our view, creating another body cannot be justified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para36"><a name="stpa_239">The hon. Gentleman has called for a Cornwall development agency. I have already said that regional development agencies are the powerhouses for economic development in our regions, and the RDA for the south-west plays a full part in supporting the entire region. Introducing another body only for Cornwall would not be cost effective.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para37"><a name="stpa_240">The Government recognise the acute pressure in the south-west for affordable homes, and the region will benefit from the highest increase of all English regions in its regional housing pot up to 2007&#150;08.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"><a name="50712h03_spnew5"><b> Andrew George </b> : The Minister seems to be saying that the Government will not give people what they want, but will simply give the people of Cornwall what they want to give them. In other words, he seems to have closed his ears to the settled will of people in Cornwall. However, the Government&#039;s proposals for devolution in the north-east&#151;they were supposed to be popular&#151;have been overwhelmingly rejected. Should the Government not listen to the people a little more?
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"><a name="50712h03_spnew6"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : We are listening to the message being sent to us by the people of the north-east; they say that they are not prepared for, or willing to have, a regional assembly. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has said that Scotland was initially not in favour of a Scottish Parliament, but some years later the idea was passed by a majority. We are saying that Cornwall is a county; it is a separate entity and not a

<br>&nbsp;<br>
region, and it does not fit our plans for regional devolution. We believe that the county is adequately covered by the county council for many of the issues raised today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para38"><a name="stpa_241">The south-west housing body recommends providing considerable support in order to allow Cornwall to produce additional affordable homes as and when required.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para39"><a name="stpa_242">Through our links with Europe, we have ensured that Cornwall receives support to meet the needs of Cornwall. Negotiations on the structural fund regulations commenced in September 2004, and are likely to continue into early 2006. They cannot be finalised until the overall EU budget for 2007 to 2013 has been agreed. The position is that all funds should go to the new poorer EU member states, with richer member states funding economic regeneration from domestic resources. It is too early to give any indication of how much funding the south-west, or any other region, is likely to receive for domestic or European funding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para40"><a name="stpa_243">We are aware that partners in Cornwall are thinking about priorities for future programmes, and we are pleased to hear that that is linked to wider preparations across the south-west. It is good that that work is focusing on strategic issues and drawing on good practice from the current programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para41"><a name="stpa_244">Our continuing agenda of reform and devolution to local government is equally important, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is a continuing agenda. We have been engaged in extensive consultation on the future of local government. We are devolving further powers to the Mayor of London and the Assembly, hoping that it will encourage other cities to consider that example. It would allow more decisions to be made by local communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para42"><a name="stpa_245">Along with the modernisation and reform of local government, we have taken several steps to devolve decision making to local authorities. We have removed restrictive controls on local authority borrowing; we have given local authorities greater power to promote the well-being of their communities; and we have given them the freedom and flexibility to deliver better services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h03_para43"><a name="stpa_246">In his statement to the House on 8 November, my hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister set out the reasons why we were not proceeding with further referendums to establish elected regional assemblies. That remains the situation. However, we do have an agenda of reform and modernisation. When we can, we will decentralise and devolve power.

<a name="time_18">
<a name="50712h04_time0"><h5>12.59 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_61"><a name="50712h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gordon Prentice  (Pendle)</b>  (Lab): This debate is very important to my constituent Peter Lambert. It is unusual for me to bring a particular case to the Commons in this way, but Peter Lambert&#039;s case, which is interesting in its own right, perhaps illustrates failings in the system, and I am sure that the Minister will want to address them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para0"><a name="stpa_247">Who is Peter Lambert, what happened to him and what does he want? He is now 63, but when he was 52, he was assaulted. That was in 1995, when he was a schoolteacher. Today, he is in great pain and can get relief from that pain only by hanging upside down like a bat or by swimming. He swims about 40 lengths a day and tells me that the pain begins to go after 20 lengths. Clearly, that has an enormous impact on the way in which he leads his life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para1"><a name="stpa_248">Mr. Lambert cannot walk without experiencing incessant back pain and he has a disabled driver&#039;s badge to help him get about. He cannot bend, stoop or kneel without experiencing pain and he has great difficulty climbing stairs. His right leg is numb below the knee and he trips and stumbles a bit. It is also impossible for him to lift heavy weights.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para2"><a name="stpa_249">He has been in severe spinal pain for a decade, since June 1995. Every day, he experiences searing, disabling pain. He now takes morphine tablets, which have been prescribed by the pain specialist at the spinal injuries unit of Hope hospital in Salford. He also wants to have an operation on his spine to make things better. His life has been completely dominated by this pain and its management. However, it is not just Mr. Lambert who suffers; his wife literally lives his pain with him.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para3"><a name="stpa_250">Mr. Lambert has become part of my life, too, because he has been along to my surgery regularly. He is consumed by a burning sense of injustice. I say to him, as sympathetically as I can, &quot;But you&#039;ve got to live your life. You&#039;ve got to move on from this,&quot; but he is totally fixated by the injustice of what happened. He has presented me with files thicker than the London telephone directory; one could get submerged in the most minute detail. A few months ago, he astonished me by bringing along a skeleton used by medical students to illustrate the nature of his disability; as if I did not know about it, having seen the photographs, the slides and so on. There he was, however, coming into my surgery holding a skeleton. It took my breath away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para4"><a name="stpa_251">So, how did it all begin? Mr. Lambert was teaching at Edge End high school in 1995. Two boys were fighting, and he stepped in to separate them. One of them hit him at the top of his spine, and that is when it all started. The doctors got involved, naturally. I am not going to name individual doctors or clinicians; that would be invidious and there is no need for it. However, Mr. Lambert is totally and absolutely critical of the medical establishment, the way in which it diagnosed his injury and the subsequent follow-up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para5"><a name="stpa_252">The accident, as I say, happened in 1995. In January 1996, a report from a consultant at the Royal Preston hospital stated that there was some bruising to the back and what he described as spontaneous osteomyelitis not caused by the trauma of the blow, which meant that it was just bruising to the spine.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 240WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para6"><a name="stpa_253">The following month, Mr. Lambert was awarded 5 per cent. disability for soft tissue injury; the bruising that I have just described. At no stage were those considering his case aware that scans taken at the hospital showed a fracture to the vertebrae. In November 1996, the medical appeals tribunal entered the frame. Mr. Lambert could not believe what was happening to him. Astonishingly, the tribunal did not apply for the detailed medical records but took at face value the original statement by the consultant that there was just bruising to the spine, a soft tissue injury.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para7"><a name="stpa_254">In early 1997, Mr. Lambert, who wanted to get to the bottom of the problem, saw the hospital records from Preston. He noted that the spine had been fractured. He appealed again, saying that the tribunal did not have all the facts and had not allowed him to speak about his condition. In December 1998, the social security commissioners entered the scene. They set aside the tribunal decision and asked the medical appeals tribunal to look at the issue again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para8"><a name="stpa_255">In June 1999, years after the assault, the medical appeals tribunal requested all the medical records. Mr. Lambert went through them and noted that various documents were missing and that there were various errors. He was told that the person who presided at the tribunal in June 1999 would not preside at the following medical appeals tribunal that December. When the tribunal met again on 13 December 1999, the person who presided was the regional chairman. Mr. Lambert was very concerned because he felt that that should not be the role of the regional chairman. The medical appeals tribunal reaffirmed the previous decision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para9"><a name="stpa_256">That takes us up to 1 March 2001. The appeal to the social security commissioner at an oral hearing was won. The commissioner wanted to get it all sorted out there and then with a meeting with the spinal surgeon and so on. I am told that the solicitor to the adjudicating medical authority advised against that and that he wanted a further tribunal. The process is endless.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para10"><a name="stpa_257">In February 2002, a new schedule of evidence was received and new documents turned up. Some documents were missing and some referred to another individual. So, there were all sorts of anomalies. On 14 May 2002, there was what is known as a direction hearing, at which the chairman of the medical appeals tribunal directed Mr. Lambert to assemble a schedule of the events; documentation of what happened where and when. Mr. Lambert spent hours, days, probably weeks, assembling that documentation. It was a huge labour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para11"><a name="stpa_258">Then came the meeting that changed things. On 19 November 2002, a consultation orthopaedic surgeon gave evidence to the medical appeals tribunal that the blunt trauma, or blow, in 1995 had caused a fracture not mentioned by the consultation in January 1996. That fracture caused the osteomyelitis and the pain that I described. So, Mr. Lambert won his appeal. He was awarded a 20 per cent. disablement, but only for six months, followed by 5 per cent. for life. Such an award does not include any financial recompense. People do not get paid for awards of less than 20 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para12"><a name="stpa_259">So Mr. Lambert&#039;s appeal to the social security commissioners had been successful but he got nothing out of it. Inside, he rages about the unfairness of the matter. He cannot understand some things. He alleges that medical notes were tampered with or, no pun intended, doctored.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 241WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para13"><a name="stpa_260">He also alleges that he saw his GP after the assault and not before. Amazingly, in the statement of reasons for the decision on 19 November 2002, which I just alluded to, we are told that Mr. Lambert
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;saw his . . . GP on . . . 22 April 1995.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para14"><a name="stpa_261">That was the month before the assault took place. Mr. Lambert contests that. He says that he did not see his doctor about his back pain then and that the doctor, amazingly, got his dates wrong. A general practitioner can be forgiven for getting his dates wrong on one occasion, but Mr. Lambert&#039;s general practitioner got his dates wrong on a number of occasions. That is unbelievable. When I read that, I thought, &quot;Is it credible that a professional person such as a doctor would habitually get his dates wrong on medical notes?&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para15"><a name="stpa_262">So, in essence, Mr. Lambert says that the pain that he is suffering was directly caused by the assault of the boy in 1995. The authorities have maintained for years that it was a degenerative back disease and that the assault caused only soft-tissue injury and some bruising, which explains the 5 per cent. disablement award. What a state of affairs it is that such a matter can still be rumbling on after a decade.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para16"><a name="stpa_263">What does Mr. Lambert want? He wants an investigation into how the claim was handled. That is a daunting prospect, given the volume of material, the details, the medical expressions, the questions about who did what, when, and who covered up what, when and for what purpose. However, that is what he wants. He wants 30 per cent. disablement benefit, backdated to 1995. He tells me, because he is an expert in such matters, that his disablement must be the same, and is probably more, than someone losing a thumb. Apparently, one receives 30 per cent. disablement benefit if one loses a thumb. I suppose that the thumb is important to the operation of the hand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para17"><a name="stpa_264">Mr. Lambert also wants this whole business sent to the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council. I took up the matter on his behalf, and I got a letter from my colleague Baroness Hollis of Heigham, who said that the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council does not look at individual cases. It looks at epidemiological work, so there is a sort of road block.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para18"><a name="stpa_265">Mr. Lambert wants someone somewhere to consider critically the doctors who sit on and advise the medical appeals tribunal. He wants people in authority to look behind the medical decisions, to hold the doctors to account, to ask questions and to challenge them. He feels that in his case that did not happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para19"><a name="stpa_266">Mr. Lambert wants the Secretary of State to take another look at his case, as Mr. Lambert thinks that there are probably thousands of voiceless people suffering because they have been mistreated by the system and the authorities. Those people do not know each other and cannot communicate with each other, but he is convinced that what happened to him was not unique. I suppose that it was not. I have been reading the recently published report of the president of the appeals tribunal, which oversees such matters. The president says that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;medical reports under-estimate the severity of the disability and how this might be remedied.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 242WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para20"><a name="stpa_267">He goes on to discuss the quality of medical reports, and how they can be tested to ensure that they accurately reflect the severity of the disability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para21"><a name="stpa_268">I am sure that Peter Lambert has been in touch personally with anyone and everyone who has a connection with this case. Some people may say that he is literally a pain in the neck. That would be a disservice, but he is persistent. He knows what he wants, and he wants answers. He got a letter from the president of the appeals tribunal, his honour Judge Michael Harris. That gave further encouragement to Mr. Lambert, because the judge said that the Secretary of State has powers to look again at what happened
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;if the decision was taken in ignorance of . . . some material fact&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para22"><a name="stpa_269">I am not entirely sure how the Minister will respond. This case is immensely complicated in all its details; but in its essentials, it is pretty simple. It is about how medical opinions can be tested and verified, and it is about getting some expedition into the system and giving people such as Peter Lambert the justice that they think has been denied to them.
</p>


<a name="time_19">
<a name="50712h04_time1"><h5>1.20 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_62"><a name="50712h04_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform  (Margaret Hodge) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) on securing the debate. I am sure that when Mr. Lambert reads our proceedings, he will be grateful for the diligence with which my hon. Friend has approached the case that has arisen in his constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para23"><a name="stpa_270">I will confirm the position regarding the Department&#039;s medical assessment procedures, and I hope that I can answer some of the points that my hon. Friend has raised. I am aware that both he and his constituent have written to the Department and to the previous Secretary of State on these matters. I hope that it will be accepted that I cannot comment on all the individual circumstances surrounding Mr. Lambert&#039;s claim for benefit, but I will make some general points, which I hope will be helpful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para24"><a name="stpa_271">There are three main issues that Mr. Lambert wanted to raise through my hon. Friend. First, there is his belief that he should get more than the 5 per cent. assessment of disablement that he has been awarded. He makes the comparison that has been made in today&#039;s debate between the assessment of 5 per cent. disablement for his condition and the assessment of 30 per cent. for the loss of a thumb. Secondly, there is the question of whether we should have an investigation of the appeal tribunal system of the Appeals Service and of my Department&#039;s medical advisers. I believe that that relates to whether the medical assessment framework has been properly complied with. Finally, the other issue is whether osteomyelitis should be referred to the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para25"><a name="stpa_272">First, let us consider the assessment of disability. The assessment is made by a fully trained medical adviser. Just to put the record straight: doctors on the tribunal are appointed by the Lord Chancellor in consultation with the Government&#039;s chief medical officer. Their training is undertaken after consultation with the chief medical officer, so, I have some confidence, which understandably Mr. Lambert does not, in the quality and calibre of the people that we appoint.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para26"><a name="stpa_273">The assessment of disablement for the industrial injuries disablement benefit is a functional assessment. It tests what the person can or cannot do compared with somebody of the same sex and age whose physical and medical condition is normal. It is not as assessment of the medical condition; it is an assessment of the effect that the medical condition has on a person&#039;s capacity to function normally. The reason why we have that method of assessment is that the same medical condition can have different effects on different people and, conversely, different medical conditions can have a similar effect on people&#039;s functional capacity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para27"><a name="stpa_274">The schedule that the Department uses to assess disability for the benefit involves the expression of a percentage of disablement. That is a bit awkward, but it is the way the system works. Those schedules are contained in legislation, so we operate within that legislative framework. We have a panel of experts who made the determinations on the assumption that the injury occurred in an otherwise healthy person. That is used as the basis of the assessment to look for a loss of function when compared with a normal person. So, the assessment is not about the extent of damage to, or the loss of, body tissue; it is about the effect on functional capacity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para28"><a name="stpa_275">Let us consider the example that my hon. Friend brought to us. His constituent was given an assessment of 5 per cent. because it was decided that the level of disablement from which he suffered was minimal. Both the formal examination findings and informal observations at the tribunal hearing of 19 November 2002 showed almost normal function of the back. The tribunal assessed disablement at 20 per cent. for the period of time when my hon. Friend&#039;s constituent had been in severe pain.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para29"><a name="stpa_276">The decision to decrease the assessment after a short time is justified because the evidence shows that his function had returned to almost normal. The tribunal decided that, although there was some residual loss of function, which it assessed at 10 per cent., there was evidence&#151;I understand that it is disputed, but it was the evidence before the tribunal&#151;of pre-existing problems with the lower back; that was the reason for the assessment of 5 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para30"><a name="stpa_277">In order to be assessed at 30 per cent. in connection with a spinal injury, the person would need to have a marked restriction when bending or straightening, with much-reduced other movements of the spine, such as twisting. There would also be much-reduced movement of the limbs, muscle wasting in the limbs, muscle weakness, and inability to tiptoe, bend or kneel. Those things are pretty well set out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para31"><a name="stpa_278">In the comparison with the loss of a thumb that was made in this case, the assessment of 30 per cent. that was suggested does not relate to the number of bones lost, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 244WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
but to the effect on the function of the hand that such a loss causes. I think that my hon. Friend understood that. The important function of the human hand is the pincer grip, which is formed between the index finger and the thumb. Thus, if the thumb is lost, a major function of the hand is lost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para32"><a name="stpa_279">In the few minutes that I have left, it is worth considering the medical assessment framework. When advising on the percentage level of assessment, the medical services medical adviser considers a list of specific injuries and the accompanying percentage disablements, as set out in the legislation. Those not only set out certain degrees of disablement for specific injuries; they are also used as a guide for assessing the effects of injuries and conditions not listed in the legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para33"><a name="stpa_280">The medical assessment framework is guidance, which was developed in the assessment of industrial injuries claims as one of the training aids on how to relate the effects of injuries that do not appear in the legislation to those that are set out in the legislation. I can reaffirm the explanation given by my predecessor that the medical assessment framework is for guidance only and has no legal status. It is only one small part of the material to which medical advisers have access.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para34"><a name="stpa_281">Disability assessment requires widely based knowledge of what is normal or abnormal, and extensive practical experience. In addition, in the context of the industrial injuries scheme, it calls for tuition in the specific requirements of the scheme and its practical application. That is provided as verbal tuition, demonstration and coaching in the examination setting. It is practical work, which is best learned by demonstration. The medical assessment framework forms just one of the aids to which medical advisers have access. There is no obligation on appeal tribunals to comply with the framework, as the medically qualified members of the tribunals are independent of the Department for Work and Pensions, and their training is a matter for the Appeals Service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h04_para35"><a name="stpa_282">I probably shall not have time in the couple of minutes that I have left to deal with the osteomyelitis issue and whether that should be referred in relation to becoming part of the scheme. However, I undertake to write to my hon. Friend about that aspect of the issue. I understand that his constituent remains dissatisfied with the current assessment of disability for his condition. My response will simply reiterate the position of which he has already been made aware. However, I hope that by responding today in Parliament and by writing to my hon. Friend on the remaining issue, I shall provide him with some satisfaction. If, after reviewing the report of the debate, my hon. Friend has further questions to raise, I shall write to him with a further full response.

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="50712h05_spnew0"><b> David T.C. Davies  (Monmouth)</b>  (Con): Thank you, Mr. Marshall. If it is not out of order, I should like to cut my speech slightly short, so that some of my colleagues will have time to speak in the 15 minutes that I believe are allocated to me.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para0"><a name="stpa_283">In the light of what took place in London last week, let me make it clear that I very much applaud the work being done by doctors, nurses and other health service workers. As Members of Parliament, most of us will have visited our hospitals and GP clinics and will be well aware of the dedication of their staff. Let me make it clear, therefore, that the criticisms that I shall make are criticisms not of the work done by those workers, but of the system and the politicians who run it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para1"><a name="stpa_284">There is much to criticise in Wales. A report published by the Audit Commission in 2004 found that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;the whole system of health and social care is not organised to best effect.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para2"><a name="stpa_285">In its summary, the report noted the following: one in four beds in Wales are being blocked; 17 per cent. of beds are being occupied by patients who should not be in the acute sector; the 40 per cent. increase in the Welsh health budget is not being used efficiently or effectively; and the NHS bodies continue to overspend, with the result that the financial deficit in the NHS has risen from &#163;58 million to more than &#163;100 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para3"><a name="stpa_286">For many people, the problem starts when they want to see a GP outside normal working hours. For many months before the new GP out-of-hours service was set up, senior GPs were warning Assembly Members and, I believe, Members of Parliament, that the Assembly had not done its homework properly and that not enough doctors would be available. The Assembly Health Minister took absolutely no notice, and the resulting shambles was entirely predictable. The service certainly failed me when I needed to use it for my daughter, who fell ill on a Saturday morning and was unable to see a GP. It also failed the Assembly&#039;s Agricultural Minister, Carwyn Jones, who felt compelled publicly to speak out after no doctor was available to see his son.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para4"><a name="stpa_287">Those who give up trying to see a GP out of hours are sometimes tempted to dial 999. If they do, the service that they get is not necessarily any better. According to the latest figures, only 57.5 per cent. of ambulances arrive within the target time frames. That might be partly because so many ambulance crews get tied up waiting with patients at accident and emergency units while beds are found. As the Minister will be well aware, crews cannot drop patients off until the hospital has checked them in, but with A and E units at hospitals such as the Royal Gwent running at full capacity, that can take hours. Meanwhile, more ambulances arrive, which means that fewer crews are available to deal with emergencies.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"><a name="50712h05_spnew1"><b> Adam Price  (Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr)</b>  (PC): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that part of the underlying problem is the lack of capital expenditure in the Welsh NHS? In 2001&#150;02 alone, total capital expenditure on health in Wales was minus &#163;5 million&#151;it was not even positive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"><a name="50712h05_spnew2"><b> David T.C. Davies </b> : I completely agree that capital expenditure plays a huge part in this, but we must also 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 246WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
look at the organisation. If the system does not allow ambulance crews to go back to collecting people who make 999 calls before they have checked their current patient in, that will have a knock-on effect on the whole system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para5"><a name="stpa_288">I think that we would all agree that the greatest failure in the NHS in Wales is waiting list times, which have risen by 73 per cent. since 1999. One in 10 people in the Principality is on some form of waiting list. In September 2004, the percentage of patients on the in-patient waiting list who were waiting more than six months was 36 per cent. in Wales and just 9 per cent. in England. The percentage waiting more than 13 weeks for an out-patient appointment has been falling in England and rising in Wales.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para6"><a name="stpa_289">Behind each of those grim statistics lie thousands of stories of individual patients waiting in pain. One constituent in Monmouth, whom I dealt with as an Assembly Member, was forced to sell his house to pay privately for the hip operation that he needed, because he would have had to wait many years on the NHS in Wales. Had he lived just a mile or so away, on the English side of Offa&#039;s dyke, he would have been seen in a maximum of six months, as opposed to the 18 months that was then the target in Wales.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para7"><a name="stpa_290">Indeed, about two years ago, the local health board in Herefordshire was advising GPs not to recommend any of their patients to go to any Welsh hospital, because the waiting times were so bad. On virtually any measurement, the NHS is worse in Wales than in England. The fact that patients no longer have the right automatically to get treatment in England undermines the myth that our health service is a national one.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para8"><a name="stpa_291">This is what others have said about the NHS in Wales. Someone commented that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;waiting lists are still unacceptably high and there is a danger that if the Assembly does not pursue reform as vigorously as it is pursued in England, the NHS in Wales will fall even further behind.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 18 November 2003; Vol. 413, c. 746.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para9"><a name="stpa_292">Someone else said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;Improvement is badly needed, and slow in coming.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para10"><a name="stpa_293">Another said that one of the
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;concerns I have is the unacceptably long waiting time for orthopaedic operations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para11"><a name="stpa_294">It has also been said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;the response of Ministers has been inadequate and complacent.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para12"><a name="stpa_295">Those are the words not of Conservative politicians, but of three Welsh Labour Members of Parliament who were reluctantly forced to express views that are shared by many who have experience of the NHS in Wales. Despite all that, the Government are now considering giving the Welsh Assembly more powers in devolved areas such as health.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"><a name="50712h05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Stephen Crabb  (Preseli Pembrokeshire)</b>  (Con): Is my hon. Friend aware of the comments of Dr. Tony Calland, the chairman of the Welsh council of the British Medical Association, two weeks ago? He described the NHS in Wales as being &quot;in intensive care&quot;, and said that the interference of the Welsh Assembly Government with the implementation of the Welsh consultants&#039; contract was &quot;unprofessional and distinctly unhelpful&quot;. Is it not a damning indictment of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 247WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Assembly&#039;s administration of this vital public service that our health professionals say that they have no confidence in the Assembly&#039;s role in this matter?
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"><a name="50712h05_spnew4"><b> David T.C. Davies </b> : It is a damning indictment. I was not aware of that quote, but I am aware of one by Roy Lilley, an independent consultant in the health sector who described the Welsh NHS as a basket case, and said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;Wales has the longest waiting lists in Britain and a critical shortage of staff.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para13"><a name="stpa_296">It is clear that the problem is deep rooted. Why, therefore, are the Government considering giving even more power to the Welsh Assembly over health? Given its performance, we should be asking whether the time has come to consider taking powers away from the Assembly, particularly in areas in which it clearly cannot deliver. Ministers and Members will know that there is a clear precedent for that, because central Government have the power to take over certain functions of local authorities&#151;as has the Welsh Assembly&#151;if they consistently fail to deliver. What central Government have given, they should be able to take away. The failure to do so needlessly condemns one in 10 people who live in Wales to languish in pain while they wait for operations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para14"><a name="stpa_297">If we considered taking powers away from the Assembly when it cannot deliver, there would be a huge incentive for the Assembly and its Ministers to improve their performances in areas in which they lag behind England. The Minister for Education and Lifelong Learning has presided over the closure of numerous small junior and infant schools, and is about to authorise Education and Learning Wales to use a new funding formula that will almost certainly lead to the closure of school sixth forms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para15"><a name="stpa_298">Various local authorities have been so underfunded for years that council taxes have risen. In Monmouthshire, they rose by an average of 134 per cent. before rebanding over the past five or six years. If the Ministers responsible for those actions knew that failure to reach a certain level of performance would result in their responsibilities being taken over by central Government and the loss of their ministerial pay, cars and perks, they would suddenly have a strong incentive to deliver.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para16"><a name="stpa_299">I therefore urge the Minister to build clauses into the proposed legislation being proposed to the Assembly that would allow powers to be removed, just as we are considering allowing powers to be added. It should be spelt out to the First Minister that those powers will be used unless there are significant improvements in the Assembly&#039;s performance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"><a name="50712h05_spnew5"><b> Adam Price </b> : Surely, the failures that the hon. Gentleman describes&#151;I do not disagree on them&#151;are those of the Labour Government in Cardiff Bay rather than of democratic devolution. His party wanted to form a Government in Cardiff Bay; surely these are political issues of the failure of the Labour party.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"><a name="50712h05_spnew6"><b> David T.C. Davies </b> : I fully accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. I have no doubt that political decisions taken by the left-of-centre Labour party in Wales contribute greatly to the problem. However, it 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 248WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
will be another two years until a Welsh Assembly election and many people cannot wait that long. If the Assembly cannot do a better job of fulfilling its responsibilities, it falls on central Government to remove those responsibilities, just as we would with a failing local authority in England or Wales. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I am happy to give way again if the hon. Gentleman wants. At the same time as giving away extra powers to the Assembly, the Minister needs to consider the possibility of taking powers away.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"><a name="50712h05_spnew7"><b> Adam Price </b> : The hon. Gentleman is being generous, but is he saying that he has more faith in Labour in London than he has in Labour in Cardiff?
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"><a name="50712h05_spnew8"><b> David T.C. Davies </b> : Amazingly enough, I am saying that with regard to the NHS. The hon. Gentleman has access to the same statistics as I have and they are clear. The NHS in England is in a better situation by far than the NHS in Wales. That is not a political statement, but a statement of fact that he can verify himself. I ask the Minister the same question: does he believe that people receive a better service from the NHS in England or in Wales? Also, does he agree with Welsh Labour MPs who have openly criticised the performance of the NHS in Wales or is he prepared to say publicly that they are wrong?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para17"><a name="stpa_300">For the sake of those who have had to wait hours on trolleys in A and E units, who cannot see their GP on weekends, who suffer the indignity of being assessed on a mixed-sex ward&#151;as many still do&#151;or who are forced to make enormous financial sacrifices, such as selling their house, to get an operation in Wales that they would get in months in England, the time has come for the Government to act. The time has come for central Government to consider making the Assembly relinquish its powers over the health service. The Assembly&#039;s management of the NHS has been a lamentable failure, as many Labour MPs would agree. The Minister should remove the powers of the Assembly to run the NHS and allow central Government to reassert its responsibilities, for the sake of all those who are on waiting lists in Wales.
</p>

<p><a name="st_72"><a name="50712h05_spnew9"><b> Mr. David Jones  (Clwyd, West)</b>  (Con): The failure of the NHS in Wales can be exemplified by the experience of a constituent of mine. Mrs. June Derry is a well known town councillor in Ruthin. She is 73 years old, has worked hard all her life, paid her taxes and national insurance contributions, and over the past few years has developed leg pain. On 8 August last year, she was referred to a consultant at her local centre of excellence for orthopaedic surgery, which is the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt orthopaedic hospital in Gobowen, which is just across the border in Shropshire. She was told that she needed a knee replacement operation. When she asked how long the surgery would take, she was told that because she came from Wales she would have to wait for 18 months. If, however, she had come from England, she would have had to wait for only 17 weeks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para18"><a name="stpa_301">Knowing that this debate was to take place, I spoke to Mrs. Derry yesterday evening. She told me that she was still awaiting that hospital treatment some 12 months later. As yet, she has received no indication of

&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Jul 2005 : Column 249WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
when the operation will take place, but she is in considerable and worsening pain. What is annoying her more than the pain, however, is the knowledge that if she lived just on the other side of Offa&#039;s dyke, she would have received her treatment six months ago. She made a simple point to me that the Minister could perhaps comment on. She said, &quot;I pay my taxes and I have paid my national insurance contributions at precisely the same rate as a patient from England. Why, therefore, do I have to wait five times as long for treatment?&quot; That is a simple question, which a lot of patients in Wales are asking. The answer, as we all know, is because of the Assembly Government&#039;s utter failure on health.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para19"><a name="stpa_302">I request that the Minister telephone Cardiff after this important though short debate and speak to the First Minister and to the Health and Social Services Minister to inform them&#151;as if they do not know already&#151;of the strength of feeling in Wales about the failure on health. He should tell them clearly that, on health, they and the Assembly are drinking in the last-chance saloon. Frankly, it would be wrong to allow political dogma to take precedence over patient care, but that is what is happening in Wales.

<p>
<a name="50712h05_para20"><a name="stpa_303">The Welsh Assembly Government are committed to establishing not just an illness service, to which many Members have referred, but a true national health service that promotes and creates good health and prevents ill health at source. I welcome this opportunity to explain the Assembly&#039;s work in introducing the changes needed in the health service in Wales to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para21"><a name="stpa_304">The Assembly Government have made important progress towards building an NHS and social care services that provide high-quality care that is fashioned to meet the individual needs of patients. For example, 190,000 more people attended hospital via out-patients and accident and emergency departments in 2003&#150;04 than in 1996&#150;97. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of innovative developments in the delivery of health care in his constituency. For example, the operation of Chepstow hospital is unique in Wales, in that it contains both primary and secondary facilities: two GP practices are based alongside the trust&#039;s acute facilities. The hospital features highly in the Monmouthshire local health board plans for the future development of health care services in the wider pan-Gwent review of health care provision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para22"><a name="stpa_305">As in other parts of Wales, the NHS in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency is being refocused on the needs of patients. This year, &#163;4.3 billion will be spent on health in Wales, almost double what was spent the last time his party was in office. In their last year, the Tories spent &#163;640 per person in Wales. By 2007&#150;08, it will be more than &#163;1,800.

</p>




<p><a name="st_75"><a name="50712h05_spnew11"><b> Nick Ainger </b> : The Audit Commission also referred to innovations. It is accepted that more improvement is needed and that, in order to get improvement, there must be investment. The Welsh health service under the Tories was certainly starved of investment.

<a name="50712h05_para23"><a name="stpa_306">In the eight-year period from 1999, real-terms investment in health in Wales will rise by 4.8 per cent. a year. By 2007&#150;08, it will be &#163;5.5 billion. The budget for hospital buildings and equipment, an issue raised by the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price), will rise from &#163;120 million in 2004&#150;05 to &#163;309 million in 2007&#150;08.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para25"><a name="stpa_308">Ambitious new targets have been established to cut waiting times for cancer patients, and trusts in Wales are required to report monthly to the Assembly to ensure that the targets are met. Waiting times for cardiac surgery have also decreased. From April this year, no patient will wait longer than eight months for cardiac surgery, and the Assembly Government will ensure that, by 31 March next year, no patient waits longer than six months. Likewise, from May this year, no patient will wait longer than six months for an angiogram. By 31 March next year, the target will be four months.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para26"><a name="stpa_309">One of the top priorities that the Assembly has focused on in the past 12 months is reducing long waits in Wales. An extra &#163;32 million has been given to the NHS to help meet targets in this financial year.

<a name="50712h05_para27"><a name="stpa_310">The key manifesto commitment for the Assembly Government is that they will ensure that, by 2009, no one will wait more than 26 weeks from GP referral to treatment. To ensure progress towards that target, they have pledged that, by 2007, no one will wait more than 39 weeks.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para29"><a name="stpa_312">The Assembly Government have rightly recognised that waiting times are a serious public concern. Just as in England, the Assembly Government are making important progress towards reducing waiting times. Indeed, the latest data show that half the patients admitted to hospital for an operation from a waiting list had waited only 11 weeks or less.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para30"><a name="stpa_313">Last year, in-patient and day-case waits of more than 18 months were cut by more than 1,300, and waits of more than 12 months were cut by almost 8,000. That shows the progress that has been made as a result of investment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para31"><a name="stpa_314">Last year, out-patient waits of more than 18 months were cut by more than 7,000, and waits of more than 12 months reduced by almost 10,000. In the last month alone, out-patient waits of more than 18 months have reduced by 27, and waits of more than 12 months have reduced by 220. Almost 90 per cent. of accident and emergency patients are seen in under four hours.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para32"><a name="stpa_315">At the end of the day, addressing waiting times and improving the health service are down to increasing the number of staff, buildings and equipment. There are more than 450 more consultants and more than 7,000 more qualified nurses in Wales than there were in 1997.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para33"><a name="stpa_316">By 2010, the Assembly plans to have 525 more consultants and 175 more GPs, 6,000 extra nurses and 2,000 extra other health professionals. The Assembly has doubled the annual medical intake since 1998, and has almost 1,000 senior doctors in training for consultant posts. In addition, the total number of nurse training places commissioned in Wales increased from 3,261 in 2000&#150;02 to 3,750 this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para34"><a name="stpa_317">The Assembly is moving towards abolishing prescription charges by 2007, a measure that is clearly benefiting Mrs. Derry, the constituent mentioned by the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones), although I accept that the problem of waiting times for patients who seek treatment and are referred to hospitals in England needs to be addressed. It is, to say the least, unfair to treat differently patients who are referred to hospitals outside Wales through the traditional commissioning process. That is an equity issue, which the Assembly will have to address.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para35"><a name="stpa_318">The Assembly also aims to make NHS provision attractive for dentists. The hon. Member for Monmouth did not make that point, but it is worth making, because the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr and I have similar problems in our constituencies. More investment needs to be made. The Assembly is handling the issue innovatively. As well as implementing dental initiatives, it is investing more money to ensure that more dentists are attracted to carry out NHS work.

<a name="50712h05_para36"><a name="stpa_319">The reforms being introduced by the Assembly Government are in marked contrast to what happened when the party of the hon. Member for Monmouth was in power. Seventy hospitals closed in Wales under the Tories.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"><a name="50712h05_spnew17"><b> David T.C. Davies </b> : The Minister should be well aware&#151;it is accepted in the Assembly&#151;that that figure is completely misleading. Some of those hospitals closed, some were reopened and new ones were built. He spoke earlier of 10 new hospitals in Wales. Did he mean 10 hospitals in addition to those built under the Tories? Does he not accept that some hospitals will be closed during the next few year, or have their A and E units taken away in order to make way for new hospitals?
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"><a name="50712h05_spnew18"><b> Nick Ainger </b> : The advice that I am given is that 70 hospitals closed between 1979 and 1997. That is a fact. One of the problems inherited by the Labour Government in 1997 was the lack of capacity&#151;in buildings and in staff. Prescription charges increased eightfold under the Tories, whereas under Labour they are being phased out altogether.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para37"><a name="stpa_320">I remind the hon. Gentleman that not so long ago we had a general election, and the Conservatives did not address the fundamental issues that any party would face if it were serious about forming a Government: how to address the problem of capacity and how to recruit staff. All that they could come up with was the expensive and wasteful health vouchers, which would have taken &#163;1 billion a year out of the NHS to subsidise private health care. That policy would benefit those who could afford private care at the expense of the many who cannot not afford it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para38"><a name="stpa_321">Devolution brings government closer to citizens, and it gives the people of Wales greater freedom to develop policies to meet their needs. Wales was the birthplace of the NHS; under devolution, Wales now has a real opportunity to take control over its own health. Devolution is about approaching priorities in a way that best suits local needs. One size does not fit all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50712h05_para39"><a name="stpa_322">The health needs of the people of Wales are not the same as those of the people of England. For example, one third of all adults in Wales&#151;800,000 people&#151;have at least one chronic condition; and 23 per cent. of people in Wales suffer a limiting long-term condition against only 18 per cent. in England. In some areas, the problem is worse. For example, 30 per cent. of people in Merthyr Tydfil suffer such a condition. Of people aged over 65 in Wales, 34 per cent. suffer arthritis, 21 per cent. have a respiratory illness, and 30 per cent. have a heart condition. The incidence of cancer among Welsh men is 10 per cent. higher than in England.

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="50712h05_spnew19"><b> Adam Price </b> : If that is true, why is health expenditure per head lower in Wales than in the north-east of England?

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="50712h05_spnew20"><b> Nick Ainger </b> : That is a decision for the Assembly. I know that the hon. Gentleman and his party have been trying to claim that it is the result of Treasury decisions made in Westminster but, under devolution, the Assembly decides how to spend the money. I have given the hon. Gentleman the figures, which show substantial

increases, including a tripling in three years of capital expenditure. Other expenditure, too, is way above inflation. The hon. Gentleman spoke of one region of England; Wales is spending far more per head than England, but finances in England are now being targeted towards regions with health problems. No one can get away with claiming that investment in Wales is not substantially above the rate of inflation.

his party leader in the Assembly agrees with that policy, nor does his health spokesman, Jonathan Morgan. The hon. Gentleman proposes the complete removal of health care from the Assembly. That shows his failure to come to terms with devolution. It would not be possible to achieve it under the Government of Wales Act 1998, as functions exercised by the Assembly can be transferred back to central Government only with the Assembly&#039;s consent. The hon. Gentleman may be a member of the National Assembly, but I do not believe that he speaks for the majority of his colleagues.
