 Good morning, Mr. Atkinson; I hope that you had a good Easter weekend break. As mine are the opening shots in the House immediately following the break, I am not surprised to see that the Chamber is so sparsely populated. I should be grateful, I suppose, that there are as many Members present as there are. I ask you to give my thanks to Mr. Speaker for granting this Adjournment debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80325h0001.htm_para1"><a name="0803252000011">I am very happy to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson. As you know, I normally occupy the seat in which you now sit, and I am sorry to visit this subject on you. It is the second time I have had to raise the issue. Each time I have spoken in Westminster Hall it has been about subjects that have given me particular concern and immediate pain, in regard to my constituency. I last addressed the Chamber on 25 July&#151;eight months ago&#151;and for the past 10 days I have been racking my brains to try to find something that might have happened in that time to change what I am about to say from what I said then. Sadly, little has changed apart from the fact that the disregard shown towards my constituents and the work force of Remploy has continued, and got worse. I am bound to ask myself, and the House, what on earth has been going on. What have the management been up to? Probably more important for Parliament, what on earth has the Department been doing? Has it been doing anything at all?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80325h0001.htm_para2"><a name="0803252000012">I remind the House that back in July I recorded the fact that the subject first came to my attention by way of a visit from Mr. Waterhouse, of Remploy fame, who wanted to tell me about what he called</p>

He charmed the life out of me, and persuaded me to believe him. Since then, sad to say, chapter after chapter has proved conclusively that he misled me. I do not say that he did so deliberately, but if he did not he must have been a fool. The outcome has been clear evidence of negligence, indolence and dereliction of duty.</p>

At a time when the Government say that they want to move people off benefits and into work, they are going about it in a very strange way.</p>

 I certainly do not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman&#146;s flow; I congratulate him on the work that he has done. In Bradford the Remploy factory has been closed down with little consultation with the work force. Many of the people who worked there have no chance of finding another job and many of those who do so probably will not last long in it. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the social value of the Remploy factories far outweighs their economic cost, simply because&#151;the point he was making relates to this&#151;people do not want to sit at home and get the money that they were getting before, they want to do something worth while, and work?</p>

 That young man has been reading my script. I have been looking to see whether Bradford is identified in a list of factories about to close, and sadly I cannot find it, but I advise the hon. Gentleman to consult the Library debate pack. We must commend the Library for its debate packs. The one for this debate is superb; it contains a list of factories that are closing and the basis on which they are held&#151;freehold, ground lease or leasehold. I advise him to find out which of those applied to Bradford, because I have discovered that the factory in my constituency was freehold. Would you believe it? While consultation was still going on about whether to keep the workers in employment, the factory was up for sale. That is a motive that we have not yet heard about among the arguments. Is this simply a matter of wanting to realise the value of the plots on which the factories sit, and being prepared to sacrifice the workers on the altar of financial gain? It is a serious question, and I hope for a serious answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80325h0001.htm_para6"><a name="0803252000020">I have lost my theme&#151;I shall render that young man redundant at the end of the debate. I was reminding the House that although the Minister said that there had been two years of discussions, eight months later nothing has changed, at a time when the Government are trying to move people&#151;I suppose we should call them recipients&#151;away from benefit and into full employment: yet in the case we are considering, individuals&#151;human beings who have worked for years at Remploy and given sterling service in sometimes difficult conditions&#151;are being put out of work. It does no good for Mr. Waterhouse or the Minister to try to persuade me that those people can be placed safely in mainstream employment, because they cannot. They have characteristics, problems and needs that cannot be provided for in mainstream employment. They have been accustomed to working in a family atmosphere, where one individual takes care of another, or several others&#151;an atmosphere full of compassion and humanity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80325h0001.htm_para7"><a name="0803252000021">Now the idea is to put those employees in the mainstream: we are told they can go into charity shops.

to come in and ask what is on the bottom shelf, when before they were gainfully employed, doing a productive job? The whole thing is farcical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80325h0001.htm_para8"><a name="0803252000022">In July&#146;s debate, the Minister said:</p>
<a name="80325h0001.htm_brev2"><a name="0803252000442"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A misinterpretation has perhaps been given that somehow the people in mainstream employment are there only for a few weeks or a few months at a time...Remploy has a good record of sustaining people in mainstream employment.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80325h0001.htm_para9"><a name="0803252000023">In fact, that is wrong. Most of those who gained any kind of placement in mainstream employment were very temporary and found out within a short time that they did not fit in. Not only are they not happy, but the work force that must accommodate them sometimes do not make them welcome, so was that argument plausible? I prefer to use the term &#147;specious&#148;. That situation has gone on consistently.</p>

I name particularly Mr. Phil Davies, of the union GMB. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i><i></i>I do not find that funny. Mr. Davies, who headed a consortium of trade unions, tried to talk sense. He pleaded with Remploy, asked questions and sought answers. GMB is still awaiting information about the financial state of play that it has requested time and time again. The Minister told us during our last debate that details of the financial considerations had been given, and that the process was to be transparent and open. That has not been the case. It has not been open. She said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80325h0001.htm_para11"><a name="0803252000025">Any discussion must be a two-way process. It is not only a question of hearing; it is a matter of heeding, and that has not happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="80325h0001.htm_para12"><a name="0803252000026">Not only has that not happened, the situation has been made infinitely worse, as anyone will find who looks at early-day motion 809, tabled on 29 January by my good friend and colleague the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham). The early-day motion relates to the issue&#151;it is only one of the issues&#151;of work being moved from his local Remploy factory to Bulgaria. Outsourcing to Bulgaria? I have nothing against Bulgarians&#151;I have spoken in the Bulgarian Parliament on more than one occasion, and I have visited the country several times and helped to educate it away from Soviet methods, if we have managed any progress in that direction&#151;but I must remind the House why Remploy was formed. It was not meant to be a profit-making organisation. Its genesis was in the need to provide employment for disabled servicemen and women who had returned after fighting to defend this country and defeat fascism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80325h0001.htm_para13"><a name="0803252000027">Remploy was set up to give such people a decent way to earn a living and live in dignity. Other disabled people have joined them in those factories since then, and they have provided all sorts of benefits. The factory on the south coast made survival suits at a cost of &#163;20, yet its single franchisee, no more than 300 yards down the street, sold them for &#163;80, and workers could not buy them for less than that. From the outset, it was a strange way to behave and that is the basis of my argument today. The management have been inept, incompetent, incapable and, to my mind, unwelcome, and something ought to be done about it.</p>

During our last debate on this subject I made the point that if I had treated a purchaser in such a way when I was a construction project manager, I would have been sacked out of hand.

It is not just that they have taken the easy way out, or that they are outsourcing work to countries in eastern Europe; it is that the Department, with the exception of Mr. Warren, who responded to my telephone call, has manifestly failed to monitor what the management were doing and to assess their failure to fulfil their responsibilities.

It is not just a question of issuing an instruction, but of ensuring that the instruction is carried out responsibly and faithfully.

 May I start by congratulating the hon. Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook) on securing this debate  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="25 Mar 2008">

today and on reminding us in such a moving way that we are talking about vulnerable people who are not being treated very well?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="80325h0002.htm_para34"><a name="0803252000092">I want to make a brief contribution to the debate and refer to the Remploy factory in my constituency in Poole. It seemed that we had received good news on that factory, because it was proposed for closure and was then reprieved, but it lost its product, which was a marine product. Bearing in mind that we have the headquarters of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in Poole, that we are a major sailing centre and that we are very close to Southampton, we could have secured extra orders from within the vicinity to keep the factory producing that same product.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="80325h0002.htm_para35"><a name="0803252000093">We have been told that there must be a new product in the factory, so what is happening now? The answer is that machinery is being taken away. I am pleased that there is another factory that will be taking on board the orders and that some Remploy employees in Scotland will keep their jobs, but the employees in the Poole factory are seeing, day by day, the machinery being taken away and realising that they will not have orders. There are set dates when the existing orders will just come to an end. The employees in the Poole factory are being offered increased redundancy pay. What should people do in those circumstances? There is uncertainty and bewilderment among the employees, because they do not know what the new product will be and because the factory is being run down. Surely we need to treat people better than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="80325h0002.htm_para36"><a name="0803252000094">I agree with the earlier point that redundancy was not the right option for some Remploy employees, who will sit behind closed doors and not socialise&#151;perhaps they will be tempted into alcohol abuse or all sorts of other problems. We have a responsibility here, and I join the hon. Member for Stockton, North in asking what type of management is that? If management are promising a new product, should they run down their factory and reduce the work force to only 16 to 20 people, who still do not know what the new product is?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="80325h0002.htm_para37"><a name="0803252000095">I recently met the new employee at the Poole factory who will be responsible for public procurement, and the meeting was positive&#151;I liked his approach. I went into that meeting wholeheartedly. I have dutifully written to all the leading people in the town who can form my champions group. I want to lead that group with enthusiasm and vision, but I cannot do so until I have received some answers to my questions. The existing situation in the factory must be stabilised while we search for the new product. Talking vaguely about &#147;scanning&#148;, which is the only example of a new product or new service that I have heard so far, is a long way removed from the skilled techniques required to work on machines that are used to make lifejackets and so on.</p>

The site is large, and I am not averse to half of it being sold to reinvest in a centre of excellence for training the disabled. I realise that we need to change over time, but I want to protect the existing vulnerable work force in Poole. I want to see short-term work in a work situation, the provision of IT suites and the creation of something positive, but others have not developed such a vision.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that comment. As the Minister knows, it is part of my vision to have a training centre for the 21st century, which will have IT suites alongside basic work disciplines. We have to move on, and the returning troops who are disabled will probably be looking for jobs in IT rather than for jobs using sewing machines and so on. We must manage the process properly.</p>

I agree with the hon.

 It is a great pleasure to take part in this debate, although the subject is very serious and very sad. I also apologise for being slightly late in attending today. I congratulate the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="80325h0002.htm_para40"><a name="0803252000101">There has been a Remploy factory in my constituency in Ystradgynlais for many years. Ystradgynlais is a rather deprived part of Wales, at the top of the Swansea valley, and indeed all the communities at the top of the south Wales valleys feel themselves to be at a disadvantage, because they are far away from the more economically active parts of Wales in the south-east around Cardiff, Swansea and the M4 corridor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="80325h0002.htm_para41"><a name="0803252000102">The factory in Ystradgynlais has also been linked with the factory in Brynamman in the neighbouring constituency of Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr. The hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) has been working with me and a range of organisations to see whether we can secure a Remploy presence in the local area, because the factories in Ystradgynlais and in Brynamman have both been earmarked for closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="80325h0002.htm_para42"><a name="0803252000103">The employees in those factories were aware that they had to move with the times and that they had to be as productive and as profitable as possible. They realised that the best way to do that was to bring the two operations on to one site. I have not corresponded with Remploy for some time, but, unfortunately, I do not believe that that merger will be possible, yet the two sets of workers were prepared to make sacrifices and to work together. Indeed, not only were the employees in both factories prepared to work together, but so were the local authorities, the trade unions and all the voluntary organisations that had an interest in Remploy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para0"><a name="0803252000104">The current situation is a huge disappointment&#151;indeed, disappointment is too weak a word. The hon. Member for Stockton, North made the case in a very emotional but very controlled way, and the same views have been expressed by a number of other hon. Members. We are absolutely appalled that, in the most deprived areas, including those of south Wales, we are losing the Remploy presence. Those are the very places where it is most difficult for Remploy employees to find alternative employment, yet they are being denuded of the opportunities provided by Remploy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para1"><a name="0803252000105">Both Brynamman and Ystradgynlais are in the communities first programme in Wales, which is a programme for the 100 most deprived communities in Wales. In those communities, special investment will be made as a result of Assembly intervention, and I am very pleased that that is happening. However, while that investment is going in, the Remploy presence is being removed. Employees are being offered alternative employment, but at a considerable distance from where they live. It is 20-odd miles away, and the public transport is not very good. Naturally, a number of those employees, who have found not only satisfaction in their work but a sense of community and of engagement with their fellow workers, are not happy to be dislocated and moved a great distance from their homes. Remploy provides such people not only with employment, but with the opportunity to find a sense of purpose and of dignity through employment in their community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para2"><a name="0803252000106">We have suffered from a huge loss of manufacturing in those areas, but both of the Remploy manufacturing units were producing a range of desirable furniture for schools and science-based furniture, for which there was a good market. If anyone could claim intellectual property rights, it was those two factories, which developed products that were in demand. I do not want to make this a party political issue, but production is being moved to Baglan, which is 20 miles away from the current factory and is in another constituency. Baglan is part of the M4 corridor and is in the more prosperous part of south Wales, so the move is a huge disappointment. Employees are dismayed that the product that they have driven forward is being taken from them and moved to another Remploy factory that could develop other products.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has made the point that I am trying to make, which is not a political point. The move is bad management and goes against the Remploy philosophy. Remploy was set up to provide employment to unemployed people and to those returning from armed conflict, so that they would have job opportunities in their community through which they could have dignity and self-worth. The project has been badly managed. Employees and the unions have been willing to bend over backwards to ensure that a presence is maintained in the heads of the valleys area, which is among the most deprived areas in Wales. It is a disgrace that Remploy has turned down that opportunity.</p>

As the hon. Member for Stockton, North has said, some of them have worked in the factory for many years and have been loyal and faithful. I understand that the Minister visited the Bradford factory when it was first earmarked for closure, and that eggs and tomatoes were thrown at her. I do not condone such behaviour, but I hope that it emphasised to her how strongly people feel about the closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para4"><a name="0803252000113">The proposed closures mean that many people face uncertainty. Previously, factories that were earmarked for closure were saved, and others that were told they would be saved were earmarked for closure. I hope that the Minister understands that the uncertainty faced by the work force in such situations was incredibly destabilising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para5"><a name="0803252000114">On securing people&#146;s employment in mainstream employment, I sometimes wonder whether an element of political correctness comes into that. Saying that everybody should have a job in mainstream employment is similar to saying that we should close special schools and put everyone into mainstream education. We should have a &#147;horses for courses&#148; strategy. Mainstream employment might work for those who are capable of holding down such a job, but that is not the case for all the people to whom I spoke at the Remploy factory in Bradford, and I am sure that that is true in many other factories. Some of those people readily told me that they would not be able to get jobs elsewhere and would be out of work. Others might get jobs, only to find that those jobs last for just a few weeks. That has already happened, because some people found alternative employment but lost their jobs after a few weeks when things did not work out for them or for the employer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para6"><a name="0803252000115">The hon. Member for Stockton, North made a powerful point about the great problem of the culture of worklessness in this country. There are people who are able to work but do not want to, and there are families who have no culture of work, sometimes for generations. There are people who prefer to sit at home, on benefits, living off the back of the taxpayer. The people who work in Remploy factories are a shining example to everyone. They probably could sit at home, on benefits, living off the taxpayer and not contributing anything, but they desperately do not want that. They have consciously decided not to sit at home on benefits, languishing at the taxpayer&#146;s expense. They want to do something worth while and go out to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para7"><a name="0803252000116">The Government have said that everyone&#146;s employment terms will be protected, even if their factory closes. That is all very well, and I am sure that it gives some comfort to those involved, but it does not take away the reason why those people are working in the first place. They are doing it not because of the money it generates, but because they want to do something worth while. They want to earn their money and do not want to sit at home collecting the money that they were getting before. They want to go out and do something worth while and feel some dignity for their work, but that is about to be taken from them.</p>

There are people in this country who should be in work but who are not, and people have benefits poured on them that they do not deserve. If the Government want to save taxpayers&#146; money, there are plenty of ways for them to do so, but this is not one of them. The social value of Remploy far outweighs the economic cost, and the hard work of the people who work there should be rewarded by some loyalty from the Government. The Government should reconsider what they are doing to the people who work in Remploy factories.

about how Remploy is going about its business four months on from that plan. The original plan was that sales from public procurement through Remploy would rise from &#163;200 million to &#163;298 million, but in the revised plan that the former Secretary of State announced on 29 November that was increased to &#163;461 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para14"><a name="0803252000124">We have heard from my hon.

Despite the fact that she willing to be a local champion and help ensure that the public procurement takes place, no one seems to be doing anything about it and the work force are sitting there, wondering what is happening. In those circumstances, if people say that they do not know what the future is, it is not unexpected that they take redundancy and go on the dole, which is regrettable.</p>

We are within weeks of the start of the new financial year, and it is intolerable that hon. Members and employees in those factories do not know what the product is or what their future will be.

When the original announcement was made, it was claimed that there was the possibility that private enterprise would be found for six factories&#151;those based in Lydney, Glasgow Hillington, St. Helens, Treforest, Ystradgynlais and Brynamman.

 It is a pleasure to serve with you in the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I congratulate the hon. Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook) on securing the debate. I was here for the debate that he secured last July, and the cast of characters was rather similar to today&#146;s debate, as the Minister and the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) were there. It was interesting and moving to listen to the update from the hon. Member for Stockton, North on what has happened in his area, and it is worth drawing attention to the speeches by the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para18"><a name="0803252000131">Given the broad title of the debate, I want to focus on the employment services aspect of the business, which the hon. Member for Rochdale has mentioned, consider how that appears to be going and revisit the philosophical debate about Remploy&#146;s purpose and what the Government&#146;s support for that should be focused on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para19"><a name="0803252000132">The hon. Member for Stockton, North has referred to Remploy&#146;s origins as a business that focused on supporting those who returned from the war having been injured, which is perfectly true, and he mentioned some current conflicts. If one looks further back, one sees that the business was not intended to be a destination where those employees would stay for their entire careers. It was created as a staging post and an opportunity to give those employees somewhere to go when they returned from war, possibly damaged, so that they could be trained, have their capabilities assessed and be moved into employment.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct, right down to the syllable. It is right and proper that we should have that as an end game and a mission statement. Remploy was set up for that purpose, but on a non-profit-making basis. That basis has since changed without any kind of open statement.</p>

 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention. I do not mean to sound facetious, but it is certainly true that Remploy is not a profit-making company&#151;indeed, it gets &#163;110 million of support a year from the Government. The Minister will correct me if I have got those figures wrong. Whatever Remploy is, it is not a profit-making business, but it needs to keep its costs low. The current problem is that the money that the Government quite rightly spend on supporting disabled people&#151;&#163;500 million over five years&#151;has been focused on a relatively small number of people until now, as there are less than 5,000 people in the factory network. As the Minister said when the programme of changes was announced, the aim is to move more of that money to support people to get back into mainstream employment, and we support the broad thrust of those proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para20"><a name="0803252000137">I want to touch on is the nature of what Remploy should be doing. It is perfectly true that for those employees working in the Remploy factories&#151;I had one in my constituency&#151;particularly those who have been employed in them for a considerable time, the change will be unsettling and, potentially, very worrying. I can focus only on how the matter has been handled in my constituency, albeit I recognise that that factory was much smaller than others. I have taken great pains to speak to local management, who were open and transparent about the matter, to discover the destination of each of the individuals employed at the factory and what was sorted out for them. Around half were moved to another sheltered employer, which is run by Gloucestershire county council. Some decided to take voluntary redundancy, some because of their age and some because of what they wanted to do, and some found alternative employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para21"><a name="0803252000138">I am satisfied that every employee has been accounted for, and although one or two of them contacted my office when the proposals were first mooted because they were concerned about the uncertainly, no concerned employees have subsequently come to see me. The concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Stockton, North are not borne out by my experience in my constituency, so his experience in his constituency is clearly different.</p>

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="0803252000139"><a name="80325h0003.htm_spnew12"><a name="0803252000586"><b>Mr. Roger Williams:</b>
 In a sense, the hon. Gentleman is right that certain individuals who are employed by Remploy will be accommodated, although I do not believe that taking redundancy is necessarily a victory, especially when the Government are trying to get people off benefit and into employment. Surely the fact that a centre of employment for disabled people has been lost is a loss not only to the people who were employed there but to other unemployed people in the area who are looking for employment.</p>

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="0803252000140"><a name="80325h0003.htm_spnew13"><a name="0803252000587"><b>Mr. Harper:</b>
 I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman, because he brings me nicely to my next point, which is that in the year since April 2007, Remploy&#146;s employment services business found work in mainstream employment for more than 6,000 people. Actually, it has helped more people into such work than it employs in its entire factory network. That is worth mentioning, because I am told by all the disability organisations that I deal with in my Front-Bench role, and by most of the disabled people whom I deal with, that disabled people want to work in mainstream employment. They want the same chances and opportunities as everyone else, and they want to be able to maximise their potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para22"><a name="0803252000141">I did not agree with the whole of the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley, but one of the points that I very much agreed with is that, generally, many disabled people&#151;certainly those whom I meet who are on incapacity benefit&#151;are absolutely desperate to work and to make a contribution. They need help and support to do so, which is why I want to concentrate the rest of my remarks on the part of Remploy&#146;s business that enables them to do that. Looking at the information that I have received&#151;no doubt the Minister will touch on it&#151;Remploy has indeed had some considerable success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para23"><a name="0803252000142">As I have mentioned, Remploy found work for more than 6,000 disabled people since last year, which is a significant growth of 25 per cent. on the previous year. We should remember that the point of restructuring the factory network is to increase that number still further, and to get 20,000 people into mainstream employment every year. It is clear that that is absolutely necessary if the Minister&#146;s goal, which is also my party&#146;s goal, to get a significant number of people who are currently on incapacity benefit back to work are to be realised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para24"><a name="0803252000143">It is worth mentioning the sort of disabilities that people have. More than one third of the people placed by Remploy have a learning disability or a mental health condition. That is incredibly important, because a significant number of people on incapacity benefit have those challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="80325h0003.htm_para25"><a name="0803252000144">It is also worth looking at the types of work into which those people were placed. Several hon. Members have expressed concern about losing manufacturing jobs. However, because the economy has changed, there will be far fewer manufacturing jobs. Let us look at where Remploy has placed people: one fifth of them were placed in business and financial services; 15 per cent. were placed in education, health and social work; and some 10 per cent. were placed in manufacturing. Those roles are spread across all the different employment sectors, which is a good thing because, again, disabled people do not want to work in manufacturing only&#151;they want the same range of opportunities as anybody else.</p>

For the much larger number of disabled people who can work, however, the range of opportunities that they can fulfil, particularly if employers are flexible, is much greater than many people thought in the past.</p>

Under a programme that it operates in south Wales called healthy minds at work, it works with employers to pick up on mental health problems in the workplace before somebody falls out of work and becomes unemployed. There is a good reason for that:</p>

 It is a delight to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson. I wish to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook) on securing this debate, which, as he said, is his second on the issue. I know that he feels strongly about Remploy, and I hope that we all share his strength of feeling.</p>

I start with the challenge that was thrown down by my hon. Friend, but before I get into that, I should say that I will relay his comments to my assistant private secretary, Paul Warren, whose ears will be burning if he is watching this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para5"><a name="0803252000152">At the beginning of my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution, he threw down a challenge and asked what had changed since 25 July last year. I believe that the phrase he used was, &#147;What has been going on?&#148; Since 25 July, there have been intensive consultations and discussions with trade unions, and between trade unions and the Remploy board. There have been meetings involving the general secretaries, the then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), and me on Remploy and how we plot the way forward. Roger Poole was appointed in August last year to bring an independent mind to the work with trade unions and the Remploy management. For those who are not aware of it, he has extensive experience on the trade union side as a former assistant general secretary of Unison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para6"><a name="0803252000153">The then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath, made a statement on 29 November 2007, after which he took numerous questions. Although hon. Members might still have issues with some of the details, there was general support at that point for the direction of travel in which we are taking Remploy. I hope that it will give my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North some confidence to know that, since then&#151;in fact, in the past few days&#151;the first high-level monitoring meeting, chaired by me, has taken place between the trade unions, Remploy&#146;s chairman and chief executive and my senior officials to review exactly how the plan has been implemented.</p>

Members share the view that, to make the process work, it is not just about words and the plan that was delivered on the 29 November: this is a living plan that has to be monitored, not least in the interests of the disabled workers currently employed by Remploy, the disabled people no longer employed by it and the 20,000 disabled people whom we want to get into employment using Remploy as the vehicle.</p>

to receive a significant, multi-million pound amount in support from the Government. Indeed, the last out-turn figure on the grant in aid from the Department for Work and Pensions for 2006-07 was &#163;133.8 million. We want to ensure that more disabled people benefit from the input from that resource.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para9"><a name="0803252000156">Let me also be clear that we have never said that there is no room for sheltered factories, or supported employment as it is now called. We also continue to give support to the Remploy factories that continue to operate. Through our Workstep programme, we support people in some 83 factories throughout the country. Many of those factories are managed by the voluntary sector and some by the private sector, and others are run by local government. There is no change&#151;our support should be there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para10"><a name="0803252000157">We want to ensure that we support disabled people into employment. However, we also have to recognise that the ambitions and aspirations of disabled people have changed over time. As the hon. Member for Forest of Dean said, in July last year the six big disability charities were prepared to go public and say that they supported the general direction of travel that we were taking. It is not about getting fewer disabled people into employment; it is about getting more disabled people into employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para11"><a name="0803252000160">My hon. Friend is right: some work&#151;shelf manufacture &#151;is being done temporarily in Bulgaria while the factory at Neath gets up to speed. Remploy has to do that to maintain customers for the products that will eventually go to another factory. Otherwise, we will lose not only the factory but the customers. Although it almost makes for an amusing anecdote, the work has to be outsourced until we get that position stabilised.</p>

In Hartlepool, nearby, there were 5,000 Jobcentre Plus vacancies and 650 disabled people moved into jobs.</p>

I understand that the only person who drives a Mercedes car is the chief executive, whose terms and conditions and salary package have allowed that. For the benefit of colleagues, it is a taxable benefit. As far as I am aware, no one else in Remploy drives Mercedes cars.</p>

The work was transferred because there is now only work for one factory. I hope that I can give the hon.

 I thank Mr. Speaker for granting permission for the debate. I welcome the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, and the Front-Bench spokesmen for the two other main parties, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) and the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake). I commend the work of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough, particularly on the recent Conservative party proposals on radically reforming our prison system.

I believe, as do my constituents, that imprisoning people for committing a criminal offence is appropriate in many circumstances and that prison works. However, the present system does not work. Too many prisoners have to spend their time in overcrowded conditions and reoffending rates have increased during the past decade, which suggests that the prison system is not working as it should. Indeed, the prison population has soared from 61,000 prisoners in 1997 to just over 82,000 today. I hope that the Minister will give us the latest up to date figures on how many people are held in jails in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para20"><a name="0803252000176">It is perhaps more distressing that reoffending rates have also risen: from 57 per cent. in 1997 to 66 per cent. now. Worryingly, one of the reasons for the increase in reoffending is the increase in overcrowding. As of 31 January this year, 84 prison establishments in England and Wales, which is 60 per cent. of the prison estate, were overcrowded. In 14 of those establishments, the population was more than 150 per cent. of the certified normal accommodation.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right; overcrowding is a factor in the increase in the number of prisoners who reoffend. However, does he also accept that it might partly be because prison is like a holiday camp, as one prisoner told the Secretary of State last week? About 1,500 prisoners have Sky TV in their cells, five prisons have swimming pools for use by inmates and two thirds of prisoners have keys to their cells. One custody sergeant told me that the biggest deterrent to people committing crimes was the prospect of going to prison for the first time, but once they had been to prison, it was no deterrent at all&#151;their friends were there and it was not half as bad as they expected it to be. Does my hon. Friend accept that such a situation also leads to reoffending?</p>

their concerns. I agree with his analysis. Indeed, with his permission, I shall later quote extensively from the debate on prisons that he initiated in Westminster Hall almost exactly a year ago. I shall quote some of the statistics that he mentioned at that time on why prison works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para23"><a name="0803252000181">I agree with my hon. Friend: in many cases prison is far too cushy. Like him, I was on the police parliamentary scheme for a year. I spent 22 days with the Northamptonshire police, and again and again police officers told me that in many cases prison is no longer a deterrent. If somebody has not been to prison before, it might be a deterrent, but once someone has been to prison that is no longer the case. For career criminals&#151;who are becoming younger and younger&#151;incarceration is considered a career break or a holiday. Prison is not intimidating to such people in any way. In fact, the quality of life for many individuals is higher in prison than when they have to do an honest day&#146;s hard work in their home town. I agree with my hon. Friend: prison is neither the deterrent that it once was nor that it should be. I shall explore those issues later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para24"><a name="0803252000182">We must stress the fact that there should be a rehabilitative element to prison. People should not simply be put in prison for a set time without attempts being made to change their attitude and behaviour. Overcrowded jails result in the rehabilitative process being damaged. It is not simply that people are not serving their sentences in full, as I and my hon. Friend would like them to do, but that they are not being properly prepared for release once their sentence has finished. The overcrowded state of our jails means that it is not possible to provide the rehabilitative programmes that should be in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para25"><a name="0803252000183">I quoted some figures on the present level of overcrowding. Another statistic is that some 17,000 prisoners are doubling up in cells&#151;twice as many as when the Government came to power. More than 1,000 of cells designed for two people are actually being occupied by three, which means that nearly a quarter of the entire prison population is housed in cells designed for one fewer person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para26"><a name="0803252000184">Because the prison system is not working as it should, emergency measures have been introduced that have resulted in the early release of violent offenders. Community sentences command small and declining levels of public confidence. In short, the prison system simply is not working. It is not that the Government have had no notice of the growth in the prison population. They have been aware of projections about the size of the prison population, but they have done too little about building prisons to house the extra prisoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para27"><a name="0803252000185">I believe that prison works, and for the benefit of Members I shall reprise some of the statistics that startled me when I first heard them a year ago when they were mentioned in this Chamber by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley. In terms of absolute numbers, Britain has a relatively high prison population, but that in itself should not be surprising as we are a relatively highly populated country. As my hon. Friend pointed out, again and again the prison population is given in terms of numbers of prisoners per 100,000 of population, but in fact we should be looking at the number of prisoners per 100,000 crimes. Let us consider that and see what the result is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para28"><a name="0803252000186">If we consider the number of prisoners per 100,000 of population, the figures are near the average, but are still quite high. However, if we consider the number of  <br>

prisoners per crime, we have the lowest prison population in the western world&#151;lower than the US, Canada, Australia and other EU countries. For every 1,000 crimes committed in the UK, we have approximately 13 prisoners, compared with approximately 15 in Canada and Australia, well over 20 in the rest of the EU as a whole, and a whopping 166 in the US.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para29"><a name="0803252000187">We are told that prison does not work. Let us examine the evidence. In fact, the evidence shows that prison does work in reducing crime. The country with the lowest prison rate in terms of prisoners per crime, which is the UK, has the highest crime rate&#151;more than 10,000 crimes for every 100,000 people. However, the country with the highest prison rate, the US, has the lowest crime rate&#151;about 4,400 crimes for every 100,000 people. Canada, the country with the second lowest prison rate, has the second highest crime rate. The EU has the second highest prison rate and the second lowest crime rate. Prison also helps to prevent reoffending.</p>

 I am flattered that my hon. Friend is using some of the arguments that I deployed in the debate a year ago. Does he agree that it is blindingly obvious that countries with the highest prison populations have the lowest crime rates, because the more criminals who are locked up in prison, the fewer who are out on the streets committing crimes?</p>

 As usual, my hon. Friend is spot-on. One reason for the reduction in the crime rate over recent years is that a large number of extra people, particularly violent offenders, have been incarcerated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="80325h0004.htm_para30"><a name="0803252000190">The other point about prison is that it helps to reduce reoffending. I shall explore some of the statistics. Just before Christmas 2006, the Home Office sneaked out a report on reoffending. Entitled &#147;Re-offending of adults: results from the 2003 cohort&#148; and published in November 2006, it concluded that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para0"><a name="0803252000191">It is worth repeating that: with sentences of up to one year, the reoffending rate was 70 per cent., while in cases involving a sentence of more than two years, the reoffending rate dropped to 49 per cent. The report went on to show that for people who had spent more than four years in prison the reoffending rate was merely 35 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para1"><a name="0803252000192">That suggests that when prisoners serve their sentence in full, they are less likely to reoffend, and when they serve more time in prison, they are also less likely to reoffend, whereas in the current system prisoners are increasingly not serving their sentences in full, and in far too many cases the Government are trying to ensure that people who should be going to prison do not go to prison at all but serve some kind of community sentence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para2"><a name="0803252000193">It would be wrong to have a debate on prison policy without examining in some detail the sort of people who go to prison, because there are some extremely sad stories about why people drift into a life of crime and there are startling statistics about what makes someone an offender. I want to draw Members&#146; attention to some of those characteristics.</p>

of the population. Forty-three per cent. of prisoners had a family member who had been convicted of a criminal offence, and 35 per cent. had a family member who had been in prison. Eighty-one per cent. of prisoners were unmarried.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para4"><a name="0803252000195">Half of male and one third of female sentenced prisoners were excluded from school. Half of male and 70 per cent. of female prisoners have no qualifications whatever. Two thirds of prisoners have numeracy skills at or below the level expected of an 11-year-old. Half have a reading ability and 82 per cent. a writing ability at or below that level. About 70 per cent. of prisoners suffer from two or more mental disorders; in the general population, the figure is 5 per cent. for men and 2 per cent. for women. We all know that prisoners are more likely to be abusers of illegal drugs and alcohol than other sectors of the community. Nearly three quarters of prisoners were in receipt of benefits. Almost one third were not living in permanent accommodation immediately before imprisonment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para5"><a name="0803252000196">Those are very sad statistics. I am all for putting people in prison when they commit criminal acts, but it is important to remember the backgrounds of many of those people. That is why we need to get rehabilitation right&#151;to help to prevent them from reoffending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para6"><a name="0803252000197">A disgraceful statistic is the number of foreign prisoners held in British jails, which has increased alarmingly in the past 10 years. While the British prisoner population has increased from just under 57,000 in 1997 to just over 67,000 today, the number of foreign national prisoners in British jails has increased from just under 5,000 to just over 11,000&#151;a staggering 142 per cent. increase. Now, more than 14 per cent. of our prison population is made up of foreign national prisoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para7"><a name="0803252000198">Constituents in Kettering and people throughout the country are simply staggered as to why we are imprisoning so many foreign nationals when we should be negotiating with their countries of origin to ensure that they are sent back to the countries from which they came, to appropriate incarceration there. It must be possible to sort out a system whereby that could be arranged, because 11,000 places are taken up by people who are nationals of another country. There are British prisoners serving time in foreign jails, but I dare to suggest that their number is far smaller than the number of foreign nationals serving time in British jails.</p>

 I absolutely agree. I am very much looking forward to what the Minister has to say on that aspect of the debate today, because my understanding is that, as the law stands, foreign national prisoners can be sent back only with their agreement. The Minister is shaking his head; I would welcome clarification of that point later. If that is not the case, I agree with my hon. Friend&#151;why should those people not be returned at the earliest opportunity? If they are returned, they must be returned to suitable incarceration in their own countries; they should not be returned just so that they can be at large. Many people in this country regard that aspect of our penal system with dismay and simply do not understand why the situation has become so bad and why the increase has been so great in the past 10 years.</p>

If I am wrong about that, I would welcome clarification from the Minister, but surely we could have an agreement with those countries&#151;two of them are members of the Commonwealth and we share many close links with the other one&#151;to provide a far more suitable arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para9"><a name="0803252000202">The figures relating to the type of offences that were committed by sentenced prisoners in jails are revealing and rather put to bed the myth that lots of people who have committed non-violent, minor offences are serving time in prison. In fact, most prisoners are in prison because they have committed some very nasty crimes indeed. In the top five categories of crime committed by sentenced prisoners, who account for two-thirds of the prison population, 23 per cent. are serving time for violence against the person, 13 per cent. for drugs offences, 11 per cent. for robbery, just under 10 per cent. for burglary and 9 per cent. for sexual offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para10"><a name="0803252000203">Another myth is that lots of people are serving only short periods of time in prison. However, that is not the case. More than half the total sentenced prison population are serving sentences of more than four years. More than 87 per cent. are serving sentences of more than one year, and only 8 per cent. are serving sentences of less than six months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para11"><a name="0803252000204">It may not be understood that prison is largely reserved for repeat offenders. Of those receiving an immediate custodial sentence, only one in 10 is a first-time offender. Most will have previously committed serious offences. Only 12 per cent. of those sentenced to prison have no previous convictions. Over half of those sentenced have five or more previous convictions. Since 2000, the proportion of people coming before magistrates for the first time has fallen by 10 per cent., while the number with more than 10 previous convictions has increased by 36 per cent. Given those realities, how are courts meant to deal with persistent offenders other than by using custody?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para12"><a name="0803252000205">We have a huge revolving door for people who are sentenced to prison. They almost never serve their time in full; they are let out only to commit more crimes before they are put back into the system, appearing before the courts and then resentenced. That was the concern of police officers in Kettering when I spent time on the police parliamentary scheme. On the walls of Kettering police station are pictures of all the persistent and prolific offenders in and around the area. Their photographs, dates of birth and addresses are known to every police officer in the force. The question I asked every police officer was: if those 50 people were in prison what would happen to crime rates in Kettering? The answer every time&#151;whether from a junior or a high-ranking officer&#151;was that crime would almost disappear, leaving officers time to concentrate on the minor offences that cause such concern in the local community.</p>

 Indeed. This time, the proposals are about reforming prisons. Prison reform was one of the remarkable aspects of the Victorian period. For the first time, it was identified that if appropriate penal institutions existed, there would be no need simply to punish offenders; one could reform their behaviour and attitude and rehabilitate them.

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para22"><a name="0803252000217">Now is the time for radical reform of our prison system. If we just carry on as we are, our prisons will be even more overcrowded, the reoffending rate will go up and more crimes will be committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para23"><a name="0803252000218">I end my remarks by focusing on young criminals in prison. I have been contacted by Mr. Gordon Raku of Burton Latimer in Kettering, who is a retired Royal Signals captain. He said that he would very much like to see the introduction of some sort of military component in the reform of the attitude and behaviour of young and juvenile prisoners. I raise that point because I agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para24"><a name="0803252000219">In preparing for the debate I found that, as of 31 January, there were 2,243 juvenile prisoners aged between 15 and 17 in our prison system and 9,420 young adult prisoners aged between 18 and 20&#151;the figures were provided by the House of Commons Library&#151;so a total of 11,663 young people, or 14 per cent. of the prison population, were aged 20 or under. Almost 50 per cent. of male juvenile offenders are serving sentences for either robbery or violence against the person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para25"><a name="0803252000220">Mr. Raku, my constituent, is keen for a system to be devised whereby those young offenders are exposed to military discipline for a set length of time to correct their inappropriate attitude and behaviour. It would be a version of national service. He makes the point that in the 1950s and 1960s, lots of people who served time in national service did not particularly look forward to the experience but, looking back, time and again they say that those were the best years of their lives&#151;all hon. Members will know of similar people from their constituencies. They say that they learned a lot about themselves; they gained self-respect and learned how far they could push themselves. As Mr. Raku asks, is it not possible to expose young prisoners, who are relatively few in number, to some sort of military discipline? I believe that if such a measure could be effectively applied at a young age, it would help to lower reoffending rates.</p>

I urge the Minister and his counterparts in the MOD to look at whether there is some way of making greater use of the MOD&#146;s resources to get some of the very young offenders who find themselves in prison back on the straight and narrow at a relatively early stage.</p>

Gloucester Leyhill category D prison, Eastwood Park, the women&#146;s prison, and, on Good Friday, Ashfield young offenders institution to meet its new governor. In a previous incarnation, I taught the new governor business studies in a university department that taught people how to teach. I am not quite sure how she became a prison governor, but she was at Kilmarnock before arriving in Ashfield, so I may have done some good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para28"><a name="0803252000224">Although I agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said about causes, I do not go along with the remedies that he has proposed, because they would take the evolution of prison policy backwards rather than forwards. In my experience, prison is not a pleasant place. The prisoners to whom I have spoken over the years do not want to be there; rather, they are there through circumstance. I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s categorisation of why people end up in prison, and I do not believe that it was a parody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para29"><a name="0803252000225">Some years ago, Gloucester prison conducted an anonymous snapshot poll of its population. It found that if it eliminated prisoners who had experienced more than three of mental illness, abuse as a child, learning disabilities allied to exclusion from school, drug and alcohol problems, and serious broken homes, including time in care, it would be left with only six prisoners out of a population of 350. I do not believe that all things are predetermined, but some people end up in prison because of their life experiences, which is why it is important to do things with them while they are in prison and in rehabilitation, and why we should spend money on resettlement and invest in people after prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para30"><a name="0803252000226">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that too many people become part of the revolving door syndrome, but that is no reason not do as much as we can to keep people out of prison. Prison is expensive, and it ruins lives. We must bear in mind that people are there because they have committed a crime, and the victims need to know that the perpetrators are serving time, but we must do as much as possible to prevent people from going back into prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para31"><a name="0803252000227">I want to concentrate on a small number of issues. People make generalisations and talk about the norm, but I have found anything but in prisons. Instead, I have found lots of good working and investment in education, for example. I am aware that a recent report was heavily critical of drugs policy, including counselling, assessment, referral, advice and through-care schemes, but the prisons that I have visited have worked incredibly hard on such matters as getting people to detox and to move on. There is a view that the best way for people to detox is to go to prison. I do not follow that logic, but we criticise the work done in prison medical and hospital services at our peril, because it is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="80325h0005.htm_para32"><a name="0803252000228">Despite the fact that there is underinvestment, I support moving prison medical responsibility to the NHS, although that has had the bizarre counter-productive effect of some people not knowing what medical conditions prisoners have. Of course, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS puts prison officers at risk. More particularly, I have heard of cases in which people who have epilepsy and diabetes have been difficult to treat, because such information is confidential unless the prisoner makes it known. Difficulties can result from such circumstances, at least in the short run.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para0"><a name="0803252000229">On the current issues, I make no apology for saying that I am not in favour of further privatisation. As I have said, however, I visited Ashfield, which is run by Securicor and found that it is a much better place now than it was when it first turned into a youth offender institution. However, that is largely because Securicor recruited top people from the public service to run the prison. It has stabilised the work force and introduced a proper regime for the prisoners, which is as it should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para1"><a name="0803252000230">I am not in favour of the National Offender Management Service&#151;I have made my views on that known in previous debates&#151;because I have always supported the independence of the probation service. I am worried that lumping the probation service under NOMS and regional offender management schemes will have entirely the wrong impact. The Prison Service is less concerned about the changes, but, if it sees them as a front for privatisation, organisations such as the Prison Officers Association will be more likely to flex their muscles in opposition. I am wary of those developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para2"><a name="0803252000231">I agree with the hon. Gentleman on titan prisons. I have been to Bristol prison&#151;I have not been to Dartmoor but some of my constituents are resident there&#151;and I worry about moving people further away from where they normally reside. There is a lot to be said for keeping people as locally as possible: their families can visit and, more importantly, proper provision can be made for them after they leave prison, so that they can re-enter their communities&#151;hopefully with a job, somewhere to live and some purpose in life&#151;rather than return to prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para3"><a name="0803252000232">Another issue on which I wish to concentrate does not relate to prison policy per se, but it is very current. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Inquest are running a campaign on the use of restraint on young offenders. In the past week, we have had the Joint Committee on Human Rights report on the issue, which was a bit critical of the Minister&#146;s performance before the Committee, but I want to give him an opportunity to say where he is going. Of course, restraint needs to be used when people are incarcerated, particularly where young people might damage themselves or others, but the issue for me is staff training and the need for clear rules, as well as the need to ensure that people get medical support if they are injured. The Adam Rickwood and Gareth Myatt cases are still highly pertinent, and I worry about secure training places. We were supposed to be getting one at Sharpness in my constituency, but policy has changed, and we have kept the number of secure training centres to an absolute minimum. However, I question how they are run, the nature of the regime and how we deal with those who are potentially at risk or who cause problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para4"><a name="0803252000233">In my experience&#151;this is purely anecdotal&#151;the key to running any prison or young offenders institution is good leadership, and strong governors are vital. The regime must be transparent and clear to all concerned. We must ensure that the staff are as much a part of the decision-making process as the management. We must also ensure that the prisoners understand the regime and what they are expected to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para5"><a name="0803252000234">On the question of why we have so many foreign prisoners, the reason is very simple: we live in a much  <br>

more mobile world now, and many more people choose to get on a plane and come to our part of the world. One suggestion, which has been put to be me on a couple of occasions&#151;I would be grateful if the Minister were to respond to it&#151;is that if we have a high prevalence of Jamaican, Nigerian and, to a lesser extent, Irish prisoners, we should look at paying to build jails in those countries and at investing properly in running them, so that we can return some people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para6"><a name="0803252000235">One of the saddest things about going to Eastwood Park is the number of drug mules who, for whatever reason, have come from Jamaica. They will spend a good deal of time away from their families and are almost certainly completely naive. I do not go along with the idea that they did not really understand that what they were doing was not right, but they were naive about what would happen to them if they were arrested. Often, they will have been put under duress by male partners or by others who have got to them, and it is desperately sad to see them serving a sentence miles away from their children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para7"><a name="0803252000236">We might be able to return such people to properly run prisons in Jamaica and Nigeria, and I hope that the Government will not see such expenditure as flippant, but as a serious suggestion. To put the issue in simple terms, it costs about &#163;4,000 per person to keep someone locked up in Jamaica, compared with &#163;50,000 to &#163;60,000 in this country. We could do something of mutual benefit on that, and I hope that the Minister will respond and see such investment as a genuine solution to the problem of the growing number of foreign prisoners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para8"><a name="0803252000237">To conclude, I do not go along with simplistic remedies, because the situation in prisons is complex. Sadly, some people end up in prison, and we must treat them humanely, but we must also do much more to ensure that they do not return to prison, because of the cost to the public purse and, particularly, the cost to our communities, which have been ravaged by those problems.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings, for what I think may be the first time. It is also a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who gave us a series of important points and some interesting ideas. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on his powerful and thoughtful speech. He leads on the issue of law and order in north Northamptonshire, where he has been courageous in his comments and where he has not been afraid to be outspoken when he has thought that necessary. I have learned again today of his interest in this issue, and he has posed a number of important questions, which I hope that the Minister will be able to answer. It is good to see such an able Minister with us, although, unfortunately, I will have to leave at 12, so I apologise that I will not be able to listen to his response.</p>

are fed up with people being sentenced to five years, only to finish up serving two. They do not think that the sentence fits the crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para10"><a name="0803252000240">My constituency includes Wellingborough prison, which is nearly always overcrowded. It has a large area of land but a relatively small amount of accommodation. Why is that accommodation not being expanded? The Government are interested in building very large prisons, but it would seem much more cost-effective just to expand prisons such as Wellingborough. I do not understand why that is not being done. I spoke to the governor, who said that only modest expansion is planned for the prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para11"><a name="0803252000241">I should declare an interest at this point. At 9.35 on Saturday night, I was sitting in my house about to watch England lose some wickets in the test match, when there was a loud explosion. Someone had attacked my house. They had stuck a stake through my front door. There was an enormous mess. The sound was the result of the panes of glass exploding and the vacuum going between them. Somebody, or a number of people, had walked up my road with a stake&#151;my house is very accessible and is just in a row of ordinary detached houses&#151;and stuck it through the front door.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para12"><a name="0803252000242">Do I want to see that person caught and put in prison? Well, the initial answer is yes. I believe that prison works, but would it work if that person was put there for six months? Probably not. The point that has been brought home to me by prison officers at Wellingborough prison, who have taken the time to come to see me in my surgery, is that they do not have enough time to deal with prisoners or to give them any sort of education or chance to get back into society in an improved situation. All that happens is that people go into prison, come out again and commit another crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para13"><a name="0803252000243">Those prison officers have put a radical proposal to me. When I first heard it, I thought that it was not a very good idea, but when I reflected on it, I realised that it had a lot of merit. Let us say that the person who attacked my house was caught and that the judge had the option of putting them in prison for six months. The prison officers I spoke to suggested that instead of being sent to prison, that person should be told, &#147;That&#146;s your last chance. We&#146;re not sending you to prison now. But if you reoffend, we will send you to prison for five years.&#148; The reason why they argued that was that if someone is in prison for that length of time, staff really have a chance to give them the education and training that they need so that they are in a position not to reoffend when they go back into society. When there are reoffending rates of 70 per cent. or 49 per cent., something is going dreadfully wrong. The proposal was a radical one, and came from someone who had worked in the prison service for a considerable number of years. I think that a variation of it would have some merit, and I urge the Minister to take the idea on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para14"><a name="0803252000244">An exciting thing that is happening in my constituency is the Rose project, which is based in Finedon and is, I believe, partly funded by the Home Office. It targets persistent offenders. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering mentioned, if we took the 50 persistent offenders out of Kettering, there would be hardly any crime. The police run the project, and they say that if it were possible to get hold of those persistent offenders, get them off drugs and into employment, get them decent  <br>

housing and monitor them, they would not reoffend, and an enormous amount of crime would be prevented. I think that the project has been very successful. I know that it is due for more funding, and I do not know whether the Minister can speak about it in particular, but it is such projects, targeting persistent offenders, that probably create the most benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para15"><a name="0803252000245">As there is a prison in my constituency, the final point that I should make is that when the prison officers went on strike, I went to talk to them on the picket line. They are a terrific bunch of men and women, who dedicate their lives to public service. To be on a picket line was unnatural for them&#151;they did not want to be there. They could not wait to get back to the prison, but they had been driven into a situation in which they felt they had no alternative. The Government were wholly wrong to break an agreement with a group of people who do not have&#151;</p>

 The Government did not break any agreement with the Prison Officers Association. Both it and the Government had signed up to a voluntary no-strike agreement until May, which still stands. The prison officers unilaterally withdrew from that agreement without any notice to the Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="0803252000247"><a name="80325h0006.htm_spnew1"><a name="0803252000609"><b>Mr. Bone:</b>
 Forget the spin; I do not want to take the union&#146;s or the Government&#146;s point of view. Those men and women believed that they had a guarantee that they would get whatever their pay review body said they should have, and that in return they would not go on strike. That is what they felt; they may be wrong. However, the episode has done nothing for morale in the prisons. If what has happened is part of prison policy, something has gone fundamentally wrong. Even if the Government are right, the fact that the prison officers took that action shows that something has gone wrong. I hope that something is happening in the Prison Service to readjust the situation and to rebuild confidence for the people who have to run our prisons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para16"><a name="0803252000248">I conclude by expressing my appreciation for all the work that prison officers do at Wellingborough prison.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on another excellent speech, which was, as ever, well researched. He is one of the politicians in this place whom I most admire, for his dedication and hard work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para17"><a name="0803252000250">I am delighted that my hon. Friend established a few facts that are not usually given much publicity, such as that the number of people in prison in this country as a proportion of crimes committed is low&#151;a figure that is not usually quoted&#151;and that prison works. As my hon. Friend said, the Government admit, in their quarterly report, &#147;Reoffending of Adults&#148;, that the longer people spend in prison the less likely they are to reoffend. Reoffending rates are highest among those people who spend the least time in prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para18"><a name="0803252000251">It is a surprise that prison is so successful in reducing reoffending, given the points that I made earlier about how cushy it can be.

to explain how giving 1,500 prisoners Sky TV in their cells, not in communal areas, helps their rehabilitation. There are lots of hard-working, decent people in my constituency who would love Sky TV and cannot afford it. They think, as I do, that it is outrageous that although they&#151;decent, law-abiding people&#151;cannot afford it, 1,500 people who have either persistently committed crimes or committed serious crimes have Sky TV in their cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para19"><a name="0803252000252">There is a crisis of confidence about the criminal justice system in this country. I guarantee that if someone were to commit a serious crime, and I were to go to my local pub and tell someone there, &#147;Did you know that that chap got five years in prison?&#148; the first reply from one of my constituents would be, &#147;Well, he&#146;ll be out in five minutes anyway. It doesn&#146;t make any difference.&#148; That is the level of people&#146;s confidence in the criminal justice system, and it is why I think it important, as does my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering, that prisoners should serve in full the sentence handed down by the court. We must have honesty in sentencing, and someone who is given five years in prison should serve five years. People should be kept in longer for bad behaviour, not let out early for good behaviour. When I went to school, if I behaved properly I was allowed to leave on time; if I misbehaved, I was given detention. I have no idea why the same principle cannot apply to prisons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para20"><a name="0803252000253">I want to touch on the question of short prison sentences. I shall gloss over some of the more cushy prison arrangements that irritate me, such as the one announced by the governor of Wakefield prison, near my constituency, just before Christmas: that the prison officers would go round the prison at night in slippers, so as not to wake the inmates. I cannot really relate to that kind of approach. I want to talk particularly about prison sentences given by magistrates. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering, when I took part in the parliamentary police scheme I asked police officers what would happen if the top 10 or 20 persistent offenders were sent to prison, and I was told that the crime rate locally would be reduced by 50 per cent. or even up to 90 per cent. It is clear that the police are for ever chasing the same people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para21"><a name="0803252000254">The majority of people who are sent to prison by magistrates have a drug addiction, and addiction fuels a lot of crime. People commit crimes to pay for their addiction, and a few people commit tens or even hundreds of crimes a week to do that. As hon. Members know, the maximum sentence that a magistrate can give for one offence is six months in prison. If someone pleads guilty, a discount will be given for that; probably a third will be knocked off, leaving a sentence of four months. We know that probably no more than half the sentence will be spent in prison, so magistrates really give maximum sentences of two months in prison. Someone who is a drug addict and who goes to prison will come out two months later still a drug addict, to return to where they lived before, meet the same groups of people they mixed with, and keep committing the same crimes. I do not see who benefits from the practice of continually letting drug addicts out of prison while they are still addicts. It is a pointless exercise that does nothing for them, their community or their families, who are usually tearing their hair out at the prospect. We must keep such people  <br>

I think that the reoffending rate for people given drug treatment and testing orders was 88 per cent., which is virtually 100 per cent., as it represents the ones who got caught. That is not the solution. Prison is the solution. My contention is that some of the people in question should be sent to prison for longer, which would do more than anything else to reduce the crime rate and would restore some confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on securing this important debate. Before the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) leaves the Chamber, I should like to say how sorry I was to hear about the incident that he suffered. I was the victim of a similar incident some years ago when a brick came through my window, but it was helpfully wrapped in a National Front leaflet, so I knew who was responsible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para23"><a name="0803252000257">What I have enjoyed about this debate so far is that, on the whole, we have not argued about who is tough and who is soft. Often, such debates are bedevilled by those arguments instead of considering what works and what does not, which is what people want. They want prisons that are effective and deliver results. We could argue about whether prison works; it clearly works more or less efficiently in some respects. The hon. Member for Kettering said that 12 per cent. of people in prison are there for their first offence, so 88 per cent. of them have committed an offence before. Whether prison works to keep people out of prison is a moot point; the statistics suggest otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para24"><a name="0803252000258">However, there is a case for some offenders, particularly violent offenders, spending an appropriate period in prison, one that people can recognise as an honest sentence. I think that there is broad agreement between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats about the need for honest sentencing. Our policy paper last year referred to the need for honesty in sentencing, a phrase that I see has been recycled or reinvented for the purposes of the recent announcement, in March, of Conservative party policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para25"><a name="0803252000259">We need to know that what is proposed will work effectively. In some respects, the Government&#146;s policy does not. We know, for instance, that the Government have had to secure an extra &#163;35 million for Operation Safeguard to ensure that funding is available to use court and police cells, and that the British Medical Association has raised concerns about the risks of temporary prison accommodation. That some aspects of prisons policy are not working is also borne out by the recent report of the chief inspector of prisons. She highlights that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para27"><a name="0803252000261">However, most people would agree that that is a fairly significant consideration. Surely a test of Government policy must be whether that number is large or small.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para28"><a name="0803252000262">The chief inspector&#146;s report highlights other problems, such as the fact that the roll-out of integrated drug treatment systems is not proceeding at the rate expected, and she raises concerns about the move to large-scale penal containment&#151;I shall come to Titan prisons in a moment. The chief inspector has serious concerns about the Prison Service&#146;s ability to act on her recommendations. She sees a deterioration in training prisons, which are doing significantly worse than last year in implementing her recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para29"><a name="0803252000263">The chief inspector is also concerned about the number of young adults coming out of prison who do not think that anything has been done to prevent them from reoffending. About 48 per cent. feel that it has, but that means that 52 per cent. do not. Does the Minister have any benchmark by which to measure the prison system&#146;s effectiveness in terms of offenders&#146; views about what is effective? What percentage of offenders does he feel should come out of prison thinking that their offending behaviour has been addressed in one way or another? I am sure that the Minister is familiar with the report, and the range of recommendations and areas of concern that it flags up. I hope that he can tell Members what action has been taken on them. A particular concern is immigration detention centres, which have not yet been mentioned. The report identifies 80 children who have spent more than a month in such centres, which is surely one of the most regrettable aspects of present prison policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para30"><a name="0803252000264">One thing on which I hope we can all agree is that a prison building programme does not amount to a prisons policy. Can the Minister explain whether the Government will go full steam ahead with the Titan prison programme? I am sure that he saw the story in <i>The</i><i>Guardian </i>on 18 March. The governor of Europe&#146;s largest jail advises the UK Government not to proceed with prisons on that scale. He believes that the appropriate number of inmates is about 600, and a senior governor at the same prison&#151;Fleury-M&#233;rogis, near Paris&#151;feels that it has not been a success. I hope that Ministers are listening to what the people running such establishments say about their effectiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="80325h0006.htm_para31"><a name="0803252000265">I want to give the Minister suitable time to respond, so I shall just flag up briefly what a prison policy should consist of. Various statistics have rightly been deployed, and they highlight the need for a sound basis on which to make decisions. I have deployed some arguments with which Members may feel uncomfortable; equally, they have deployed arguments that are perhaps subject to statistical interpretation. We need a solid basis on which to make decisions. Other countries&#151;Denmark is often quoted&#151;have some similarities to the UK but seem to be much more effective at tackling reoffending, so will the Minister say something about what lessons we can learn from their approach?</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on securing this debate and laying out his arguments so convincingly and powerfully. He was sufficiently candid to say that on 28 March last year, our hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) introduced a similar debate. If one reads the <i>Hansard </i>for that debate and tomorrow&#146;s <i>Hansard </i>for today&#146;s, one will see a delicious similarity not just in their thoughts but in the words that they use. However, that does not matter, because it would seem to demonstrate that the Government have done nothing in the intervening 12 months to make anything that my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering said today less true than what my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley said this time last year, which is regrettable to say the least.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para2"><a name="0803252000269">In the past 12 months, I and my colleagues in the shadow Justice team have worked very hard and produced a paper, &#147;Prisons with a Purpose: our Sentencing and Rehabilitation Revolution to Break the Cycle of Crime&#148;. As my hon. Friends mentioned, breaking the cycle of crime is key to a number of the problems that the Government have&#151;I was going to say supervised, but perhaps that is not the right word&#151;been in charge of over the past 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para3"><a name="0803252000270">One of the things that always surprises me about the Secretary of State for Justice&#151;I do not know why it still surprises me&#151;is that he makes announcements or responds to criticism as if he had been in government for about four weeks, whereas, as we all know, he has been a senior member of the Government for the past 10 years and has twice been in charge of prison policy: once, during the first Parliament, as Home Secretary, and then, like an animal returning to its food, as Secretary of State for Justice&#151;also know as the Lord High Chancellor of all England. In whichever guise, or dressing gown, he happens to be wearing, he has presided over a total farce in prisons policy. I wholly acquit the Minister, who has to work extremely hard under very difficult circumstances, being bundled from pillar to post, as some hare-brained scheme comes out of the Secretary of State&#146;s office that he has to implement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para4"><a name="0803252000271">My criticism of the Government is this: we have an overcrowded prison estate that is not achieving what it should as a matter of justice, humanity or sensible economics. It is not surprising that my hon. Friends were able to advance arguments with such power, and which completely filleted the Government&#146;s competence in this public policy area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para5"><a name="0803252000272">As my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering said, prisons are overcrowded. I rang the Ministry of Justice on Thursday, when I hoped that the weekly population  <br>

figures would come out; Friday being Good Friday, we were promised that they would come out early. However, they had not been published before I arrived here, so I hope that the first thing that the Minister will do will be to provide us with the current prison population figure. I hope that it has gone down, rather than up, which it has done quite a lot, not because I think it a good idea to release people early from prison sentences, but because an overcrowded prison estate is an inefficient prison estate. We simply cannot mend prisoners&#151;that is to say, reform them&#151;and release them as better, law-abiding citizens with an overcrowded estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para6"><a name="0803252000273">All of my and my hon. Friends&#146; arguments over the past several years in this area of public policy will not be responded to satisfactorily until the Government address the prison estate&#146;s incapacity to deal with the huge numbers of people that it has to accommodate. That is why our paper, &#147;Prisons with a Purpose&#148;, produces a hopeful prescription: by 2016, we will have dealt with the imbalance between prisoner numbers and prison capacity so that we can begin to reduce crime and, therefore, the need for people to be recycled back into the prison estate. That will prevent them from returning to our streets and villages and their life of crime&#151;a life identified correctly by some of my hon. Friends as one fuelled largely by drug addiction. Until we deal with that and get those people of drugs and living cleanly, we will find it extremely difficult to prevent them from committing further crimes in order to fund their habit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para7"><a name="0803252000274">Surely it is uncontroversial to say that our prisons are in crisis: the prison population has soared, jails are seriously overcrowded and reoffending rates have risen. Emergency measures, such as the end of custody licence, which was announced last June, have done nothing to manage the prison population sensibly or to restore or create public confidence in our criminal justice system. Now that we are nine months into the scheme, what effect has the introduction of ECL had on the prison population? The evidence suggests that despite the fact that the Government will release, over the 12-month period from last June, approximately 25,000 people, the prison population has gone up and, worse still, those released have gone on to commit, in the 18 days between early release and the end of their official sentence, many more crimes. One, I think, committed a homicide, but many others have committed other serious and violent crimes. It is no good the Government&#146;s managing the prison population by releasing early those not suitable to be so released. They should be planning and providing the prison estate with the capacity to deal with those deemed&#151;at the discretion of the courts and in line with sentencing policy, as set out in statute&#151;necessarily imprisonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para8"><a name="0803252000275">It seems clear that the prison system is not working. Building new prisons to accommodate those sentenced by the courts and to reduce overcrowding is essential, but it is not an end in itself. As has been identified, half of all crime is committed by previous offenders and one in five recorded crimes is committed by ex-prisoners. The right way to reduce the prison population is to break the cycle of reoffending and to reduce crime, which is why we need to invest much more political will and leadership and intellectual energy in the rehabilitation revolution. Those who enter prison should not simply  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para9"><a name="0803252000276">We want a restoration of confidence in the criminal justice system, a re-design of our prisons for the 21st century and, as I said, a major effort to rehabilitate those who commit crimes to prevent them from doing so again. The fundamental reform required is based on the concepts of decentralisation, clear accountability, greater use of the voluntary and private sectors and the introduction of incentives through payment by results, which my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering touched on. I shall not recite the contents of our document, &#147;Prisons with a Purpose&#148;, which we produced earlier this month, but I recommend it to you, Mr. Cummings&#151;I shall hold it up so that the Minister can see it. I hope that the shelves of the Ministry of Justice library are full of copies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para10"><a name="0803252000277">People, including my hon. Friends, have complained about the lack of confidence in both community and custodial sentences. We must ensure that they are based on four pillars: punishment, of course; rehabilitation; work for offenders&#151;real work inside prisons to get prisoners used to proper work, not the awful time-wasting occupations with which so many contend at the moment&#151;and reparation for victims. Too often in the political debate about law and order and other such public policy issues, we forget about the victims. If criminals earn money in prison and put it into a fund to compensate their victims, the public and, in particular, victims will benefit greatly. My hon. Friends have talked about our sentencing reforms. I shall not outline them&#151;time does not allow me&#151;but again, they are well set out in our document, &#147;Prisons with a Purpose&#148;. I urge the Minister, his advisers and colleagues to read it and to study them.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="25 Mar 2008">

<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>25 Mar 2008 : Column 41WH</b><br>
and the Chamber today, we do have some common concerns. They are how we ensure that we prevent crime and prevent individuals from entering the criminal justice system in the first place; reducing crime and ensuring that when people are convicted, sufficient prison places are available; and, crucially, reducing reoffending so that people in the system go through it and&#151;I hope, as the vast majority of individuals will&#151;return to society in such a way that they do not continue committing crime and further offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para14"><a name="0803252000282">Important issues have been raised at the margins of that discussion. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) discussed restraint, and foreign national prisoners were mentioned. What we do with short sentences and how effective they are has been a key theme of the debate, as have the way in which we examine prison build and what we do about that, and the future of prison issues. There are some key challenges for all in the Government and the House to examine. First, how do we provide increased facilities to ensure that we keep dangerous, violent and sexual offenders in prison and ensure that prison places are available for them? Secondly, how do we help develop the reducing reoffending agenda in looking at the very issues that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough and the hon. Members for Kettering and for Shipley (Philip Davies) mentioned: employment, drugs, alcohol, rehabilitation, family links and a re-examination of how individuals return to the community? Thirdly, how do we strengthen and examine the effectiveness of community sentences?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para15"><a name="0803252000283">First, on the availability of places, I shall not deny that there are challenges in the prison system. There are 81,000 people in prison, and about 82,000 places. Some 20,000 additional prisoners have gone to prison through additional capacity, and there has been extra pressure on that capacity over the past 10 years. That is partly because we are bringing more people to justice and picking up more offences than ever before, and because people are being given longer sentences than ever before. There is range of challenges leading to the prison population issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para16"><a name="0803252000284">We have responded, however, and I take slight exception to the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough that there has been no Government action over the past 12 months. He knows that in December 2007, following Lord Carter&#146;s review, which Lord Falconer commissioned in May 2007, we announced additional prison places&#151;20,000 new places by 2014, making a net total of 96,000 by 2014&#151;and the decommissioning of 5,000 old prison places. Indeed, in the past 12 months alone, the capacity programme announced last year has delivered 2,227 places, and a further 1,900 places are planned in 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para17"><a name="0803252000285">There have been a number of developments&#151;for example, regarding places at Stoke Heath, Albany, Erlestoke, Ranby, Lewes and Wayland prisons. Indeed, if the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) were still present, I would tell him what I told him in a letter on 28 January&#151;that we plan to build an extra accommodation block with 90 places in Wellingborough prison by next year. What he called for in the debate, we already plan to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para18"><a name="0803252000286">Many prison places are being built and it is important that we have them. I disagree with the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake). We have planned three, 2,500-strong titan prisons. They will be consulted  <br>

on over the next few months, and we will issue a consultation document shortly. The plan is that the first titan prisons will not come on stream until perhaps 2011, 2012 or 2013, but their large scale will allow us to create small house-blocks in a large prison, enabling us to provide some of the interventions that Members have spoken of today in a cost-effective and efficient way for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para19"><a name="0803252000287">There are plans to build sufficient prison places, but the key question is what we do with the people in prison. The figures are still challenging, so I believe that we need to up our game on rehabilitation, on investment in employment opportunities, on tackling the drug problems that have been rightly singled out as leading to many crimes in our communities, and on reintegration. I refer all Members to the prison policy update paper that we published in January, which highlighted what we intend to do on drug treatment in and out of prison. It also highlighted what we need to do on increasing the number of drug rehabilitation orders and helping support further testing and security regarding drugs in prison; on employment, linking up with employers in the community to ensure that they can provide proper work and work with prison workshops in the community and in prison; and on making strong links with individuals who are on their way through the process, so that in prison they learn and develop skills that can be used outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para20"><a name="0803252000288">We all agree on the point that the hon. Member for Kettering made in his opening remarks: we have a problem with underperformance, literacy and numeracy, and with poor social background&#151;often involving family break-up&#151;leading individuals to crime. We must invest in those individuals not only because doing so is positive, but because it will, we hope, help them not to return to crime when they return to society, as undoubtedly they will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para21"><a name="0803252000289">On foreign national prisoners, which several Members mentioned, we have more than 100 prisoner transfer agreements with countries throughout the world. We have successfully negotiated an agreement that all European Union prisoners should serve their sentences in their home countries. It will take effect from 2011 and should have a major impact on the foreign prisoner population in jails in England and Wales. We have recently negotiated a prisoner transfer agreement with Jamaica, as has been mentioned, and I am due to meet the Nigerian Interior Minister shortly to discuss a transfer agreement with him. Ireland forms part of the negotiations that will take effect from 2011.</p>

 I shall certainly write to the hon. and learned Gentleman on that point, and I shall place a copy in the Library if it helps, because that policy has been in existence for some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para22"><a name="0803252000292">The issue of consent of prisoners was also raised, and I can confirm that we have introduced legislation that has removed the requirement for prisoners to consent to transfers, provided that the recipient country is willing to accept them. Much needs to be done, further agreements need to be made, and there are difficulties with some countries that have refused to have prisoner transfer  <br>

 What will future historians write about one of the terrible disasters in British military history, one that ranks with the charge of the Light Brigade, the Somme and the Dardanelles? This debate is not about the mission to Afghanistan as a whole, which received almost universal approval from the House and still does so.

Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid), who was the Secretary of State for Defence at the time, said on 24 April 2006 during a visit to Afghanistan:</p>
<a name="80325h0007.htm_brev0"><a name="0803252000507"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are in the south to help and protect the Afghan people construct their own democracy. We would be perfectly happy to leave in three years and without firing one shot because our job is to protect the reconstruction.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para26"><a name="0803252000297">I am sorry to say that those words are mocked by the subsequent events. There was not one shot fired; four million shots were discharged. At the beginning of 2006, only five British lives had been lost in Afghanistan. Now the total is 89 and there have been 330 serious injuries to troops, almost entirely as a result of our mission to Helmand province, a mission that has failed in every possible respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para27"><a name="0803252000298">There was a mission to reduce the opium being grown in Helmand province, which has utterly failed. In 2006, the production of opium in Afghanistan went up by 60 per cent. Last year, production went up again by nearly 17 per cent. Most of that increase in production took place in Helmand province. Helmand is bigger in terms of the acreage and production of illegal drugs than any country in the world and it is only a province. The mission to reduce opium growing has been an abject failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para28"><a name="0803252000299">An alternative, proposed by the Senlis Council policy group, was to use the opium production to create morphine, of which there is a world shortage. That alternative is used for opium produced in Turkey and in India, but our Government have not argued the case for it in Afghanistan, because of opposition from the United States.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="80325h0007.htm_para29"><a name="0803252000300">All the other missions in Helmand province have failed, too. There has been some construction, but a pitifully small amount compared to our original ambition for the mission. When we went into Helmand province, our soldiers could move around with soft hats and they could talk and fraternise with the local population. Two years on, that is not the situation. In Helmand province our troops are no longer seen as an army of liberation but as an army of occupation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para0"><a name="0803252000301">The situation gets worse. We have fractured our relationships with most of our allies and with the Karzai Government. We are in constant disagreement with the Americans, who call all the tunes in Afghanistan, especially on the question of whether they can bomb people into democracy. We know about the terrible toll of lives that have been lost since the mission to Helmand province started. At least 500 civilians have been killed. Some of them may have been members of the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but a great many of them were innocent civilians, including women and children, and we know the reaction that has been caused by their deaths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para1"><a name="0803252000302">Our mission was to win hearts and minds. Everyone agrees that there is no military solution in Helmand province or in Afghanistan and there is certainly no mileage in the belief that bombs and bullets can be used to win hearts and minds. We have gone backwards in combating drug production and backwards in winning hearts and minds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para2"><a name="0803252000303">There has been a constant battle with the governors in Helmand province. There was a good governor&#151;Engineer Mohammed Daoud&#151;who was praised highly by the Secretary of State for Defence in Parliament in November 2006. In December 2006, however, he was sacked and replaced by a number of governors, in particular the Akhundzada brothers, one of whom was not allowed to take part in politics because he kept a private army and he was suspected of involvement in the narcotics trade, like many other governors and provincial police chiefs. We have had constant battles with those people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para3"><a name="0803252000304">Matters came to a bit of a head on Christmas day last year, when our ambassador to Afghanistan was summoned to meet President Karzai and told that a number of British diplomats were in contact with the Taliban. Two diplomats, who happened to be very experienced, very skilled and Pashto-speaking were expelled from the country. At about the same time, Karzai attacked our troops and said that they had made the situation in Helmand &#147;worse&#148;, which was an incredible thing for that ingrate President to say when 89 of our soldiers had laid down their lives for his Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para4"><a name="0803252000305">We are in trouble as far as our allies in America are concerned, because they are convinced that the only way to deal with the opium production is to spray chemicals from the air. We are equally convinced that such a policy would lose further hearts and minds and turn a crisis into a hopeless situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para5"><a name="0803252000306">Relations with our allies in NATO have led to a two-tier NATO. We shall hear soon that the French are sending another 1,000 troops, but they will not send them into Kandahar and they certainly will not send them into Helmand. They will send them into a safe area&#151;or at least a relatively safe area, because few areas in Afghanistan are entirely safe now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para6"><a name="0803252000307">None of the other NATO partners has any intention of providing cavalry to come charging over the hill to help us out in the difficulties we face in Helmand province. We can see why it is so resistible. We could say to them, &#147;You could have come into Helmand province when we did. You could have come and helped us out. It is military force that will do it&#148;, but they can see the record&#151;the silver record&#151;of the deaths that we have suffered. They have suffered some deaths&#151;Germany has suffered some deaths, and so on&#151;but they will not be persuaded to come into the hopeless situation in  <br>

Helmand province, where the hornets nest has produced hornets with a deadly sting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para7"><a name="0803252000308">Canada is thinking seriously about pulling out of Helmand province. Proportionally, it has suffered more than any other nation; it has 2,500 troops there and lost 78 soldiers. However, at least in Canada such matters are debated in Parliament. We have never had a proper debate in this place. We did not have a debate about going into Helmand province. We had a mini-debate in March 2006, which took place here in Westminster Hall, when warnings were given, but there was no vote and only about six or seven MPs attended. We have never had a proper debate on the situation that we are in now, which is why I am pleading this morning that we should consider the disaster more closely before we continue with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para8"><a name="0803252000309">We can look at the situation in relation to our casualties, but it is difficult to establish the precise figures overall. However, according to <i>The Independent</i>, in 2007 at least 6,000 civilians died in the conflict across Afghanistan, mostly in Helmand province, and 1,400 of them were civilians. Furthermore, at least 500 of those deaths were directly attributed to NATO forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para9"><a name="0803252000310">What can we do? We have been moving along in Afghanistan in a state of denial. We have used the fact that other NATO countries are not helping out as an excuse for not thinking and not facing up to the abject failures in every sense of the Helmand disaster. The time has come for a debate in Parliament, in the House itself, and for a decision. I plead with the Minister to tell the Government that we need a review. We already have enough reviews and we complain that there are too many of them, but we need to know about the position in Helmand province. Where is the hope? On what basis are we continuing to send young men to die?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para10"><a name="0803252000311">The Americans gave their assessment of the situation a month ago, when the US director of national intelligence made his report. Where are we now, after having been in Afghanistan, having pumped in &#163;3 billion of aid, and after the sacrifice of life? We have spent &#163;250 million of taxpayers&#146; money only to increase the output of drugs, the consequence of which is that the street price of drugs in Britain is the lowest it has ever been. The situation is utterly and abjectly disastrous.</p>

The victories that the Taliban have chalked up there have emboldened them to attack Kabul. If we had taken a different decision in 2006, and defended Kabul, we could have been in a strong position, but we believed the myth that we could somehow get all the warring factions together&#151;the Pashtuns, Baluchis, Uzbeks and Tajiks&#151;to form a Scandinavian-like democracy of peace and harmony. That will not happen.</p>

Afghans and losing 15,000 of our soldiers. When we left, there were 300,000 mujaheddin surrounding Kabul. That will happen to you.&#148; His words were prophetic. Where are we now? Are we making progress? We shall not be staying for only three more years. No one believes that we will be out of Helmand province by next year. There is even talk of us being there for 38 years. That was the forecast of a military chief, when he was asked whether we would be there for as long as we have been in past wars. He replied, &#147;Yes, at least as long.&#148; One of those wars lasted for 38 years, and in one of them, only one British soldier came out alive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para15"><a name="0803252000316">There is a terrible history for foreign occupation and invasions of Afghanistan. The situation of the past few years is uncannily like that of Saigon. There are now 10,000 non-governmental organisation representatives in Kabul. They are swanning around in their bullet-proof land cruisers, going from meeting to party and from party to reception, spending huge amounts of public money, mostly on themselves, but with little to show for it. That was precisely the situation in Saigon when General Westmoreland was cheering himself on and giving hope to the nation by publishing lists of the numbers of enemy who had been killed. We are doing the same thing when we try to shore up our belief in the situation by publishing lists of the killed and saying that we are making progress, but we are not. We are going deeper and deeper into a vortex of disaster, blood, shame and failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para16"><a name="0803252000317">The Government must realise that the disaster is continuing and they must take a stand against it. We can do something about the drug situation, but there is a practical problem with standing up to the Americans. We are in an impossible situation. We have put out a leaflet saying that we will not destroy drug crops&#151;rightly so, to stop the attacks&#151;and that we will not destroy farmers&#146; only means of production, but 16 separate organisations in Kabul deal with reducing the number of drug crops. They are achieving nothing, as few NGOs will go into the Helmand province, but we continue to be in denial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para17"><a name="0803252000318">The comparison with Vietnam is powerful. The problem is that we have Governments and Ministers who do not read history and who did not live through previous wars. They have not witnessed the past disasters that many of us have seen and lived through. The situation precisely parallels that of Vietnam. We seem to be an army of occupation, and the centre is crumbling. The American Defence Secretary set out the precise, bleak position that we are in. Less than a third of the country is controlled by Karzai, 10 per cent. is controlled by the Taliban, and the remaining 60 per cent. is run by a group of lawless, oppressive warlords, narco-barons and a range of people with whom we certainly would not want to do business. There has been oppression over many years. Karzai is looking after his diminishing empire in the centre, while we are losing lives for the cause.</p>

harsher, Taliban view of life, which is being accepted not only in areas that are controlled by the Taliban and warlords, but in those that are allegedly controlled by Karzai.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para19"><a name="0803252000320">The area for which we have the greatest responsibility is that for which we, in the House, take decisions. This afternoon, we are to debate our decision to send troops to war in Iraq, but at least that was a decision of the House. The Canadian Government will soon decide whether to withdraw their troops, which they have threatened to do unless 1,000 more go in. A thousand more will go, but not to the dangerous areas. NATO is fracturing before our eyes. That precious alliance has served us well, but the divisions are deep and growing worse. Our relationship with Karzai is at rock bottom, and it is questionable whether we should treat him as an ally, as we once did, because of his insult to our British soldiers and because of his suggestion that their sacrifices have not been beneficial and have even made matters worse. We are flooding the world with drugs. Our mission was to reduce them, but that has failed utterly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para20"><a name="0803252000321">My final point is about our feelings towards the soldiers who die. Nothing that I say on the matter should take away from my admiration, and that of the whole House, of the extraordinary courage and professionalism of our men and women who have served so splendidly, and with rare heroism, in Afghanistan, especially in Helmand. But will we number them on our war memorials in future? I think of the Welsh national war memorial in Cardiff, which is garlanded with an englyn, two lines of which recall the sacrifice of soldiers:</p>

 I welcome the ongoing interest that my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) has shown in our mission in Afghanistan, especially in Helmand province. It is a subject of the utmost importance, which it is good to debate again today. However, the debate should take place openly and with an acceptance of all the facts, and it should not become skewed by perceptions of and assertions about particular elements of what is a truly multifaceted campaign.

that my hon. Friend&#146;s doom-laden contribution is a travesty of what is happening in Afghanistan and of our policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para24"><a name="0803252000326">Above all, our 7,800 people in that beautiful country are motivated by a determination to make a difference for the better, enable the Afghans to put right those injustices and avoid further disasters. It is difficult for us in this House to appreciate that often the more austere the conditions our soldiers work in, the more they relish the task&#151;adversity and hardship breed camaraderie and satisfaction. That is precisely the kind of benevolent but hard soldiering that they joined the armed forces to do and that they have been trained for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para25"><a name="0803252000327">Our people are providing the secure space for our partner organisations&#151;whether British, international or Afghan&#151;to spread development, reconstruction, stability, governance and the rule of law. Even the most cursory glance at history reveals that western ideals imposed upon Afghanistan do not work. Only solutions of Afghan provenance and with Afghans at their centre will endure, which is precisely what we are enabling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para26"><a name="0803252000328">We have made progress. It might not look much like the Cotswolds, but there have been improvements in Afghanistan, which for so long has been one of the most lawless and troubled nations on earth. I have seen it myself. I was in Musa Qaleh last month, and the recent operations in that crucial town, which was previously characterised as hopeless, have confounded the most sceptical. Faced with measured and relentless pressure, with the Afghan national army in the vanguard having been mentored by us, the demoralised Taliban turned tail and fled in disarray. Despite the tragedy of a fatality on our side, it was a successful operation that maximised consent and minimised damage. The Musa Qaleh operation met all of its objectives in what is an infinitely complicated and ambiguous operating environment. We enabled the re-establishment of the Afghan Government&#146;s mandate without providing those who seek to destabilise it the opportunity that they crave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para27"><a name="0803252000329">Our role is not about military operations in isolation, and every soldier whom I have met knows that. It is about what comes next, what those operations enable and what follows in their wake. Seven weeks after operations concluded, a school opened in Musa Qaleh for the first time in years. That was quick by anyone&#146;s standards, but doubly so against Afghan timelines. Every soldier knew that the job was not about killing the Taliban, but about winning the people. My hon. Friend has said that it was about kill lists. I have been the Minister for almost a year, and I have never seen a kill list or seen our troops present their progress in the way in which he suggested&#151;it is simply not true. If he has any evidence that our troops present their victories as kill lists, he had better give it to us, because I certainly have not seen it.</p>

What I have just described is an example&#151;just a microcosm&#151;of what we are attempting through the comprehensive approach, and part of that approach is in counter-narcotics. That is for two profoundly important reasons. First, Afghanistan simply cannot develop and build itself as long as its foundation is an illegal narco economy. Secondly, the product of that economy, heroin, wreaks untold misery both within Afghanistan and more widely. We should remember that almost all the heroin on our streets originates in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="80325h0008.htm_para29"><a name="0803252000333">We attack that trade through a multi-dimensional and sophisticated approach. Eradication focuses on those for whom alternative livelihoods are available&#151;the targets are the greedy and not the needy. The targets are the wealthy facilitators, financiers and traffickers, not the unfortunate poor who are forced to grow opium by the brutal landowners who lurk in the shadows, and our attention is focused on those landowners. It must be remembered that our involvement in those efforts is necessarily a supporting one: Afghans are in the lead, as they should be, from President Karzai down. Some progress has been made: in 2007, the number of poppy-free provinces in Afghanistan more than doubled from six to 13.</p>

Importantly, as he knows and mentioned throughout his contribution, Afghans lead on those policy areas. The Afghan Government build their own capacity, and we do not take over and dictate to them. My hon. Friend has decried American policy on aerial spraying, but knows that the Americans cannot engage in aerial spraying without the agreement of the Afghan Government. We agree with the Afghan Government that that would not be a step forward or an appropriate way of tackling narcotics cultivation in Helmand province and elsewhere in Afghanistan.</p>

That provides us and the legitimate Government of Afghanistan with an opportunity, and operations such as that at Musa Qaleh exploit such opportunities. The Taliban are a desperate and divided enemy who are increasingly reliant upon asymmetric tactics, suicide bombers and land mines. Vile though those tactics are, they represent disarray, and the atrocities widen the chasm between the Taliban and the Afghan people.</p>

Instead, without imposing our own ideals, we must support the growth of Afghanistan into a nation of stability&#151;a nation whose people live with confidence, freely and without fear. That process will be neither easy nor quick, as I have said to my hon. Friend. It cannot be pursued without the dedication, bravery and ingenuity of our armed forces personnel, of whom we should be very proud, and I am enormously pleased by what my hon.

To allow licit cultivation of heroin would risk drawing people even further into poppy cultivation, when they ought to be growing food for their own consumption or potentially for exportation in niche markets, thereby assisting their own economy. Those are the reasons why we do not support it. It is not because the Americans tell us not to, but because the Afghan Government are against it and because it does not make sense.</p>

<p><a name="st_62"><a name="0803252000341"><a name="80325h0009.htm_spnew2"><a name="0803252000624"><b>Martin Horwood (Cheltenham) (LD):</b>
 Thank you, Mr. Cummings. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, especially as we have spent so many happy hours together dissecting the finer points of regional government on the Communities and Local Government Committee. I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate, and to the Minister for his time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para2"><a name="0803252000342">The issue of rural poverty in developing countries has interested me since I witnessed it at first hand some years ago when I worked for Oxfam and lived for a while in India, where I met poor rural farmers and came to understand some of the challenges that they face. I am not a development expert, but I learned three important lessons during my time working for Oxfam.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para3"><a name="0803252000343">The first is the importance of first-hand experience and seeing for oneself the fragile existence of many rural farmers. For them, the issues are not millennium development goals or economic growth, but bare existence, the survival of their family and being able to put food into their children&#146;s mouths from month to month, from week to week and even from day to day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para4"><a name="0803252000344">The second important lesson is that small interventions can have an enormous impact. I saw that clearly in Oxfam&#146;s work all those years ago, and there are more recent examples, many of which are contained in a report that I commend to the Minister: &#147;Unheard Voices&#148;, which was produced by Concern Worldwide, deals with many of the policies adopted by that charity&#146;s programme, including crop management, increasing the conservation focus of farming, improving the marketing of agricultural products by poor rural farmers and encouraging polyculture, which includes multi-cropping, companion planting and the promotion of beneficial weeds&#151;all without the benefit of genetically modified crops or vast amounts of fertiliser, I am happy to say&#151;and which leads to more diverse and more secure crops for many poor rural farmers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para5"><a name="0803252000345">The report quotes an interesting-sounding study by the university of Essex, which undertook</p>
<a name="80325h0009.htm_brev0"><a name="0803252000521"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the largest ever study of environmentally and socially responsible farming, covering projects involving 12.6 million farmers in 57 countries. It explores how the poor can increase output using low-cost, locally-available technologies. The University&#146;s Centre for Environment and Society has evaluated how farmers in 286 sustainable agriculture projects have improved food crop productivity since the early-to-mid 1990s.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para6"><a name="0803252000346">The following passage is the exciting bit for anyone who really wants a difference to be made to rural poverty:</p>
<a name="80325h0009.htm_brev1"><a name="0803252000522"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The average crop yield increase is 79 per cent, with the highest improvement in rain-fed crops. The evaluation also found that relative yield increases are greater at lower yields&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para7"><a name="0803252000347">In other words, the greatest benefit from that kind of approach actually translates into benefits for the poorest farmers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para8"><a name="0803252000348">The third important lesson that I learned at Oxfam was that one cannot separate the provision of support and assistance from people&#146;s rights, and that it is vital to champion their right to be heard and to influence at policy level the decisions that affect their lives. As I have said, I heard that at Oxfam, but I have also come across  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="25 Mar 2008">

it more recently as chairman of the all-party group on tribal peoples. An important focus of the group is to champion the ratification by the United Kingdom of International Labour Organisation convention No. 169, which emphasises that the rights of tribal peoples to be protected from incursions by everything from logging to mining, and from denial of their land rights, are a crucial part of maintaining their sustainable rural lifestyles. Such rights are also invaluable in respect of the more dispossessed, the landless rural poor and those mainstream farming communities that suffer from extreme poverty. Their voices need to be heard by national Governments in policy making, and donors and Governments need to reflect their priorities in strategies and listen to their voices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para9"><a name="0803252000349">What Oxfam understood then, and what Concern Worldwide has highlighted in its report, is that rural poverty is the hidden giant of poverty in developing countries. It is hidden because national Governments, non-governmental organisations, multilateral agencies and even bilateral missions are often based in reasonably comfortable, air-conditioned offices in national capitals. They often do not do what I managed to do in India all those years ago, and get out to see for themselves rural poverty and the impact on rural people&#146;s lives of development policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para10"><a name="0803252000350">Rural poverty is a giant, because 75 per cent. of the world&#146;s poor live in rural areas. If 1.25 billion people live with the threat of hunger&#151;that number is frequently used&#151;then some 900 million people live in rural poverty. The UN millennium project&#146;s hunger taskforce classified the number of hungry people in the world into four specific categories: the first category contains 160 million urban household members; the second category contains 64 million herders, fishers and forest-dependent people, including the tribal peoples whom I have mentioned; the third category contains 176 million rural landless household members; and the fourth category contains 400 million people who live in farm households. A massive proportion of the overall number of hungry people in the world live in rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para11"><a name="0803252000351">Most of the world&#146;s poor depend directly or indirectly on agriculture and the natural resources in their vicinity, but, unfortunately, aid to agriculture has fallen sharply in the past 25 years. Concern Worldwide stated:</p>
<a name="80325h0009.htm_brev2"><a name="0803252000523"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Although bilateral and multilateral assistance to agriculture increased during the 1970s and 1980s, it has since declined significantly.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para12"><a name="0803252000352">The numbers are staggering:</p>
<a name="80325h0009.htm_brev3"><a name="0803252000524"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In 1982, 17 per cent of all aid went to agriculture. By 2002, this had fallen to just 3.7 per cent.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para13"><a name="0803252000353">The fear is that the same trend is at work in our Government&#146;s programme. In its report, &#147;Tackling rural poverty in developing countries&#148;, the National Audit Office asked Department for International Development country teams for their estimates of the proportion of their expenditure that benefited people in rural poverty. Fewer than half described their country programmes as more rural than non-rural. I would welcome it if the Minister were to provide more detailed statistics on whether the trend over time has been towards or against aid to agricultural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para14"><a name="0803252000354">There is more promising evidence of increasing commitment by national Governments and donors. In 2003, African Governments recognised the importance of increased support to agriculture and adopted the  <br>

comprehensive Africa agriculture development programme, which includes commitments to increase market access through improved rural infrastructure, to increase food supply and reduce hunger across the region by increasing smallholder productivity, and to improve agricultural research. African Governments also committed themselves to spending 10 per cent. of their national budgets on agriculture by 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para15"><a name="0803252000355">In 2006, the alliance for a green revolution in Africa was founded by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with a commitment to provide hundreds of millions of dollars to revitalise African agriculture. The alliance&#146;s goal is that farmers will be able to double or even triple their yields within 10 to 20 years. Judging by the Essex university work, that is an achievable objective, if the political and social will are there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para16"><a name="0803252000356">More recently, Jeffrey Sachs has been leading discussions about the establishment of a fund for an African green revolution. Its structure would be similar to that of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and it would aim to attract up to $10 billion to be used to fund projects that help poor farmers. It is hoped that it will be established later in 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para17"><a name="0803252000357">The increasing international attention to agriculture has been reinforced by the World Bank&#146;s &#147;World Development Report 2008&#148;, which focused on agriculture for development. It stated:</p>
<a name="80325h0009.htm_brev4"><a name="0803252000525"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Agriculture has been vastly underused for development.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para18"><a name="0803252000358">It made a plea for increased support:</p>
<a name="80325h0009.htm_brev5"><a name="0803252000526"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Today&#146;s improved opportunities and greater willingness to invest in agriculture provide optimism that agriculture-for-development agendas can move forward. The window of opportunity that this offers should not be missed because success will provide high payoffs toward the Millennium Development Goals&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para19"><a name="0803252000359">The Government are committed to the millennium development goals. However, it is no exaggeration to say that their objectives on poverty reduction worldwide cannot be met without fully addressing rural poverty reduction. I am sure that the Minister is itching to get to his feet and say, &#147;We do focus on it&#148; and list the White Paper on international development, the International Development (Reporting and Transparency) Act 2006 and, above all, the 2005 policy paper, &#147;Growth and poverty reduction: the role of agriculture&#148;. That was a good document, which contained welcome aims and priorities and recognised the importance of small farms and of the voice of the poor, particularly in the commitment to supporting the Governments of developing countries to</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para20"><a name="0803252000360">which is welcome. There is a commitment to</p>

growth, but in enabling farmers simply to feed their families, in providing jobs and in the management of natural resources. DFID is now taking an even narrower view than the World Bank, which at least defines agriculture as not only an economic activity, but a livelihood and a provider of environmental resources&#151;quoting the World Bank approvingly is not something that I do lightly.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80325h0009.htm_para26"><a name="0803252000366">One possible explanation is that, unlike Oxfam, DFID has been a little less enthusiastic about taking its staff out of national capitals and into rural areas. As the Public Accounts Committee pointed out in its report on 10 December 2007, some key DFID staff spend little time in rural areas:</p>
<a name="80325h0009.htm_brev11"><a name="0803252000532"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;DFID&#146;s management practices do not give it sufficient insight into the situation on the ground. DFID advisers and programme staff spent little time outside capital cities: the National Audit Office found that on average such DFID staff spent less than five days in rural areas in a year. In Rwanda and Nigeria staff spent less than two days in the field each year.&#148;</p>

<a name="80325h0009.htm_brev15"><a name="0803252000536"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is a tension between DFID's aims of helping the poorest, who are often in remote rural areas, and of making the quickest and most cost-effective progress against poverty reduction goals, which is often easiest in more densely populated locations. DFID does not analyse the results of its assistance to types of beneficiary such as the rural poor, and does not have targets to prevent some people from getting left behind. Rural areas have remained on average significantly poorer than non-rural areas, and in some countries this gap is increasing. DFID is currently off track for achieving its Public Service Agreement targets for poverty indicators such as child mortality rates, where rural areas have on average 28 more deaths per thousand than urban areas.&#148;</p>

they reject that one-size-fits-all approach and identify, monitor and try to measure specific countries and agricultural communities in which an increased focus on agriculture and rural poverty could make a difference? Thirdly, how will they respond to the establishment of a global fund for the African green revolution and will they contribute to it? Fourthly, will the proportion of United Kingdom support to agriculture, which Concern Worldwide believes has declined over the past 20 years, now increase? Fifthly, will the UK Government address in practice&#151;they have begun to do so in policy, at least&#151;the rights of people in rural areas? For instance, will they ratify International Labour Organization convention No. 169 to support the rights of tribal peoples in rural areas and protect their way of life? Will they encourage partner countries actively to engage farming communities and the landless poor in their policy making? Perhaps then the unheard voices that Concern Worldwide has mentioned will, after all, be heard.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) on securing this timely debate. Tackling rural poverty is crucial to the achievement of the millennium development goals. Some 820 million people in the developing world are hungry, and more than 500 million of them live in rural areas. The majority of them depend on agriculture for their livelihoods and for food security. Agriculture and rural development are clear priorities for the Department for International Development.</p>

DFID spends around &#163;160 million each year on livelihoods programmes, much of which goes to rural areas. On top of that, our health, education, infrastructure, water and sanitation, governance, and other programmes, contribute to sustainable rural development. The &#163;200 million that we have committed to agricultural research is a testament to our commitment to rural areas and agriculture.</p>

Agriculture is key in rural areas, as is the work that we do on roads development in rural areas, which has a positive impact on schooling, employment and health. We also have some health programmes in rural areas, such as one that I visited in Nepal, with midwives who get out on bicycles to assist mothers with pregnancies where, ordinarily, that would not have been so.</p>

farmers have been given the skills to enable them to abandon destructive slash-and-burn systems of agriculture and to take up sustainable small-scale farming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para1"><a name="0803252000376">In Bangladesh, the programme has supported communities in raising more than 30,000 homesteads above the flood level and in raising the earth plinths, and that figure will increase to 100,000 by 2011. The programme has also provided more than 20,000 latrines and 750 tube wells, which have brought substantial health gains. Under the programme, more than 30,000 households have already received productive assets, such as cattle and goats. Close monitoring of the programme shows real success in helping to lift destitute and landless households out of chronic poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para2"><a name="0803252000377">In the context of the alliance, the hon. Gentleman talked about the green revolution in Africa. We are considering increasing support for agriculture, supporting the alliance and providing additional support through the rural development forum. Climate change will potentially have dire consequences for the rural poor, and it will make agriculture increasingly unreliable. Glacial melting in the Himalayas will compromise water flows into the nine major river systems of Asia, and it will reduce an already stressed water supply that goes to more than 1 billion people. In Asia alone, more than 50 million people who live in coastal areas are expected to be displaced by rising sea levels. That is why we have put together &#163;800 million for an environmental transformation fund that will hopefully provide some of the answers to the difficult questions that the hon. Gentleman has asked&#151;such questions are also asked every day across the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para3"><a name="0803252000378">The gloomy prognosis adds to the urgency and priority of making rural livelihoods more resilient. It is encouraging that developing countries are recognising the importance of rural development. For example, in 2003 African Governments committed themselves to spending 10 per cent. of their national budgets on agriculture and rural development by 2009 from a baseline of just 4 per cent. DFID supports the &#147;Comprehensive African Agriculture Development&#148; programme, which is a major initiative by the African Union and is strongly backed by African political leaders. As I have mentioned, we are working closely with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support the alliance for a green revolution in Africa, which was recently launched by Kofi Annan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para4"><a name="0803252000379">Policy reform is delivering results&#151;especially in Africa. In Malawi, DFID supports an innovative targeted fertiliser subsidy programme which has enabled the country to move quickly from dependency on maize imports to an export surplus at a time when the region as a whole has been experiencing a serious food crisis. In Uganda, reforms implemented in the 1990s have significantly increased the share of export prices received by farmers, which has contributed to a large reduction in rural poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para5"><a name="0803252000380">The hon. Gentleman also talked about rights. In all our work throughout the world, we try to embed a rights culture into programmes to ensure that the rights of many people from across a wide spectrum&#151;irrespective of whether they are rural or urban&#151;are protected, respected and enhanced. More focus has been put on rural and social transfer programmes for smallholder farmers and on giving cash, food and farming inputs to the poorest farmers in Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.</p>

 I am sure that many of the examples that the Minister is giving are positive, but in the time remaining, I hope that he will address some of the questions about the proportion and emphasis of aid. As I have said, that has legitimately been criticised by a series of non-governmental organisations, Select Committees and the National Audit Office. Although there may be successful rural development projects in DFID&#146;s portfolio, the focus of those projects is too small for the vast numbers of rural poor who need our help.</p>

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="0803252000382"><a name="80325h0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="0803252000627"><b>Mr. Malik:</b>
 I shall certainly come to that point. The hon. Gentleman talked about the review that we undertook in January 2007 and asked about the proportion of time spent in rural areas as opposed to capital cities. We are looking at that matter, but it should not be assumed that because staff are in capital cities they are not working on rural issues. Many Government decision makers are based in those cities and to obtain positive changes in rural areas it is necessary to engage in those cities and with those individuals. However, of course, we need to be at the coal face and to be in rural areas to get an understanding of the day-to-day challenges that people face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para6"><a name="0803252000383">We have acted upon the review through a submission to the Development Committee that contains a number of recommendations to improve the quality and quantity of our engagement in agriculture by addressing the poor policy and institutional environment. In Africa, improvements can be made by working regionally to influence donor approaches to agriculture, and in Asia we can build on our country networks to support regional advocacy. There should be active engagement in promoting agriculture-related policy reform in a number of focused countries and in direct budget support countries. Other donors should be worked with collectively to ensure that Government spending on agriculture and related sectors is adequate to meet national priorities. Funding for agriculture should be based on a harmonised approach and should use aid instruments appropriate to the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para7"><a name="0803252000384">Rural development has received increased parliamentary attention in recent months, as has been mentioned, most notably by the International Development Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. That resonates with the latest world development report from the World Bank, which argues strongly that donors and partner countries have given insufficient attention to agriculture and rural development in the past decade. Does that concern us? Yes. Will that help to focus further attention in this area of work? Yes, it certainly will.</p>

 The Minister has mentioned the World Bank report. Does he accept the World Bank&#146;s definition of agriculture as something that does not simply contribute to economic growth but is a provider and sustainer of natural resources? That is a broader definition than the one that DFID is now adopting.</p>

rural poverty, both in relation to food security and rural growth. The Committees&#146; reports have made a number of recommendations about how DFID might improve its effectiveness. We have carefully considered those and responded appropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para9"><a name="0803252000388">Will the Government reject a one-size-fits-all approach? We do not agree that we have such an approach. Each of our country programmes works with that country&#146;s Government to agree how our support can best fit with the needs, challenges and priorities in that country. It is critical that we continue to work in that format. DFID will continue to seek to strengthen the effectiveness of the agriculture policies and programmes of multilateral donors, particularly the World Bank and the EU. We will develop joint policy programmes and engage in debate and dialogue around main strategies and policies. We will support reforms within the consultative group on international agricultural research and will continue to press for the urgently needed reform of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. At country level, we will seek to strengthen our engagement in agriculture and rural development&#151;particularly in key countries in Africa and Asia, including Afghanistan, India, Bangladesh, Malawi, Uganda and Rwanda.</p>

We welcome the feedback that we receive from partners, NGOs, members of the public and parliamentary Committees. DFID will evaluate its agriculture policy later this year, and we will consult widely and listen carefully to what such groups have to say in determining the future direction of our programme. I am happy to receive the Concern Worldwide report, about which the hon. Gentleman has spoken. In the spirit of reciprocation, I was going to give him our report, &#147;Growth and poverty reduction: the role of agriculture&#148;, but it is obvious that he has scanned through it and had a good read.</p>

 It is a pleasure to introduce the debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings, and to seek a response from my hon. and good Friend the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para11"><a name="0803252000392">Let me start by saying that I am in favour of there being public open spaces where people, especially those in urban environments, can relax, play and enjoy leisure time. Town and village greens have a long history of being well used and appreciated by their communities. They allow, almost literally, a breath of fresh air to enter our urban environments. I have no problem, in principle, with areas of land that might be considered as town and village greens in all but name being legally recognised and registered and protected as such. That right has been recognised in law for many years and was reinforced by the Commons Act 2006. I served on the Standing Committee that considered that legislation, but I have to say that the changes that we made did not fully address the problematic issues that I shall raise today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para12"><a name="0803252000393">My worry is that over the years, we have established a body of legislation that allows the law to be used in ways that were not intended by Parliament. That misuse is tantamount to abuse when it is used deliberately to thwart an otherwise legitimate planning permission. In High Peak, that has now produced a crisis in the planning process. Although the 2006 Act gave the authorities that decide on town and village green applications the power to reject repeat applications and those that are clearly vexatious, neither of those criteria has been sufficient to prevent misuse entirely, and many pre-2006 applications continue to wreak havoc with the planning process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para13"><a name="0803252000394">Although High Peak borough council is Conservative controlled, we speak with one voice on this matter. The leader of the local Liberal Democrats, the former leader of the council, also agrees. In a story in the local paper entitled &#147;New Law to Stop Nimbys&#148;, he said that the vast majority of people should not be denied what they want because one or two people thought that a TVG application was a good way of stopping development. That problem is not unknown elsewhere, but it is rife in High Peak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para14"><a name="0803252000395">In my area, Derbyshire county council is the authority charged with processing TVG applications. It is currently dealing with about 20, of which half relate to High Peak. All but two of those relate to Buxton, with more believed to be in the pipeline. From that authority&#146;s discussions with specialist lawyers and other registration authorities, it seems that no other registration authority in the country has as many TVG applications as Derbyshire. It has recently increased the number of staff working on TVG applications in order to try to address the backlog of casework. I shall explain what is happening through the use of several examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para15"><a name="0803252000396">First, High Peak borough council, like every other local authority, has a house building programme that has been consulted on and endorsed by the local plan. The building of affordable and social rented housing has become more important than ever, as local authorities and Government together strive to reach ambitious targets to cope with Britain&#146;s demographic challenges.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>25 Mar 2008 : Column 61WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para16"><a name="0803252000397">The largest single planned housing development in High Peak is off Dale lane, in Buxton. That would be a mixed development of about 300 homes, a substantial proportion of which would be affordable or rented. It would be adjacent to a large council estate in Fairfield and its access would be from an area known as  Fairfield common. That name is a bit of a giveaway: Fairfield common is a genuine area of common land on the edge of Buxton, between the town and the golf course. From a new roundabout on the A6, a small access road needs to be built to make the Dale lane site accessible both to future residents and, in the shorter term, to construction vehicles, but today not a single brick has been laid, nor a sod turned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para17"><a name="0803252000398">Three of the TVG applications&#151;those submitted way back in 2002&#151;have been processed. In April 2007, the High Court ordered that the town and village green register should be amended by the deletion of a previously recorded town green entry. At present, Fairfield common is free of town green status, which should allow the access road and therefore the homes to be built. A fourth application, registered in March 2003, does not directly affect the site of the proposed development, but a fifth, called VG86, was held in abeyance until that High Court action was completed. That happened almost a year ago, but VG86 remains unresolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para18"><a name="0803252000399">Last week, a sixth application affecting the proposed development was made. It is known as VG101. I am pleased that Derbyshire now regards this as a priority site for the determination of TVG applications and will be taking that one together with the outstanding VG86. However, I am not optimistic of a rapid solution, as VG86 has remained unresolved since it was lodged in October 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para19"><a name="0803252000400">There are 2,732 people waiting for homes in High Peak, and the Fairfield development of 300 mixed homes could have made a significant hole in that backlog. It is my contention that the targets of the TVG applications were picked so as to thwart the building of the access road to the proposed Dale lane estate, as the site of the development itself continues to be free of town green applications. Although that was the largest housing development proposed in the local plan, would it not have been sensible to have identified other sites around the town of Buxton where housing development could take place? Indeed it would.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para20"><a name="0803252000401">My second example is Hogshaw field in Buxton, which is reclaimed land. It was once a tip and therefore was never a village green. It is also earmarked for housing development in the local plan. In December 2003, a town green application was lodged&#151;again, not in respect of the site itself, but of the land that would be needed to provide access to it. The application has yet to be resolved and will not be addressed until the Fairfield cases are over. In 2004, High Peak borough council&#146;s report on objections to the local plan stated:</p>
<a name="80325h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="0803252000537"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The TVG applications have the potential to fundamentally thwart the housing strategy for Buxton. If the Fairfield Link Road and the access to Hogshaw cannot be built, the two most important housing sites in Buxton would be stymied.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para21"><a name="0803252000402">The third example is at the other end of the constituency, in Glossop, where 25 new homes, including eight classed as affordable, are planned on an infill site at Sumners place. In March 2006, a town green application was lodged, and a public inquiry will be held this summer, as that, too, is now regarded as a priority case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para22"><a name="0803252000403">It is not only housing developments that are being thwarted by the use of TVG applications. My fourth example is High Peak magistrates court. The 650 square miles of High Peak were, until recently, served by two magistrates courts&#151;at Glossop and Buxton, 18 miles apart. In May 2002, planning permission was given for a new courthouse to be built adjacent to New Mills town hall, in the centre of the borough, on the site of a burned-out and derelict former Methodist church. It was planned that that new facility would replace both existing courts and the local county court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para23"><a name="0803252000404">Planning permission is but the start of the process, and a campaign led by residents living close to the proposed site gathered pace. Building had not commenced when, in March 2004, a TVG application was made. Clearly, a burned-out shell of a building to which there is no public access cannot be reclassified as a town green, but the campaign focused on a tiny patch of land to the rear of the premises that would be required for access purposes. Four years on, that application remains unresolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para25"><a name="0803252000406">One possible outcome, I should remind hon. Members, is provided for in the commons legislation, which says that if that land were to be designated a town green&#151;a claim that is by no means certain to be agreed&#151;the authority could resolve the issue by identifying an appropriate alternative piece of land to fulfil the same function elsewhere in order to allow the development to take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para26"><a name="0803252000407">In January 2007, the Court Service, quite rightly, closed Glossop court because of its inadequate access and security. All its cases and those of the county court, which closed at the same time, were transferred to Buxton magistrates court. That court has slightly better facilities than Glossop had, but even so, the court is up two flights of spiral stairs with no lift, security is so poor that prisoners on remand have to be tried elsewhere, privacy for solicitors and clients is limited to two booths constructed within the waiting room, prosecution and defence witnesses share the same waiting facilities, and the staff accommodation and facilities for magistrates are simply appalling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para27"><a name="0803252000408">The TVG application lodged in 2004 has yet to be decided, but the Court Service has made a decision. Because of the protracted delay in the commencement of the development of the new courthouse caused by the TVG application, the plans fell out of the 2005-08 spending round and are now, effectively, scrapped. There are no plans in the 2008-11 spending round to provide High Peak with a courthouse that meets the demands and standards of the 21st century. That is a tragedy caused by the action of nimbys who used town green legislation in a cavalier manner outwith the purposes for which it was designed.</p>

 Although I do not want to interfere in the grief of High Peak, will my hon. Friend accept that the obverse also exists?

I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that we may well have to revisit the problem.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. He also served with me on the Standing Committee that considered the Commons Bill a couple of years ago. I will make some suggestions towards the end of my speech as to how we might address that situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para28"><a name="0803252000411">The fifth example is at St. Thomas More secondary school, which announced plans to build a new sports hall within its existing footprint in Buxton. A large proportion of the funding of the building was to come from the sale of a piece of unused and waterlogged farmland, which was owned by Derbyshire county council and is situated about half a mile from the school. Although I understand that the schoolchildren used the land for cross-country running, it is not a sports field and not technically part of the school. The land was on the fringe of the built-up area of Buxton and has potential for development. However, houses would have spoiled the view from one or two large private homes, so what did the residents do? They submitted a TVG application. The field could not be sold for development and the funding stream for the sports hall dried up, which threatened to derail the project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para29"><a name="0803252000412">I met representatives of the county council, the school, the borough council and the diocesan education board and together we expressed our determination to press ahead with the project. Fortunately, a different financial arrangement was found, which resulted in a mere six-month delay, and the hall is now being built, but the TVG issue on the site off Brown Edge road remains unresolved. As there is no planning application involved, that application is not being treated as a priority, and there is, as yet, no timetable for resolving it. That resolution would have to be made by a body other than Derbyshire county council because, as owners of the land, it cannot pass a judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para30"><a name="0803252000413">My last example involves Buxton leisure centre. Two weeks ago, two sisters called Dorothy and Margaret came to see me. They own a very small farm on the outskirts of Buxton. The farm includes a field that is bounded on one side by a wooded hillside owned by the Civic Association, on another side by private housing and on a third by a school playing field. Buxton community school is a sports specialist school and it is therefore not surprising that High Peak borough council is considering using this site, adjacent to the school land, to relocate its swimming pool and develop a leisure centre. Development can be sniffed in the air, so what happens? Someone who may have once flown a kite on this field or walked their dog there&#151;albeit while trespassing&#151;puts in a town green application to protect the land from yet another socially valuable development. Whatever the merits of the case, we know that it will be years before this application is considered. Meanwhile, the sisters have to live with uncertainty, and the council has to look for another piece of land that is potentially more viable to develop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="80325h0010.htm_para31"><a name="0803252000414">Dorothy and Margaret were close to tears in my office. They are ladies of mature years and the field represents their retirement fund. A successful town green application would make the land next to worthless, effectively leaving them destitute and unable to plan for their retirement. That is not something the authorities can take into account when deciding on the merits of the case for a TVG.</p>

jeopardy through the deliberate targeting of sites with TVG applications by people whose first thought is to stop legal, legitimate and much-needed developments, and whose passion for open spaces is, at best, secondary to that aim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para1"><a name="0803252000416">In a letter to me of 3 March, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda), said that the &#147;balance is about right&#148; in the way in which TVG applications operate. However, Eversheds solicitors, writing in <i>Planning Magazine </i>on 14 March, takes a contrary view:</p>
<a name="80325h0011.htm_brev0"><a name="0803252000538"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The delay involved in a registration application can be just as important as its chances of success...Many cynical applications have been made with the clear intention to cause delay and cost.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para2"><a name="0803252000417">It describes as &#147;effectively impossible&#148; the process of having land removed from the register once it has been included. It notes, too, that councils and developers cannot reclaim costs from TVG applicants whose applications fail, even if the delays have caused great expense, often to the taxpayer, or the loss of an approved planning development. In short, Eversheds is warning of a crisis in the planning world caused by TVGs. Citing examples from all over the country, it says:</p>
<a name="80325h0011.htm_brev1"><a name="0803252000539"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The full picture should strike fear into the hearts of private landowners and agencies trying to deliver housing and regeneration targets.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para3"><a name="0803252000418">In another letter from the DCLG, to High Peak borough council in February, officials said:</p>
<a name="80325h0011.htm_brev2"><a name="0803252000540"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is hardly surprising if communities spring to the defence of a valued site only once a change of use is proposed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para4"><a name="0803252000419">Such naivety is frankly staggering. There is no evidence to suggest that it is the communities that are making TVG applications. It is clever individuals who see a way of putting a spanner in the works of a development that has local support and the endorsement of the planning system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para5"><a name="0803252000420">In my experience, it is developments that are required by, or advantageous to, communities that are being hit by this blight. In one instance, the council was told by the DCLG:</p>
<a name="80325h0011.htm_brev3"><a name="0803252000541"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;While it can be frustrating to have a particular site removed from consideration for housing in consequence of its registration as a new green, a local authority&#146;s housing strategy should be sufficiently robust and diverse to accommodate such difficulties.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para6"><a name="0803252000421">The civil servant who wrote that is simply showing ignorance of the local situation. Brownfield sites are few and far between in High Peak, so when campaigners make a concerted effort to attack every major greenfield development with a town green application, and when most of a borough is contained within a national park in which there is simply no chance of significant housing development, the planning experts at the DCLG are effectively telling the council to like it or lump it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para7"><a name="0803252000422">With my endorsement, the council asked for a prohibition on TVG applications being made after a planning application has been submitted, and special measures to deal with potentially vindictive applications that would not be in the public interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para8"><a name="0803252000423">Private landowners such as Dorothy and Margaret need special protection, so that their lifetime assets are not lost by the removal of development rights on private land that would follow a successful TVG application. Secondly&#151;this covers the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)&#151;we should make it  <br>

compulsory for local authorities to include town and village greens in the local plan. That way, the need for public open spaces would have to be taken into account alongside other developments and not piecemeal, in conflict with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para9"><a name="0803252000424">In 2006, there were 77 TVG applications across the country. In 2007, that figure more than doubled to 172. Unfortunately, that trend does not reflect a growing interest in access rights, the enjoyment of the countryside or the value of green lungs within urban environments. What it does reflect is that an increasing number of campaigners have discovered a low-cost, low-risk, low-effort way of delaying the development of sites, often to the extent of preventing the delivery of socially valuable projects, whether their TVG application is successful or not. &#147;Crisis&#148; is not too fine a word to describe the situation, and all the signs are that this misuse, bordering on abuse, of an otherwise beneficial law is going to make planning blight ever worse. We have created a virus that is loose in the planning system. I call upon my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues in the DCLG to stop it in its tracks and let sanity, balance and responsible government prevail in the planning system.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) on the way in which he presented the case on behalf of his constituents and raised the important issue of the 500 houses. Clearly, many of his constituents need affordable, rented housing in Buxton&#151;I know the town well having visited it on a few occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para10"><a name="0803252000426">My hon. Friend talked about the magistrates court. It is right that its staff should have modern facilities. He also mentioned the schools that want to develop their sporting facilities. It is laudable for Buxton council to co-locate those facilities next to a specialist school but one of those projects&#151;the Buxton specialist school&#151;is now uncertain. He highlighted the disagreement between planning lawyers and the Department for Communities and Local Government. He knows that I am confined to speaking about Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs responsibilities, but I realise that the community and the council have some particular difficulties in Buxton. I will, therefore, arrange for him to bring folk from Buxton to meet my colleagues and our colleagues in the DCLG to go through the matter. It is clear that barriers are preventing developments that are desirable for the local community and my hon. Friend pressed his case well. I am aware that he raised such matters previously with our colleagues during the passage of the Commons Act 2006.</p>

Friend said, but they do not cause enormous delays. The Government&#146;s survey of greens registration activity, undertaken in September last year, estimated that 133 applications were made in the first three quarters of 2007, compared with 103 in 2006. We welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s recognition of the role that public open spaces play in delivering an improved quality of life, particularly in built-up areas. He said that there should be a compulsory measure to require new developments to have green lungs and the like, but that is for the local development framework and for local councils to determine.

trying to move away from centralised imposition&#151;to reduce the number of indicators and targets and so on&#151;so such matters are for local communities to resolve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para12"><a name="0803252000428">It is only right that long-standing use of land by local people for recreation should have protection in law&#151;as my hon. Friend knows, that has always been the position&#151;just as there is protection for long-used paths or for rights to light. However, such rights are frequently asserted only when they are threatened. Although my hon. Friend is concerned about what the DCLG said about objections coming to the fore, he will know from his time as both MP and councillor that people say, &#147;I only got to hear about this or that at the last moment, and I am concerned&#148;. We need to acknowledge that people do not always know what is happening, despite the laudable best efforts of local authorities to advise them. The difficulty, therefore, is to distinguish the legitimate response that is intended to protect community recreational sites from the vexatious application that is intended to defer or obstruct, which my hon. Friend described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para13"><a name="0803252000429">Under the old common law, once a green became established through long use, it remained protected for good. My hon. Friend was kind enough to acknowledge that the 2006 Act brings the law up to date; a claim for green status may be brought only within two years of any interruption of use. However, as a transitional provision, we ensured that a claim can be brought within five years of cessation of use if the interruption took place before the commencement date of 1 April 2007, which gives much needed clarity both for landowners and for local communities. Once use as of right has ceased for the requisite period, the landowner can be confident that no subsequent green application can succeed. That may offer little comfort in High Peak, where there has been no delay in bringing forward applications for registration, but it should increase certainty generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para14"><a name="0803252000430">The Government see the provision to register greens as a necessary balance between long-standing community recreational use and legitimate development proposals. That is not to say that the balance is likely to turn out right in every case, or in many cases, such as those to which my hon. Friend referred. However, let us look at the difficulties. An application to register a green will inevitably interrupt plans for development. Applications take time to deal with. Notices must be served and people must have time to comment; often, the local authority will want to hold a hearing or inquiry to test the evidence, so reports must be drafted, committees convened and so on. Meanwhile, no wise developer would proceed with work on land in respect of which such an application had been made, so there may be long delays to works. Sometimes, a deal might fall through, as my hon. Friend mentioned in relation to the courts in Buxton. Funding may be withdrawn, or the developer may sell up and try his luck elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para15"><a name="0803252000431">It is difficult to see how green applications can be properly and fairly determined without rigorous appraisal, and such appraisals inevitably take time, just as it might take time to investigate claims to an unrecorded right of way, or for the Secretary of State to call in and determine a controversial planning application. Nevertheless, we want to encourage local authorities to be sensitive to the circumstances surrounding applications, and to consider prioritising cases in which the determination of an  <br>

application may be crucial to a wider development agenda. I am reassured to hear from my hon. Friend that Derbyshire county council has adopted just such an approach in its area, and that it has increased the resources available for determining the applications that have already been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para16"><a name="0803252000432">We do not accept that planning permission should override claims to register new greens, any more than it prevails over any other third-party rights, such as rights of way, easements, rights to light and restrictive covenants. Indeed, it would be inappropriate to impose a cut-off on applications to register new greens as soon as planning permission for development of the site was granted, because it might encourage developers to act as quickly as possible, perhaps forsaking community engagement, to have plans approved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para17"><a name="0803252000433">My hon. Friend will know of developments where there has been good, positive community engagement, which eases concerns within communities and allows developments to take place.</p>

 I hear and respect what my hon. Friend is saying. However, the 10-year development plan, which is considered with full public engagement and consultation, is the time to decide on medium and long-term land use, not to look at every aspect of land use apart from town and village greens, which are then considered ad hoc, piecemeal and separately.</p>

 I have undertaken to meet my hon. Friend to look at his local circumstances. We have not seen the High Peak phenomenon elsewhere in the country. We must look across the board, but I should be happy to consider particular circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para18"><a name="0803252000436">I have not much time, and my hon. Friend wants to know what the Government are doing about the situation. We recognise that there are difficulties, and it seems that his constituency is a hot spot. The survey of registration activity that we undertook last year found an increasing level of applications for registration, but it is too early to conclude that there is a huge and increasing trend. We already enable local authorities and others who want to develop greens to apply to the Secretary of State to change the status of the green, as my hon. Friend mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="80325h0011.htm_para19"><a name="0803252000437">We are grappling with a complex policy area, the history and law of which stretch back several hundred years. I learned very quickly from the 2006 Act&#151;as my hon. Friends the Members for High Peak and for Stroud (Mr. Drew) know&#151;that there are no simple answers to the complexity of the questions that arise. Even so, I hope that my Friend the Member for High Peak accepts that in this brief debate, I have gained some understanding of the problems in his constituency that he described, and that I will keep them in mind as we develop measures for the full implementation of part 1 of the 2006 Act. The regulations that currently govern the registration of new greens in England are described in the Act as &#147;interim arrangements&#148;, and we have the opportunity to rethink them when we fully bring part 1 into force. I am hopeful that, as we proceed with implementation, we can tailor the measures to ensure that the balance does not tilt too far in favour of any one part of the community against another. My hon. Friend has articulated concerns; I have offered to meet him, and I am sure that the discussion will continue.</p>
