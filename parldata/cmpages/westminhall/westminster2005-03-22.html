<a name="50322h01_head1"><h3 align=center>Post Office Closures</h3>


<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Mr. Watson.]</i>
</p>



<a name="50322h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>


<p><a name="50322h01_spnew0"><b> Bob Spink  (Castle Point)</b>  (Con): I am delighted to have secured this important debate on the scandal of post office closures, which results, I hope to show, from specific policies set and followed by an uncaring Government. As so many colleagues are here this morning&#151;I thank them for taking the trouble to attend&#151;I will keep my remarks as short as I can.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para0">One of my constituents, Mr. Keeler, wrote to me on the subject, and I can do no better than to read his measured and wise words. He said that our much cherished post offices
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;enable people to enjoy and carry on their life&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para1">and continued:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I am aware that government decree has removed many of the services which could be obtained from a Post Office, but little thought has been given to the hardship this will cause. Many elderly people  . . . prefer to draw their pension in cash from their local Post Office. Each Friday, I take my 91 year old neighbour to collect her pension . . . If very mature folk have trouble walking, the use of the bus service is a further problem due to the length of time they might stand at a bus stop waiting for a bus.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para2">Mr. Keeler goes on to make many telling and excellent points. He really cares about people and about his community, so we are indebted to him for informing the debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para3">Post offices are important for society. They are the very social fabric of Britain, and closing them hurts vulnerable, disabled and elderly people most. Visiting the post office gives people interaction with their local community; they meet their peer groups there. For them, it is not simply a commercial venture or a chore. Post offices have an important social role that they have played well for many decades. It should not be underestimated or undervalued.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew1"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): Is the hon. Gentleman familiar with independent research by Postwatch, in which 75 per cent. of respondents said that their local post office was extremely important to them, and 91 per cent. that it played an important role in their local community? Will he call on the Minister to review the way in which barriers are put in the way of old and disabled people who want to open and use post office card accounts but who are constantly pushed back to using existing bank accounts? Is that not a problem?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew2"><b> Bob Spink </b> : Of course I agree with that entirely. I shall come to the excellent statistics provided by Postwatch, and I shall speak later about the services that the Government have withheld or withdrawn from the Post Office.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 186WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Nigel Evans  (Ribble Valley)</b>  (Con): My hon. Friend mentioned disabled people. In Clitheroe, a wheelchair-bound lady was able to go independently from her home to the post office and to access all the services that it provided. When her post office closed, she became dependent on somebody to take her by car to the post office that she had to use. However, when the car parked and she got out in her wheelchair, she found that the post office was on a hill with a steep gradient. That has detracted from her quality of life, and it is another reason why the network should be protected.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew4"><b> Bob Spink </b> : My hon. Friend makes a telling point. When post offices are considered for closure, we should take into account not only the distances between existing post offices but physical obstacles that might have an impact on elderly or disabled people such as the lady from Clitheroe. We must have special regard to obstacles such as hills, rivers, canals, major roads and bridges between post offices, and we should consider the nature of the community served by the post offices, including factors such as deprivation and concentrations of older or disabled people in the area served by the post office threatened with closure.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew5"><b> David Taylor </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the view of Mr. Pat Shawcroft, the sub-postmaster of Kegworth, a prosperous village in north-west Leicestershire, that, even in villages such as his, there are still pockets of deprivation and people who have a real need to use the post office? Their needs should not be overlooked when the Government, correctly, give priority to deprivation in urban areas.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew6"><b> Bob Spink </b> : I agree entirely with that.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe) </b> : At the outset of what promises to be a lively debate, I would like to put on the record the fact that Postwatch agreed to some sub-post office closures. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that some post offices had to close?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew7"><b> Bob Spink </b> : I do accept that, but the question is whether the figure should have been 3,000 in the past three years. We should have been much more discriminating and taken into account the social cost of closing those post offices.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew8"><b> Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield)</b>  (Con): It may be helpful to point out that in the west midlands, from where both the Minister and I come, Postwatch opposed 73 closures but only 15 post offices were saved. The opposition of Postwatch to many closures was totally ignored.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew9"><b> Bob Spink </b> : In my constituency, there have been several closures&#151;last year there were six, every one of which was fiercely opposed. Postwatch assisted me in opposing many of those, yet every closure went ahead.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew10"><b> Richard Younger-Ross  (Teignbridge)</b>  (LD): The point is that Postwatch opposes many closures. Will the Government support Postwatch in its opposition to some closures? Will they ask the Post Office to consider the closure programme in total rather than piecemeal? 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 187WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Why has Decoy post office in my constituency, which was given notice to close in September, still had no answer?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew11"><b> Bob Spink </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely telling point. The Minister has heard it and will no doubt address it. The social cost of closing post offices must be taken into account. In fact, I was saying before the interventions that we should not underestimate the social impact of post office closures and nor should we undervalue the social benefits that post offices bring to our community. If that means we need social funding, who cares whether we support our post offices at the expense of a couple of new politically correct Government quangos? We are not talking about a lot of money, and the post offices are much more useful and more valuable to our society than almost all the expensive quangos, put together, that the Government have created. The Government have seriously mixed up their priorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para4">Post offices have a commercial dimension that we should not forget. They add to the viability of our shopping areas and community centres. They help newsagents, chemists, florists, grocers, cleaners and caf&#233;s to attract customers and to provide the critical mass of small businesses required for a centre where people will congregate. As the main banks drive for ever-more profit by shamefully closing branches in villages and in smaller urban shopping areas and high streets, post offices are increasingly important. It is more essential than ever not to close them, yet the Government have not got the message; they simply are not listening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para5">UNITE, the National Federation of Royal Mail and BT Pensioners, has an active and socially extremely responsible local branch in south Essex. I met its representative and treasurer, Mr. Colin Melluish, last year and I hope to meet UNITE again soon to discuss the better deal for pensioners that it is promoting. It is doing that because it is a good and caring group. UNITE is seriously concerned that the post office network in the UK is failing to meet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para6">According to a 2004 MORI poll, &quot;Subpostmaster Income: The Impact of Changes to the Benefits Payment System&quot;, 44 per cent. of sub-postmasters have seen their income decrease in the past year and 43 per cent. are worried that their businesses will not have a future. The crisis in the rural post office network is such that 90 per cent. of those post offices are no longer commercially viable without Government subsidies, and many face closure. Independent research by Postwatch, another excellent organisation, shows that rural post office closures are having a profound effect on local communities. The research showed, as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) mentioned, that 75 per cent. of respondents felt their local post office was extremely important to them. More than half&#151;about 60 per cent.&#151;thought that it was essential to their way of life, and 91 per cent. agreed that it played
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;an important role in their local community&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para7">Those figures increased among the elderly and those with disabilities that affect their mobility, which is hardly surprising.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 188WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para8">The much-respected National Federation of Sub-Postmasters has published a hard-hitting manifesto urging the Government to pull up their socks in the run up to the general election. I expect another U-turn from the Government. If they are listening, they will certainly see the sense in that. The manifesto born out of the frustration of sub-postmasters all over the county lists a series of unfulfilled Government promises and warns that further inaction could mean the end of the post office network. The key demands include:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Government must provide more funding to pay for the social and economic service provided by post offices. Government must take a leading role in ensuring that all major banks enable their customers to access their bank accounts at post offices.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew12"><b> Malcolm Bruce  (Gordon)</b>  (LD): The hon. Gentleman is making an important point about rural post offices. According to the Post Office, 85 per cent. of rural branches are loss making, and the Government have extended the subsidy for the time being, but unless they come up with more business for those post offices, the post offices cannot survive. He is hitting on that point: without business, the post offices cannot survive, but the Government have not yet identified that business.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew13"><b> Bob Spink </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. Of course, the subsidy of &#163;150 million is peanuts these days in terms of the social benefit for our communities across the country. The Government have given the subsidy until 2008. It is too little and it must be extended for longer to give certainty and clarity to post offices to encourage them to stay open and provide the service that they obviously do provide, which is needed both economically and in terms of social impact. As well as paying for that social benefit, the Government could help by providing more work; perhaps some benefit work can be given to post offices. So, there are two angles. Post offices need more work and, I am not ashamed to say as a Conservative, they need subsidy. They need certainty.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe </b> : I am sorry to disrupt the hon. Gentleman&#039;s speech, but I need some clarification on the point about subsidies. Is he saying that in his view&#151;we will hear later whether the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman supports him&#151;post offices, whether urban or rural, should be subsidised fully by the Government?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew15"><b> Bob Spink </b> : My personal belief is that post offices provide a social benefit for our communities and we should be prepared to pay for that, but we would not have to subsidise post offices if the Government had not changed so many policies and, for instance, removed the pension book and introduced payments by automatic credit transfer directly into banks. That is why post offices need subsidy. I am disappointed by the Minister&#039;s intervention; I thought we were going to hear the U-turn that we all expect from the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para9">The third key demand from the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters is that a
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;comprehensive range of local and national government services should be made accessible throughout the UK&#039;s post offices&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para10">It goes on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Without urgent Government action our much-loved national post office network is in serious danger of extinction.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 189WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para11">In short, closing our post offices is tearing the heart out of our communities. It is changing our shopping areas much for the worse. It is destroying many of our important and valuable small businesses. Most importantly, it is hurting vulnerable, disabled and elderly people, and that is unforgivable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para12">The latest figures show that about 15,000 post offices remain nationally and that closures have accelerated greatly over the past 18 months or so as a result of Government policy. We have seen more than 3,000 closures in recent times, and more are expected. That trend must be stopped. House of Commons Library research shows that 90 per cent. of urban closures in the past five years have taken place since March 2003, with the majority closed as part of the so-called network reinvention programme. So, it is essentially a recent problem that is accelerating out of control. Colleagues will not be surprised to learn that the Library research also shows that, yet again, London and the south-east come off much worse than the rest of the country from the Government-promoted closures. Until Labour took over in 1997, the fall in post offices was about 1 per cent. a year, but that rose to 7.4 per cent. under Labour last year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para13">Dozens of post offices have closed in Essex. Six have closed in Castle Point in recent times. Each and every closure was fought by me and by many caring constituents, such as Mr. Keeler from Benfleet, and excellent local councillors, such as Bill Dick, Colin Riley, Mark Howard, and Mr. Canvey himself, Ray Howard. We have produced petition after petition in the House of Commons and we have put in a lot of hard work behind the scenes. Working together, we are still fighting the closure programme. Indeed, we are starting to have some success. Councillor Ray Howard and I will preside over the reopening of the post office in Canvey village at Jones&#039;s corner, in Long road, which will be a great community asset. We hope to do that over the next week or so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para14">Councillor Ray Howard recently helped to get motor vehicle licensing facilities at the excellent Winter Garden post office. He speaks highly of the postmistress there, who is a caring lady. Councillor Mark Howard is fighting alongside me to get a new post office opened in the Canvey Island shopping centre on Furtherwick road to replace the post office that closed in the Martin&#039;s newsagents in the Knightswick centre. That is essential. The value of good, hard-working local politicians working with the Member of Parliament to save post offices and to get them reopened cannot be overestimated.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : The Government could be imaginative about where post offices are located. In my village, there was one in the pub, &quot;The Swan with Two Necks&quot;. It was a part-time post office, but because it was not valued and given sufficient resources, the landlady, who was tied to the business, decided in the end that she could not go on with it. Lots of premises and businesses are semi-operative but could be made properly financially stable if services currently held by some post offices that cannot make a go of it were allowed to be transferred to them.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew17"><b> Bob Spink </b> : My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. We have to be flexible in our considerations, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The problem is that with 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 190WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the Government withdrawing so many services a post office can provide, post office viability becomes questionable. Where a post office has no ancillary retail function, it is particularly difficult to retain viability. We must be flexible when we consider solutions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para15">Returning to Castle Point, there is no doubt that we have suffered badly from Labour&#039;s policies locally. We have seen many of our post offices close in recent years, and I congratulate the local press, particularly the <i>Yellow Advertiser </i>and <i>Castle Point Evening Echo</i>, on their campaigns to save them. One <i>Yellow Advertiser </i>front page from the middle of last year is headlined &quot;Post Offices Set to Close.&quot; The story says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Sources confirm at least three proposed closures are to be announced later this month in the latest bid to centralise branches. The move comes just months after the axe fell on three other sites in Castle Point last year.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para16">Castle Point is not a big community. It cannot afford to keep haemorrhaging post offices, and all six branches have closed. I am trying to replace at least one of them. The <i>Yellow Advertiser </i>went on to say in its exclusive, by Steve Neale:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Post offices have seen trade dwindle since the Government introduced pension and benefits payments through the main banking outlets.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para17">It is typical of the local press to be fighting for the interests of our community, and I congratulate them&#151;there must be an election coming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para18">We must be clear about why so many post offices are being closed, because only by knowing what is happening and why, will we be able to understand and develop the necessary solutions. We must not blame the Post Office. It is easy to think that the Post Office is an ogre, but it is not. It has to respond to the situation in which it finds itself. We must not blame our excellent and caring postmasters and postmistresses. I commend them for their caring and diligent work over many years. They deserve to choose to retire when they wish to retire if they are offered a decent package, so I do not blame them at all. They would not have had to retire if the Government had left the services with them and their post offices were not unviable. The blame for the closures lies squarely with the Government, and I hope that with an election coming we will see the U-turn that I keep on hoping the Minister will tell us about.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para19">The Government must do something to stop the rot. It mostly affects the grey vote, and retired people are keen to give the Prime Minister a clear and unequivocal message at the polls. The Government must re-examine the &#163;150 million annual subsidy, consider extending it beyond 2008 and, in the meantime, look to replace the necessity for that subsidy by re-providing post offices with work that they can do to make themselves viable again.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew18"><b> Michael Fabricant </b> : With respect to that &#163;150 million of subsidy, does my hon. Friend agree with me and the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters that merely subsidising the income of sub-postmasters is only a short-term solution? As my hon. Friend has said, it takes us only to 2008. Should that money not be used, together with a change of Government policy, to recreate a new working environment for post offices so that they have a long-term future that will not require subsidy?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 191WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew19"><b> Bob Spink </b> : My hon. Friend has put his finger on the point. We need certainty and confidence put back into the system, so that post offices know that they will be viable in the longer term and that they can redevelop their businesses as they ought to.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para20">The Government must reconsider their callous withdrawal of the pension book. The new payment method is not better; it is not more convenient for elderly people. Elderly people do not like it, they often do not understand it and they forget their personal identification numbers. It is difficult for them, and it is not acceptable to treat elderly people contemptuously. One key problem created entirely by the Government was caused by their decision to switch payment of pensions and benefits from post offices to automated credit transfer into bank accounts. That drove a stake through the heart of our traditional post office network. It is estimated that it removed at one stroke 40 per cent. of post office income. How can post offices survive that loss?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : We were all told that it would be okay, because people would be able to get debit cards, go to post offices and withdraw their pensions from machines. Does my hon. Friend agree that that might have been one answer to the problem except for the fact that in too many cases the machines charge senior citizens for withdrawing their money and that the charge, as a proportion of their pensions, is far too expensive?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew21"><b> Bob Spink </b> : Yes of course. Added to the &#163;1.50 withdrawal charge, there is the &#163;1.50 bus fare to get to the post office, and, with the community charge, the pensioner has no money left out of his basic state pension to buy a loaf of bread.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para21">The Government must reconsider support for Crown post offices, and they must offer a short-term financial package to prevent their closure. It would be a terrible blow if a large number of Crown offices were sold off to become hotels or&#151;even worse&#151; flats. The Government must act urgently to prevent that unacceptable loss of service to the public.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para22">A few months ago the all-party Select Committee on Trade and Industry criticised the Government&#039;s level of subsidy for Crown post offices and called for short-term finance from public funds to prevent their closure. I fully agree with that conclusion. Its necessity distresses me, however, because the Government have withdrawn the work that post offices used to do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para23">We must see a viable plan to safeguard the post office network, enabling post offices to offer different financial services, such as full banking. That could include, for instance, direct debit, so that customers could obtain utility bill discounts and, through turnover, post offices could remain viable and open without the need for public funds to subsidise them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para24">The Government must start listening to local communities and must pay attention to their needs. Local people will send that message very clearly to the Prime Minister at the general election.
</p>



<a name="50322h01_time1"><h5>9.58 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50322h01_spnew22"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I am very pleased to speak in this debate. It is raised by the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), and I thank him 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 192WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
for that. It is highly propitious, and I wish to speak entirely about one post office and the repercussions of its closure. I would like to say, however, that my hon. Friend the Minister has fought several closures in his constituency as a good constituency MP, so he has some experience of the way in which the process operates. Easy as it is to cast aspersions on the Department of Trade and Industry, it is also far too easy to say that responsibility lies at the door of the Government. Although the Post Office is a public corporation, or whatever its status is now, its way of doing things is set by its own independent management, and in the story I shall tell, I shall not let the Post Office off the hook.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para25">I find it a little bit rum of the Opposition to talk about what they would like to do with the Post Office. If we are playing the game of U-turns, I hope that they might reconsider their policy, as far as I understand it, which is to privatise the Post Office. The Liberal Democrats have a policy of privatising the Royal Mail. I am not always of one mind with the Government, although I am a supporter, but I received a personal assurance from the Prime Minister on Thursday that it is the Government&#039;s intention to keep the Post Office public. If we can agree that today, we shall have made significant progress.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew23"><b> David Taylor </b> : Does my hon. Friend agree that the Liberal Democrats occasionally give opportunists and bandwagons a bad name? In North-West Leicestershire, there was a scurrilous, scaremongering and dishonest campaign to suggest that two urban post offices in Cropston drive and Meadow lane, Coalville, were to close. Despite confirmation from the Post Office that that would not happen, they are still campaigning on the basis that there is a secret closure list, even though that has been denied. Is that not opportunism gone mad?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew24"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : I will leave that as a statement from my hon. Friend, as I have no evidence one way or the other. He has made his point, and I am sure that he feels as strongly as I do as a constituency MP that the aim is to keep open as many post offices as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para26">My story starts with the list produced some years ago by the Post Office to do with its designation of the branch network. It kindly referred to all its branches as urban or rural. Some of us would say that it could have referred to some as suburban, but the designation was made. When the list was produced, I had no real disagreements with the way in which branches were designated, except in one case, which was that of the Whiteshill post office.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para27">Whiteshill is a village. It looks like a village, it feels like a village, and the people who live there know that it is a village. However, the Post Office designated the post office as urban. They did so because, by pure chance, a sliver of the village abuts the Stroud urban area. On either side, there is countryside, but it happens to be a traditional ribbon development that has begun over time, by a house or two, to be encroached on by the urban area. I am thankful that that is all the encroachment that will remain as we will fight any planning applications, including rogue ones&#151;I will say no more about them&#151;that have tried to infill. We have managed to defend the village.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para28">One advantage of being designated as a rural post office is that rural subsidy applies, as the hon. Member for Castle Point mentioned. In Nympsfield, that led to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 193WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the recovery of the village post office, which was lost but has reopened because of the subsidy. I hope that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats will put it on the record that they will continue that subsidy. Although it could be used in other ways, it is a lifeline. The &#163;150 million a year is not chickenfeed; it keeps a lot of our post offices open. Notwithstanding the migration of benefits to different methods of payment, the subsidy must be continued, not just now, and not just for the next year or two, but into the future. We need a rebirth of that way of keeping post offices alive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para29">When the original designations were made, I was told not to worry because they were merely designations. Then, network reinvention took place and all of a sudden an apparent slip of the pen became a crucial matter of how Post Office management considered a post office. Again, there was no immediate worry. When we looked at the first round of closures, only two were considered, followed by a third. They were Cam Woodfield, Cashes Green and Bath road in Stroud.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para30">I had two criteria by which I judged it right to fight on behalf of those post offices. First, I considered how the community responded. In all cases, there was hurt, upset and questioning about whether closure was right. It depended on whether there were alternatives, which were certainly considered. The second criterion is not openly talked about, but I will talk about it. It was the attitude of the postmaster or postmistress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para31">The hon. Member for Castle Point, quite fairly, talked about the packages that were made available. I talked to postmasters and postmistresses across the network, and those who have decided to stay in the suburban network&#151;most of Stroud is what I call semi-rural and is not truly urban&#151;deserve the highest praise. They have continued to run those businesses, which we all know are not terribly profitable, and many have said that they are working for less than the minimum wage. They are providing a social service, but they wish to do so. They believe that to be their life&#039;s work, and it is right that central Government should support them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para32">In each case deemed for closure, I checked and talked to the postmasters and, in one case, the postmistress. It was clear that it was difficult to run a viable business. It was wrong to stop them from getting the advantages of the packages. Maybe we could have taken matters forward in other ways, but I was clear and open with communities about the repercussions if we tried to keep a business going that would not only remain unviable but would become more so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para33">I point the finger at some communities, who want it both ways. They want the post office to remain open, but may not use it often. The Government can be blamed for the way in which they have moved through benefits changes&#151;which are not the responsibility of the DTI but of the Department for Work and Pensions&#151;but I have challenged people to go and get a post office card account. My wife and I have a post office card account for our child benefit, and it is not as difficult to have one as people tend to make out. If communities want to keep their post offices, it is important that they keep money coming through.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew25"><b> Malcolm Bruce </b> : I take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but I want to reflect a conversation that I had with my local postmistress. She said that of all the people 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 194WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
receiving child benefit in our village&#151;there are a lot of children in the village&#151;only three have opened a card account. One is my wife. Other people have found it too much hassle and have not done so. It has not been made easy for people.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew26"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : That is the perception and the problem. When people go through the process, as we have, they find it is not as difficult as they think, although I will not say that it is easy. There is evidence that even to this day the post office card account is seen as a poorer alternative to the other ways in which money can be drawn.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew27"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe </b> : Let me be clear about the post office card account. Information came to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions about the difficulties experienced with those accounts and to my office when I became a Minister. We have ironed out those problems, I hope, and the number of post office card accounts now stands at 4 million.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew28"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : That is good to hear. It shows that people can use that means to draw money. I hope that they do so. I challenge all my constituents: if they want to keep their post offices, the minimum that they can do is look at how they can draw money in such a way. If it is not suitable for them, at least they have looked at the options.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para34">Whiteshill village and its post office were in quite difficult circumstances because of issues of compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which meant that work would have to be done. However, the key difference was always to do with the postmistress&#151;I have to be circumspect, because we all know that postmistresses and postmasters are not supposed to talk to the general public if they are highlighted for closure and because there is still the potential of legal action. I cannot say much more as it would be improper, but hurt is so deeply felt that the community may choose to take matters further.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para35">The post office wanted to remain open. By pure chance, the post office had been in the family in one form or another for more than 100 years. There was tremendous pressure on the family to keep it open, let alone on the wider community. That was not a problem at first, because it was not in the initial list of closures that were largely brought forward on the back of the Post Office&#039;s trawl to see who might want to phase in closure. The Post Office then changed the game slightly, by suddenly nominating Whiteshill post office for closure. That came as a shock to the postmistress, who had made it clear that she did not want to close her post office.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para36">The process got under way, and we had consultation. I would like to say that it was full, frank, open and believable consultation. I have met people from the Post Office on a number of occasions, and I have always said that I do not agree with closure. I have also met people from Postwatch, and I have told them that I do not agree to the closure of this post office. As far as I know, Postwatch has never got back to me on the matter, and I have been very disappointed. When it has, it has sent a series of holding letters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para37">The Post Office has been told by all concerned that the post office in question is a rural one and should be treated as such. If it were deemed a rural post office, it 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 195WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
could remain open, but if it stays as an urban post office&#151;notwithstanding the fact that custom is not very good&#151;it has to stay open for five and a half days a week, which is an increase on its current opening hours. That is not acceptable; the postmistress cannot do that because she does everything herself.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para38">Lo and behold, under notice of closure we have a situation where the nominated branch, Paganhill is in a one-stop shop, which is about three quarters of a mile away down the hill. The one-stop shop has been taken over by Tesco, which has a policy of removing post office branches from one-stop shops wherever it can, and it has made it clear to us that it wishes to do that. It looked for all sorts of people to take it on; it was not easy. Eventually, the community got involved and, working with Tesco, the local council and the people who run Maypole hall, which is the local community hall, have said that once they can get an individual to consider taking it on&#151;there is another postmaster in the area&#151;they can run a community post office. Everyone, including the Post Office, seems to be happy about that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para39">During that time, the Post Office came on board, and it has had to suspend the process of closing Whiteshill, because its nominated branch was under threat of closure. We have not yet signed contracts or come to firm agreements on our ability to deliver Paganhill post office, but having suspended the process of consultation, the Post Office has started it again. It did so without anyone knowing it had started again, including the MP, which led to the announcement that closure will take place tomorrow: March 23. There was no further consultation, and that came as a total shock to everyone.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para40">The Post Office nominated a branch that was itself under question. Admittedly, it also mentioned the main branch at Stroud, but that is well over a mile from Whiteshill. I thought that it was not possible in the network reinvention programme to nominate a branch that was further than a mile away. I would like clarification on that; I know it is an issue that concerns the relationship between the DTI and the Post Office, but we need clarification. If Paganhill were to close&#151;I do not want that to happen because we have worked damned hard to make sure it does not&#151;the nominated branch would be well over a mile away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para41">The process has been made much worse; I shall choose my words carefully. The pressure that was brought to bear on the postmistress and her husband is not fair. Some people would say it is a question of bullying and a matter of saying, &quot;Sign this form because you cannot do anything but sign it. You are going to close.&quot; That is not negotiation or consultation: it is the imposition of a decision. In that village, we are fortunate because we still have a voluntary shop. It was always possible that we could negotiate an outcome that would lead to better throughput in the use of the post office, but that has not been offered to us. It has been a question of the Post Office saying that the post office is an urban one, so it will have to close.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para42">I wish to put three points to the Minister. First, the original designation stands or falls by what size of population can be termed urban. A figure of 10,000 is used, and the Post Office has reinforced it with a series of maps. I do not know whether anyone has seen the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 196WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
maps, but they are computer-drawn&#151;I almost said computer-driven; I wonder whether they are that, too&#151;and they are so vague as to mean anything to anyone. I challenge the Post Office to say whether it is prepared to defend those with a definitive explanation of the difference between rural and urban Britain.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para43">Secondly, we cannot have a process of consultation that is turned off and turned on again without people knowing about it. That results in closure where people have no opportunity whatever to say that the circumstances of the closure are wrong because of the designation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para44">Lastly, there is the point of how to nominate a succeeding branch that is acceptable to people who are losing services. That has to be clarified because it is wrong if the nominated branch may close; that is not an acceptable way of making such decisions. I use Whiteshill as an example of what is wrong.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para45">The process is difficult, and my hon. Friend the Minister has to oversee it and the way in which the Post Office has to be called to account. We know that there is not enough money in the system; the Government have to pump-prime it. They have to do so because the post office is a public service, which, I am pleased to see, is beginning to make some money through the Royal Mail. That is well overdue but greatly to be welcomed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para46">We must build confidence in the network. I always remember the statistic showing that people still trust the Post Office more than any other public service, but unless we sort out the Whiteshills of this world, that trust will go. It will evaporate, and people will say that the Post Office just reneged on its promises.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para47">I work on verbal understandings. I had assurances from people that the Whiteshill post office would not close until and unless we sorted out Paganhill. It is wrong that we have been told that it will close anyway. It is not I who bears the brunt, although, I have to be honest, it is not an electoral asset to have it closing in advance of a probable general election. I am thinking not about myself, though, but about the way the community has been short-changed and the pressure that has been put on the postmistress, which is unacceptable and must be fought. I hope that the Government will listen carefully and do something about that.

<p><a name="50322h01_spnew29"><b> Malcolm Bruce  (Gordon)</b>  (LD): This is a very important debate, which goes on in every constituency in the country.

<p>
<a name="50322h01_para48">I have been a Member of the House for 22 years and when I started there were Crown offices and branches in my constituency. I lost the Crown offices about 15 years ago and was told at the time that it would make no difference. However, very often when I ask in certain post offices for certain services, I am told that they are reserved for Crown offices and I cannot have them, so it did make a difference.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para49">The post office in Keith, which is currently in my constituency but will not be when the new boundaries take effect, has long asked for passport forms. The

<br>&nbsp;<br>
postmaster runs another post office where he does have passport forms, and he therefore knows how to deal with them, but he has been denied them on the grounds that Keith was never a Crown office. That has nothing to do with whether it would benefit the community or whether it was a relevant service; he cannot have them because the post office was never in a particular category. That is simply bureaucracy and not a real response to the service, which is partly a criticism of the Post Office and its relationship with the agencies. When one takes the matter up with the Post Office, it says that it is a matter for the Passport Office. The Passport Office says, &quot;No, we just did a deal and they tell us which branches they are distributed through.&quot; That issue has never been satisfactorily resolved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para50">My constituency, within its current boundaries, is substantially rural although the main town, Inverurie, was designated during the very first round of urban reinvention. As I was leaving a meeting with Post Office management, one of them said, &quot;By the way, I have just written to tell you that Inverurie has been designated as urban.&quot; My immediate response was to ask which office was being closed. He said, &quot;No, no. We are just designating it as urban.&quot; Three weeks later, we were told which office was being closed. There was no consultation and, unlike in the case of the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), although I was more than willing to fight a campaign, the postmaster said, &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;m taking the money, and I&#039;m not prepared to stay.&quot; The will to fight for it did not really exist in the community, which was somewhat disappointing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para51">In Aberdeen city, part of which will be in my constituency under the new boundaries, there was a proposal to close 15 offices. At the end of the process, 11 were closed. That was after phase 2 of urban reinvention when, under pressure from Members on both sides of the House, the Post Office agreed to review the process. What it actually did was to put up more offices for closure and close the ones that it was going to close anyway. It did not fundamentally change the process, but it made it look better and made some people feel better.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para52">The postmistress at Bankhead post office, which will be in my constituency under the new boundaries, happens to be the secretary of the local branch of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. She told me, &quot;The business has gone from this office in the last 12 months, so I&#039;d like you to fight to keep it open, but frankly all that will happen if you do is that I&#039;ll have to close it myself in 12 months&#039; time, and I&#039;ll get no compensation.&quot; It is not always easy to fight to keep post offices going, because the financial considerations are significant.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para53">The owner of one post office in my constituency, in Pitcaple, decided simply to change the business as he did not wish to continue it. The Post Office is keen to keep a post office going there, but for the past two years it has not found anybody to run it or any premises in which it could operate. Clearly, that post office is not going to reopen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para54">Here is a tragic case: a good, lively shop with a post office in the village of Auchleven, which I have visited regularly and which is a real model of the kind of village shop that can survive in this day and age as a successful business, was perfectly reasonably sold by the owners because they wanted to retire. They sold it in good faith

to somebody who said that they would take the business over, but within three months the new owner closed the business and applied for planning permission to convert it to a dwelling house. I am still fighting to get the Post Office and the local council not to co-operate in that venture, but I am left with the problem that someone must be persuaded to operate both the post office and the shop; they are not attractive businesses any more because their fundamental long-term viability does not inspire confidence or tradability.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew30"><b> Bob Spink </b> : That is the point. Although we must sympathise with postmasters and postmistresses who decide to take the package and retire, as they have every right to do, and with people who wish to change the nature of their businesses, the problem is that there are no new people taking their places because the Government have removed post office functions and destroyed the viability of the post offices. The Government must address that.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew31"><b> Malcolm Bruce </b> : That intervention was timely because I was just about to move from examples in my constituency to the national picture. The hon. Gentleman made my point exactly: it is all very well challenging parties to say that they would continue support for rural post offices, as the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) did&#151;I have no problem with that, but it is not enough unless there is confidence in the long-term future. For the record, my party does not have any plans to privatise the Post Office, which we see as a public service. We are not so sure about the future of Royal Mail, but the Post Office is a social service, as the hon. Member for Stroud said, and will inevitably require support one way or another.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew32"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe </b> : So, is the Liberal Democrat policy to privatise Royal Mail but sell off the other?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew33"><b> Malcolm Bruce </b> : No, our policy is not to privatise either of them. We said that the liberalisation of Royal Mail may require some rethink in the future. Royal Mail is actually subsidising the Post Office, so one way or another, we must make sure that the Post Office is adequately supported as a public service. I hope that that clarifies the position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para55">We need to move from the current situation to a position in which there is confidence in the future of the network and individual businesses. Over the past few decades, post offices have been closing at an average rate of 305 a year. In the past 10 years, the number of post offices has reduced from 19,251 to 14,976, so there was a dramatic fall in the number of post offices under the Conservatives, which has accelerated under Labour, particularly with the urban renewal programme, and there is no end to that in sight. People are concerned about urban reinvention and the likelihood of some kind of rural reinvention because even though, theoretically, the idea is to end up with a stable, reduced network in which we can have confidence in the future, the reality is that we are reducing the network but the confidence in the future is not there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para56">The hon. Member for Castle Point rightly said that we need a plan that gives guaranteed revenue and guaranteed business for the valuable work of the post offices, but there are two problems with that. When I 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 199WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
was in a post office in Leicestershire, looking at the community point&#151;I shall come back to that&#151;the postmistress told me that it was a busy shop and post office and that people said to her, &quot;Oh, you&#039;ll never close; look how busy you are.&quot; But she pointed out that although the post office is busy and there is always a queue at the counter, the value of transactions is very small. Lots of people want to use the service, but they spend only &#163;1 or &#163;2. That is the real issue: we have to pay more to those who run post offices, subsidise post offices or find other kinds of business that will effectively cross-subsidise them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para57">I am tabling questions to all Departments to ask what their information purchases cost&#151;the cost of forms, distribution and printing&#151;to see whether co-ordinating that and using the Post Office, not necessarily exclusively, but principally, might generate substantial revenue for post offices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para58">Members may not have looked at the sub-postmasters&#039; experiment with community point, which is not yet a definitive answer but is nevertheless an interesting way forward. Regrettably, the Government pilot scheme, &quot;Your Guide&quot;, did not go forward because it was considered to be too expensive&#151;I make no comment on that. The postmasters have tried to develop the scheme using the same pilot area of Leicestershire because people there are familiar with it. They have not had the e-Government support that they deserve and need to make it work, but one thing that came across to me as having big potential was that if each post office had a computer terminal with a printer behind the counter, virtually every Government form could be immediately accessible online and printed in the post office, for which a charge could be credited to the account. That would save on printing costs, as printing would be done to order, and there would be no worries about stockholding and pulping, or about forms being out of date because they would be accessible, up to date and online. I hope and believe that that solution is a way forward in partnership with Government that could help to boost the viability of the post office network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para59">In an ideal world, everything that happens in the post office would be paid for as a fully commercial business, including public services, although I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Castle Point that if a small subsidy is needed to keep the social network, it would be a disaster if that network were destroyed for the sake of a relatively small amount. We need to agree what is the viable total network and try to support it in the best way possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para60">It is interesting that post offices run by the Post Office appear to lose the most money. That leads me to believe that as the Post Office has changed, the relationship between it and its branches has not changed fast enough. For example, an Office of Fair Trading adjudication is going through the system in which convenience stores with post offices have challenged the restrictions imposed on them by the Post Office. That is a point of contention on which not all postmasters agree, because the postmasters and shopkeepers are not necessarily the same people. I can see the point of view of shop owners who say, &quot;We are operating a business here, of which the post office is a part, not the sole aspect, and we object to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 200WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the Post Office telling us what we can do in the other part of the shop,&quot; but I also understand the Post Office&#039;s reasoning, particularly as it is developing new services. I shall be interested to see the OFT&#039;s conclusion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para61">I support Post Office management trying to introduce new commercial services, but I do not know how successful they will be, as the environment is very competitive. One reason why the Royal Bank of Scotland refuses to co-operate with the Post Office is that it regards it as a direct competitor in both cash and financial services, and it says that under no circumstances will it co-operate in allowing its customers to access money through the Post Office. HBOS has taken the same position. I am glad that Clydesdale bank has now started to allow people to get cash through the Post Office.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para62">I am conscious of the time, but let me make a Scottish point. We in Scotland are particularly disadvantaged as a result of the decision of our two biggest banks, the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, not to co-operate with the Post Office, because that means that many people in Scotland&#151;a high proportion are customers of those banks&#151;will not be able to obtain cash through the Post Office, and yet the card account has not come across as the ideal alternative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para63">Although MPs make party political points on this issue, all of us know how important the post offices in our constituencies are and how much they are valued and used. We want to find a solution to this dilemma that will give confidence for the future. The Government face a great challenge; they are going through a process that is demoralising and damaging to confidence, and most sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are not at all convinced about how the endgame will finish. I have made some constructive suggestions, and I hope that the Government will address them in a sensitive manner. They must ensure that the combination of business and whatever subsidy is required will guarantee a future. The fact is that 85 per cent. of rural post offices are not profitable, and unless we solve that problem, swathes will be cut through the service in rural areas. Postmasters and postmistresses will simply walk away, as they will be unwilling to continue to subsidise the Post Office, because the tables have turned; the Post Office is not subsidising them any longer; it is the other way around now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para64">This has been a good debate, and I am sure that we will continue to discuss the subject through the coming election campaign.

<p><a name="50322h01_spnew34"><b> Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield)</b>  (Con): We have had a number of debates on the Post Office in the past few years, and one thing that characterises them is a sense of unanimity. There is a strong feeling among MPs of all parties, who, after all, are elected to represent their constituents, that the post office system has tremendous value. We recognise that post offices exist not just to sell stamps; they also play a valuable role in our communities. Debates on this subject are pleasant because, although we might have specific differences about how to maintain the post office network, we all agree that it has huge value.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para65">It is a great pleasure to me that my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) has secured the debate, and I congratulate him on that. He and I, and

my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), who was present earlier, were elected to the House at the same time, in 1992. We are still here&#151;more or less.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para66">The debate has been interesting. All Members, regardless of political party, care about the Post Office. The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) pointed out the importance of the Post Office brand, and, as the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) said, that brand is not being utilised enough. I think we all agree on that. The Post Office brand is recognised and respected, and it is regarded as having great integrity. The BBC used its brand to enable it to operate in a wider range of areas, which has cross-subsidised its programme making, but the Post Office has decided not to use other services as a way of keeping post offices viable, either because of externally applied restriction or because of its own restrictions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para67">The hon. Member for Gordon raised a fascinating point: he explained how, historically, there are differences between post offices that had always been sub-post offices and those that were originally Crown post offices. What does it matter if they are now sub-post offices and they want to offer certain services, such as providing passport applications? Why should they be disallowed from doing so? I have no idea. Can the Minister answer that? Have the Government put that restriction in place, or, as I suspect, has the Post Office done so? Either way, will the Government intervene to ensure that all post offices are able to offer a large number of services, because that is what will keep them viable?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para68">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) spoke about the fact that some people find it difficult to get to their post office. With regard to the urban reinvention programme, the Post Office said that it would not close post offices more than one mile distant. The Post Office also claimed that it would take into account natural obstacles, but that simply does not seem to be the case. We have heard time and again, not only in this debate but in debates in the main Chamber, about areas where elderly people live and where there are mountain ranges, canals or torrential rivers&#151;I exaggerate slightly, but I am making my point&#151;and the Post Office says, &quot;Well, there are two post offices within a mile of each other, so one of them can close,&quot; even though, in practice, the other is inaccessible. That is wrong, and it must be addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para69">The Government cannot get off lightly, because they have played their part. We heard from the Minister today that 4 million post office users are now account holders, but not all of them wanted to be. Many elderly people have difficulty in operating cash cards. Many have difficulty in remembering their personal identification number&#151;as do I. Many, and many disabled people, too, find it difficult to enter their PIN number on the little keypads that are provided; they really are quite small. For understandable reasons, the banks are now introducing chip and PIN, but lots of people have problems in operating keypads, when they go to the gas station to buy petrol, for instance. That is an important issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para70">The Government are spending an extraordinary amount of money to try to persuade people to give up their cash books. Some &#163;10.5 million of taxpayers&#039; money is being spent to persuade benefit claimants to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 202WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
abandon their order books in favour of direct payment; that figure has been obtained by the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. That is equivalent to the taxpayer spending &#163;70 per benefit claimant. Of course, the direct payment facility should be available at post offices for people who have bank accounts, or who do not like dealing in cash; it was initiated by a Conservative Government, and I applaud new Labour for continuing with the programme. However, it is wrong to do that in a way that prevents people who wish to keep their benefit books from doing so, particularly as those people are vulnerable, and find using such benefit books difficult enough.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para71">In this debate, and in others, we have heard of the many campaigns that Members have run to keep their post offices open. Postwatch has played its part. It may not have replied to the Member for Stroud, but it is generally quite proactive. As I mentioned in an intervention, it opposed 73 closure proposals in the west midlands but only 15 were withdrawn. When there is unanimous opposition to certain post office closures among local authorities, local communities, Members of Parliament, and Postwatch, and yet the Post Office still closes those post offices, one has to wonder whether it is completely deaf. Does it not recognise that the Post Office, as well as the Government, has a duty of care in this area?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew35"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe </b> : The hon. Gentleman suggested in his earlier intervention that my constituency was part of the west midlands. Bradford does not want to join the west midlands. It is strictly Yorkshire.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew36"><b> Michael Fabricant </b> : I am grateful for that helpful intervention; I do not know what made me think that the Minister represented a west midlands seat. My geographical knowledge of the United States is far better than that of the United Kingdom. I thank the Minister&#151;I like to refer to him as my hon. Friend&#151;for making that helpful, creative intervention.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para72">Postwatch also pointed out the question raised by the hon. Member for Gordon: when is it convenient and when is it not convenient to close a post office? Sometimes it is convenient to do so because the postmaster wants to take payment from the Post Office to surrender their position. As Postwatch said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We believe that POL&#039;s choice to use subpostmaster preference as a major part of selecting which post offices to close has in a number of cases meant that businesses closed that were in some ways better than those that remain.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para73">That issue must also be addressed by the Government. Although I understand and accept that Post Office Ltd is a separate organisation in law, the House and Members should not forget that it is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Government. It is not right for them to say, &quot;Mea non culpa. This will operate at arms&#039; length. We shan&#039;t intervene&quot;. As a former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry might have said, the Minister should be intervening before breakfast, before lunch and before dinner, so far as some closures are concerned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para74">It is not just hon. Members who have been intervening, or trying to intervene, to keep post offices open. I have received a series of e-mails and letters from people in their communities who have been trying to keep various post offices open. Such people include: Pamela Singleton in

They have all run campaigns to try to keep their post offices open. They have joined in the local community. In some cases they have succeeded, and in others they have not.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para75">Under the Conservative Government, about 1 per cent. of post offices closed each year; under the new Labour Government, the rate is running at 7 per cent. The total number of post offices has fallen by more than 3,200&#151;17 per cent.&#151;since the Government came to power. The last figures available show that 15,304 post offices in the United Kingdom still existed at the end of 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para76">The hon. Member for Stroud, whom I am pleased is taking part in the debate, tabled a written question. He asked the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;what discussions she has held with . . . parish . . . councils&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para77">The Minister for Employment Relations, Consumers and Postal Services replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I have not held discussions with parish and town councils or with the National Association of Local Councils at this stage.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>21 December 2004; Vol 428, c 1615&#150;16W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para78">I hope that the Minister will hold such discussions, because I know that he cares about the issue. He is a caring sort of Minister, but caring just is not enough; doing is what matters.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew37"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : As the hon. Gentleman has quoted me, I would like to respond. To be fair to the Post Office, the rural network has tried to evolve an interesting way in which parish councils and other voluntary groups can be brought in to help run it. That is exactly what should be done as a matter of urgency. We need that to be brought forward and not left as a future possibility. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew38"><b> Michael Fabricant </b> : As I said near the beginning of the debate, many of the issues cross party boundaries. Yes, I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. There should be greater community involvement, not only at the stage of discussing whether there should be a closure, but, as was said, to help keep post offices open in a constructive way; that could be as part of a village shop or, as we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley, as part of a pub.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para79">There are all sorts of different mechanisms of having full-time or part-time post offices by which we can create a footfall. But the position has been damaged under the Government because of the Post Office card scheme. I am talking about a footfall that improves the viability of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 204WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
post offices. Sub-post offices depend on people coming into them for their survival. Under the Government much business has been lost. We have stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;A Conservative government would aim to increase the number of services available from urban and rural post offices and so increase their long-term viability. We will . . . work . . . with the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para80">I meet with that body on a regular basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para81">The Government have failed to give adequate backing to the Post Office card account. They have made too complicated the process by which customers open accounts. The Government have betrayed the trust of local people by doing so, and they have tried to dragoon people into using card accounts, as my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point said. That has been done against people&#039;s will, and public money has been used to force them to do it. That means that customers are likely to open bank accounts out of frustration. Trade at the local post office, which is the village shop, will dry up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para82">Local post offices provide a focus for the community as well as merely being places that provide stamps. Our aim must be to create an environment where post offices thrive in the United Kingdom, not only for the benefit of the Royal Mail, but for the benefit for the communities we serve.
</p>



<a name="50322h01_time4"><h5>10.47 am</h5>


<p><a name="50322h01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) on securing today&#039;s debate. He has been assiduous in voicing local concerns on behalf of his constituents about Post Office Ltd&#039;s urban reinvention programme proposals for his constituency. I add my congratulations to him and his colleagues on the efforts that they have made on behalf of their local community. I was pleased to hear him say that one of the post offices will reopen. I congratulate him on that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para83">Since I became the Minister with responsibility for postal services in September 2004, I have examined the whole area of postal services with great interest. Some people have accused me of being a masochist in accepting that responsibility, given the nature of the problem that we face in relation to a trusted service. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) is correct in saying that despite all the issues relating to the Royal Mail and the Post Office, people still trust them as brand names.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para84">The hon. Member for Castle Point spelt out his views clearly and fully. That is why I questioned him on subsidy. He spoke strongly about the social aspects of post offices and the importance of maintaining subsidies. I will return to issues relating to his constituency a little later if I have the time to go through them in great detail and if he allows me to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para85">Today&#039;s debate has been important. I agree with the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) that what tends to happen in situations such as those that we are discussing, particularly with a possible general election around the corner, is that the issues become politically emotive as we all knocks spots off each other in determining who was responsible for things. I will return to some of those issues.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 205WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para86">I agree that all of us, when we get down to the detail, want a viable post office network, and we want the Royal Mail to survive and develop. We need to try to find ways of examining the issues together. I was grateful for some of the suggestions that the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) made. We are at the next crucial stage. The first plan for Royal Mail recovery was in 1999, and it concludes this year. We need to consider what the next plan will entail. Remarks were made about the rural subsidy. What is interesting is that the time frame has given us the opportunity to see what local communities want to do about the range of services that post offices should provide. Some innovative ideas have come from the pilots, which could contribute to a future plan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para87">The post office network is relevant to every Member of Parliament. We all share concerns about the future provision of post office services in our constituencies. I assure hon. Members that the Government are fully committed to maintaining a viable nationwide network of post offices. The truth is that there have been decades of underinvestment, and the business was in a spiral of decline. If the network is to survive and thrive, it needs to change significantly. The Government want a post office network that can prosper on the needs of today and the future, not those of 20 or 30 years ago.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para88">Because the Government have grasped the nettle and taken the necessary steps to restructure and revitalise the Post Office, the future of the network has rightly become an issue of national debate. We all share concern for the future provision of post office services in our constituencies, and we want to maintain a viable network. Everyone involved faces a massive challenge. I pay tribute to those local communities and people who have voiced their concerns about post office closures. However, I take the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud made about the fact that some people have unfortunately joined the campaign after the horse has bolted, so to speak, given the massive problems that the network was facing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para89">The starting point for Government policy on the post office network was the performance and innovation unit&#039;s report of 2000, &quot;Modernising the Post Office Network&quot;. The Prime Minister called for that report in 1999, because it was clear, following decades of decline and zero investment, that dramatic action had to be taken to get the business on track. We set about producing policies that would help secure a future for the post office network, which was something that the previous Government failed to do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para90">I was interested to hear the Opposition say what they would do if they ever return to power. I would ask why they did not do those things when they had the opportunity during their previous reign.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew39"><b> Michael Fabricant </b> : The Post Office was not under such pressures then. It is primarily because of the introduction of the card scheme that we now have to propose such measures.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h01_spnew40"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe </b> : That was a good try, but not an effective enough one, because closures were already taking place during the Conservative reign, as hon. Members have pointed out. If we consider the problem honestly, we find that it has much to do with the relationship between 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 206WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the Royal Mail and the Government. They have basically been at arm&#039;s length since 1967. On other agencies using the Royal Mail and post offices, lots of good work could have been done to ensure that Post Office Ltd played an integral role in community regeneration, especially if we consider the money that the previous Government invested in regeneration and what this Government have done. There could have and should have been an opportunity to involve post offices and other services in such regeneration. That did not happen, and we all stand to blame for that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para91">The PIU report showed quite starkly that the network of post offices had not kept pace with the changing needs of its customers. Too often, post offices had become dingy and shabby through lack of investment and were losing business. The Post Office faces an enormous challenge. In recent years, Post Office Ltd has incurred substantial losses: &#163;163 million before exceptional items in 2001&#150;02, &#163;194 million in 2002&#150;03, and &#163;97 million in 2003&#150;04. Some 96 per cent. of the nation&#039;s post offices are run by sub-postmasters&#151;private business people who have invested not only their own money into their businesses but a great amount of care and effort into helping the post office network to achieve its high status.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para92">I pay tribute to the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. I meet the federation regularly and have discussed its manifesto, which contains many interesting ideas, although, as the federation acknowledges, they are uncosted. It is run by people who are committed to the network, as hon. Members have said. It is vital that we listen to the federation and to people who have invested many years of their life in the network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para93">It was right that Post Office Ltd gave those people who wanted to get out the opportunity to do so through the payments that were made. Some people were put under a great deal of pressure over some decisions. I shall return to the example that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud raised from his constituency, because I am concerned if people have been put under the pressure that he described. I will write to him with details about the two post offices that he mentioned and will look at the issue of undue pressure being put on people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para94">The post office network has been contracting since the 1960s. The previous Government presided over 3,500 closures between 1979 and 1997, but in all that time produced no policy on how to structure the network and ensure that it would remain relevant in the 21st century. There have been reductions in post office usage for all sorts of reasons. The absence of investment by the previous Government was an important one. However, major advances in technology, greater mobility, and changes in shopping and financial habits mean that a large proportion of our constituents simply do not use post offices as they used to and that custom has sharply reduced. That trend is not a matter of the Government or some unseen market force acting against the interests of the Post Office and its customers; rather, it is about ordinary people&#151;our constituents&#151;making choices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para95">The decline in transaction volumes has not been caused just by the changes in benefit payment arrangements that have recently been completed. The decline started well before the move to direct payment and applies not only to benefit payments but to a much 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 207WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
wider range of services, including Girobank and National Savings transactions, telephone bill payments and postal orders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para96">As the recent National Audit Office report noted, the change is not a uniquely British phenomenon. Research commissioned by Postcomm, the regulator for postal services, has noted that people in other countries increasingly access services electronically over the telephone and through the internet. In response, most countries have been remodelling their networks, usually by closing the smallest or least profitable offices and converting directly run offices to agency offices. In Germany, for instance, the number of post office branches has been reduced drastically, from 30,000 to 13,000. In Britain, other networks, such as those of the retail banks, have also been scaled back. Like them, the post office network needs to adapt to changes in people&#039;s preferences and new ways of doing business. Such external changes pose big challenges to the network of post offices, which have to be addressed not ducked. That is what the Government have done and it creates the emotion that we have seen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para97">Postwatch has done a tremendous job of creating a picture for consumers, through its response to Post Office Ltd&#039;s plans. That was a deliberate plan by the Government, in order to create a balance, so that a number of things could be dealt with. Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd were losing money, and the Government set them targets: to turn the situation round, to stop those loses, to maintain a viable network, and to ensure that there were no unplanned closures. The difficulty would have been an acceleration in those closures, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 208WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
creating gaps, which would not have put us in the position of having post offices within a mile of one that had closed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para98">Postmaster preference, Postwatch operating on behalf of the consumer, and Post Office Ltd were involved in trying to create a viable network. Clearly, there have been difficulties. Since becoming the Minister with responsibility for postal services in September 2004, I have tried to ensure that hon. Members in all parts of the House have had the opportunity to meet Post Office Ltd directly. I have done that through arranging surgeries in the House on Thursdays with senior management of Post Office Ltd, so that hon. Members can at least have face-to-face discussions about the concerns that have been raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para99">The Government are listening. When we look at the new plan, we shall have to consider the role of Postwatch and Postcomm, the regulator. Postcomm is looking at a survey of how the urban reinvention programme has affected certain areas. If gaps appear, we shall have to ensure that they are filled.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h01_para100">We are debating a difficult issue to which I am we shall return, notwithstanding what happens in the general election. Hon. Members have shown great dedication in dealing with the issue. If we take party politics out of the debate, as I am sure we will after the election, and consider the good ideas that are around, I am sure that we can restore and develop our constituents&#039; confidence in Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. That way, we can ensure that our constituents understand what has happened and what we all agree is the need for change, and that the change is as painless as possible for them. If we do that, I am sure that confidence will return.

<a name="50322h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Western Balkans</h3>

<a name="50322h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>


<p><a name="50322h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Randall  (Uxbridge)</b>  (Con): I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to raise this subject, which, unlike many others, will not be high on the list of issues in the run-up to the forthcoming election in the United Kingdom, so we can get away from the party politics that pervades too many of our debates at the moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para0">First, I want to pay tribute to the Foreign Affairs Committee, which recently produced a report on developments in the western Balkans. Although it is something of a curate&#039;s egg, there are more good bits than bits that are not to my taste, and I certainly welcome the Committee&#039;s involvement. It is important that the UK and the rest of Europe take the future of the region very seriously, not only because it is in Europe, but because it holds the key to stability and peace in Europe and therefore must not be ignored.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para1">As it happens, today is the sixth anniversary of the eve of the bombing of Yugoslavia and it is interesting to consider how far we have come since then. The region had already been in turmoil for some considerable time, but in many ways the bombing of Serbia&#151;Yugoslavia as it was then called&#151;was a turning point for it. I always make the point, and the Minister for Europe has heard me do so on many occasions, that history plays an important part in the region and is forgotten at our peril, but I want to be more positive and concentrate on what has been going on recently and what can be done in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para2">Some recent developments have been positive. I am delighted that the UK and the European Union are trying to be as even-handed as possible in the area. That has not always been apparent to some people, but recent insistence in the case of General Gotovina in Croatia and the indictment of the Kosovan Prime Minister, Ramush Haradinaj, have shown that the west is trying to change the fact that too many people in Serbia and the diaspora feel that they are the only victims of what has happened. Also today, the President of Serbia and Montenegro, Mr. Svetozar Marovic, is visiting the UK again. I do not know what discussions he is having or with whom, but I hope that those diplomatic efforts will not go unrewarded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para3">I will not deal with the whole region, not only because of the lack of time, but because in recent years I have concentrated my efforts on several specific parts of this diverse region. I shall start by talking about Macedonia, which is an interesting part of that area of the world and, in many ways, as successful as any country there in implementing policies that the west would like. It is certainly keen to join the European family. Also, it has tried hard to implement the Ohrid agreement and has succeeded, despite the nervousness caused by a recent referendum that could have put that in grave jeopardy. Successive Governments have made every effort to ensure that the country is a model of integration in the Balkans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para4">In light of Macedonia&#039;s efforts&#151;it has supported the coalition in Iraq and a member of its armed forces has even been killed over there&#151;we sometimes need to give more support than mere words.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h02_spnew1"><b> Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield)</b>  (Con): Does my hon. Friend agree that Greece could be more helpful in its 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 210WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
relations with Macedonia and provide additional encouragement to its long-term ambition of joining the EU?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Randall </b> : My hon. Friend pre-empts me. Greece is being helpful to Macedonia in many respects, certainly economically, which is to be welcomed. Other countries, including the UK, could help economically through business and bilateral arrangements, but the big problem with Greece is still the sticking point over the name of Macedonia. In most of our deliberations in the House and elsewhere, most people&#151;even Ministers who normally have to be very wary about such things&#151;will refer to the country as Macedonia, because that is its name. However, my hon. Friend may be aware that the Greeks, and therefore the EU, have insisted on the full title being the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I am not sure whether Greece would like to be referred to as the former Ottoman province of Greece, or whether Finland would like to be called the former Russian province of Finland. They would not be altogether chuffed with that idea.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para5">As in so many parts of the region, there are little nuances&#151;the title of a country is more than a nuance, however&#151;but it is about time we got past the problem with the name. After all, the United States, China and Russia have accepted the name of the country as Macedonia without the &quot;former Yugoslav&quot; bit tacked on. The UK has a wonderful opportunity, through our forthcoming presidency of the EU, to have a chat with the Greeks and try to make them see sense. I am not an expert on German politics, but I believe that the Bundestag, the lower House of the German Parliament, recently passed a resolution to that effect, so we might be able to find help and allies on the subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para6">Unfortunately, there are signs that the problem with the name is becoming a bit like our problem with Gibraltar and Spain. Recently, I heard that a plane carrying the Macedonian Prime Minister to talks in Turkey was not allowed to go through Greek airspace because &quot;Macedonia&quot; was written on its side. One hears all sorts of stories in that region. That story came from an eminent source but, not having access to the Macedonian dailies, I cannot verify whether that happened, although I believe it did. If it did, the UK Government ought to have more than a quiet word with our colleagues in Athens, because I would be nervous if a problem over the title of a country got down to what we would all agree are childish levels. I do not think I will be going to Greece on my holidays in the immediate future, after that little diatribe.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Denis MacShane) </b> : The hon. Gentleman could go plane-spotting.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Randall: </b>  Although the Minister claims that plane-spotting would be an amply good pastime for me, one of my constituents did that, which did not help his summer holidays that year. Having been a bird watcher, I know the perils of walking around the Balkan countries with a pair of binoculars around my neck.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para7">More seriously, I return to existing conditions in Serbia. Before the civil war, Serbia was not exactly at the forefront of economic success. It was doing quite well years ago when I was a student there, but it fell behind under successive Governments. In 1990, the income per 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 211WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
capita was $2,850; now it is only a few hundred dollars. We can see what has happened to a large proportion of the population: unemployment is 38 per cent. and rising, and sadly, industrial production is down 50 per cent. compared with 1989.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para8">I understand, and I know that the Minister will repeat, the insistence on the bringing to trial in The Hague of Mladic and Karadzic, and I know from I speaking to members of the Government in Serbia that they are keen on that too. All I can say is that I would like to know whether the British Government or our allies&#151;NATO or whatever&#151;have firm evidence of where those people are. If I thought that the authorities had been given firm evidence and were unwilling to help, I would have less sympathy for them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para9">I remain open on that issue, which I know is very big   in the country. The Serbs feel that they were not granted the same rights as the Iraqi people to try those who caused severe problems&#151;problems is an understatement. The issue gets to the people there. They saw a further such example when there was no international tribunal in The Hague, or anywhere else, for the criminals who caused all the difficulties in Iraq.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para10">I know that this is a big problem, but I hope that the British Government and others are not saying, &quot;We want those people,&quot; if they have firm intelligence. If they can offer help on the ground with intelligence, I hope they are doing so. If they are not being helped by the authorities, I would certainly have a deal less sympathy for what is going on there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para11">That said, there is a severe humanitarian problem in Serbia and&#151;albeit less so&#151;in Montenegro. Of course, Kosovo is included in that, and it is sad that a number of people come to my surgeries in fear of returning to Kosovo because of action by the Kosovo Liberation Army. They feel that the army is still in control despite international efforts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para12">Kosovo is not the wonderful idyllic state that perhaps we sometimes want to think it is following our intervention there. In many ways, I presume, the indictment of the former Prime Minister of Kosovo reflects, without stirring up too many other problems, our obsession with Irish republicans. It becomes difficult to accept that they have given up military and criminal action, and we have seen in recent months that they have not given up what they say they have given up. Kosovo is like that, only more so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para13">A mere Back Bencher can possibly do a service by raising a matter continually. I cannot do the grand politics of the region, but I can raise the humanitarian problems that exist. This country was instrumental in making things worse by the bombing, however well intentioned the Government and the majority of people in this country&#151;although I happened not to be one of them&#151;thought the intervention would be. What worries me is the huge number of refugees living in Serbia: there are internally displaced people living in appalling conditions, but they are not the only ones who are important. Because of the economic state of the country, there is incredible poverty away from the major cities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para14">One of the problems is that people such as me tend to go to Belgrade when we visit and we see a caf&#233; society that is still almost blossoming. It is a pleasant place, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 212WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
there is affluence and the shops are full of items, but if one goes a few miles away to villages that were never really developed anyway, one is back in an era that many people would be shocked to see in Europe today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para15">Indeed, I heard a report from someone who recently visited a hospital in Zemun, which is just outside Belgrade, on the other side of the river. The last of that hospital&#039;s cookers had packed up, so patients could not have any hot meals and it was down to a couple of volunteers to keep things going. However, Zemun is a major conurbation; it is really part of Belgrade. That that should happen anywhere in Europe&#151;virtually in the capital city of that country&#151;is a disgrace and we must do whatever we can to help.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para16">Pensions and pensioners are one of the biggest problems. There have been masses of suicides because elderly folk cannot afford medication or, in many cases, food. I do not think that I am exaggerating: I really do think that there is a humanitarian disaster there, and we must do something. We owe it to those people not only because they are in Europe, so we should be doing something anyway, but because of the history&#151;not just the recent history&#151;and the fact that the Serbs have been our strong allies in the past.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para17">Incredibly, the Serbs still have great respect for the British. This is the moment to show that we can and we shall help them in their hour of need&#151;not just paternalistically by giving aid, but by treating them as equal partners. The future of that area lies in ensuring that it integrates within the European family. That is some way off, but we must give those countries hope.
</p>



<a name="50322h02_time1"><h5>11.18 am</h5>


<p><a name="50322h02_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Denis MacShane) </b> : I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) for introducing the debate, because it allows the Government to place on the record in the House our current thinking on the western Balkans. I pay sincere tribute to him, as he has consistently brought to the House&#151;in the form of parliamentary questions, oral questions, Adjournment debates and interventions in broader European debates&#151;the issues of the western Balkans in general and of Serbia, to which he is greatly attached, in particular. He has done so very moderately, avoiding some of the polemic to which the region has given rise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para18">I entirely take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point that the people of Serbia deserve a better deal, if not a new deal. For me, Belgrade is the natural capital of the western Balkans. The people of Serbia are cultivated, intelligent and skilled, and in every way have the potential to deliver enormous benefits to the European economy. No Government more than this one would want to see Serbia as anything other than a full member of the European family of nations. I welcome President Marovic&#039;s return visit here; his political business was done on his previous visit a couple of weeks ago. I am in regular and, I hope, friendly contact with other leaders in Belgrade, but it would be helpful if all Serbian elected politicians and leaders in Belgrade spoke with one voice on behalf of the Serb people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para19">It would also be helpful if Serbia moved forward with economic reconstruction. I refer hon. Members to the interesting article in today&#039;s <i>Financial Times</i> about the problem of investing in Serbia and, in particular, the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 213WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
difficulty of ensuring that land is available for investment. According to the <i>Financial Times</i>, great swathes of land are still held under state control, with no liberalisation of land ownership. That results in a paradox: Serbia is one of the poorest countries of Europe, but its housing is among the most expensive. So, there is much that the Serbs themselves can do. I have also had meetings with leading British multinationals to urge them to invest in Serbia and the region. For example, I would like to see direct, low-cost flights to Serbia, as we now have to Croatia. That would be a good step forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para20">Unfortunately, there is the fundamental problem of coming to terms with what happened in the 1990s. The entire elected leadership must clearly say, urbi et orbi, that the indicted war criminals&#151;not just the fugitives Karadzic and Mladic, but the generals whose whereabouts are known&#151;must go to The Hague. We welcome some of the transfers, but I would like 2005 to be the year in which there is a real effort in Serbia, including the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to bring to an end the problem of sending indicted generals and leaders to The Hague.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para21">One might wish that the tribunal process was different, but we cannot rewrite history. Honourable men have gone there, including Ramush Haradinaj, the Prime Minister of Kosovo, who immediately accepted his responsibilities when he was indicted and flew to The Hague without fuss. Others might care to follow his example. We would like 2005 to be the year when we make clear and definite progress in the western Balkans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para22">It is nearly two decades since Slobodan Milosevic made his infamous speech in Kosovo Polje. We all remember with shame the inability of European Governments in the early 1990s to rise to the challenge of stopping the murderous nationalism that was unleashed in that beautiful part of our common European home.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para23">On Sunday, I took my children to see the film &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;, and I know how often you have raised the issue of human rights in Zimbabwe, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It was horrifying to be reminded of how, 11 years ago, a British Government colluded with other European Governments and the United States to prevent the United Nations from backing its forces in Rwanda to stop the genocide. I recommend that all Members of the House take their children to see &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para24">That happened in 1994, but a year later there was a genocidal attack on European citizens, when 8,000 were killed in cold blood at Srebrenica. They were killed because, like the Jews and Roma in the Nazi era, they belonged to the wrong religion or the wrong community. We all thought that the scapegoating of Jews and Gypsies had stopped in 1945. Well, Srebrenica proved us wrong. The United States had to intervene to impose the Dayton settlement, but four years later we saw waves of asylum seekers&#151;I am sure that all Members of the House have had them in their constituency surgeries&#151;fleeing Kosovo because of the brutality there. By then, at least, Britain had a new Government, who were not prepared to sit on their hands. We had decisive British leadership to put together a coalition that was not frightened to use force to deal with tyranny and terror.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para25">That is history&#151;the last century. Today, let us try to look forward, not back. This year, we have a chance to close the chapter on that lost decade and, in particular, to send a message to the men and women of Serbia that their talents and skills deserve a full future in a Serbia fully in Europe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para26">The same is true for Croatia. I regret that it was not possible last week for Croatia to begin talks on accession to the European Union. In my view, it is question of when, not if, a Croatian Minister sits in the European Council and Croatian MEPs take their place in the European Parliament at Strasbourg. Britain wants Croatia in the EU.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para27">When I was made a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister four years ago, one of the first visits I undertook was to Zagreb. I asked the then Croatian Government to take immediate action to deal with the case of Ante Gotovina, the Croatian commander accused of serious war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague. Alas, my entreaties fell on deaf ears, and they have done so every year since.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para28">For four years, I have been repeating that message, and so have Ministers from other major European Governments. Alas, too many agents and officers in the Croatian state apparatus defied the authority of the elected Government and, far from co-operating in persuading Gotovina to report to the Hague, they colluded with him in evading both his and Croatia&#039;s responsibilities under the international rule of law. No one can join the EU on the basis of refusing to accept their responsibilities under the international rule of law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para29">Let me make this appeal through the House of Commons to General Gotovina. An officer of any rank in the army of any democratic state must accept the authority of the elected Government. An officer of any rank in the British Army, the American army or any European army who is charged with any crime in connection with his command has to answer to the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para30">The patriotic and honourable course for General Gotovina is to stop holding the Croatian nation to ransom and to report to The Hague. He will face a fair trial, his living conditions will be good and he will have full legal representation. If he surrenders voluntarily now, there is even the possibility of bail, although I must emphasise that that is a matter for the tribunal, not for any Government, and nor is it a question of negotiation between the tribunal and the accused. As a soldier, General Gotovina should do his last great patriotic duty by going to The Hague. I urge him to open the door to Croatia joining the EU by reporting to the international tribunal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para31">The same goes for Messrs. Mladic and Karadzic. We have sought to work with Serb authorities, but, in the end, it is Serbs who can track down and capture a person wanted in Serbia or the region of Serbian nationality. It is up to the Church and the communities to understand that Serbia&#039;s route to Europe lies through The Hague. We will continue to offer co-operation and officials, including from the Ministry of Defence, are seeking to work with the Serbian Government. The British Government want Serbia on the road to Europe, but not at the price of sweeping under the carpet the terrible crimes committed at Srebrenica 10 years ago.

<p>
<a name="50322h02_para32">The hon. Member for Uxbridge mentioned Macedonia, and I understand that the position is difficult, but he is slightly wrong, as the United Nations, NATO and other international bodies use the name attributed to Macedonia when it split from the former Yugoslavia more than a decade ago. This is a passionate issue in Macedonia and in northern Greece. In Macedonian northern Greece, 2.5 million Greeks see themselves as Macedonian. The name, for them, is a passionate issue. I am not a Solomon in the House of Commons or the Foreign Office to decide between Skopje and Athens. I know that talks are going on. In English, we say that a rose by any other name smells as sweet. I do not know whether that is a proverb in Greece or in Macedonia, but I urge Athens and Skopje to try to find a solution to the problem.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Randall </b> : I understand that there is a problem with the name, but will the Minister give an assurance about relaxing the visa regime? At the moment, Macedonian diplomats still have to get visas to come here. We are one of the few EU countries where they have to do that.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h02_spnew5"><b> Mr. MacShane </b> : We take the view that all citizens from a country where we have a visa regime in place have to apply for visas. Obviously, diplomats accredited to the United Kingdom travel on a diplomatic passport. That is the normal position under the Vienna convention. I am happy to look into that, but where there are visa requirements for citizens, we are not, for obvious reasons, granting the right for anyone to obtain a British visa without going through the normal procedures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h02_para33">I have not been able to deal with Kosovo, but there is a review procedure in that regard. If the hon.

<a name="50322h03_head0"><h3 align=center>Coal Health Claims</h3>

<a name="50322h03_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50322h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham)</b>  (Lab): I am very grateful to Mr. Speaker for allowing me to initiate this debate. The subject is of interest to many right hon. and hon. Members who represent mining and former mining constituencies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para0">I am very proud that the Labour Government put in place the coal handling agreement, which compensates miners and former miners who were affected by their exposure to dust. Thousands of miners and former miners and their families have been compensated for having their health ruined by exposure to coal dust, but no amount of compensation can restore the health of those men, or make up for the heartache that many of their families went through in watching their loved ones die. However, it helps, and in my constituency the scheme has paid more than &#163;18 million to miners and their families. That is evidence that the Labour Government recognise the injustice that was done to those men, and are trying to put things right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para1">Proud though I am of the scheme, the way in which some solicitors and, more sickeningly, claims handlers have sought to exploit it and the victims&#151;who are often elderly or dying&#151;disgusts me and many of my parliamentary colleagues. I am at a loss to know why their sickening and cruel practices have not been highlighted or given more publicity. I can only repeat what I said in this Chamber on 26 August 2004: because the victims are in coalfield communities, rather than leafy, middle-class suburbs, the media choose to ignore their plight. I hope that by raising the issue again today, we can publicise the way in which claims handlers and solicitors exploit vulnerable and dying people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para2">To highlight the appalling way in which claims handlers exploit coal claim victims I shall describe the case of Mr. R. Jobes of Tanfield in my constituency and his dealings with an Ashington-based company, Industrial Disease Compensation Ltd, which is now known as Freeclaim IDC. Mr. Jobes, a former miner, had just over &#163;3,000 of his compensation deducted by IDC. It passed his case to a firm of Liverpool solicitors, Silverbeck Rymer, which, on completion of the claim, deducted the money to recover &quot;IDC&#039;s costs&quot; under the agreement that Mr. Jobes had signed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para3">Silverbeck Rymer was first instructed on 5 February 1999; the judgment that led to the setting up of the coal handling agreement was given in 1998. Therefore, when the firm took the case from IDC, it knew that the scheme was under discussion and that it would not have to enter into any litigation on Mr. Jobes&#039; behalf. Ironically, it was also a member of the claimant group of solicitors, so it was well aware of developments. Indeed, the judge at the time warned the claimant group not to incur any unnecessary disbursements while negotiations on the scheme were taking place. When it took on the case, Silverbeck Rymer knew, as did IDC, that there was no risk at all. When the handling agreement was put in place in September 1999, it also knew that its costs would be covered by the DTI and that the DTI would not attempt to recover costs from claimants in cases that failed. Why, then, did Silverbeck Rymer and IDC deduct that money from Mr. Jobes&#039; settlement?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 217WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para4">I reported Mr. Jobes&#039; complaint to the Law Society, and I would like to record my thanks to the case officer, Mr. Ian Roberts, for his work on Mr. Jobes&#039; behalf. The adjudicator considered the report, found in Mr. Jobes&#039; favour and directed Silverbeck Rymer to pay Mr. Jobes &#163;3,775, including &#163;250 compensation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para5">In what I can describe only as a highly critical judgment, the adjudicator is clear that Silverbeck Rymer should have advised Mr. Jobes that there was no risk in his case and that there was no need for the agreement with IDC. His report states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I have concluded that they did not explain matters to Mr. Jobes so that he could properly understand the funding arrangements and he was not, therefore, in a position to give informed consent to the deductions made by them later&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para6">In this case, there was no risk to IDC. It simply gained &#163;3,000 for passing the case from its client to Silverbeck Rymer. I shall go into this further later on, but clearly the relationship between claims handlers and solicitors is important; claims handlers could
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para7">not exist without the collusion of some solicitors. A question that still remains is what else did IDC get from Silverbeck Rymer? Did it buy the case and get a fee? I shall highlight a case shortly in which a fee was paid by a solicitor to a claims handler.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para8">Although IDC has changed its agreement since Mr. Jobes&#039; case, there must be many hundreds of claimants in the north-east and nationally whose compensation, like that of Mr. Jobes, has been plundered by IDC. I strongly urge them to come forward, because their cases need to be investigated. What IDC did in Mr. Jobes&#039; case was unjustified and there must be many other people in a similar situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para9">Freeclaim IDC is still operating and, according to its website, is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;one of the leading compensation claim funding specialists in the UK.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para10">It goes on to claim that it is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;genuinely &#039;win no fee&#039;. . . There is no need for a client to pay the registration fees, administration fees. . . or start-up costs levied by other compensation service companies.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para11">If that sounds too good to be true, it is. Certainly, Mr. Jobes&#039; dealings with the company were not &quot;win, no fee&quot;: he lost more than &#163;3,000. Later, when it changed the agreement, it charged those registered with it an administration fee of &#163;35. To say that its service is &quot;win, no fee&quot; is absolute rubbish, and it is certainly not true in relation to its latest product.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para12">Having satisfied its bank balance by milking the victims of coal health handling agreements, Freeclaim IDC is now targeting asbestos victims by charging &#163;587 for a CT chest scan and getting people to take out &#163;1,500 loans for insurance policies to cover unsuccessful cases. I have real concerns about unqualified individuals asking people to have CT scans. Will the Minister ask the relevant Department to look into those activities? It worries me that a company with no medical expertise is exposing people to high levels of radiation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para13">Clearly, contrary to the claim on the website, the service is not &quot;genuinely win no fee&quot;. I have read the agreement, which states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In the event of a successful claim Freeclaim IDC guarantees the maximum of &#163;399 will be deducted from your compensation to cover legal expenses which cannot be recovered from your opponent&quot;.</p>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;that if you are a Trade Union member and if the court considers that it would have been more appropriate for you to pursue a claim via your Trade Union, IDC reserves the right to raise the &#163;399 maximum deduction from your compensation to &#163;800&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para17">Surely, solicitors should advise their clients&#151;as they should have in Mr. Jobes&#039; case&#151;that there are alternative ways of funding and pursuing their cases. For example, if they are members of a trade union their cases can, in most cases, be handled for nothing. Likewise, if they look at their household or other insurance policies, they might find that they are covered for legal expenses. Why are solicitors not advising people that there are alternative ways of pursuing cases? Asbestos victims are still finding themselves out of pocket.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para18">The <i>Newcastle Evening Chronicle</i> highlighted the case of a trade union member who went to IDC but decided to pursue his case through his trade union, Amicus. He has been left with a bill for more than &#163;500.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para19">The Law Society needs to take an urgent look at the relationship between its members and claims handlers. It is not good enough for it to state that claims handlers are unregulated; the actions of its members are allowing claims handlers to operate, to the financial detriment of individuals who could get access to justice more cheaply and, in many cases, more effectively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para20">I thought that I had come across every scam there is in relation to miners&#039; compensation claims, but there is a new firm operating in the north-east. An advertisement from a company called Mineworkers Compensation Services appeared in last week&#039;s <i>Sunday Sun</i> in Newcastle:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Do you have an ongoing compensation claim against the coal board? Transfer your claim to us and get &#163;100.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para21">It is not clear from the advertisement whether that is from a Government organisation, so I rang the freephone number and posed as a potential client. What I have to expose alarms me greatly. I spoke to a Mr. Philip Rogers, who was very helpful and forthcoming. He gave me a lot of information. I understand that he is a partner in a claims handling company. He stated that he set it up because a lot of law firms had taken on too many cases and, he said, could not deal with the backlog. I asked him whether he and his colleagues were solicitors. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;but we have a close relationship with a North Shields-based company called Hindle Campbell.&quot; I asked him what would happen if I moved a claim to his firm. He told me that I would be given &#163;100 straight away for transferring it. I asked whether anything would be deducted from the compensation. He replied, &quot;Oh, no, certainly not&#151;we get our fee from the solicitors.&quot; The firm of solicitors is paying his company to steal cases from other firms dealing with such cases, which is scandalous.

partner in the company that he has set up, and he also works for Hindle Campbell. That is against Law Society rules, and it demonstrates that claims handlers&#151;in this case, Mineworkers Compensation Services&#151;could not exist without the collusion of, if not working in partnership with, firms of solicitors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para23">I also asked about Hindle Campbell&#039;s record in miners&#039; compensation. Is it an expert or large firm? I understand that it is a small practice in North Shields that does personal injury work like any other company, and that it has no expertise in miners&#039; compensation work. I shall certainly write to the Law Society about this, but I must also ask the Minister whether he will have a meeting with the Law Society, or at least raise with it the issue of collusion. None of these claims handlers could operate if they did not have firms of solicitors working with them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para24">The Government must regulate claims handling firms. Self-regulation has been tried and the Claims Standards Council has been set up, but it is not acceptable to me. On its website, it claims to ensure

<p>
<a name="50322h03_para29">I understand that the Claims Standards Council has applied to the Office of Fair Trading under the OFT&#039;s consumer code approval scheme for the approval of its code of practice.

Innocent and often poor people are being exploited because of their ignorance of the legal system. That must stop. Many of us in this Chamber went into politics to fight injustice. In my experience, there is nothing as unjust as the cases that I and other Members have come across, and the way in which claims handlers have exploited the old, the vulnerable and the weak.

Enough is enough.

Nottinghamshire who have been quite bluntly given false hopes and expectations. The problem is simply this: people in coalfield areas are honest and hard working. Many of them have given their health and, in many cases, their lives working down the pits to keep us warm. Although there have been difficulties, the two coal health schemes have been enormously important in north Nottinghamshire. My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham quoted figures for his area; in Nottinghamshire, the two schemes together have brought in &#163;265 million to former miners because of injuries to their health. Of that &#163;265 million, however, a significant amount is simply being siphoned off.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para36">My hon. Friend talked about claims handlers, and one body of claims handlers is the trade unions. I have talked to a variety of trade unions in the coal sector: the National Union of Mineworkers, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers, the deputies&#039; union, and the British Association of Colliery Management&#151;Technical, Energy and Administrative Management, the managers&#039; union. All of them make some charge for handling coal health claims.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para37">The BACM makes a small charge in lieu of trade union membership. I do not object to that. It is right that if a trade union operates for somebody outside the membership, it should charge a membership fee. I fundamentally object to companies such as Vendside, which is connected to the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, in effect double charging. Let us be clear that with coal health claims the union gets its fees from the Government, and they are significant and substantial fees. I am at a loss to know why any trade union should be ripping off members and former members by double charging and taking a fee out of the compensation awarded to miners. That is wrong, it must stop, and those bodies, which are about fraternity, ought to act more sensibly.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew4"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies  (Ogmore)</b>  (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree with the comment made by Mr. Bleddyn Hancock of NACODS South Wales, who said way back in 1998 in an interview in <i>The Independent</i>:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The individual will end up with a fraction of what they will get. The general procedure is that miners go through their union because it will back their claims and we have the miner&#039;s interests at heart&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para38">Does my hon. Friend think that Bleddyn Hancock would be on sounder ground if NACODS South Wales was not deducting 10 per cent. from claims?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew5"><b> Paddy Tipping </b> : I have taken a great interest in the matter. That individual does not operate only in south Wales; his organisation operates in the Kent coalfields, and significant sums are being made. I know also that the gentleman concerned was a trustee of the miners pension scheme and made some fairly outrageous comments and false promises about that. Organisations ought to look after the people they represent, and the double-claiming in the trade union movement is quite wrong and should stop.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para39">As my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham said, given the tremendous amounts of money coming into the coalfields, claims handlers are casting their net wider. Asbestosis has been mentioned. One area of

<br>&nbsp;<br>
operation is the making of false promises to women who used to work in the textile sector over their deafness claims. Many of those individuals are claiming through Vendside, many of them have taken out loans, and many of them have been left with loans when they cannot make payments on the cost of an unsuccessful case. Instead of no win, no fee, it is no compensation and real debt. That is most unsatisfactory. I say to the Minister that that is a real scandal and the time has come to act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para40">The second scandal is the issue well illustrated by my hon. Friend&#151;the unsavoury relationship between some claims handlers and some firms of solicitors. I am delighted that the Law Society has begun to consider the matter more closely; I am sorry that it has taken so long for it to act; and I hope that it will act with vigour, so that those claims handlers who have a relationship with firms of solicitors, leading to the conning of people in the Nottinghamshire coalfield, are dealt with appropriately. Professional people who ought to know better are letting the desire for money work against their public interests and, more particularly, their professional interests. If that is the case, they should be disciplined.

<a name="50322h03_para42">My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr.   Mann) was moving from the problem with solicitors to that with claims handlers. I wonder whether his experience has been similar to mine. It has been easier to get money back from solicitors, but the danger is that we do not know how many people might have been double charged by solicitors. Would he support the Government&#039;s conducting a systematic trawl through the people who have received final settlements to find out how many have been double charged, so that we can get their money back for them?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew10"><b> John Mann </b> : I would wholeheartedly endorse that. The problem is that people feel that once they have

<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 223WH</b>

signed a piece of paper they are legally bound. The solicitors who are given the work by the claims handlers write and tell the individuals, and take a dual instruction&#151;one from the claims handler and another from the claimant. I have letters, received in the past week, from the largest firm of solicitors when it comes to outstanding claims, Beresfords, warning people of the danger of not paying money to claims handlers. That is a routine feature of the system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para43">Let me explain how claims handlers go about their business. I can give a good example: only two weeks ago, I was on the Larwood estate in my constituency. A widow aged 92 had received a knock on the door. A claims handler had gone to a pensioner&#039;s bungalow&#151;it would be a good bet in Worksop that a miner or a deceased miner would be related to the person living there&#151;and asked: &quot;Has anyone in the household or any of your relatives worked in the mining industry since 1954? There&#039;s money due to you and we can get it.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para44">In the miners&#039; welfare clubs, it is the same. I suspect that some miners&#039; welfare clubs were paid to put leaflets out. Men, some of whom have retired, and widows of men who may have died many years ago were told that they could get some money at no risk to themselves. The companies said that they would do the work and that those people need do nothing. It seems perfectly reasonable, on the face of it, that there should be a payment for the work that has been done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para45">I have referred more than 700 cases to the Law Society in which solicitors were negligent about advising that, with this scheme, uniquely, the defendant had conceded the costs and they would be paid in full.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : Does my hon. Friend agree that the case of Mr. Jobes against Silverbeck Rymer highlights that point exactly? The company was working not in the best interests of Mr. Jobes, as solicitors should, but in its own best interests to get the fee or the work.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew12"><b> John Mann </b> : My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. Who are the solicitors who work for such companies? For example, Moss Solicitors threaten me and my constituents, but, having read an adjudication from the Law Society, it has been repaying money in the past week as a good will gesture. Why is it repaying a good will fee to my constituents if it has done nothing wrong?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para46">Moss is the firm of solicitors that told my constituents that, as the Law Society has confirmed in writing, I&#151;as the MP&#151;was &quot;playing politics&quot; by challenging it. I do not know whether we have the advantage of free libel advice in this place. If we have, I appeal to a solicitor who is an expert in libel law to come forward, because anything that I can win from Moss Solicitors I will donate to the miners who have not received at least &#163;500. That is an offer that a decent firm of specialist solicitors might like to take up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para47">Why do I have only 700 cases, when there are thousands in Bassetlaw alone? People believe that because they signed on the dotted line, they are legally bound. They do not understand, even when they read my column in the <i>Worksop Guardian,</i> that they did not have to sign and that the advice was negligent. In the case of those who understand, another factor comes into

Friend agree that a claims handling company that calls on a home in a mining community and encourages people to sign on the dotted line but fails to inform them that the DTI would pay the legal fees is culpable and should have to make a refund?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew14"><b> John Mann </b> : I have demanded that. My hon. Friend mentioned IDC. I have dealt with similar cases, and I have written to suggest such a refund but the company has declined to correspond with me. There is PR Associates; large amounts of money have been taken from claimants when they have rightfully won their compensation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para48">Another such company is Union and General Services. I would like to sue that firm but, of course, I cannot do so because it has gone into voluntary liquidation. So, who can we find? Mr. A. J. Revill was the owner. We can do something to him, because information provided to me in the past few days suggests that Mr. Revill is a member of a party that I know rather well. Should it be the same Mr. Revill&#151;I apologise to my fellow party member if it is not, but the details seem remarkably similar, as the address is near to that of Union and General Services in Thorne in Doncaster&#151;our party should expel him forthwith because he is not fit to hold a party card of the Labour party, or, indeed, of any party.

<a name="50322h03_para50">The name, Union and General, sounds reputable&#151;it sounds like the kind of company one might go to: the deal, to the individual, sounds good. It will take only 10 per cent. or so. The fact that the defendant had conceded the entire payment of the fees was not made clear, and that is the point of law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para51">The biggest firm, Vendside, was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping). Many interesting things will begin to emerge about Vendside in the next few weeks, I am certain. One issue that my hon. Friend the Minister could consider referring to his friend, the Chancellor, is the VAT charged by the claims handlers. In the case of Vendside, is there an input VAT as well? Are there union costs? Is a company being set up to maximise tax benefits that would not be available if so-called membership or union fees were being paid? Union membership fees are not &quot;VAT-able&quot;. The Inland Revenue needs to address that imminently.
</p>

<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 225WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Mr. Towler, who started off in the unemployment centre in Sunderland but now drives a nice new Mercedes and lives in a big house in Northumberland&#151;have given legitimacy to some of the claims handling companies? Frankly, we cannot blame a lot of people for thinking that the companies are part of the trade union and labour movement. Until recently, I understand that Freeclaim IDC was registered in Guernsey.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew18"><b> John Mann </b> : Such companies have that legitimacy. Claims handlers and solicitors are swapped between companies. I believe that some of those connected with Vendside worked elsewhere, including for Capita Insurance Services&#151;or Aon IRISC, or any of the various names that it has gone under. That should be specifically investigated by the Minister to see whether there is any impropriety about data protection and the exchange of information and whether Government contracts have been suitably worded to stop people illicitly transferring information or knowledge from one organisation to another. I do not know, but with all the claims such things need to be considered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para52">There are other solicitors: Moss, AMS Law, Beresfords, Frank Allen Pennington, Robinson King, Kidd Spoor Harper, Mincoffs, and Watson Burton. Those are merely the ones I have referred to the Law Society. They are not tin-pot, diddly-squat organisations, but big, rich, wealthy solicitors, who are bringing down the good name of solicitors across Britain. We need stronger action against them from the Law Society and the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para53">In my view, the Government could do more. We cannot just wait. Frank Allen Pennington repaid &#163;705 only last week to one of my constituents. This week, it refused to pay.

<p>
<a name="50322h03_para54">We cannot take cases in dribs and drabs and ones and twos at the whim of any solicitors who have conspired with the claims handlers to take money illicitly, in my view, from our constituents. The Law Society should be doing a lot more and should also be considering that collusion. I have handed some of my files to the fraud squad.

The DTI could and should have done more, and should be doing more. The Lord Chancellor&#039;s Department is, rightly, answering the debate, so may I suggest to the Minister that his Department look at funding test cases against each of the claims handlers to prove to our constituents that the money should never have been taken? That would open the floodgates. Rather than each individual having to take civil action at risk to themselves to prove the point, the Government should take test cases to show that in the spirit of the agreements such people should not have been deducting the money.

<a name="50322h03_para55">Finally, for other kinds of claims, such as the textile, deafness and knee claims, we clearly need a system that works far better. Having been enticed into making a claim, a constituent has found that having won the claim they owe money because of the interest that has built up under the insurance policy. I am challenging that, and I believe that our challenge will succeed. However, we should not have to challenge it, as regulation should be much tighter&#151;at least as tight as the Financial Services Authority&#039;s remit over insurance sellers and others. Claims handlers should fall within the ambit of the Law Society, which should have increased powers to deal with them. We need to get the money back for our people from those hideous organisations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para56">Claims handlers came on to the scene just after the two compensation schemes were widely publicised. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) referred to some of the names that claim handlers use, such as Union and General Services, the Miners Welfare and Compensation Agency and PR Associates. Many of those names are meant to mislead. Many people in mining communities associate the Miners Welfare and Compensation Agency with the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation, and they associate Union and General Services with the trade unions. People have been misled into putting their claims with solicitors through go-betweens&#151;claims farmers&#151;which have taken large amounts of money.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para57">Let me give an example from my constituency. I shall not name the widow because the case is likely to proceed to court, but she was visited by the Miners Welfare and Compensation Agency. She thought that it was an official organisation related to the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation, and she gave it permission to take her case. It lodged the case with a firm of solicitors called Lopian Wagner of Manchester. That lady had &#163;9,000 taken from her total compensation, and the company went as far as making a deduction from her bereavement payment. It took the full weight of this place and the focus of the media to force the company to refund her.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para58">Claims farmers need to be controlled, and I urge the Minister to think about how that can be done. I suggest that it can be done through the way in which the Law Society controls solicitors. We could make the solicitor taking on the work from a claims farmer responsible for paying the fee, rather than the claims farmer being able to charge the client. If we controlled the system through the solicitor, we would get to grips with this scandalous operation, and solicitors would be extremely wary of taking on a contract with a claims farmer.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 227WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para59">It must also be pointed out that there are two ways in which claims farmers deal with solicitors. Sometimes they take cases and charge a solicitor for delivering the cases to them, but on other occasions they come to an understanding&#151;almost a contract&#151;that the solicitor will pay their fee from the compensation the claimant receives before the cheque is sent on to the claimant. If we tackle the situation first through ensuring that claims farmers, like solicitors, have to have insurance, and secondly by controlling them through the solicitor by making the solicitor responsible for the way they behave, we could get to grips with the problem. However the Minister decides to proceed, this scandalous problem must be dealt with.

<a name="50322h03_time4"><h5>2.49 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50322h03_spnew23"><b> Paul Holmes  (Chesterfield)</b>  (LD): I join others in paying tribute to the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) for securing the debate and to all other hon. Members who have spoken and reinforced, with many local examples, the points that he made. The importance of the debate is shown partly by the fact that it is one in a long series of debates over the past few years that hon. Members have raised about claims handlers and solicitors double charging.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para60">As we have already heard, it is an important issue because of the number of people affected and the amount of money involved for people who are often elderly, sick or bereaved and are gaining compensation for injuries or deaths in the family resulting from work that was performed. In Chesterfield alone, up to January more than &#163;6.6 million was paid in compensation just for respiratory diseases. About 2,300 claims have been settled or are in the process of being settled, with interim and outstanding settlements, and there are about another 1,800 after that. It is a major problem in ex-coal mining constituencies, and it results from the way the system has been so disgracefully exploited and abused.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para61">We have heard many stories of disreputable behaviour, initially by solicitors double charging, and we heard today about claim handlers or firms, which are exploiting people who, as we have heard repeatedly, are often elderly, sick or from families of miners who have died. We have heard examples of their activities, such as cold calling, misleading claims of no win, no fee, and conning people into paying for expensive insurance, which makes a mockery of the idea of no win, no fee.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para62">We are fairly lucky in Chesterfield in that my constituency case load and my talks with the local unemployed workers centre yesterday reflect the fact that there do not seem to be any problems with the main group of NUM solicitors&#151;Graysons&#151;which deals with most cases in my area. There are complaints, though not on the same scale as those that some Members have reported, about claims handling companies operating in the area. We are relatively lucky, but we do experience many of the problems that we have heard about.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew24"><b> Chris Bryant </b> : Part of the difficulty is that we do not know the real extent of the problem. In all the cases in my constituency in which we have tried to get money back from lawyers, we have been successful, but we have not been so successful with claim handlers. However, I 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 228WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
have no idea whether I have seen the real extent of the problem; the Government need to trawl through so that we know the extent of the problem.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew25"><b> Paul Holmes </b> : I agree absolutely with the hon. Gentleman: we do not know if we have dealt with or uncovered the tip of the iceberg or a substantial part of the problem. We simply have no idea how extensive the problem is.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew26"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : We are scratching the tip of the iceberg. It was estimated that one of the biggest claim handlers in my region&#151;NACODS South Wales&#151;had raised &#163;13 million by the middle of last year. That is only one organisation with 40 members, so where is the money coming from? The Minister must take on board and feed back to the DTI the fact that we need a root and branch investigation of what is happening with claim handlers, because I think that millions of pounds are being skimmed off from miners.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew27"><b> Paul Holmes </b> : I agree that we do not know how big the problem is. I have come across examples of elderly people who either do not want to pursue the matter because they are too old, or are embarrassed because they feel that they have been made a fool of and ripped off. Unless we find the people responsible, we will not know how many are out there, because there are many hidden cases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para63">We have heard lots of details today and in previous debates about what happens and about individual cases, and I will not rehearse that. I want to talk about why it happens and what we can do about it. As we all know, unscrupulous people in any area of activity will always exploit loopholes to make money, even when that means exploiting elderly and sick people. Some abuse has been immoral but legal and within the scope of the law. What can and should the Government and the Law Society do to minimise such abuse?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para64">The original 1997 agreement could have explicitly prohibited the charging of an additional fee for solicitors&#039; work, as has been done in other cases, but the Government did not do so. That led to the exploitation of double charging. The rules were changed later, which has led to most, but not all, solicitors stopping double charging.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para65">Reimbursements by solicitors who double charged are being made, but often only when the individual, perhaps through their MP, pursues the case. Some firms of solicitors have made a lot of money out of double charging, but are not systematically going through their files and automatically reimbursing the money. Individuals bringing cases forward are, again, just the tip of the iceberg.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew28"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : Last year in Westminster Hall, I raised the case of a company in Newcastle, Mark Gilbert Morse, which has about 29,000 claims, but has reimbursed only about 50 individuals. I have tried to urge the Law Society to trawl that company&#039;s books to see who it has not paid back. Would the hon. Gentleman support the Government taking action to force that company and others to pay back every single penny, not when people complain to them, but as a matter of course?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew29"><b> Paul Holmes </b> : The hon. Gentleman touches on the point that I was going to raise at the end of my 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 229WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
comments. We need to consider what the Government can do to close loopholes and enforce compensation or reimbursement if people have been exploited. Between them, what can the Government and the Law Society do? Rather than wringing their hands and saying, &quot;This is terrible, but it has happened and it wasn&#039;t totally illegal&quot;, action must be taken. It is almost worthless for a law firm to deal with only 1,000 individual cases that have been brought to its attention out of a total of 19,000, because the vast majority of people who have been exploited and ripped off are not getting the compensation they deserve. The Law Society could have been more proactive earlier, and I ask the Minister what the Government and the Law Society could do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para66">Claim handlers, which we are specifically discussing, can flourish only when solicitors work with them by buying claims from them&#151;otherwise there would be no point in having claims handling firms. Therefore, by using such firms, solicitors are endorsing their activities. Many people criticise the Law Society for being ineffective in policing itself and its members, and I have a lot of sympathy with those criticisms, but at least it is willing to talk about the need for better regulation of groups other than lawyers and solicitors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para67">The Law Society has talked about claim handlers and claims management companies needing greater regulation. It points out:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Before March 2004, solicitors were not permitted to pay third parties for the referral of cases. The rule was designed to ensure that there were no improper influences constraining the independence of advice given by solicitors to their clients. However, the rule was subject to significant criticism from the Office of Fair Trading (and some solicitors&#039; firms) as being anti-competitive.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para68">The rule was changed in March 2004, but with certain conditions&#151;for example, that there should be no cold calling, although we have heard that that still happens on a large scale. Will the Minister tell us where we are in reviewing that change made a year ago, and whether the Government plan to reverse it to prevent claim handlers from selling on bulk cases to solicitors, which was prohibited under the original rule?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para69">The Law Society also states that, for some years, it has been
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;pressing the Government to introduce effective regulation of claims handling companies. The Society has suggested that this could be done by amending the definition of litigation in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, so as to cover advice given in contemplation of litigation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para70">That suggestion would mean that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;only those who were qualified to conduct litigation could operate claims handling businesses on a commercial basis.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para71">Alternatively, the Law Society suggested that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;regulation could be achieved through the Office of Fair Trading.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para72">Will the Minister tell us where the Government have got to on that subject, and, in the light of Sir David Clementi&#039;s review, what action they plan to take to control claims handling firms and stamp out the abuses that we have heard about?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para73">It is not enough to complain about the exploitation of the elderly, the sick and the bereaved in our constituencies, as has so eloquently been described today and in previous debates. What action will the Government take to close legal loopholes and stop abuses, especially with regard to claim handlers, and, if 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 230WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
necessary, to enforce action to ensure that all firms of solicitors refund double charging that they have legally extorted from people in the past? Surely solicitors who abuse the system and refuse to refund the money, or are difficult about doing so, should be struck off, because they are not fit to continue practising.
</p>



<a name="50322h03_time5"><h5>2.59 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50322h03_spnew30"><b> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire)</b>  (Con): We have had a most useful debate; I congratulate the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) on securing it, and on speaking as he did. He exposed a range of abuses in the coal health claims system, under the two schemes that were started following the success of the group actions in 1997 and 1998.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para74">It is worth reflecting that, having established liability&#151;the unions must take a good deal of the credit for pursuing the cases in the way they did&#151;the handling agreements were a major step forward. At least in principle, those agreements should mean that the people who suffered, their widows and their dependants receive the money much more quickly than they would if everything had to go through court. However, there are still well over 400,000 claims to be dealt with, so there is still some way to go.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para75">One aspect has not yet been mentioned, and I would be grateful if the Minister commented on it. It is the criticism in <i>The Northern Echo </i>earlier this year about Capita IRISC, if it is still called that, a claims-handling business that the Government use to deal with claims through the Department of Trade and Industry. According to senior civil servants, a memorandum disclosed to <i>The Northern Echo</i> suggested that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the work of Capita Irisc should be put out to public tender as soon as possible, to allow other companies to bid for the contract.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para76">The article went on:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Capita Irisc &#039;has been causing concern&#039; over the years and successive officials &#039;have not grasped the nettle&#039;.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew31"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : I accept that some of us have a slight advantage over the hon. Gentleman, as we have lived and breathed this issue for a while, but I point out that Capita is not a claims handling company, although I concur with some criticisms of how it handled the coal claims dealt with by the DTI.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew32"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : Capita IRISC is described as the claims handling company for the DTI, but, of course, it does not play the same role as the claims handlers that the hon. Gentleman is talking about.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para77">Capita IRISC seems to be criticised substantially for
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;allowing &#039;a paper mountain to develop within the system&#039; with &#039;layer upon layer of low grade staffing&#039;.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para78">It has been suggested that there is a

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para79">in allowing it to continue to do its work over such an extended period.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew33"><b> Paddy Tipping </b> : I sympathise with criticisms about IRISC. The criticisms that the hon. Gentleman read out appear to come from the DTI, but if there are real criticisms to be made, they are of the DTI itself for not giving clear guidance on policy and for badly 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 231WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
miscalculating the number of claims that would be made. The real problem is not with IRISC; it is with poor policy advice that initially came from the Department.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew34"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : The point that I was about to make&#151;and it ties in with what the hon. Gentleman says&#151;is that it looks as though there is a case for a review of what happens at the DTI, to see whether it can speed up what it does. The hon. Gentleman makes the point that the initial estimated number of cases was wrong. I think that the Department estimated there would be 100,000, and in the end there were about 750,000, so no one could argue with that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para80">The schemes are very important, and the points that have been made by hon. Gentlemen today are important, too. If, as it seems, people have been given false hope, and told that claims were worth while when they were not, that needs to be addressed. There has been substantial double charging, and not just in relation to the &#163;2,000 that the Government provide; in addition, substantial proportions of claims were taken by solicitors and claims handlers. That needs to be addressed, too.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew35"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): The issue is much wider than one of claims-handlers encouraging would-be claimants to think that their claim would be much more substantial than it was. There has been any number of cases in which they encouraged the gullible claimants or their descendants to exaggerate or fabricate the evidence or extent of the illness or injury caused by mining. That is utterly reprehensible, is it not?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew36"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : Yes, indeed. Every time a false or hopelessly exaggerated case is brought, it slows the payment of claims to those who desperately need the money, many of whom are elderly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para81">I agree that we should look at the relationship between solicitors and claims handlers. It is welcome that the Law Society has said that double charging is unethical, and has asked firms to pay back the money that was double-charged. I agreed with the point made by the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham): the Law Society might be the best focal point, in terms of trying to achieve some control over the whole system. It would be well worth the Minister&#039;s while to consider that, and to see whether there is some way in which solicitors&#039; rules can be tightened to ensure that the claims handling side of the system works better.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew37"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : May I postulate a way forward that the hon. Gentleman might want to consider? It arises from Sir David Clementi&#039;s review. He sets out six broad guidelines on how legal services should operate, and they include matters such as the protection and promotion of consumer interest. However, what is not mentioned in those six points is ethical behaviour and ethical standards, although he does talk about them later, and says that they should be in the regulatory framework.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para82">Does the hon. Gentleman believe that anything that comes out of the review should result in us putting the need for ethical behaviour from solicitors in regulations, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 232WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
and right at the top of those regulations, too? Does he agree that there should be an ethical duty on solicitors that forces them to avoid getting into the same situation again, a situation in which some of the most vulnerable constituents&#151;let us not beat about the bush&#151;are being ripped off by solicitors?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew38"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : As I said in an intervention on the hon. Member for North Durham, there is concern about what happens once we say that people who are not professional can represent others in legal proceedings. I practised in industrial tribunals as a lawyer for many years, but I know that often the trade union representative knew more about the matter than I did. There was some excellent representation on offer from the trade unions, and indeed employers. However, we want to be sure that people are given good quality advice. I am worried by the idea of an organisation that does not have a person trained in legal matters undertaking work when it is not skilled in what it is doing. The trend at the moment seems to be towards allowing more of that sort of approach.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para83">The hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) said that there has been a change, and that previously solicitors were not allowed to buy in great classes of cases. One could argue that there were good reasons for that. All movement seems to be towards opening up legal practice to more competition from people who are unqualified. Although there might well be a case for that, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that ethical conduct, high professional standards and all those aspects of the matter should be at the centre of our concern.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew39"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman feel that ethical conduct should be set out as a duty in regulations? That is the strongly held feeling of many hon. Members; such conduct should be a duty for those involved&#151;whether they are lawyers, solicitors or a management organisation&#151;and not something implied.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew40"><b> Mr. Heald </b> : Certainly, one needs to achieve that outcome. We are still considering the Clementi review, and I imagine that the Government are doing the same. If one follows the logic of the review, which is that people who are nothing to do with the legal world can own solicitors&#039; practices, it opens up the possibility that one of the claims handling firms that has been discussed could buy a firm of solicitors and operate it, even though it was not legally qualified in any way, and might not have the same standards as the solicitors&#039; profession would normally expect. It is important that we act in a way that retains the ethical standards of the solicitors&#039; profession, and I agree that it is important to focus on the Law Society and its role.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para84">I would have thought that, by and large, trade unions probably provide a pretty good service in this area. However, if there are concerns about how trade unions are operating, there should not be any barrier to ensuring that they are properly regulated like everyone else.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para85">There seem to be concerns about how the DTI and solicitors operate. That needs to be addressed, and perhaps that is also true of claims handlers, through the Law Society. Perhaps the trade unions need to raise their game, in some cases. I will be extremely interested to hear how the Minister intends to accomplish all that.

<a name="50322h03_time6"><h5>3.10 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50322h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Mr. David Lammy) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) on securing this good and important debate. I particularly thank my hon. Friends the Members for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping), for Bassetlaw (John Mann) and for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) for their powerful and passionate contributions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para86">The debate is, in effect, about justice&#151;social justice. It is about what all of us in this Room went into politics to do: assist people who are vulnerable and who cannot speak up for themselves. Therefore, it is most definitely about the role of our solicitors in society, and the claims management industry that has grown up over the past few years. Central to that discussion is the subject of regulation, particularly of our solicitors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para87">We expect the highest standards of our solicitors and lawyers; on the whole, they are respected across the world, but it is the practice that we are debating today that goes furthest towards undermining that reputation. That is why the Government made the decision, which they announced yesterday, to accept Sir David Clementi&#039;s recommendation on the regulation of solicitors: that is, to separate their representative function&#151;their function as a trade union of solicitors&#151;and their regulatory function. It is precisely because of some of the frustrations that we have heard about this afternoon that that decision had to be taken. There is an issue about how our solicitors are regulated, notwithstanding the work that the Law Society has done and is doing on the issue. I will come back to that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para88">The sharp and wicked practices in the claims management sector must stop. My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood reminded me in the House a few months ago that the sector was in the last chance saloon; the saloon door is now closed. The Government are moving to regulate that area. It really is outrageous what some of our vulnerable constituents have had to experience.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para89">Obviously, I do not represent a former coal mining area, and particular issues arise in those constituencies. However, what my hon. Friends and I share is the fact that we represent some of the poorest constituencies in this country&#151;the constituencies that come high up in the index of deprivation, the constituencies where over 50 or 70 per cent. of children are on free school meals. We understand what that means for those people. We understand the incomes that they have, and we understand what it means when someone knocks on the door, advertises in the newspaper or appears on television, wearing a suit, and says, &quot;Look, I can provide this service.&quot; We understand what it means to those very hard working people who take on face value what professionals claim to offer before moving on to exploit people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para90">When we talked about the issue in the past, we tended to assume that claims handling is a dry, technical or legal issue, and we heard in this debate that it is far from that. It is not about legalese; it is about the everyday lives of some of the most vulnerable people in this country, especially in former mining areas in the north, and in the Welsh valleys and other areas.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 234WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para91">This issue is about access to justice. It is about ensuring that people have honest, accurate and effective legal support that does not raise expectations but is fully committed when a client has a genuinely good case. People must have proper routes to redress, where redress is required, and compensation must be targeted on those with genuine cases who deserve the full weight of our support. The Government&#039;s position on this issue is clear. We need to tackle the practices that help to encourage false expectations of compensation, and to improve effectiveness and efficiency for people who have a genuine claim.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para92">Let me explain why some of the practices of claims management companies have been unacceptable. Their methods of dealing with potential clients are often inexcusable. Some of them use the hard sell, putting the squeeze on people even if there is little chance of them receiving compensation. Their practices are even worse because of the kinds of people they approach&#151;ordinary working miners and former miners, and people who work in the textile industry and factories. They are vulnerable people who expect more from lawyers, and from people who operate with lawyers and the insurance industry. The law can seem like a minefield, and it is the job of legal professionals to help people plot their way through it. At its best, the legal system in our country is the finest in the world, providing honest, transparent and expert advice. However, claims companies have failed to live up to that standard. Many of them earn money by using complex systems of referral fees and charges, and, ultimately, the losing party picks up the cost.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew41"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : I welcome today&#039;s announcement on the regulation of claims handlers, although it will take some time to come into effect. Meanwhile, I would like the Minister to urge the Office of Fair Trading and other organisations to act against some of the claim handlers. Will he agree to join me and other Members who are present in meeting the Law Society and other organisations to see what we can do to clamp down now on some of their sharp practices?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew42"><b> Mr. Lammy </b> : Absolutely. I will meet all colleagues in this Room and beyond who want to continue to take action on this issue before a regulatory framework is put in place. I will continue to work with the Claims Standards Council to see what more we can do, and I would be happy to meet the Law Society, which is doing work in this area. We must do more with solicitors, too.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para93">Members have raised issues to do with the Department of Trade and Industry. The Trade and Industry Committee is looking at this issue, and it is due to report shortly. Colleagues in the DTI will want to wait and see what its report says before taking action. All across the Government, the pips are squeaking for this group of people; that is happening because of pressure applied by Members who are present.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew43"><b> David Taylor </b> : All Members for mining areas and former mining areas will welcome that announcement.

We are moving forward: we are accepting the Clementi recommendations; later this year, we will publish our White Paper; we have stated that we are bringing the claims management sector into the loop. As we continue to introduce legislation, we must look closely at the key issues. As we move to regulate the claims management industry and to set up a new regulatory framework for our lawyers, we must look at any gaps that exist, and at how to get the best legislation possible.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew45"><b> Chris Bryant </b> : Everybody will have been glad to have heard the Minister say that the saloon door is closed. However, although I do not want to mix metaphors too much, unfortunately, in many cases, the horse has already bolted. There are many cases throughout the country&#151;thousands we suspect, but we do not know precisely how many&#151;where people have already had the money taken from them. That is a serious problem, and changing the legislation now will not affect those cases. Will the Minister look into how we can establish the precise level of this problem in our country? That might be a matter for the DTI, rather than for his Department.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew46"><b> Mr. Lammy </b> : Colleagues in the DTI continue to look into that, and, as I have said, the Trade and Industry Committee is working on it. Many people who are caught up in this way are out there in the system. In its newsletter to former coal miners&#151;not just individually, but through their networks and organisations, and through the citizens advice bureaux and other organisations&#151;the DTI has called for people to come forward. There are problems caused by the fact that some of these cases began a long time ago; people might have moved or died, for example. However, that work is going on, and through the networks and the concerns voiced in this debate, colleagues in the DTI might be able to take it forward in a more strategic way, regardless of what the Trade and Industry Committee says. We should not underestimate the size of this issue, or how long some of these cases go back.

<p>
<a name="50322h03_para94">I have spoken a little about the effects of some of these practices&#151;the cold calling, the hard sell, the aggressive behaviour, the unprofessional conduct&#151;on vulnerable people in our communities. We have heard a lot about that from Members today. The Government have favoured self-regulation, and I welcome the steps the Claims Standards Council has taken. It has attempted to produce comprehensive rules and consumer and commercial codes of practice&#151;although I was concerned by what my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham said about the fuzzy line of some of that practice between solicitors and claims managers, and I will look into that.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew47"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : I have enjoyed the Minister&#039;s contribution, and I welcome what he has said, but how can the Claims Standards Council have any credibility when organisations such as Freeclaim IDC are founding

members? That is not merely akin to giving Dracula the keys to the blood bank; such organisations have been given a say in how to construct the council. It can have no credibility at all if the very companies that are ripping off my constituents and those of other Members are founder members.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew48"><b> Mr. Lammy </b> : I hear my hon. Friend&#039;s frustration. We said that we would move to self-regulation; that has happened within the last year, and I said that such companies were in the last chance saloon. I know that my hon. Friend will accept it in the right spirit when I say that for all regulatory frameworks&#151;for those covering doctors as well as solicitors, and, indeed, for the rules governing the professional conduct of Members of Parliament&#151;there will always be bad apples. However, the Claims Standards Council has been in a position where it can ill-afford its own members to be engaged in some of the conduct that my hon. Friend has done so much to bring to the attention of the Government and the country. That is why I take what he has said in this debate very seriously.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew49"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : I also welcome much of what the Minister has said. However, I want to make it clear that many Labour Members feel that this is not a matter of the occasional bad apple; the whole barrel is stinking and rotten.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para95">With regard to the adoption of the Clementi principles and the review that the Minister has carried out, he has talked about extending into the regulatory framework the claim handlers. Does he also want to include the unions in that?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew50"><b> Mr. Lammy </b> : A separate set of regulations governs the unions. They would be surprised if the Government were to suggest that they should be brought within the regulatory framework for solicitors. However, I have heard what has been said about some associations that operate in and around the unions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para96">It is also important to acknowledge the good work that unions do for poor people throughout the country. I have met enough union members, leaders and solicitors who have made representations to me about things like small claims to know that the unions do a lot of good work, and I would not want them to be tarnished by a few bad apples.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew51"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : I entirely agree with the Minister&#039;s sentiments. I am not asking him to consider pulling the unions within the entire regulatory framework, but where unions act as commissioning agents to solicitors, they must fall within it, because no other framework will regulate their activities in that regard. NACODS South Wales raised an estimated &#163;13 million from people, and many of them now want their money back. That can be achieved only if the union falls within this framework.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew52"><b> Mr. Lammy </b> : That is right, where there is a clear crossover. That reminds me that lawyers are often employed within our unions, and that they deal with solicitors and with claims managers, and that all of that behaviour must come within the scope of proper professional conduct. That is what my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) wants. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 237WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
When we produce our legislation, he and his colleagues will be keen to ensure that it contains the principles and language that provides that professional conduct.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para97">It has also been said that we should emphasise the concept of ethical behaviour. That has always been at the heart of what we expect of a lawyer in this country, along with independence, honesty and integrity. That is why the Government take this matter so seriously. This activity is damaging that perception. I say that with no self-interest as a consequence of being a lawyer myself.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew53"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. Strangely enough, lawyers do not have to declare an interest in this House, which is a situation that is unique to them.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew54"><b> Mr. Lammy </b> : There are a few of us in the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew55"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : Too many.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h03_spnew56"><b> Mr. Lammy </b> : Some people think there are too many of us, as my hon. Friend says.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para98">I have explained our position on self-regulation. We must carry on working with the Claims Standards Council, while investigating what my hon. Friends have mentioned, but we must also continue moving towards regulation. I encourage my hon. Friends to engage in that process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h03_para99">I agree with the DTI about solicitors or claims handlers who overcharge. Those charges are unethical and immoral. The DTI has advised claimants to make sure that they check the charging policy, and that they should not sign anything without having read it first. It has also asked claimants to seek advice from an independent source, such as their local citizens advice bureau.

<a name="50322h04_time0"><h5>3.33 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50322h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Malcolm Savidge  (Aberdeen, North)</b>  (Lab): In some ways, this debate should be considered in the context of two previous Westminster Hall debates. The first took place on 18 January 2000, when we looked ahead to the new millennium and the issue of weapons of mass destruction. We need to consider how we have moved forward in the past five years. The second debate, which took place on 8 March 2005, was secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn). We examined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review. I mention that if only to try to minimise the repetition of points made by me and by others in that debate, for which the same Minister was present.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : The same Deputy Speaker as well.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Savidge </b> : And the same Deputy Speaker.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para0">I also want to concentrate on the relevant section of the United Nations Secretary-General&#039;s high-level panel report, &quot;A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility&quot;, to which the Secretary-General responded yesterday.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para1">I said in the debate on 18 January 2000 that I felt insufficient media attention was given to this subject, although it has received considerably more subsequently. Initially, that was in part due to the all-party group on global security and non-proliferation, which was established that same week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para2">The Foreign Affairs Committee, in a report that year on weapons of mass destruction, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Media interest in nuclear weapons and arms control treaties was boosted in March 2000 when Michael Douglas, UN Goodwill Ambassador, urged Members of Parliament to encourage the Prime Minister to take a leading role in preserving arms control regimes.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para3">It said also that while the British and international media coverage had &quot;eye-catching headlines&quot;, it gave serious coverage to the issue, which was followed up in a further meeting that we had with the then UN Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, Jayantha Dhanapala.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para4">More permanently, the issue has also featured highly as a result of the terrible events of 9/11. Although they did not involve WMD, they bought to our attention the threat of WMD and terrorism. It is a matter of common consent that they are a major problem and one about which our worries have increased since 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para5">As I have said before, it is important that we use careful definitions in relation to WMD and terrorism, particularly as they can be used as a pretext for war. As many people have said, the term &quot;WMD&quot; contains the danger that, although it is a useful phrase, it blurs the difference between the threats posed by different forms of weapon. The radiological weapon, or dirty bomb, is sometimes included in this area. As the high-level panel&#039;s report says, it should perhaps be described as a weapon of mass disruption in that it would probably cause comparatively few fatalities, but could lead to a large part of a city being uninhabitable for a while.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para6">The vast majority of chemical and biological threats would also not cause mass fatalities. A lot of loose talk is used in relation to lethal materials such as ricin, which 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 239WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
have not been put into a weaponised form that could be used to kill a large number of people at the same time. Similarly, it should be remembered that the worst case analysis of an anthrax attack on Washington was based on a highly sophisticated weaponised version of that agent being used.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para7">However, one cannot rule out the possibility of serious biological attacks if, for example, someone wished to cause indiscriminate death on a large scale and distributed a virus in a hub airport. There is also the possible danger, as the report indicates, of biotechnology or genetic manipulation enabling things of a much more serious nature to occur. In general, it is true of nuclear weapons that we can say, as the report does, that any use would be catastrophic.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para8">On terrorism, it is perhaps important to define the terms we use, because while all terrorism is heinous&#151;the high-level panel correctly condemns all forms of terrorism&#151;it is probably true that the majority of political terrorists would not find it in their own interest to cause massive fatalities. However, they might find that something such as a dirty bomb would be in their interests.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para9">It is only the absolutist, unconditional, apocalyptic groups of the type that the Prime Minister described shortly after the events of 9/11 that would want to kill very large numbers of people. We think primarily of al-Qaeda, but we should not think just of Islamic fundamentalism, as can be seen from the examples of the Aum sect or Timothy McVeigh. We should also recognise that we cannot rule out the possibility that political terrorist groups can become absolutist terrorist groups, be it through fanaticism or frustration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para10">If we are to reduce chemical and biological terrorist risks, we need to get far better control of the stocks that exist, particularly in the former Soviet Union. As the high-level panel says, we need to apply the chemical weapons convention and set about trying to destroy all chemical weapons by the target date of 2012. We also need to seek to establish, through negotiation, a biological and toxic weapons convention with proper verification.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew3"><b> Llew Smith  (Blaenau Gwent)</b>  (Lab): I recently asked the Foreign Secretary in a written question if he would
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;list each multilateral negotiating forum in which United Kingdom nuclear weapons are under discussion pursuant to . . . Article 6 of the . . . non proliferation treaty.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para11">My hon. Friend the Minister for Europe, answering on behalf of the Foreign Secretary, stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;None.&quot; &#151;[<i>Official Report, </i>10 March 2005; Vol. 431 c.2002W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para12">Does my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) agree that that puts the United Kingdom in breach of its obligations under article 6 of the NPT? It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Savidge </b> : With my hon. Friend&#039;s permission, I would rather leave it to the Minister to say what the Government&#039;s position is on that.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew5"><b> Llew Smith </b> : Will my hon. Friend give way?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 240WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew6"><b> Mr. Savidge </b> : I am sorry, but I am short of time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para13">The greatest immediate threat is from nuclear weapons. The high-level panel indicated that there is a real possibility of terrorists producing a simple gun-type nuclear device, whereby the combination of two amounts of highly enriched uranium could produce a bomb roughly similar to that which the South African Government produced during the apartheid era. The panel suggests that the use of such a weapon in a major city could lead to the deaths of anything from tens of thousands of people to more than one million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para14">One need only imagine the scenario of, say, a suicide bomber in a van in London taking out the whole of Westminster, Whitehall and Buckingham palace. If they chose the state opening, for instance, they would destroy not only the buildings, but the people, which would decapitate the state. One can picture similar scenarios in different capitals. An attack in Washington during the State of the Union address could take out the Executive, the Congress and the judiciary. One can repeat that example for various capitals, whether of dictatorships or democracies. Such an attack could devastate a country and cause panic worldwide. Modern capitals cannot ban vehicles from their centre, so it is therefore in the common interest of all countries, of whatever type, that we co-operate to reduce that threat.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para15">It is important that we reduce proliferation both of nuclear materials and among states and non-state actors. The high-level panel report indicates that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has enjoyed considerable success, with only eight definite nuclear weapons states&#151;with the possible addition of North Korea&#151;over 40 years, as compared with the much higher number that most experts predicted beforehand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para16">However, the &quot;atoms for peace&quot; strategy, as Eisenhower put it, has had problems. Civil nuclear energy and military production were assumed to be completely separate, but we now know that they can have considerable dual use. We must therefore beware of the fact that the nuclear power industry produces not only materials that terrorists could use, but targets that they could attack.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para17">The report also indicates that as many as 40 of the 60 states that now have nuclear power are suspected of being able to produce nuclear weapons fairly rapidly. It warns of the risk of a cascade of proliferation. We must therefore recognise the basic risks in the nuclear power industry. However, on the assumption that it will continue to expand, we must certainly try to reduce reprocessing and enrichment, ensure the use of low-enriched uranium rather than highly-enriched uranium, enforce the additional protocol and increase security in the ways discussed at the International Atomic Energy Agency conference that the Government hosted in London last week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para18">We must also have the utmost control. It is not satisfactory that Sellafield cannot account for significant quantities of weapons-grade material, not only because of the risk of material that is not being properly checked being passed to terrorists: how can we answer if a country such as Iran claims that it cannot account for significant amounts of such material? Will we find that acceptable?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 241WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para19">I repeat the appeal that Senator Sam Nunn made when he spoke at the conference and here in Parliament: when the UK is to try to persuade the G8 to deal with the problems of climate change and global poverty, we should also insist that we fulfil the promises made at the G8 meeting in Canada to give proper financial support to the threat reduction programme of decommissioning. That is vital in and of itself, but it is important also because not fulfilling past pledges gives little meaning to the commitments that we make at future G8 meetings. Furthermore, the four issues of poverty, climate, weapons of mass destruction and terrorism are crucially interlinked as we try to build a safer world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para20">The report makes many other constructive suggestions, which I shall not go into because of time and because some were covered in our debate on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but I repeat the one major claim made on the nuclear weapons states. We should not abandon the 13 steps that were agreed at the NPT review conference in 2000 and we should give evidence of good faith as to our commitments, including those under article 6, as my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Llew Smith) indicated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para21">The report comments on the A. Q. Khan threat of black market distribution of such materials and suggests that the proliferation security initiative deserves support in that respect. The only caution that one should offer is to be wary of precipitate military action, because that can obviously be dangerous, in which context it is correct that the world community is thinking of diplomacy to address the difficult situations with Iran and North Korea.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para22">We should also not forget that there are worse dangers than nuclear terrorism, such as regional nuclear war. Only two or three years ago, India and Pakistan faced terrible risks. There was an acute danger at that time, and we should give our fullest support to the leaderships of both countries, including the past and present Government of India, in their work in the peace process. I am sure that they would say that a number of other countries, especially the US and the UK, played a crucial, positive role in helping to defuse that dangerous situation. However, we must face the fact that if there is more proliferation, further risks of regional war may increase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para23">There is also the risk of accidental nuclear war. It is surely insane that, this long after the end of the cold war, there are thousands of nuclear weapons, exceeding any possible rational defence or deterrence requirement of any country involved. It is even more insane that so many weapons are on hair-trigger alert. The United Kingdom has set an example by de-alerting, and we should urge other nuclear weapons states to follow it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para24">I stress the views in the report of the high-level panel, but one cannot ignore the fact that there are different views abroad in the world today. There are influential voices in the United States&#151;neo-conservatives and other hawks&#151;who, in their most extreme version, take a view of US national sovereignty that opposes international treaties, arms control and the United Nations. Such commentators take the view that military might rather than common security should be the basis of defence and that aggression should take preference over diplomacy. Also, they talk of pre-emptive and preventative war. The Project for the New American Century talks of seeking US military dominance 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 242WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
throughout the century. There are also plans for new nuclear weapons, and the military-industrial complex seems to be even more powerful than when General Eisenhower coined the phrase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para25">Such voices give frighteningly different visions from that espoused by George Bush senior of a new world order. Indeed, I would suggest that such views are very different from the mainstream tradition of both the Democratic and Republican parties. If such counsels prevail, we will surely increase rather than reduce the risks we face, and we may even face the risk of global nuclear war, whether before or after the end of the century, which could endanger humanity as a whole.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para26">In a world where nuclear weapons cannot be disinvented, and if we are to have a more secure future, we need to strengthen the United Nations and international treaties and progressively to develop a fair system of international governance and law whereby conflict can be resolved without resort to war. That might seem an impossibly distant vision for a human race whose entire history and culture have been dominated by war, but it shows the scale of the challenge we face.

<p><a name="50322h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Chris Mullin) </b> : My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) raises an important subject, in which I know he has a long-term interest. As he said, he took part in the debate on similar matters that occurred here two weeks ago. We all agree that weapons of mass destruction pose one of the biggest threats to the security of the United Kingdom and its interests, at home and abroad.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para27">My hon. Friend referred to the recommendations of the UN high-level panel. That is a body which has our support and we are already acting on many of its recommendations. I shall also deal at this stage with his point about Sellafield. He made a point that I do not suppose he would want to press too seriously, comparing the situation in Sellafield with that in Iran. UK civil nuclear facilities, unlike those in Iran, are fully open to International Atomic Energy Agency inspection, so there can be no doubt about our willingness to co-operate fully and answer any questions that the international community may have, although I note his point.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para28">The main threat is the use of WMD by states and terrorists against the UK or against British economic interests.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew7"><b> Llew Smith </b> : On the question of weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, going back to a previous job held by the Minister and a far more important one, editor of <i>Tribune</i>, I know that he was a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, if he was not a member. With that in mind, does he agree that there are no circumstances that justify the use of nuclear weapons? While I am on my feet, I ask him to answer the question that my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) refused to answer on the non-proliferation treaty.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mullin </b> : I shall have to come back to my hon. Friend on the point about the non-proliferation treaty; 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 243WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I shall drop him a note about that. As he said, I was an undistinguished editor of <i>Tribune</i> and it is extremely difficult to foresee any circumstances in which nuclear weapons could be used. That, I think, given my current incarnation, is about as far as I can go.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew9"><b> Llew Smith </b> : My question was not whether the Minister could foresee any circumstances. I asked whether he accepts that under no circumstances could the use of nuclear weapons be justified. This is a Government position and I assume, as the Minister is part of the Government, that he has no problems answering that particular question.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew10"><b> Mr. Mullin </b> : I know what my hon. Friend is attempting to do: he wants somehow to separate me from the rest of my Government colleagues, and I decline, if he will forgive me, to go any further down that road.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para29">I spoke about how the main threat is the use of WMD by states and terrorists against the UK or against British economic and strategic interests overseas. We are addressing the production and trafficking of WMD-related material by states, companies and individuals, and working to guard against less obvious risks such as the use of higher education courses in the UK and elsewhere by individuals seeking to acquire technology for proliferation purposes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para30">Limiting the threat posed by WMD requires coherent policies to detect, deter, check and roll back programmes for the development of WMD and related delivery systems in countries of concern such as North Korea and Iran. We are deeply concerned about North Korea&#039;s decision to suspend participation in the six-party talks and its claim of an enhanced nuclear capability. We urge North Korea to re-engage and support the efforts of the US, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea to that end.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para31">We also have serious concerns about Iran&#039;s nuclear programme. Following our agreement with Iran, we&#151;along with colleagues from France, Germany and the European Union&#151;are engaged in discussions with Iranian officials. We want a long-term agreement that will provide objective guarantees that Iran&#039;s nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. The steering committee established under the agreement is meeting tomorrow to review progress.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew11"><b> Mr. Savidge </b> : Can my hon. Friend tell us whether there is any truth in the reports in the press last week that Iran suggested a joint project with the United States so that the US could be reassured about its programme?
</p>




<p><a name="50322h04_spnew12"><b> Mr. Mullin </b> : I am not aware of any.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para32">Given such clear threats, we must strengthen international co-operation against the proliferation and the use of WMD. We must at all costs maintain an effective multilateral regime. As I said when we debated this subject two weeks ago, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty remains the cornerstone of nuclear non-proliferation. It is a strong treaty, with the widest membership of any arms control treaty, and it retains the wholehearted support of the UK and the vast majority of the international community.

<p>
<a name="50322h04_para33">However, recent events have shown that a number of states continue to pursue clandestine nuclear weapons programmes and that there are individuals willing to assist them by providing sensitive materials and technology. The treaty must, therefore, be strengthened.

<p><a name="50322h04_spnew14"><b> Mr. Mullin </b> : If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I have only a few minutes left and I am unlikely to get to the end of my speech. I shall happily have a discussion with him after the proceedings are over.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para34">We have no wish to reopen the treaty, but we need stronger measures to address non-compliance. We also want to build support for new measures to combat the spread of sensitive technology. We want to ensure that sensitive nuclear items are not exported to states that may use them for weapons purposes or allow them to fall into terrorist hands.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para35">We are working with partners to make the necessary amendments to the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines. We are also working to put into effect the principles set out in the written statement to the House of 25 February 2004 from my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, which said that states that fail to comply with their IAEA safeguards obligations should forfeit access to enrichment and reprocessing equipment and technology.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para36">As regards biological and chemical weapons, we continue to work towards universal adherence to the chemical weapons convention and the biological and toxin weapons convention, in particular to include states such as Egypt, Syria and Israel. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the Geneva protocol against the use of chemical and biological warfare and the 30th anniversary of the biological and toxin weapons convention. The UK will chair this year&#039;s annual meetings, where we will be discussing such issues as codes of conduct for scientists. As president of the G8, we will follow up on a range of earlier suggestions on tackling biological threats.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para37">A stronger international framework is essential, but not sufficient in itself, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North will agree, to meet the proliferation threat. We want greater practical engagement in counter-proliferation by other states and regional groups. We played a major role in the formulation and unanimous adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1540, adopted on 28 April 2004, which was the first to address the threat posed by WMD proliferation. It obliges all countries to introduce robust legislation to tackle the threat. We welcome work done by the UN Secretary-General&#039;s high-level panel.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para38">We are also committed to supporting the G8&#039;s global partnership and the proliferation security initiative. We contribute &#163;36.5 million to the global partnership, which deals with dismantling nuclear submarines; safe and secure storage of over 20,000 spent nuclear fuel assemblies; the safe destruction of Russia&#039;s chemical weapons stocks; and new employment opportunities for former nuclear scientists and engineers in the former Soviet Union. Over a 10-year period, we expect to invest about $750 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para39">The UK strongly supports the May 2003 proliferation security initiative to prevent trafficking in weapons of mass destruction and related technology by states and

terrorist groups or criminal networks. Export control is only as strong as its weakest link. We must ensure that multilateral export control regimes are effective and that progressive proposals are not unreasonably held back by one or two states. We must also keep such controls proportionate and simple to administer. In addition to those international efforts, we must act effectively at home.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h04_para40">The first line of defence is an effective outreach programme to alert industry and academic institutions to the possibility that UK technology could help proliferators and to raise awareness of export legislation. The Export Control Act 2002 includes a range of measures aimed at preventing WMD technology from falling into the wrong hands. We should never underestimate the potential threat posed by WMD, but the Government believe that such threats can be minimised through effective multilateralism and concerted domestic efforts. Counter-proliferation will remain a key priority for us and we shall continue to take the lead in promoting a strong international response.

<a name="50322h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Council Housing (Southwark)</h3>

<a name="50322h05_time0"><h5>4.1 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50322h05_spnew0"><b> Simon Hughes  (Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</b>  (LD): I am very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce an Adjournment debate. As I walked over here, I reflected that it is almost 22 years to the day since I made my maiden speech. That was on the Budget, but this debate is on an issue that is equally important to the majority of my constituents and to many others as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para0">The Minister will be aware that the borough in which I live and in part represent&#151;I share it with the Solicitor-General, the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa Jowell)&#151;is the largest local authority landlord in London and the fifth largest in the country. It is not surprising, therefore, that, periodically, each of us returns to the management and future of council housing in Southwark as important issues for our constituents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para1">I checked the figures, as far as I could, and I believe them to be accurate. I would like to set them out to show the significance of such issues in our borough. There are some 105,000 households in Southwark, under 10 per cent. of which are owned outright by those who live in them. About 20 per cent., or one in five, homes are owner-occupied with a mortgage. Only 1 per cent. have shared ownership, but four out of 10 people in the borough live in local authority property. In my part of the borough&#151;the old borough of Southwark and the borough of Bermondsey&#151;the figure is well over 50 per cent., so very many more than half the people I represent are local authority tenants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para2">In addition to being the largest local authority landlord in London, with 42,500 properties run by the London borough of Southwark, we also have one of the largest amounts of leasehold properties&#151;those bought under the right to buy, but where the council retains the freehold interest. The figure I was given last Friday was 12,600. Just over 15,000 properties have been sold under the right to buy, but some of those are completely freehold, rather than leasehold.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para3">I want to put three other statistics on the record. First, the current figure from the office of the director of housing is that nearly 14,000 people are waiting either to become council tenants or to transfer within the local authority stock. Secondly, of those, 4,000 are waiting for a transfer while the others are waiting to become council tenants, so there are 9,000 people in the queue. Even though we are the largest landlord, there is still an enormous queue. Thirdly, the number of local authority properties being built is about 150, of which 100 are on the Elmington estate in Camberwell, in the constituency of the Solicitor-General, while 40 are on the Coopers Road estate in Bermondsey, near where I live. There are, of course, other developments that are not local authority developments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para4">That is the backdrop, and I want to put on record a few statements of what I believe the vast majority of my constituents regard as the issues. I hope to continue to engage with Ministers in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, including the Minister in the Chamber today and the Minister for Housing and Planning, in the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 247WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
constructive discussions that are talking place. I also hope to encourage them to continue doing the right things in the few weeks left, if the election is to take place this spring, and to ensure that those statements are on the record for whoever inherits ministerial office in relation to looking after housing in London after the election.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para5">I want to say unequivocally that all the experience and information that I have confirms that the vast majority of Southwark council tenants wish to remain Southwark council tenants and therefore want what is colloquially described as the fourth option. The Government are very keen that the relationship between local authorities and their housing stock and tenants moves on. This has been well rehearsed on the Floor of the House: I have put questions to the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, and many other colleagues have raised the issues, including the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who has regularly introduced an early-day motion on the subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para6">Many have argued the case that if people want to remain conventional council tenants, they should be able to do so. I hope that that remains an option. The Minister will know that there was a ballot on one of the large Southwark estates, the Aylesbury, which is predominantly in the constituency of Camberwell and Peckham, although a small part of it is in my constituency. There was a 70 per cent. turnout&#151;very high these days&#151;and a 70 per cent. vote against transfer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para7">There was a possibility a few years ago of another estate&#151;Tabard Gardens, which is entirely in my constituency&#151;being transferred to the Peabody Trust, when my colleagues in the authority began, for the first time, a Liberal Democrat administration. My colleague, Councillor Beverley Bassom, who was then the executive member for housing, took the view that the tenant management co-operative that was then in place would not vote yes in a ballot for transfer to the Peabody Trust, so she stopped that process&#151;rightly, in my view.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para8">I hope that the Minister will accept that the fourth option for boroughs such as ours&#151;with the overwhelming support of the tenants, the tenants&#039; council, the representative bodies and the local authorities&#151;can remain. That is the first and most important point that I want to make.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para9">Secondly, I am conscious that the Government have rightly said that the immediate task is to find the money to achieve decent homes standards for all council tenants. I sign up to that; it is a laudable objective. People living in substandard council stock clearly need to be in much better homes, and I accept the timetable that has been set out. I hope it will be possible for the funding&#151;not just of the coming financial year, which starts next week, but of years ahead&#151;to make it possible for that to be achieved. I hope that, if there is a difficulty or a sticking point with funding from Government sources, according to the current projections, but it is possible to make up any difference through all the regeneration and other schemes that the local authority is happily exploring or proceeding with, we can achieve decent homes standards but retain the council stock.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 248WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para10">It was a surprise to Ministers in other Departments that the decent homes programme does not require improvements that you and I, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and probably the Minister, would regard as necessary. For example, a decent home on a decent estate might require a CCTV system to ensure proper security. As I understand it, that is not programmed in; I think it should be. Security and safety doors might be wanted at the bottom of a block where the concierge system might be. That should be included. Playgrounds and safe play areas for children ought to be included. I hope that we can improve decent homes standards to be able to give all the tenants on all the estates in Southwark&#151;all local authority tenants&#151;the opportunity to have a decent home that is also safe and in a safe, decent and respectable community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para11">I am keen to hear from the Minister&#151;I hope he can be helpful&#151;that there is now increasingly joined-up government between the ODPM and those responsible for housing, both nationally and in the Government office for London, and in other Departments dealing with, for example, leisure, safety&#151;the Home Office&#151;and open spaces and the like.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para12">The third issue is a live issue, and the Solicitor-General and I share a view on this. Leaseholders who bought under the right to buy in boroughs such as ours have often had a bad deal. Some were badly advised when they bought their homes&#151;we all have constituents who bought not knowing what the implications were and who did not get good legal advice&#151;and some have not received a good service. My colleague, Councillor Stephen Flannery, who has just become the executive member for housing, is writing, as we speak, to all the leaseholders to apologise about the fact that people have had a bad service in the past, such as delays and inaccuracies with bills.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para13">I have two propositions to put to the Minister. He might want to give an immediate response, but I want to feed them into the programme of government. First, a lot of people think it is unfair that an estimate for capital or other works is effectively a take-it-or-leave-it estimate once the council has put the job out to tender. Yes, people might be able to negotiate to pay in instalments; yes, Southwark and other local authorities have introduced a buyback scheme for people who discover that the cost is too big; yes, in extreme circumstances, a charge can be put on the property so that people do not have to pay and, following death or assignment, it goes to someone else who has it deducted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para14">However, the one thing that I have found hugely frustrating over the years&#151;I was partly responsible for setting up the Southwark Association of Leaseholders and leaseholder organisations because of the many frustrations&#151;is the fact that, once a section 20 notice is served, the council has put the job out to tender. So, effectively, although people are entitled to make &quot;a reasonable response&quot; as a leaseholder, if the council believes that the cost in the original tender is reasonable or that what is included in the works is reasonable, it is unalterable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para15">I propose that we should build into the legislation through a small amendment&#151;I hope that Southwark will do this without legislation&#151;something that will allow independent arbitration of the cost of capital or other works, so that after the council proposes, but 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 249WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
before it disposes, leaseholders can go to an independent body and say, &quot;We think this is too much. It is unreasonable and it encompasses other things.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para16">I move to my second proposal. A private leaseholder in a private block for which there is a management company effectively goes out into the market, gets in some tenders and opts for one of them, but that is not possible for local authority leaseholders. Therefore, people who lease council homes from local authorities do not have the same rights and control as private leaseholders. Can the legislation be amended so that things can be handled that way round? Leaseholders would get the advice, then the council would say, &quot;We need to put on a new roof, do security works and talk to you about new windows.&quot; Then we would have an agreed way forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para17">Just this week, two reports were submitted to Southwark council about the Aylesbury estate, which the Minister may have etched in his political memory because it is the estate where the Prime Minister went to look out over the blocks and talk about the new Britain that would come under new Labour. The people on the Aylesbury are always hopeful that what was promised will be delivered; they are still hopeful, although it has not been delivered as quickly under this Government as they would have liked. They deserve to be looked after.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para18">The northern half of that part of Walworth where the Heygate estate is, which the Minister will probably know from his travels around London, is to be demolished and replaced. The council is absolutely committed to providing at least as many affordable properties as before. Everybody who was on the Heygate will be able to return to an affordable property there, and everybody who wants to remain a council tenant will be able to do so. I have signed up to that, as it is a good scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para19">The southern half of that middle part of Walworth is the Aylesbury estate, which is one of the largest estates in London. The reports show, happily, that some concerns that were cause for alarm are not borne out. One report states that only the five and six-storey blocks on the Aylesbury, built using the large-panel system, need to be strengthened and that all other blocks, both higher and lower than that level, do not require any changes. Work also needs to be done to ensure that people in those blocks do not use gas and that they are transferred to an electricity supply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para20">Aylesbury New Deal for Communities&#151;an organisation I support, which covers the whole estate&#151;is working to ensure that the quality of life there improves. I hope that the Government will support Aylesbury NDC by providing the money needed to do the work that has clearly been identified as necessary. The report is not alarmist; the buildings are not about to fall down and there is no cause for panic, but work must be done on certain blocks to ensure that people are safe and feel safe, and the Government should respond positively to that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para21">When I was elected, which was around the time that Lord Heseltine&#039;s urban development corporation in London was set up, there was huge development along the river: wharves were converted to luxury flats and there were many new builds, shared ownerships and other property developments. However, there is still more than a bit of a tale of two cities. Things are fine for 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 250WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
people on the lowest incomes who are happy to stay in council property, or people who are happy irrespective of their income. There is council property, but not enough. We need more.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para22">People whose income means that there is no limit to what they can spend on accommodation can be offered places such as those at Butlers wharf, but for those whom we often refer to as ordinary, decent, working people&#151;those who aspire to go up the ladder a bit, who want to stay in a borough such as ours, who love the inner city, whose families are there and whose children go to local primary schools such as the one I went to this afternoon&#151;we still do not have enough suitable property.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para23">We need to ensure that our council housing is of the highest quality. I ask that we should be allowed to continue to build more good-quality council housing, but that&#151;I accept that the Deputy Prime Minister has been alive to this issue&#151;we do not keep losing stock out the other end through the old Conservative right-to-buy policies, which meant that the best stock went, and was often sold on and lost. We must continue to have good-quality, rented, affordable housing so that Southwark can become a mixed community of the sort that people can be proud to come to and stay in, not least because the housing is of good quality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para24">I am grateful for the Government&#039;s work so far, and I think that we share the same objectives. I probably have the largest number of council tenants of any English Member of Parliament, so I hope the Minister understands that this is a hugely important issue whether it is election year or not. I also hope that the investment, support and work with my local authority will continue.
</p>



<a name="50322h05_time1"><h5>4.17 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50322h05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) on securing the debate. I assure him, his constituents and all Southwark council&#039;s tenants that we are committed to delivering decent homes for all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para25">The hon. Gentleman may not know this, but I visited the Aylesbury estate last Thursday&#151;not that part that is in his constituency, or I would, of course, have informed him accordingly&#151;and I conducted, for the first time, a street audit regarding an organisation called Living Streets and what can be done when local issues affecting people&#039;s lives are addressed, as well as how changes can be made by the community, the local authority and other partners to improve the quality of life on the pavements, along the shop fronts, in the streets and among traffic. I may say some more about that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para26">The hon. Gentleman began with a good summary of the position in Southwark&#151;the number of houses in council ownership and so on&#151;and I want to put that description of Southwark into a national context, because it is helpful to see its relevance. There are 4.1 million social homes, which are a tremendous asset in financial terms&#151;worth around &#163;400 billion&#151;and an immeasurable asset to the community and the country. However, the impact of decades of neglect and under-investment left us with a &#163;19 billion backlog of repairs in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 251WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
1997. We responded to that huge challenge by radically changing our approach to housing policy, building in far greater flexibility and greater capacity for investment in that housing stock because of the scale of the problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para27">The results of that radical change since 1997 have been dramatic. We have reduced the number of non-decent social homes by no fewer than 1 million and we have increased the proportion of vulnerable households in the private sector living in decent homes to 63 per cent. That is important to us. We have massively increased investment: local authorities have invested more than &#163;13 billion in bringing their homes up to a decent standard and a further &#163;5.3 billion&#151;a billion being &#163;1,000 million&#151;has been levered in from the private sector through transfer. On top of that, local authorities&#039; plans suggest that they will invest a further &#163;11 billion in their stock by 2008. That is a huge investment in our local social housing stock.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para28">We are on track to meet our target that, by 2010, everyone living in social housing will have a decent home and that 70 per cent. of vulnerable households in private accommodation will also have a decent home. By the time that we meet our target, we expect that local authorities and housing associations will together have spent no less than about &#163;42 billion on ensuring that their tenants live in decent homes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para29">That target is not merely about bricks and mortar&#151;a point the hon. Gentleman made. It is about individuals, families, the young and the old, and their right to live in a secure and stable environment. That is absolutely right. The spending of that &#163;42 billion by 2008 is a crucial part of our commitment to create safe, sustainable communities. Last month, the Deputy Prime Minister launched &quot;Homes for All&quot;, the Government&#039;s five-year plan that sets out the way forward for housing. Decent homes and the decent homes target are, of course, an integral part of that plan. I am confident that we all agree that the decent homes strategy is tremendously important to our communities and neighbourhoods.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para30">I will now talk about Southwark specifically. The hon. Gentleman rehearsed some of the facts. For example, 44 per cent. of Southwark&#039;s homes do not meet the decent homes standard. Southwark is considering what is achievable with the resources that it has. It may be viable for Southwark to deliver most, if not all, decent homes using the borough&#039;s resources. That is, of course, for Southwark to determine. It is the responsibility of the London borough of Southwark to work with tenants to develop a strategy for the council to achieve its decent homes target and to close the funding gap.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para31">Other London boroughs with a large housing stock have taken on that challenge. The London borough of Lambeth, for example, is also one of the country&#039;s biggest landlords. The council&#039;s option appraisal&#151;the appraisal of the various options for improving the stock in Lambeth&#151;has just been signed off. I stress that we need Southwark to do the same. I do not for one moment underestimate the size of the challenge facing Southwark. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is one of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 252WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
largest landlords in the country, and the largest in London, with responsibility for more than 45,000 properties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para32">There are options and choices, and I shall mention one route that might be appropriate for Southwark. If retention is not an option, the arm&#039;s-length management organisation option is one that will deliver additional resources to deliver decent homes while keeping the stock in local authority ownership and ensuring that tenants retain all existing rights. That is important, because it is not the popular understanding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para33">As there has been much misleading campaigning about that option, not just in London but elsewhere, I want to be clear about the fact that ALMO programmes are not a means of privatising housing by the back door. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that, where tenants opt to have their homes maintained by an ALMO, those homes remain the property of the local authority. That is an important point. The option, therefore, is not only not privatisation&#151;I will keep saying that until people finally understand it&#151;but it offers tenants an improved service, with many council housing departments making particular efforts to raise their performance so that the ALMO can achieve the necessary two-star rating and attract additional Government funding to help it to deliver decent homes. Southwark is in that position. So, we have opportunities and options.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para34">Separating management and maintenance functions enables councils to focus their efforts more directly on the strategic management of their stock, while the ALMO focuses its efforts on delivering the highest standards of service to tenants. Those high standards are delivering results. This year we will see the first ALMOs bring all the council stock that they manage up to the decent homes standard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para35">So, I understand why the hon. Gentleman mentioned what he called the fourth option&#151;a different option for investing in housing. That does not exist, but ALMOs do, as does the option of retaining the existing stock. I hope he recognises that ALMOs are an option that merits attention.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h05_spnew1"><b> Simon Hughes </b> : Of course I recognise that point. I have never disputed it. The issue is what the tenants want.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h05_spnew2"><b> Phil Hope </b> : Indeed.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h05_spnew3"><b> Simon Hughes </b> : If tenants prefer one option to another, I hope the Government will support that option.
</p>




<p><a name="50322h05_spnew4"><b> Phil Hope </b> : That is absolutely right. To start that debate with tenants, Southwark needs to engage in the options appraisal process. Southwark has started some of the necessary steps to make that process work and is working closely with the ODPM and the Government office for London to come up with a strategy to take forward the options appraisal process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para36">Given the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, the important aspect is that effective tenant engagement is critical to the options appraisal. He is absolutely right about that. Tenants are at the heart of the options appraisal process and the need to engage with them to seek their views on future management of their homes is vital to our 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Mar 2005 : Column 253WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
policies. All local authorities are obliged to draw up communications strategies that set out in practical terms exactly how they intend to involve tenants and other stakeholders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para37">We go further than that. We also ensure that tenants are properly equipped to make informed decisions about the options open to them. We recognise that it is fundamental to tenants&#039; rights that they can access impartial information without bias to any option. That is why we encourage local authorities to use an independent tenant adviser to ensure that tenants have a clear picture of the process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para38">Our community housing task force, which brings together expert advisers from a range of social housing backgrounds, provides advice and support to local authorities on all aspects of options appraisal, including how best to inform and consult with tenants. Tenant engagement does not stop once a decision has been made: tenants make up about a third of the governing boards of transfer housing associations and ALMOs, which broadens tenant participation to estate and neighbourhood level.

<a name="50322h05_para39">The hon. Gentleman raised one or two points other than the specifics about decent homes. I want to address them. First, on the wider questions of security, safety, playgrounds and play areas, he will be aware that the Government have adopted a public service agreement&#151;PSA 8&#151;which is about liveability and ensuring that we have cleaner, safer and greener communities. That is my shorthand for it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para40">That PSA target requires not just one but nine Departments to work collaboratively. We have established an inter-ministerial departmental group made up of Ministers from each of the relevant Departments&#151;the Home Office, the Department for Transport, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the ODPM, which is in the chair, and others&#151;to consider what we can do to bring together the various strategies that affect a local community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para41">When I did the street audit that I mentioned, it was clear to me that a vast number of organisations are affected. I did a short walk from St. Peter&#039;s church to Walworth road and back to the bottom end of the Aylesbury estate. We are considering issues surrounding crime, policing and community support officers, as well as waste management and litter clearing. We are also considering questions of shop frontage, roads up and down the Walworth road, crossing the road safely and access for people with disabilities or who have buggies.

<a name="50322h05_para42">Those issues have to be tackled using a joined-up approach or this simply will not work. We are promoting such street audits as a good way of engaging local councillors, MPs&#151;I am sure the hon. Gentleman would enjoy undertaking one of those activities&#151;and, in particular, local residents. I was on the Aylesbury estate with local residents and two young people who are year 6 pupils at the local St. Peter&#039;s school. They were very articulate and they pointed it out to us that people of a certain height can see certain things, but that those who are slightly smaller see other things on the streets with regard to their lives and what would make those streets a cleaner and more pleasant place to be. This is an effective process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para43">We are publishing three new guides. We have already published the first, on town centre management. It joins together all the resources and powers available to local authorities and other partners to make town centres better. There will be a second guide, on managing residential areas, to be published, I hope, in June&#151;depending on events that the hon. Gentleman alluded to&#151;and a third, on parks and open spaces, to ensure that those are properly managed and delivered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para44">We are alive not only to the specific issue of decent homes and the long-term future&#151;working with organisations such as Aylesbury New Deal for Communities, which is doing a magnificent job&#151;but to the everyday management of the street, which is important when people walk out of their front door, through the parks and into the town centre and the shopping centre. What is life like for local people and how can we make it better? I am delighted that, as the hon. Gentleman said, the board of Aylesbury New Deal for Communities is at the forefront of taking forward new proposals to improve quality of life on the estate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322h05_para45">The issue involves not only decent homes, but putting together a comprehensive package of improvements for local residents. Southwark has started to make progress, which is encouraging. That means that Southwark&#039;s tenants should all be living in decent homes by 2010. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can use his influence in the council to ensure that members of the council remain committed to the stock options appraisal process. He can use his influence among tenants to ensure that there is positive engagement with what is an important agenda.
