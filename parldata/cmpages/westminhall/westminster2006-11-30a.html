Patrick Cormack (South Staffordshire) (Con):</b> I am very
grateful for the opportunity to speak&#151;not too long, I
hope&#151;about the report that the Select Committee on Northern
Ireland Affairs produced in July on organised crime in Northern
Ireland. I am glad to see several members of the Committee present, and
glad, too, that the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the
hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins) is present to
respond. He and I have had several amicable conversations since he
assumed his new duties earlier this year, and he is a man who has
dedicated himself in that short time to the affairs of the province of
Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="61130h0001.htm_para2"><a name="06113062000008">As I said in the House last
week when we were debating Northern Ireland matters, the future is not
what it used to be in Northern Ireland. Things really have changed a
lot, even since we produced the report in July. In July, there was a
general air of pessimism about the prospects for the talks succeeding
and the devolved institutions being restored. Although it would be a
rash man who put money on all going smoothly between now and March,
nevertheless, the prospects are better than they were, and it is
important to put that on record.</p><p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="61130h0001.htm_para3"><a name="06113062000009">I should also like to put it on
record that the report was unanimous. There was not a single Division
in the Committee as we discussed the report. We had long discussions as
it was drafted and re-drafted, but in the end, it represented the
unanimous view of a Committee of 13 members, all of whom attended some
or all deliberative sessions. I am particularly glad to see present the
hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound), who has played a most
important and constructive part in the affairs of the Committee for a
long time. I hope that later in the debate, he has the good fortune to
catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p><p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="61130h0001.htm_para4"><a name="06113062000010">I also pay tribute to the
Committee members from Northern Ireland, two of whom are present. The
other two, the hon. Members for North Down (Lady Hermon) and for
Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell), have sent their apologies. They are
unable to attend because of unavoidable engagements in Northern
Ireland. All four Committee members from Northern Ireland played a
constructive part in our deliberations.</p><p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="61130h0001.htm_para5"><a name="06113062000011">We launched the report at a

all three Northern Ireland parties that play their full part in this
Parliament were present on the platform.</p><p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="61130h0001.htm_para6"><a name="06113062000012">The Committee
decided to consider the issue of organised crime, because when we began
our deliberations after the last general election, it became apparent
to all that it was the most important social issue in Northern Ireland.
Organised crime in the Province, as I shall seek to describe, is
different from crime in the rest of the United Kingdom. In compiling
our report, we took evidence publicly from a number of people, and we
are grateful to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Assets
Recovery Agency, HM Revenue and Customs and others who gave evidence to
us.</p><p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="61130h0001.htm_para7"><a name="06113062000013">If not
uniquely, then most unusually for a Select Committee, we were also
obliged to take much of our evidence in private&#151;either in
private session or in informal meetings. As the report makes claim, we
are utterly convinced of the bona fides of all who met us on whatever
basis, but it was significant that many people did not feel able to
give either all or some of their evidence in public, so worried were
they about the consequences of doing so. The Minister recognised that
we had to take evidence in private, much as we regretted it. To all of
those who talked to us, we are grateful.</p><p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="61130h0001.htm_para8"><a name="06113062000014">We are grateful, too, for the
co-operation that we received in the Republic of Ireland. We went to
Dublin and met&#151;within the walls of the British
embassy&#151;leaders of the Garda Siochana, the Criminal Assets
Bureau and others, who were frank and helpful with what they told us,
and we were grateful for that. One thing that I shall do this afternoon
is to respect the confidentiality of the information that we received
during our inquiry. I know that all Committee colleagues who take part
in the debate will do the same. It is absolutely crucial.</p><p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="61130h0001.htm_para9"><a name="06113062000015">Crime
throughout the United Kingdom is a worry. It is a worry in your
constituency, Madam Deputy Speaker, and it is a worry in mine. However,
in Ireland, it has another dimension: paramilitaries from both sides of
the divide are behind organised crime. I hate using
&#147;loyalist&#148; in this context, because to engage in the
activities that paramilitaries engage in, seems the reverse of loyalism
to me; however, one has to use the shorthand. From the loyalist side
and the nationalist side, paramilitaries or former paramilitaries
continue to play a part in organised crime, to intimidate individuals
and to exert a malign influence over communities. When one delves into
the subject, it is noticeable just how far-reaching the effect is.
Without breaking any confidence, we saw the nature of counterfeit goods
and how skilfully many of them were counterfeited. We met people whose
lives had been made a misery by the intimidatory tactics of those who
sought, under various guises, to extort money from
them.</p><p><a name="st_3"><a name="06113062000016"><b><a name="61130h0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="06113062000252">Lembit

in what the right hon. Gentleman says. Does he feel that organised
crime in Northern Ireland is a direct consequence of the redeployment
of paramilitary forces that were formerly engaged in political crime,
but now regard themselves as money-making organisations with precious
little political aspiration, even by way of their own defence? Is that
one reason why Northern Ireland has particular problems at this
time?</p><br>

almost all the Committee&#146;s sessions and met almost all our
witnesses, can doubtless expand on that. The description was absolutely
right, and it is a great worry. We met people in Belfast and some came
over to see us in London. For every reason, some people were not
prepared to have their identities revealed. We respected that, and I
shall not provide even any geographical indicator. We refer in the
report to people who had had vast sums of money extorted from
them&#151;in one case, a six-figure sum over a period of little more
than a year and in another, a large five-figure sum over a similar
period. In some cases the villains were from the nationalist and
republican side, and another case involved the loyalist
side.</p><p><a name="st_7"><a name="06113062000020"><b><a name="61130h0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="06113062000256">Sammy

was reported to the Committee was a sum that was demanded from someone
in the construction industry by the Provisional IRA, and that that was
within the last year? It happened at a time when the Government had
been trying to paint Sinn Fein-IRA as moving away from criminal
activity.</p><p><a name="st_10"><a name="06113062000023"><b><a name="61130h0001.htm_spnew8"><a name="06113062000259">Sir
Patrick Cormack:</b> I shall again be careful, because I do
not want to do anything that could reveal the identity of the person
concerned. However, it is quite clear from what we were told that the
people who extorted that sum were indeed, at the very least, former
Provisional IRA members. One does not necessarily know their current
commitment, but that was where they came from, and they certainly used
all the tactics to which reference was made by both the hon. Gentleman
and the hon. Member who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, the
hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit

and tax frauds (including oils fraud and cigarette smuggling),
intellectual property crime, extortion (intimidation and blackmail),

illegal dumping have been identified as the major areas of organised

Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser) made a
fundamental point. In any country, the rule of law depends on a number
of elements. First, it depends on widespread community support. One
wants a population that recognises that the rule of law is essential
for the proper functioning of a normal and civilised society. Vast
numbers of people in Northern Ireland&#151;the overwhelming
majority&#151;would subscribe to that without any reservation.
Unfortunately, however, there are in both communities&#151;especially
in a number of republican and nationalist communities in the
south&#151;those who have not demonstrated that support. Why have
those communities not demonstrated that support? Because their leaders
have not done so. Community support needs proper leadership.</p><p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="61130h0001.htm_para19"><a name="06113062000037">There is no doubt in my mind
that had all the communities and political parties in Northern Ireland
signed up to supporting the PSNI&#151;a remarkable organisation that
is probably the most supervised police force in the civilised
world&#151;we should not have needed to conduct our investigation and
there would be absolutely no doubt about the outcome of current talks.
The biggest stumbling block, to which we refer in the report and to
which reference has been made many times on the Floor of the House, is
that there is in Northern Ireland a powerful political party, with five
Members elected to this House and a considerable number of Assembly
Members, that has not yet fully signed up to the rule of law and
recognised the

in mind that we have avoided that in the inquiry, but if the criterion
that he has outlined were the sole one, the inescapable logic of his
argument would be that absolutely no crime is committed by loyalists or
Unionists, who do indeed support the police. By implying that it is
only the absence of a specific form of stated support for the police

throughout the world, because human beings are not perfect. We are all,
as the hon. Gentleman knows, miserable sinners and we have in our midst
people who commit crimes. The difference that became increasingly

crime would not vanish. No one would be so fatuous as to suggest that.
However, it would create a wholly different climate. We saw that and we
continue to see it. Even during the Committee&#146;s current inquiry
into community restorative justice schemes one sees&#151;we had
evidence of this only last week&#151;that some schemes are marvellous
and beyond reproach, but others are worrying, because they are seen as
an alternative to policing and control is in the hands of people with
dubious credentials. I circulated to the Committee, so that we would
all have the benefit of reading it, an extremely penetrating but
worrying article by Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a former Taoiseach, in which
he made those points. I hope that the Committee will have the
opportunity before long of meeting Dr. FitzGerald and
discussing some of the issues with him. We need a total commitment and

positive and for that we are grateful. However, if I have a
criticism&#151;the Minister knows that it is a constructive
criticism&#151;it is that the Government do not view some of the
issues with quite the sense of urgency that we would like. For example,
I know that the Government hoped to table a measure on charity law by
the end of November, but I do not believe that anything has been tabled
and today is the last day of November. It is monstrous that in Northern
Ireland the word &#147;charity&#148; is abused and that so many

ever, and I am grateful to him. I shall not seek again to put words
into his mouth, but I am sure that he, like me, is a passionate
pro-European who looks forward to monetary and fiscal harmonisation
throughout the whole of Europe, as we all do. Is he aware that at an
earlier inquiry into the aggregates levy in Northern Ireland we took a
great deal of evidence from quarrying interests and, as a result, were
able to obtain an arrangement with Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury
whereby the aggregates levy was not enforced? The difficulty with fuel
and fuel oils is the scale of the problem, not a lack of willingness on
the part of the Government in these dark days before full fiscal
harmonisation throughout Europe. The sheer scale is so large that the
Government would find it almost impossible to enter into an arrangement
that pertains in some other European
countries.</p><p><a name="st_20"><a name="06113062000048"><b><a name="61130h0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="06113062000269">Sir
Patrick Cormack:</b> Spoken like a true Parliamentary Private
Secretary, but the hon. Gentleman signed up to that recommendation in
our report&#151;he agreed with it. We were unanimous and there was no
vote on it, so he is committed to it. I have made the point and he has
underlined it in his own inimitable way. He is a PPS, but on the
Committee he must speak with that fearless objectivity demanded of
every member of every Select Committee, and he is very capable of doing
so. I do not want to make fun at his expense, but he
intervened.</p><p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para1"><a name="06113062000049">The issue is
important and I am sorry that the Government did not recognise the
importance that the Committee invested in it. However, we are grateful
for their general response. For many years, there has been a broadly
bipartisan policy on the issue. The very processes that we hope are
coming to a successful conclusion were begun during the premierships of
Mrs. Thatcher and John Major and were developed by the
present Prime Minister. We wish them success. Success will not bring an
end to crime; it will not even end organised crime, but it will bring a
real reduction in organised crime. If there is true success, we will
create in Northern Ireland communities in which the rule of law is
accepted, the police have a writ that runs throughout the whole of the
Province, and all politicians are committed to upholding the rule of
law and supporting the police. I very much hope that that happens
during the next few months, and if our report makes some small
contribution to that I shall be well
satisfied.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="time_1"><a name="61130h0002.htm_time0"><a name="06113062000242">2.59

this afternoon and on how he steered the ship throughout the
inquiry&#151;with a light hand on the tiller but a full press of sail
at all times. We made quite good
progress.</p><p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para2"><a name="06113062000051">I shall
respond to a couple of minor points, although, to be honest, most of
the report speaks for itself. The key aspects for many of us fell into
two categories. The first was a feeling of absolute amazement at the
deeply institutional and entrenched nature of gangsterism in so many
aspects of life in Northern Ireland. Many of us will have read the
letter that Her Majesty&#146;s Paymaster General sent to the
Committee in March 2006. It referred to payoffs being deducted when
computing the profits of a trade, and actually admitted that protection
money could be tax-deductible. My hon. Friend the Minister looks as
amazed as I was at the fact that it could qualify as a deduction for
tax purposes to pay graft to a bunch of gangsters who have threatened
to blow up one&#146;s building site. That that should happen in the
United Kingdom or in any civilised society is
extraordinary.</p><p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para3"><a name="06113062000052">We
discovered over and over again that there was an institutional depth to
the sort of commercial gangsterism&#151;it is almost terrorism by
another name&#151;that was taking place. We were led down some
strange byways as we realised the extent of the criminality. The hon.
Member for South Staffordshire referred to intellectual copyright. Many
of us viewed with horror not just the contents of many of the illegal
videos on sale throughout Northern Ireland but the increasing extent of
such dangerous and lethal objects as cigarettes that appeared to have
been rolled from the sweepings of a factory floor in Riga or Vilnius,
drenched in mercury and sulphuric acid, packed into a container, sent
halfway around the world and then flogged on the back streets of
Belfast.</p><p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para4"><a name="06113062000053">As an
ex-smoker, I am completely objective about such things. That anyone
would buy a cigarette is fairly amazing; that anyone would buy a
cigarette of such dubious provenance is even more horrific. But the
fact is that people do. It is so institutionalised that I could go into
many shops, as I did in those carefree libertarian days when I was a
slave to the weed, to buy a few cigarettes and be asked if I wanted any
cheapies. It took me a while to understand. I thought it was a form of
parrot food, but it turned out to be reduced-rate cigarettes sold from
behind the counter. That practice is widely institutionalised. Our
recommendations speak for
themselves.</p><p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para5"><a name="06113062000054">At the
core of the matter is the role of paramilitary organisations in
criminality. The key question is whether some are pursuing their
previous activities&#151;we can dignify them by calling them a
struggle; we can call them any name at all&#151;under another flag,
by another name and for another purpose, using the structures and
organisations that they built up during the 30 years of the troubles to
enrich themselves and fill their boots now, in a time of comparative
peace.</p><p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para6"><a name="06113062000055">Many of us went
to Northern Ireland, visited many people and looked into the eyes of
the victims of such heinous crime and trade. What we realised quickly
was that for organised crime to exist, not just in Northern Ireland but
in parts of this capital city and in many countries, there are certain
prerequisites. When a gang

come into it. Very often, there is a political, ethnic or religious
linkage between such groups. One need only look at the north London
Kurdish-Turkish heroin smuggling gangs recently exposed in the papers,
whose godfathers received two huge prison sentences. That is a group of
people with an ethnic, religious and political linkage. In Northern
Ireland, for a range of reasons&#151;we can go back centuries if
necessary&#151;some people perceive themselves as belonging to a
particular group or organisation. The fight&#151;the struggle, as
some would call it&#151;between those opposing groups has taken place
over many years and in many different forms.</p><p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para7"><a name="06113062000056">I did not see a continuity of
the struggle between Unionism and republicanism in the open-air
markets, the back streets, the shebeens and the hucksters&#146;
stalls that we visited. What I saw was a business that cannot be
dignified by association with a political ideal. Some would say that
some of the activities of paramilitary groups during the past 30 years
should not be dignified by reference to political idealism. I happen to
believe that for all the manifold faults and criminality of many
people, there was in many cases an element of political idealism. We
can argue about wrong and right later, but it was there.</p><p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para8"><a name="06113062000057">The report spells out

would be appropriate to take. It is also the function of the
Committee&#151;and one that it has exercised with great skill,
excluding my own small part in it&#151;to delineate the scale of the
problem. That it has done. If the House were inclined to indulge me I
could list the responses that the Government have made to the
recommendations. There are many matters&#151;particularly cabs,
charities and the licensing of doorkeepers and door security

Gentleman&#146;s statement about the Government responding quickly to
some of the recommendations in the report. Given that the licensing
regime for the road haulage industry is not due to come in until summer
2008; that the legislation on charities was to be laid before the House
before the end of November, which has not happened; and that the
licensing regime for petrol retailing is only the subject of

the Government&#146;s response is hardly swift, is

forensic skills and veritable verbal scalpel to the verbiage that I
have offered the House, but if I may say so he is being a little
unfair. To consider the particular issue of charities, the Minister of
State launched the draft Charities (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 for
consultation on 17 July. I think that that is pretty rapid. There was a
deal of controversy about the role of independent public sector
inspectors general, but the Government should not act precipitately,
and they acted thoughtfully and with care. Despite that they introduced
the order in
July.</p><p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para13"><a name="06113062000068">The

bearing it in mind that the licensing regime that we want has been in
place in England and Wales since 2000. However, the Government said at
the time, and the Minister can no doubt confirm, that that legislation
to bring the road haulage licensing system into line with that in Great
Britain will be launched for consultation in autumn 2007. I appreciate

with a certain amount of care. We all have experience of legislation
that has been rushed through, and we have all suffered from it. This
Government are not as other Governments. We do not act precipitately.
We weigh the facts slowly and carefully, chewing them over, and
masticating at length. Only when we have finally digested the proposals
do we come forward with a legislative document, which will doubtless be
welcomed by all hon. Members
present.</p><p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para14"><a name="06113062000069">The
Committee raised concerns about illegal dumping, and on 21 July the
Government responded by introducing the draft Waste (Amendment)
(Northern Ireland) Order 2006. I could go on, but I suspect
that that might try your patience, Mrs. Anderson, and that
of other hon. Members. Overall the Committee has done a thorough,
extensive and workmanlike job. It has drilled down deeply, as well as
looking widely. As I said, it has produced a document that will stand
the test of time, and which I suspect will come to be seen as the first
point of reference for future discussions of the role of paramilitary
organisations in crime, particularly in extortion.</p><p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para15"><a name="06113062000070">Everyone would like the
Government to do more immediately. There are some things that they can
do, and others that they cannot. However, there are many things,
particularly in relation to the Organised Crime Task Force, on which
action has been taken. I want to end by saying that the impression that
I have gained is not just of the United Kingdom Government acting; the
Committee Chairman, the hon. Member for South Staffordshire, has
mentioned the fact that our inquiry extended into Ireland, and that we
had discussions in Dublin with An Garda Siochana and other
groups.</p><p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para16"><a name="06113062000071">I was
mightily impressed by the cross-border co-operation between the PSNI
and An Garda Siochana, and I think that one of the extremely positive
factors to have emerged from the report is the complete commitment on
both sides of the border to the eradication of that degree of
criminality. It is a degree of criminality that may, politically, be
difficult to prosecute in the Republic of Ireland; however, that is
being done with enthusiasm. It is not for us to praise the Government
of the Republic of Ireland, but it is appropriate to mention that the
political direction that has been given, and the actions of An Garda
Siochana, have been extremely
impressive.</p><p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para17"><a name="06113062000072">A great

operates through its Select Committee system. I commend the report to
the House and, to continue the maritime metaphor that was used earlier,

crime is big business in Northern Ireland. I join other hon. Members in
commending the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick
Cormack) and the staff who assisted in producing such a comprehensive
report. We took a considerable amount of time travelling around
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, taking evidence and gathering
information. As the hon. Gentleman said, some of that information had
to be given in confidence, because of the nature of the evidence and
the potential threat against those who imparted it to us.</p><p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para19"><a name="06113062000075">Organised crime is big
business, whether it is run by criminal gangs or by paramilitary
groups. During the course of our investigation, a number of people
outlined specific details in their allegations against named republican
groups and named loyalist groups. Ironically, the groups that they
named are supposedly committed to a peaceful outcome to Northern
Ireland&#146;s problems, yet it appears that many of their members
are still deeply involved in such activities as running protection
rackets.</p><p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para20"><a name="06113062000076">The extent
of the problem is outlined in the report, from which I shall take two
quotations. The director of the Confederation of British Industry in
Northern Ireland, Mr. Nigel Smyth, told us that extortion
and racketeering were
continuing</p><a name="61130h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="06113062000223"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;at a very
high level&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para21"><a name="06113062000077">and that
counterfeiting was continuing &#147;to get worse&#148;.
Mrs. Val Smith, who is a former national chairman of the
Road Haulage Association in Northern Ireland, said that current levels
of criminality
were</p><a name="61130h0002.htm_brev2"><a name="06113062000224"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;worse

investigations.</p><p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para23"><a name="06113062000079">It is
undoubtedly true that good progress has been made in dealing with some
of the problems. No one should seek either to minimise or to undermine
that. The Assets Recovery Agency has been hitting some of the
individuals involved hard. That is good and should be welcomed, but
there must be no room for any complacency or easing up of the campaign
to hit those individuals where it hurts. Some announcements have been
made in the past few weeks about action against one individual in south
Armagh. That is good, but such action is long overdue, because that
individual is believed to have a multi-million pound racketeering
empire at his beck and call. Whether he is pursued for &#163;5
million or &#163;10 million, the final amount will be a drop in the
ocean unless he is pursued rigorously, as all the others who are
involved in such activities should be pursued.</p><p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="61130h0002.htm_para24"><a name="06113062000080">I am of the opinion, which I
hope other hon. Members present share, that there is an innovative and
chameleon-like quality to some of those groups. They can adapt and
alter their illegal practices and modus operandi to take advantage of
any loosening of the system and to drive a coach and horses through any
attempt to crack down on their activities. The work is work in
progress, to quote some of the people in Northern Ireland who have been
quoted on other issues.</p><br>

has.</p><p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="61130h0003.htm_para2"><a name="06113062000084">In conclusion, I
draw attention to something that several hon. Members referred to. To
expand upon what Val Smiths said, organised crime in Northern Ireland
appears, in certain respects, to have been getting worse in recent
years. However, there are members of organisations in Northern Ireland
in both the republican movement and loyalist movements, but
particularly the republican movement, who want to be involved in the
Government there. That is precisely why my party and I have insisted
not only that all prospective participants in any future Government in
Northern Ireland must indicate that they support the police, the rule
of law and the courts, but that those who previously did not support
police officers&#151;indeed, they engaged in shooting them rather
than supporting them&#151;must prove over a long period that their
change of attitude is deep-seated, and not just grounded in a desire to
get into power.</p><p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="61130h0003.htm_para3"><a name="06113062000085">That
is why we need to see the report in the context of a changing political
environment in Northern Ireland and why we need to keep the matter
under review throughout the next period, whether it be of three months,
six months or a year. We need constantly to monitor those who say that
they are moving away from criminal activity. Whether that work is done
through the Independent Monitoring Commission, the ARA, the police or
other bodies, we need to monitor how such people are behaving, rather
than simply accept a verbal statement to the effect that they now
support the law that they broke so frequently and for so
long.</p><p><a name="st_29"><a name="06113062000086"><b><a name="61130h0003.htm_spnew0"><a name="06113062000278">Mr.

vital point about the need to test people who even today still refuse
to give the slightest endorsement to the Police Authority for Northern
Ireland in tackling crime. Does he agree that such organisations,
including the republican movement, still have in their possession
millions of pounds of illegally gained assets? The retention of those
assets constitutes ongoing criminal activity. Does he therefore agree
that, to prove their bona fides, people in the republican movement in

will have to get a move on in giving up those assets and encouraging
others to do so?</p><br>

a report on organised crime in Armagh, the seat of much of the
organised crime that it describes. There are fuel laundering plants
there, and one of the biggest markets of counterfeit goods was recently
closed down at Jonesborough in County Armagh. Many of the godfathers of
the mafia gangs that run organised crime scams are located in south
Armagh. The fact that the Committee was able to go to south Armagh and
launch its report there was therefore very significant. Only 10 years

organisations of the past. As I pointed out in an intervention, one of
the descriptions given of organised crime in Northern Ireland was that
terrorist crime had turned into paramilitary crime. We have to bear in
mind that many of the gangs are run by people who were previously
engaged in terrorist activity. All the evidence that we were given by
the police and others was that those people use the same skills,

has got worse: terrorist gangs are moving into criminal activity and
that affects Northern Ireland&#146;s economy because it affects
businesses. Business leaders gave us a lot of information about that.
Crime put their costs up, they had higher insurance costs, and it
affected their employees. One of our most poignant visits was to Val
Smith&#146;s transport company, where we interviewed drivers, some of
whom had been held up at gunpoint; the families of some of them had
been held up at gunpoint. One driver described being held up and his
life being threatened on five occasions. As Val Smith pointed out, that
has an immense impact on the morale of employees and their ability to
carry out their work. The criminality affects where businesses can
locate. During some deliveries of alcohol and tobacco, scout cars had
to be sent ahead of lorries to ensure that the routes were clear and
that any patterns of behaviour showing that a hold-up was likely could
be identified. Sometimes former policemen were employed for that

the police could eventually defeat it, but made it clear to us that it
continued to be carried out by loyalist and republican groups that in
the past were engaged in terrorist activity. Indeed, as I pointed out
in an intervention, the evidence was that even up until this year,
five-figure sums were given to some of the groups that said that they

including a spy room in the room underneath my room in Stormont. The
thing that caused that Assembly to stumble from one crisis to another
was the crime and terrorism associated with one of the parties whose
representatives sat in Stormont and were even in government. It is
important not just to give the impression that there has been a divorce
between the IRA and Sinn Fein, but that the crime and any stigma that
comes from it is no longer associated with a political party. The only
way that that can happen is for those Sinn Fein leaders who have the
ability to exercise some control to make it clear to those who follow

Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound) is gone. Organised crime is
embedded in paramilitary organisations, many of which, unfortunately,
are held in esteem in the communities in which they operate. Some of
the individuals are seen as heroes, and some of the organisations are
seen as defenders. The first prerequisite for fighting organised crime
is that the political leaders of communities make it clear that there
is no justification for crime or for sheltering criminals, and that
communities must work with the statutory authorities, whether they be
the police, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the Assets
Recovery Agency or whoever happens to deal with a criminal
activity.</p><p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="61130h0003.htm_para18"><a name="06113062000110">As the hon.
Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser) pointed out in a
telling intervention, the report emphasises in several places&#151;I
believe in three or four different paragraphs&#151;the importance of
the need not only for community support but for leadership to persuade
communities to work with statutory agencies. In paragraph 145, the
Committee states that it is under no illusions about</p><a name="61130h0003.htm_brev6"><a name="06113062000230"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;gaining the community support

be done. Although the recommendations gave the Minister at least four
opportunities to make some comment on the need for political parties to
support the police, there is not one endorsement of that position in
his response to the report. I find that disappointing and I hope that
he will address it when he comes to sum up at the end of the
debate.</p><p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="61130h0003.htm_para21"><a name="06113062000113">There
is a feeling in Northern Ireland and among many of my colleagues that
from the time the Secretary of State stood in the House and said in
response to questions from spokesmen for the Conservative party and my
party that he did not want to make support for the police a new
precondition in any talks, the wrong signal went out to Sinn Fein that
somehow or other the Government would fudge the issue of support for
the police. Even when we discussed the Northern Ireland (St. Andrews
Agreement) Bill and the spokesman for the Conservative party tried on
three occasions to get the Secretary of State to say when he believed
it would be essential for Sinn Fein to hold a party conference, he
could not even pin him down to something as woolly as before or after
the election in March. What kind of signal does that send out to the

Ireland who are engaged in organised crime?</p><p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="61130h0003.htm_para22"><a name="06113062000114">I want to see political

Member who feels increasingly frustrated that the Government, with
their large majority, can push legislation in Northern Ireland through

would rather see a lot of that transferred to a devolved Assembly in
Northern Ireland. My party is on record as saying that it is committed
to working towards that goal and wants to achieve it as soon as
possible. It will not be achieved, and even the most enthusiastic
supporter of devolution will not move rapidly towards that position, if
the requirement of political support for the police is not addressed.
As was pointed out by one of my colleagues, who have either become
bored or have been chased away&#151;they have gone,

there be support for the police, but the police must have the ability

recommendation based on the comments of people who gave evidence that
they feel at times or in some areas that the police may have been
under-resourced when it came to the tools that they needed to carry out
their job. I note that in the Minister&#146;s response all we are
told is that the financial commitment to the police will be about
&#163;800 million until 2008 and that after that the comprehensive
spending review kicks in.</p><p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="61130h0003.htm_para24"><a name="06113062000116">That masks the fact&#151;I

few months ago&#151;that the police are staring at a huge financial
deficit after 2008 with the comprehensive spending review, the Gershon
efficiencies and the cuts that there will be in police expenditure. The
extent of that meant that there was talk that the PSNI might have to
divest itself of nearly 2,000 personnel and to come down to the levels
given by Patten for a situation where Northern Ireland has as much

police service and asking politicians to build it up when, at the same

they take the light sentences as part of the risks of the job. It is
important that some cognisance is taken of the Committee&#146;s view.
Despite the fact that the Minister said in his response that it is not
Government policy to interfere with the operation of the courts, we
have precedents in Northern Ireland for giving guidance to courts to
impose heavier sentences for certain types of crime. The report pointed
that out: with hate crimes, whether they involve religion, sex, colour
or whatever, judges are encouraged to and do give heavier sentences. It
is important that there should be a similar direction in the cases of
those who are involved in organised crime when they use their
paramilitary muscle, paramilitary past, paramilitary involvement,
paramilitary tactics or paramilitary friends, because allied to that is
the culture of intimidation.</p><p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para3"><a name="06113062000125">The Committee&#146;s next
recommendation was for certain legislative change. I listened to the
hon. Member for Ealing, North, and I know that he is a Parliamentary
Private Secretary and that he had to say all those things and be nice
to the Minister, but he was not in touch with reality. He talked about
how swiftly the Government have moved on some of the issues. That is
not the experience that the Committee had when listening to evidence or
indeed the impression given by the report or the Government&#146;s
response.</p><p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para4"><a name="06113062000126">Let us look
at a couple of the issues. On the licensing regime for petrol
retailing, half of the garages in Northern Ireland sell illegal fuel.
Many of them have been put out of business and many of the owners are
forced to take loads from fuel-laundering plants. Despite the fact that
in 2003 the Committee recommended that a licensing system should be
introduced, nothing was done. There is promise of a consultation in
paragraph 49 of the Government&#146;s response and of a licensing
system that might come in some time in 2007, but it is likely to be
later than that. I hardly think that that shows urgency. That is all
despite the fact that the industry is crying out for a licensing
system, as are those involved in collecting the revenue&#151;or not
collecting it as the case may be, as result of all of the illegal fuel.
We are saying that a licensing system would help and may have saved
many of the small petrol retailers. A robust licensing system would at
least ensure that it was much more difficult for those who laundered
fuel in plants along the border to find an outlet, because much of it
is now going through what appear to be legitimate forecourts, but are
not.</p><p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para5"><a name="06113062000127">I note that
there has been some change regarding the second piece of legislation we
asked for. That involved an amendment to part 5 of the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002 to aid the Assets Recovery Agency in, first of
all, speeding up the civil recovery of the proceeds of crime. One of
the things that the Minister must look at very soon is the way in which
even when assets have been seized, they can be used to fund the legal
defence of those from whom they were seized. The evidence that we were
given was that large amounts of those assets were simply ploughed back
into the legal defence. In fact, the legal bills were sometimes so
enormous that it called into question just how genuine some of the
bills were. Given that the report courageously points out that some
professionals were actually part of this network, and I know some of

that this loophole of using seized assets for a defence might actually
be recycling assets right around the system again. There is no sign in
the Minister&#146;s response that that aspect is going to be looked
at soon.</p><p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para6"><a name="06113062000128">The third
area is the licensing regime for the road haulage industry; something
that was introduced in other parts of the UK in 2000 and is not likely
to come to Northern Ireland until the summer of 2008. Again, that is
not a speedy response from the Government. In the meantime, people who
are transporting illegal fuel can do so because there are not the same
controls over the road haulage industry as elsewhere. Illegal
cigarettes are transported and a whole range of other criminal
activities are also taking place.</p><p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para7"><a name="06113062000129">The requirement for the role of
the Charity Commission to be extended to Northern Ireland is also
important. There was a lot of interest in that issue in the local media
when the Committee published its report. One of the fears that I
had&#151;I did a number of interviews at home on the issue&#151;was
that many legitimate charities could actually find themselves hurt by
the fact we had identified charity fraud in a report. People do not
want to see that money ending up in the pockets of the paramilitaries.
It is important that some assurance is given in Northern Ireland that
organisations set up as charities are genuine so that the funds do not
dry
up.</p><p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para8"><a name="06113062000130">There
are many other recommendations that I wanted to discuss, but I have
spoken for long enough. The Committee Chairman has been generous in his
comments on the Minister&#146;s response. The Minister has tip-toed
around many aspects of the report and the recommendations rather than
address them head-on. There are some difficult issues here and I know
that there is no panacea, but the tackling of organised crime is
important for stability in Northern Ireland. It is important for the
political stability of Northern Ireland and for showing that we are
moving out of an era when paramilitaries and their political associates
were able to run the place and benefit from organised crime.</p><p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para9"><a name="06113062000131">Every effort should be made to
address the issues raised in the report and look at the recommendations
that the Committee has made. They were made after due consideration and
as a result of much thought and evidence from people who are affected
by paramilitary and organised crime on a day-to-day basis. The
Government must give serious consideration to the report, particularly
because some of those who came along did so reluctantly, not, as the
Chairman said, because they were afraid. Many of them were afraid and
were very brave to come because they knew that, if some of the evidence
given to us in private had got out and been made public, they would
have been in personal danger. However, many came along saying,
&#147;We have been here before. We came to this Committee when you
were looking at fuel fraud in 2003. We gave evidence and nothing
happened. We do not want this to be a waste of time again.&#148;
People took a chance in giving evidence; they gave us an honest view of
what it is like to be a business person in Northern Ireland and the
Government have a duty to respond to the fears that they
expressed.</p><br>

financial costs of organised crime and the potential gains to criminal
gangs are significant and continue to present a threat to the long-term
stability of the economy and the communities of Northern Ireland. It is
worth spending a moment assessing the size of the problem. The cost of
intellectual property theft is estimated at &#163;200 million. Drugs
worth more than &#163;7 million were seized by the PSNI in 2005-06.
Some 35 million cigarettes were seized during the year, which amounts
to almost &#163;7 million in revenue. Environmental crime such as
illegal dumping is worth at least &#163;25 million to criminal gangs
and extortion probably generates in excess of &#163;10 million in
criminal profits a year. The revenue lost from fuel smuggling and
legitimate cross-border shopping is estimated to be &#163;245
million.</p><p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para11"><a name="06113062000134">The

something that the report articulated well. Paramilitary-backed gangs
have been responsible for some of the largest scale and most lucrative
organised crime activities undertaken in Northern Ireland. Paramilitary
groups have long relied on criminal means to finance their activities,
and all paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland have been heavily
involved in organised crime, both as a principal means of raising
finance for their organisations and, obviously, for personal gain. The
disciplined structures of paramilitary organisations have allowed a
smooth transition from terrorist organisations into profitable criminal
ventures. Extortion in particular has long been used by paramilitary
groups as a means of raising finance for their terrorist operations
and, since the early 1970s, has been an effective means of exercising
paramilitary control over the community. The point about the community,
which has been articulated this afternoon, is of great concern to us
all. However, there has been a move beyond traditional means of
fundraising such as extortion and armed robbery towards more
sophisticated and complex forms of crime, such as counterfeiting and
smuggling. Those points were well articulated to us during our
inquiries. There is evidence to show that funds from organised crime
run by dissident republican organisations in particular have been used
to fund attacks and threats against members of the police, the Army and
the Prison
Service.</p><p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para13"><a name="06113062000136">According to

from clear. The true extent of Northern Ireland&#146;s extortion
problem is not reflected in the number of cases successfully
prosecuted, as we have heard in the past. It is likely that less than
10 per cent. of extortion is reported to the police&#151;I hope that
the Minister understands that. There are also many difficulties in
prosecuting such cases successfully. In approximately 85 per cent. of
the cases reported, the victims decline to work with the PSNI during
the investigation. When the PSNI has been able to conduct an
investigation, every case has resulted in the extortionists being
convicted, which is marvellous. We must focus on increasing the number
of people who report the crime in the first place, and there is a real
issue about how that process can be undertaken. What steps are being
taken to make the public aware of those facts, to give them more
confidence about reporting
crime?</p><p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para15"><a name="06113062000138">Violent crimes
are also a particular concern. The incidence of cash-in-transit
robberies is increasing. The use of so-called tiger kidnaps, which were
described and in which family members are taken hostage to compel an
employee to facilitate a robbery from their place of work, is on the
up. Perhaps the most notorious example of that was the Northern bank
robbery in 2005. How many tiger kidnaps occur each year, and what
advice is available to those who may be susceptible to that type of

Ireland remains unacceptably high. It costs the Treasury &#163;245
million a year in lost revenue. HMRC assesses that nearly all its
investigations relating to fuel on mainland Great Britain involve
individuals from Northern Ireland. A particular problem is the misuse
of rebated fuels&#151;fuels on which a reduced rate of duty is
payable&#151;especially red
diesel.</p><p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para17"><a name="06113062000140">The Northern
Ireland Affairs Committee recommended, as my hon. Friend the Member for

fuel in Northern Ireland to the same level as that in the Republic of
Ireland to reduce smuggling. I believe that serious consideration
should be given to changing the system to allow duty to be paid on fuel
at the point of sale&#151;as in the Danish model, in which rebates
are reclaimed and offset against VAT returns&#151;rather than at the
refinery gate, as is currently the case. Given the health and safety,
as well as the financial, implications of laundering rebated fuels, and
the extortion and intimidation that often accompany that, will the

factor is important in all that we discuss, because I do not believe
for a moment that people are necessarily buying these goods for
themselves. They spread them around their communities and families, so
the goods affect more people than just those who buy them. We must
consider that extremely carefully in any further reports that we

part of the problem, and they may be participating in the activity as a
part of paramilitary organisations, as the hon. Member for East Antrim

that I have been very aware of since I became a spokesman on Northern
Ireland. We hear things over here, we read reports in the newspapers
and we see pictures on television of events in Northern Ireland. That
coverage tends to centre these days on the political movements and
political discussions, but whenever I go over to Northern Ireland and
read the local newspapers, I tend to see things that I do not read over
here very often. More things are going on than perhaps the headlines
report in this country. I know that we can access the newspapers in
Northern Ireland through the internet, but if we go over there, read
the newspapers and talk to people, they tell us of many things going on
in the Province that perhaps we do not read about in England. That
unfortunate fact is highlighted in the report, which emphasises the
fact that there is a continuing big problem with organised crime in the

water down the independence of a Committee. I do not mean that in a

worry that the private sector is not coming on as strongly as it should
be and that the level of economic inactivity in Northern Ireland is far
too high. I know that the Government want to address such issues, but
the continued organised crime cannot be helping. It could be said that,
for the best part of 40 years, terrorism has led to the Province being
relatively poorer economically than the rest of the UK, and we must
address that.</p><p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="61130h0004.htm_para27"><a name="06113062000153">The

in relation to fuel. The report goes into great detail on the matter,

intelligence and the police are doing their best, so it is worrying
that the situation is getting not marginally but a lot worse. One
begins to wonder how that decline will be stopped and where it will

Organised crime and its proceeds must be financing political activities
to some extent. I have talked many times in the House about a meeting
that I had with the former Member of Parliament Seamus Mallon in his
constituency, three or four years ago, before the previous election. He
said that Sinn Fein had 200 paid employees working in his area,
supposedly volunteers. That came not from the DUP but from a
nationalist politician. I do not know about my hon. Friends, but I am
lucky if I can get 10 people on the streets. We have a by-election in

which is a worrying one. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Norfolk mentioned the Northern Bank robbery. It caused a bit of a
hiccup, but not as big a hiccup as it should have caused. The
Government said that the IRA did it and that members of the IRA and
Sinn Fein were one and the same, yet they are determined to propel them
into government in Northern Ireland. That worries me. I want to see
progress made as much as anybody, and in every Statutory Instrument
Committee on which I sit I begin with the words, &#147;It is a shame
that we are all here. I wish that the Assembly were up and running and
carrying out this legislation.&#148; I stick by that, but it worries
me that the people who will sit in government are the very people who
knew about the Northern Bank robbery and might even have been involved
in committing it.</p><br>

money has gone. Not all of it has been accounted for and it could be
used to fight the Assembly elections in March. It would be amazing if
it were not used for that purpose. I am sure that some of it will be
used for personal gain, but some will be put towards fighting the
elections. That is not only highly illegal and dangerous but very
unfair to the political parties in Northern Ireland, including the
Social Democratic and Labour party, which must fight the election
legitimately with small amounts of money. We are all well aware of the
difficulties of raising money to finance our campaigns, and Sinn Fein
might have something of an advantage. That cannot be right, and it
makes it more difficult to solve the problem that there seems to be a
dual-track process. There is a political track and a paramilitary,
financial one. It cannot be right for people to be politicians by day
and terrorists by night. That is not sustainable and the Government
must somehow find a way to address the problem. I am not suggesting
that that will be easy, but it must be recognised that such problems
are going on. </p><p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para1"><a name="06113062000157">That is
particularly true because of the prospect of policing and justice being
devolved at some stage. I know that the Minister will talk about the
triple lock mechanism, but things move on. I have spoken to Sinn Fein
MPs such as Conor Murphy who have told me that they are not prepared to
sign up to the policing boards until they get that devolution. I do not
know whether they have changed their minds&#151;things move on and
people take different approaches at different times&#151;but he
looked me in the eye and said that they were not prepared to do that.
Yet all this organised crime is going
on.</p><p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para2"><a name="06113062000158">The report makes
it absolutely clear that organised crime is being carried out by people
on both sides of the divide: the loyalist paramilitaries&#151;I
regret the use of that phrase because it is a contradiction in terms,
but that is the name by which they are recognised&#151;and the
republicans. I have so far focused on the role of the republicans
because they are politically represented and would be sitting in
government, but for the avoidance of doubt it is important to say that
the Conservative party totally and utterly condemns paramilitary
activity from either side.</p><p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para3"><a name="06113062000159">To say that I welcome the
report seems wrong because it contains an awful lot of bad news, but it
is valuable because it brings to the House the reality of life in
Northern Ireland. As I said earlier, I am not sure whether everyone in
England realises that everything there is not exactly right. That
includes Members of the House who perhaps do not need to spend as much
time on Northern Ireland matters as I do. A lot of people say,
&#147;Everything is fine there now, isn&#146;t it?&#148; to which
I reply, &#147;No, it&#146;s not fine. It&#146;s better but it is
not fine. There is still a long way to go.&#148; One great value of
the excellent report is that it brings these issues before the House
and gives us the opportunity to debate them.

good-natured, unlike that on the water and sewerage statutory

get more out of it. I congratulate Committee members on all their hard

the report and its recommendations. As far as I can, I deal with this

unnoticed by the majority of UK citizens and, occasionally, Members of

additional risk there that we have to
confront.</p><p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para7"><a name="06113062000164">The report

to paint a particular picture&#151;I think that those were his
words&#151;but it cannot be left just to the Government to make
assessments as to whether certain organisations are still engaged in
paramilitary activity or the organised crime that funds it. That is why
we have the IMC: to report to us what progress is being made.</p><p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para13"><a name="06113062000170">The IMC has been clear in its
reports, particularly the past two, that PIRA has set its face against
organised crime although individual members may still be engaged in

for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell), talked about the impact
of organised crime on the economy and the community, and wanted to know
what more is being done on that&#151;even since the important report
was published. I can tell them that only last month, after a successful
operation by the PSNI and HMRC, 3.5 tonnes of cannabis was seized in
Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para17"><a name="06113062000174">We
get used to reading headlines about those kinds of quantities of
cannabis being seized but let me share with hon. Members what it means
in practice. I was with the district commander for Ballymena on Monday
and he told me that the supply of cannabis on the streets in that town
has been radically reduced because of the seizure. It means that
cannabis is not getting through in anything like the quantities that it
was. We should not underestimate the importance of such a seizure in
stemming the supply of that drug to local communities in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para18"><a name="06113062000175">I shall
visit the PSNI drug squad next week, and I shall certainly convey my
appreciation of and support for its work. As hon. Members have said,
those drugs and the perhaps more harmful class A drugs destroy lives
and undermine communities. None of us should cease in our efforts to
ensure that we challenge and tackle anyone who is involved in the
supply of drugs into our
communities.</p><p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para19"><a name="06113062000176">I am also
able to tell the House that between March and September, police seized
counterfeit goods to the value of &#163;2 million. I am sure that
hon. Members will share my sense of injustice and outrage at such
criminality. One can picture a member of a low-income family, in the
run-up to Christmas or at a time when such issues come to the fore,
seeing counterfeit goods that appear to be the real thing but cheaper,
and thinking that they can get something cheap for the family. They buy
those goods, and they turn out to be fake, or they do not work, or they
are even harmful.

That is good news, particularly because, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound) made clear, they are even more
harmful than legitimate cigarettes. During the same period, HMRC closed
down 12 fuel laundering plants, and I am pleased to say that they
included several in what were regarded until recently as no-go areas
for many aspects of law enforcement. When the hon. Member for East
Antrim praised the Committee Chairman for going to Armagh to publicise
the report, he made the point that it is important that such issues are
confronted forcefully in those areas. Literally tens of millions of
litres of illicit fuel are not on the market, and that must be good for
the ordinary car user, who will not damage their engine, and it must be
good for the environment, because of the damage that is caused by
dumping waste products.</p><p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para21"><a name="06113062000178">The Assets

Hon. Members will know the case of Dylan Creaven, who recently settled
with the agency, and with the Criminal Assets Bureau based in the
Republic of Ireland, for &#163;18 million&#151;the largest
settlement to date. I am sure that that will be one of a growing number
of settlements, as the criminals realise that we are serious about
seizing assets from them. Some &#163;11 million of assets has already
been disrupted this year alone, which is 40 per cent. of the total for
the United Kingdom. We can see how seriously the agency deals with
those issues.</p><p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para22"><a name="06113062000179">We must
create a situation in Northern Ireland whereby the criminal mind

there is evidence, people will be arrested and prosecuted, and when the
prosecution is successful, they will be sentenced appropriately. We
will disrupt the criminal lifestyle from beginning to end, and when
they come out of prison, we will follow them and see what they get up
to. If they engage in further criminal activity, they will be dealt

changing the mindset of criminals in Northern Ireland, and that is
important. However, England has a similar problem, which is partly
brought about by the high rate of tax on tobacco, alcohol and fuel.
That is not a criticism of the Government, because the rate would
probably have been the same under a Conservative Government. However,
the rate encourages people to deal illegally in those products. The
Minister may say that they are bad products, which should be taxed
heavily. However, the rate is creating a problem. One in four

however, the criminal mind will continually look for the opportunity to
engage in criminal activity, make a profit and accumulate criminal
assets. If we rely on closing a loophole here and a loophole there,
even if we are successful at closing off that criminal option,
criminals will simply move somewhere else. There is no substitute for
confronting the criminal, finding out who they are and what they are up
to, dealing with them, locking them up and seizing their assets. In the
end, that must be the way. I shall address fuel in a moment, because it

on 13 October. We received more than 90 responses, and we are
confident that the order will be laid before the House before we rise
for Christmas. On taxes, we held a 12-week consultation on the draft
order, which ended on 7 November. We received 53 responses and,
altogether, 26 public meetings were held with people who operate in
that industry. The comments were detailed and mainly positive. We are
considering them, and if changes are needed, we will make them&#151;I

legislation.</p><p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para25"><a name="06113062000184">On the
petrol licensing scheme, the consultation started in September, and it
will end on 12 January. Again, assuming that there is a fair wind, new
legislation will be in place by June next year. It will be some time
before new road haulage industry legislation is in place, but we are
still committed to it and a thorough consultation will begin in 2007.

licensed. There will be a thorough system of regulation, the like of
which we have not seen in Northern Ireland. I can understand why people
urge us to do more and to do it quickly, but we are addressing a range
of issues. There is a lot of work, and we must get it right. However,

have considered the issues carefully. As was said in response to a
previous report, the Danish model would be administratively more
complex, and that must be taken into consideration. However, a more
compelling argument is that it would create more opportunities for
criminal activity, because duty would be paid further down the chain.
Fuel would go missing from the supply chain, never to be seen
legitimately again.</p><p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para28"><a name="06113062000187">The beauty of the current
system is that duty is paid as fuel leaves the refinery. If we were to

believe that that argument can be made in this case. In addition, the
central principle is that we cannot have different tax duty systems in

derogating from the relevant European directive. As I said earlier to
the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, even if we took that step and closed

between the Netherlands and Belgium it is 8p. In itself, a differential
should not present a difficulty; the issue is the criminality that
arises around it. The way forward is to confront the criminal gangs
themselves, deal with them, get them locked up, seize their assets and

drawn. The Committee has made a legitimate argument, but in the end it
is for Government to reflect on that argument. Although we have taken
the recommendation seriously, we have come to a different
conclusion.</p><p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para31"><a name="06113062000196">A number
of hon. Members have mentioned extortion, including my hon. Friend the
Member for Ealing, North. The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk was
right to mention the figure of 10 per cent. of incidents reported. Some
would argue that that is a generous assessment of the level of
extortion that is reported and dealt with. He is also right, however,
to underline the fact that in those cases in which a report is made,
investigation takes place and a prosecution occurs, there is a 100 per
cent. success rate for prosecution. The record shows further that there
are no recriminations against those who gave evidence. Fear of
recrimination is probably one of the reasons why people are reluctant
to come forward, but in fact it does not occur in cases that have been
proved. The hon. Gentleman rightly asked what we are doing to encourage
people to report extortion. We have established an extortion helpline
and we are widely advertising the contact number for it.</p><p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para32"><a name="06113062000197">The construction industry has
been mentioned this afternoon. I have had a very detailed and
constructive meeting with the Construction Employers Federation in
which we dealt with many of the problems that employers are facing. The
federation was invited to give information and further evidence
whenever it feels the need to do so. We also had a very focused
discussion of the problems at the most recent meeting of the Organised
Crime Task Force stakeholder group, in which people from the business
community gave us evidence and further
information.</p><p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="61130h0005.htm_para33"><a name="06113062000198">We are
trying to build confidence within the industry to report extortion
whenever it is threatened, so that it can be thoroughly investigated.
We want to develop the independent private sector inspector
general&#151;IPSIG&#151;model, although hon. Members may be pleased
to learn that we are giving it a different title: construction contract
monitors. As far as we can see, there will be a &#163;1 billion
programme of public investment in construction in the years ahead in
Northern Ireland. That is a huge amount of money, and it is incumbent
on us to ensure that it is absolutely free of extortion and of
filtering out of taxpayers&#146; money to fund criminal activity. The
public sector has an important role, and we hope that the private
sector will be able to make use of the model too.</p><br>

discussions with the Construction Employers Federation, ultimately we
must move to a regulated and properly licensed private security
industry, so that if companies feel the need to protect a building site
or an asset, they pay a legitimate fee to a legitimate company, and do
not have to hide away secret payments to extortionists, which is
completely unacceptable. That is why the licensing arrangements
proposed in the Bill introduced this week are so very
important.</p><p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para1"><a name="06113062000200">The hon.
Member for South-West Norfolk asked about tiger kidnaps. They have
increased since 2005, and they are now running at roughly the same
level as in 2004. The PSNI takes them very seriously indeed. Forums
have been held involving people from banks and post offices to make
them aware of the risks and to identify the risks that can be dealt
with if staff know the correct procedures to follow. The PSNI&#146;s
view is clear: it is important to obtain better intelligence in order
to deal with the problem effectively, and it will continue its
activities in those areas.</p><p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para2"><a name="06113062000201">The need to
develop a greater public understanding of the damage done by organised
crime has also been highlighted this afternoon. We are pursuing that
objective vigorously through messages about the damage to
people&#146;s health that illicit cigarettes and alcohol can do, and
about the damage to car engines from illicit fuel. Communities are
undermined by drugs and by the connection between organised crime and
paramilitary activity. All those arguments must be made and must be
made up front&#151;there is no dodging that.</p><p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para3"><a name="06113062000202">We are working to strengthen
our media strategy and to focus it more strongly, because it is
important that we get the message across effectively. On 11 December I
shall launch an initiative with a group of 150 school students in the
Coleraine area. There will be a roadshow to explain to them the impact
of organised crime on their lives, and to explain that DVDs and certain
items of clothing may not be legitimate. If it works, as we hope it
will, it is a programme that we can roll out across Northern Ireland so
that we can educate young people as well as adults about the dangers
that lurk in illicit activities. Another event is planned for January
with the chamber of
commerce.</p><p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para4"><a name="06113062000203">A
great deal of work is going on to try to spread the word and to instil
greater confidence in the minds of ordinary citizens, as well as in the
minds of companies. It is important that all of us engage together in
the fight against organised crime. A short time ago I invited
Sir Stephen Lander, the chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency,
to a launch in Northern Ireland. He undertook a review of the
suspicious activity reports that lawyers and accountant have a
responsibility to make when they think that money laundering is
occurring. The launch was very well attended, and it was clear to me
that people do indeed want to play their part in the fight against
crime.</p><p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para5"><a name="06113062000204">During
our discussion today, a great deal has rightly been said about progress
since the report was published in July and about the moves towards
devolved government in Northern Ireland. I want to reaffirm a point
made during the debate and elsewhere about the conditions for the
process moving forward. It is clear that two important elements
underpin the process: first, a willingness on behalf of all parties and
communities to share power, and secondly, a willingness on behalf of
all

unthinkable that any Government could be established that is not
founded on those principles, and it is clear that both must be in place
to establish stable, long-term, democratic government in Northern
Ireland. We cannot have a casual on-off switch. Those are long-term,
not short-term, commitments, and they must be strong and able to
withstand the test of time. No ounce of energy will be spared by
Ministers or anyone associated with the Northern Ireland Office to
ensure that we work towards a lasting settlement with both those
elements firmly in
place.</p><p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para6"><a name="06113062000205">The hon. Member
for East Antrim asked about police resources. He probably knows more
than most about those resources in Northern Ireland because of his
involvement with the Northern Ireland Policing Board. He knows that
there is to be a comprehensive spending review in 2007 and that there
will be discussions about long-term funding. He also knows the
commitment that we have made to maintain the number of police officers
in Northern Ireland at the current level until at least 2010. We must
do that to fulfil the Patten commitment on the representation of the
Catholic community in the police force. We are making huge progress in
that area. The police force of 7,500 officers, which is the current
full strength, will remain in place until 2010, and we will provide the
money to ensure
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para7"><a name="06113062000206">The hon.
Gentleman expressed frustration about sentencing. That frustration is
not confined to Northern Ireland&#151;we all hear messages about
sentencing in our constituencies. People are outraged by criminal
activity and they want punishment that fits the crime. When they feel
that it does not do so, they say so. Politicians cannot intervene in
individual cases because that is a matter for the process of law, and
for judges and the courts. However, when there is organised criminal
activity and violence is used, the courts can take account of that when
sentencing.</p><p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para8"><a name="06113062000207">I make an
offer to the Chairman of the Committee to provide more information, but
when we have examined sentencing trends and patterns, we see a
situation in Northern Ireland that is broadly comparable with that in
England and Wales. I am happy to share that information and we will
monitor the situation. Sentencing is important, which is why we have
continued to strengthen the law in a number of ways, not least the law
covering organised crime, to ensure that punishment fits the
crime.</p><p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para9"><a name="06113062000208">In conclusion,
the hon. Member for South Staffordshire said, wisely, that we will
never end criminality, whether in Northern Ireland or elsewhere, but
that we should be firm in our resolution to break the link between
paramilitary activity and criminality, to make it extremely difficult
for organised crime to operate in Northern Ireland, and to make it
clear to those engaged in it that they stand to lose more than they
will gain if they persist in their endeavours. I assure the House that
there will be no letting up in our efforts.</p><p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para10"><a name="06113062000209">I again thank the Northern

it sent to the Northern Ireland Office.</p><br>

Patrick Cormack:</b> I thank all who have taken part in this
debate, which has been a useful exercise. I am grateful to every hon.
Member who spoke, including the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, my
hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson), and
the Minister. We have had a useful exchange of views and an extremely
robust expression of opinion from my hon. Friend, as I shall call him,
the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) who made some valid and
telling points, as did my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk
(Mr. Fraser) and the hon. Member for Belfast, North
(Mr. Dodds), who had to return to his constituency before
the debate came to a
close.</p><p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para11"><a name="06113062000211">I admire the
way in which the Minister has got to grips with the issues since taking
office relatively recently. He and I have a good personal relationship,
which I value. He knows that the Select Committee is the creature not
of Government, but of Parliament, and that it is our duty to hold him
and his colleagues to account. He also knows that there are some
differences between us, albeit not on the substance or the necessity of
dealing with crime; perhaps we differ slightly in our sense of urgency.
I know that in Northern Ireland the consultation process tends to be
longer than elsewhere and that that tends to create delay, but it is
crucial that there is no further delay on the charities issue, for
example. There has already been slippage and an order should have been
tabled by today. Indeed, that was promised in writing for today, but it
has not happened. We sincerely hope that the Minister&#146;s
commitment to produce an order before Christmas will materialise,
because that is
essential.</p><p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para12"><a name="06113062000212">We shall
continue to differ respectfully on the fuel issue. I listened carefully
to what the Minister said, but I was not convinced. Where I can
willingly join forces with him is in congratulating the Police Service
of Northern Ireland on many things, particularly the recent drugs haul
to which he referred. I also congratulate the Minister on the recent
roadshow initiative. I hope that it works well and that the Select
Committee will be able to co-operate with him on future roadshows. If
we could bring home to the young people of Northern Ireland the
appalling dangers, aside from the criminality, of buying noxious
substances, whether to smoke them or to drink them, that would be a
significant
achievement.</p><p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para13"><a name="06113062000213">I want to
finish on a note that concerns us all. The Minister quoted from the
IMC&#146;s report and referred to the favourable comments about the
Provisional IRA, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating and it
must deliver. Time is running out in the Government&#146;s timetable.
On 30 January, the Assembly, such as it is at the moment, will be
dissolved, an election campaign will begin, and it is proposed to have
elections on 7 March. If Sinn Fein is to have credibility as a
democratic party, it must have begun to show that it has truly signed
up to the concept of the rule of law and that it has truly and
absolutely foresworn criminality in all its forms and the ill-gotten
gains that criminality has produced.</p><p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="61130h0006.htm_para14"><a name="06113062000214">It is not just the
Minister&#146;s order on charities that I hope we shall have before
Christmas; I hope that we shall also have a signing up by Sinn Fein so
that we can enter the new year with all political parties absolutely
