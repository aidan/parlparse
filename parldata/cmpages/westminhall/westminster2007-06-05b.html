 First, I welcome the Secretary of State for International Development to the debate. I know that he has taken a great interest in these matters over a long period of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para1"><a name="07060543000011">As I walked through Westminster Hall, I noted the exhibition on slavery. We know the figures involved and the amount of commitment given in the late 18th century and early 19th century to ensuring that people would no longer suffer as a result of that despicable crime. I am also bound to consider the matter before us in the context of the number of people who have died as a result of the lack of provision of water and sanitation. Obviously, we are not talking about deliberately inflicted circumstances, but people are dying unnecessarily on a scale commensurate with many of the other great concerns that we ought to have. I ask the House a simple question: why does a child die from water-related disease every 15 seconds? That situation cannot continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para2"><a name="07060543000012">Clean water is life; foul water is death. We, as parents and grandparents, ought to consider that in the context of our own kith and kin. How would we feel if our children or grandchildren were dying of such terrible diseases? In the 19th century, Chadwick and Snow both addressed the question in not dissimilar circumstances. In the aftermath of the industrial revolution and in the slums of Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield and so on, there was no proper water provision. In the 1830s, 1840s, 1850s and 1860s, a series of reports was produced, because people realised both how awful the situation was and the fact that it was capable of being remedied. It was not only a moral dilemma and problem, but a practical problem. To begin with, Chadwick did not get the reasons for the problem of bad water right&#151;it was John Snow who did so&#151;but in combination they managed to solve the problem, although it took a long time. We now have the technology and the facility, but do we have the political will?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para3"><a name="07060543000013">I am bound to add a personal anecdote. In 1849, my great-great-grandfather, William Cash, died of cholera in the great epidemic. Prince Albert also died of cholera a short time later. The curious thing was that my great-great-grandfather was chairman of the National Temperance Society, so he drank water. Even at this distance in time, one must acknowledge the fact that that was, to say the least, something of an irony, because when he and the other directors of the company that he had founded&#151;the National Provident Institution&#151;were gathered together for lunch, the  <br>

others all drank beer, wine or whatever else was on offer, but he drank water and regrettably died within days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para4"><a name="07060543000014">This important debate is about a present issue. I do not want to overstate comparisons, but I want to contextualise the discussion. We shall have a debate later today on Darfur, and we face the problem of civil wars and conflict in Africa. I have mentioned slavery, both historical and modern, and there is also the problem of AIDS. However, to my mind, it is inconceivable that we cannot give the problem of water and sanitation the attention that it requires. I repeat: a child dies every 15 seconds as a result of water-related disease. I seek an increase in the amount of attention given nationally and internationally to this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para5"><a name="07060543000015">I should mention a number of articles. I want to get the problem out in the open because there is a question that we have to address to the media at large. We live in a media age: we know perfectly well that the best way to keep a secret is to make a speech in the House of Commons. A number of people have played an important part in trying to raise the question, but we need a continuation of that process. We need awareness to be built up in the same way as awareness of the other subjects that I mentioned. Larry Elliot and Ashley Seager of <i>The Guardian</i> have written important articles, as have Fiona Harvey of the <i>Financial Times</i>, Paul Vallely of <i>The Independent</i> and Tom Stevenson of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. They have taken an interest, but they are isolated examples in the context of a child dying every 15 seconds. We need a continuous commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para6"><a name="07060543000016">The Select Committee on International Development recently produced a good report. I pay tribute to Tearfund and WaterAid, to Laura Webster and Jennean Akadiri, both of whom have been enormously helpful to me. I also pay tribute to the 220 MPs who have signed my early-day motion on this issue, and the approximately 300 MPs who signed my motion on the reduction of third world debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para7"><a name="07060543000017">I am interested in the subject because, leaving aside other matters&#151;sovereignty, Europe and things of that ilk&#151;the practical questions of life and death and of people&#146;s lives are of ever greater importance, because they can be solved by combined action throughout the world and through the national and international agencies. I appeal not only to the newspapers, but to <i>The Economist</i>, the Economist Intelligence Unit, the <i>New Statesman</i>, and <i>The Spectator</i>. I ask them to give this subject space, to give it attention and the coverage that it deserves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para8"><a name="07060543000018">Recently the <i>British Medical Journa</i><i>l,</i> for the first time in 150 years, did a report on which issues the public throughout the world regarded as the most significant and the most important. It discussed which medical and related solutions had led to the biggest change in the world, and some 15 milestones were chosen. Interestingly, sanitation came above antibiotics, by a clear head. When people focus on sanitation and water, they realise that it is the issue that spreads its tributaries throughout all public health problems and throughout the entire global landscape, in a way that deserves the sort of attention that I hope it will receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para9"><a name="07060543000019">One billion people globally lack access to safe water, and 2.6 billion people lack access to sanitation. As I have said, a child dies every 15 seconds from diarrhoea, and 443 million school days are lost globally each year  <br>

to the illness. Half the world&#146;s hospital beds are taken up with people suffering from water-borne diseases, 40 billion working hours are lost each year in Africa to the need to carry water, and 11 per cent. more children attend school when sanitation is available. Improvements to water and sanitation are crucial if development interventions are to be effective. New hospitals will remain full and new schools could remain empty unless water and sanitation are included in the bundle of essential services that are given priority nationally. Water and sanitation are also important to improving the lives and status of women. However, globally, aid to the sector has fallen and less aid has been focused on the countries that need it the most. Although spending on health and education has doubled since 1990, the share of global aid spent on water and sanitation is contracting. The problem is compounded by the fact that renewable freshwater supplies are running low due to a sixfold growth in consumption in the 20th century, and that issue is likely to be exacerbated by climate change.</p>

 I very much welcome this debate. As a member of the International Development Committee, I have visited a number of pit latrines this year as part of our investigation and report. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the lack of funding for sanitation, which is much more severe than the lack of funding for water, is a very serious problem? People fail to address the issue, sometimes simply out of embarrassment, but it is vital to do so if we are to save the many lives that he has spoken about this morning.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="07060543000021"><a name="70605h0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="07060543000403"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Lady. She has taken a great interest in this subject and was a contributor to the Committee&#146;s report. I agree with her 100 per cent. My constituency abuts Stoke-on-Trent, where sanitary ware has traditionally been produced in this country, and I shall be in touch with people there to try to promote their interest in the subject for the very reason that she has mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para10"><a name="07060543000022">Some people might think that provision of latrines, lavatories, toilets, sewerage and so on is a difficult subject, but I disagree. It is so vital and the pit latrines that the hon. Lady mentioned are so fundamental that we must take it seriously. Piped water, for example, can be provided, but what is the point of piped water if it becomes contaminated by sewage? It is essential that we tackle those issues, and I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her intervention.</p>

I pay tribute to the Secretary of State for his work, and I hope that he will take my criticisms, such as they are, in good heart. With a change of Prime Minister, who knows what might happen to the right hon. Gentleman? However, the plain fact is that his voice in such matters will continue to reverberate, and I sincerely trust that the new Prime Minister, when he  <br>

takes over, will give water and sanitation the sort of priority that he has given to education in Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para12"><a name="07060543000024">I turn to the Government&#146;s record on the issue. United Kingdom aid to the water and sanitation sector fell steadily between 2000 and 2004, but the Secretary of State has made a number of positive recent announcements. In March 2004, the Department for International Development produced a water action plan and in 2005 the Secretary of State announced a doubling of aid for water and sanitation for Africa by 2007-08 from &#163;47.5 million to &#163;95 million. In the context of what I have said, I am bound to ask whether that is enough&#151;even though it is considerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para13"><a name="07060543000025">DFID&#146;s 2006 White Paper included water and sanitation as one of the four key basic services&#151;the others are health, education and social protection&#151;on which it will spend 50 per cent. of its aid. The White Paper also announced a &#147;doubling of the doubling&#148; to Africa, with aid increasing to &#163;200 million per year by 2010-11, as the Secretary of State said in reply to my question in the House the other day. DFID is drafting a new policy paper on water and sanitation, and it published a document earlier this year called, &#147;Why we need a global action plan on water and sanitation&#148;. I am not going to say that those are just fine words; they are important, but the Department must do better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para14"><a name="07060543000026">The Secretary of State has demonstrated considerable commitment to the issues, but with the Chancellor championing education and the Prime Minister closely linked to commitments on HIV/AIDS, it could be argued that water and sanitation have not received the same high-level political commitment from the UK at international summits. The Committee&#146;s report also accused DFID of having a blind spot when it comes to sanitation, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin) said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para15"><a name="07060543000027">Aid from other European Union member states has also declined. The EU water initiative, launched in 2002, aimed to increase high-level support for those issues and to improve mechanisms for co-ordination between donors nationally. However, despite DFID attempts to improve the initiative, there remains a general lack of commitment from most member states, and we believe that the initiative has largely failed to achieve its objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para16"><a name="07060543000028">Other major donors to the sector include the United States and the World Bank. The amount of money that the World Bank provides for water and sanitation is great, but it, too, must do better. Major donors have tended not to focus on the poorest people in the poorest countries; instead, they have spent more on a small number of major infrastructure projects in middle-income countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para17"><a name="07060543000029">When one looks at who suffers the most in Africa, and in sub-Saharan Africa in particular, it is important to note that the poorest people in the poorest slums pay the most for water. There are rackets in certain countries. In Kenya, for example, there are disparities in the amount of money that the water carriers and suppliers seek, and the net result is that poor people pay disproportionately more for water. That is inconceivable when one considers the impact that it is bound to have on poor people and their children. No wonder, one child dies every 15 seconds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para18"><a name="07060543000030">The G8, which is about to reconvene, last discussed water and sanitation in 2003, when it signed up to the  <br>

Evian action plan on water and sanitation. The plan, however, was more a broad statement of intent than a concerted strategy for meeting the MDG targets. With two days to go before the G8 meeting and with one child dying every 15 seconds, I believe that now is the time to revisit the issue of water and sanitation and for the G8 to commit itself to a comprehensive plan of action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para19"><a name="07060543000031">Will the Secretary of State speak to the Prime Minister? Will he push for a global action plan on water and sanitation at the G8 summit, the day after tomorrow? That is a specific request&#151;in fact, I would call it a demand. I do not want to overstate the case, but I want to ask: will the Secretary of State please speak to the Prime Minister and raise the issue as a top priority in the G8? That is needed as a first step to providing high-level political commitment to action. The Prime Minister has just made a speech in Berlin about commitments made at the previous G8 meetings being not fulfilled by other countries. Now we have an opportunity to raise the issue in the context of a child dying every 15 seconds as a result of water and sanitation problems. Certainly DFID has acknowledged the need for a plan at that level, but we need more commitment immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para20"><a name="07060543000032">Given the fact that 220 MPs have signed my early-day motion and that five chairmen of all-party groups on African matters were among the first six signatories, the fact that we went to Downing street with WaterAid and Tearfund only three weeks ago and presented a petition&#151;I have a reply from the Prime Minister acknowledging that&#151;and the fact that we are setting up a new all-party committee on water and sanitation to look more deeply into these questions, I again urge the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister to respond. I am writing to the Prime Minister today to urge him to bring the issue up at the G8. I look forward to hearing him report back to Parliament on the issue, presumably on Monday. I do not think that what I have proposed is a challenge or an unreasonable request. In the context of what I have said, it is essential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para21"><a name="07060543000033">Finally, we must ensure that sanitation is fully integrated into all health, education and other development initiatives. I say this to my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds), who is my party&#146;s Front-Bench spokesman. We are giving a great deal of attention to the subject, as I have no doubt he will demonstrate when he speaks. No schools or health facilities should be built without latrines. Indeed, I understand that the new health care strategy is to be launched today in relation to this matter. We must fulfil our commitments on spending in the sector and work hard to ensure that other countries make it a priority. That includes countries within the EU, although I am always concerned about whether it will manage to achieve its targets. We must ensure that efforts are made to integrate the water sector fully into climate change plans, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para22"><a name="07060543000034">I end by simply saying this. If I have demonstrated a passionate concern about the issue, it is because I believe that it matters. It matters because, as I said at the beginning of my speech, clean water is life; foul water is death. We can no longer allow a child to die every 15 seconds as a result of a failure on water and sanitation.</p>

 It is an enormous pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash). I congratulate him on achieving a debate on a such an important subject, and on the eve of the G8 summit, too, as he said. He has shown a great interest in the subject and has pursued it with the diligence that we have come to expect from him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para23"><a name="07060543000036">I am also particularly grateful for the excellent support that the hon. Gentleman gave to the International Development (Reporting and Transparency) Act 2006, which I sponsored last year. Now that a first-class report has been presented to Parliament&#151;the first of its kind arising from that Act&#151;I am sure that, when we have a debate in the House, he will continue to pursue the subjects dear to his heart and to present his case in the well-informed and comprehensive way that he has done this morning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para24"><a name="07060543000037">I am pleased, too, that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is present. I am sure that he will confirm that the issue is very much at the heart not only of the Government&#146;s approach, but of their endorsement&#151;also now included in the 2006 Act&#151;of the millennium development goals. At least one of those goals&#151;perhaps more&#151;impacts on the issue of water and sanitation, and of course we all want that pursued. The intention in millennium development goal 7 is to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by the target time of 2015. I know that the Government accept that objective; indeed, from everything that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said, it is fair to say that he would feel that we can do even better than that. Nevertheless, there is a commitment to the millennium development goals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para25"><a name="07060543000038">The hon. Member for Stone acknowledged that, as reflected in DFID&#146;s recent White Paper, the UK is striving to ensure that our commitments on basic services and on doubling the water spend in Africa by 2007-08 are achieved, and that the spend is then doubled again, to &#163;200 million by 2010-11. We all accept, however, that our current trends suggest that we will simply not meet the target in sub-Saharan Africa. That applies to other aspects of what we hope to do, but it does not mean for one second that we withdraw from what we want to achieve. Nigeria has the largest slum populations in Africa and less than half the rural population there has access to an improved water source. Together with UNICEF, DFID is helping 500,000 people get access to water in eight states and piloting innovative low-cost sanitation initiatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para26"><a name="07060543000039">I was pleased that the hon. Gentleman mentioned the important debate that is to take place in the House this afternoon on Darfur. It is important that we acknowledge that DFID has provided &#163;17 million specifically for the water sector, through its humanitarian assistance programme in Darfur and southern Sudan. However, the great frustration that we all share is that because of the conflict and the carnage there, even that funding will not be as effective as we would all wish it to be. Nevertheless, DFID should be congratulated on its contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para27"><a name="07060543000040">DFID has done well to encourage the international focus on the issue, particularly with its recent  <br>

document, entitled &#147;Why we need a global action plan on water and sanitation&#148;. I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will wish to develop the commitments in that document in his response. It highlighted the role to be played by Governments and civil society in the co-ordination and management of projects, as well as the need for better financing and capability building at local and regional levels. Again, our Government have a record of which I am proud. DFID recently launched a five-year, &#163;3 million research programme on water supply and sanitation in three regions of Ethiopia, helping to show how better financing can strengthen human security and provide opportunities for growth, for the benefit of poor people in Ethiopia and the wider Nile region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para28"><a name="07060543000041">Of course, as the hon. Member for Stone said, not only Africa suffers from the problems that he identified. In Pakistan, half the girls who drop out of school do so because of a lack of access to latrines. That underlines the point that the problem of water and sanitation links in to the other problems that we want to deal with, such as health care, infant mortality, maternal mortality and education. I think that DFID would highlight the importance of its funded programme in the North-West Frontier province in Pakistan, which in 2006-07 provided clean drinking water for 170,000 people and proper sanitation for 225,000 people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para29"><a name="07060543000042">Recently, that excellent organisation Results UK, which is doing wonderful work in this field and particularly on tuberculosis, encouraged a number of us, including my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar), to visit India. Although we were focusing on tuberculosis, it was obvious to us that the issue raised by the hon. Member for Stone&#151;water and sanitation&#151;was pivotal in trying to find a solution to that problem and to many others. The fact is that 1,000 people die of tuberculosis in India every day. Even if we improve water and sanitation as we want to, we will not solve the problem exclusively through that. Nevertheless, that contribution is significant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="70605h0001.htm_para30"><a name="07060543000043">At any one time, half the people in the developing world suffer from one or more of the diseases associated with inadequate water supply provision. Half the world&#146;s hospital beds are occupied by people suffering from water-related diseases. That was unsurprising in India, because as we heard, just 15 per cent. of the rural population have access to a toilet. The UK Government promote water sustainability in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, and that is welcome. It was certainly welcome to the people to whom we spoke, as my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland will recall.</p>

I am glad to join the hon. Member for Stone, if I may, in paying tribute to Tearfund, to Laura Webster and to WaterAid. In India, we heard of WaterAid&#146;s contribution.

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para1"><a name="07060543000045">I believe that the issues raised in this important debate go beyond even Governments, and so I want to end with a reference to development education. The vast majority of the British people are supportive of what the hon. Member for Stone has said and of the things that we want to do to provide clean water and proper sanitation. For that reason, I was proud that one of the main secondary schools in my constituency, Rosehall high school, working with a nearby primary school, St. Mary&#146;s, has involved itself in a twinning link with a little village in Malawi. When I visited the school recently, we saw slides that showed places where water had not been provided and where people had to walk five miles to obtain it, and because of the help that the two schools have been able to give through fundraising and keeping in touch with that village, water is now provided in those areas. I am proud of the schools for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para2"><a name="07060543000046">The challenge to us all goes further than that. Development education means that we want more schools, individuals, churches and voluntary organisations to take the view that together we can indeed give this matter a push. It is vital, for all the reasons that have been given, that we achieve the millennium development goals and more. I congratulate the hon. Member for Stone on the focus that he has encouraged us to deliver on those matters in this important debate.</p>

Member for Stone and I have had a number of discussions about water over the past few months, and when he was putting together his early-day motion, I was glad to have the honour of being one of the signatories. It is a great credit to the House that more than 200 of our Members have signed it; I only wish that 646 had. We are working on that, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will put his usual effort into it, as he does with most subjects. It was a pleasure not to hear the word &#147;Europe&#148; in his speech today, but it is early days and there is still time left. I was interested in the story about his great-great-grandfather, who drank only water and sadly died. It gives people like me, who drink alcohol, some hope that we may continue for a bit longer yet. But enough of the frivolities, as they say.</p>

Perhaps when they came back, we would not have the problem of having only 200 signatures on an early-day motion.

first concerns an area just outside Kano, called Wudil. It is a semi-rural region, with a population of some 200,000 people. The project is probably one of those DFID projects mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. It is an example of good housekeeping and of how the work should be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para6"><a name="07060543000051">DFID stepped in to help that community and worked alongside partners from other countries&#151;from Canada in particular&#151;to ensure that the water pumps and water station were up and running and that the water was delivered to the local villages. That has increased the amount of water delivered from 500,000 litres a day to 10 million litres a day. That is 20 times what the people there received before, and it was better than anything else I had seen in Nigeria in my visits over the previous few years. To get 20 times as much water&#151;we will even reach the stage where some in the villages receive water straight into their houses&#151;is fantastic compared with what we have seen in the shanty towns, with their sheet metal and dirty water running in the street being siphoned off, and where young children walk two miles to fetch water, and carry their buckets, containers, pots and pans all the way back to the house to provide dirty water to cook and clean with. That is not what we want to see, and DFID should be congratulated on the work that it has done in that case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para7"><a name="07060543000052">Let us compare that community with another, Iddo Sarki, which is just outside Abuja. It has six standpipes, of which two work. The two that work have been installed for a number of years, and were put in properly. The piping was dug deep into the ground and there was not a problem. There was an improvement project, but by the time that it had been passed down from central Government to the state government, and then via local government to the local water installers&#151;with everybody taking their skim off the top&#151;the further piping was left lying on top of the ground. It was the type of very thin plastic piping that we would use for gutters. Needless to say, given the heat and the number of people in the village, some of whom stood on the piping, it cracked. The result was that there was no water pressure and no water. Four brand new standpipes were waiting to deliver water, but did so for what I believe was a total of only 120 minutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para8"><a name="07060543000053">That is not good enough. Somewhere along the line, money had been given by a Government&#151;I never did work out which one, although I do not think it was the British Government. However, by the time that that money had come down through the various channels, with various people skimming amounts off the top and the contracting company using the cheapest possible materials, it was clear that the installation would never last. As a result, a village of more than 5,000 people had only two standpipes for everybody in the village.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para9"><a name="07060543000054">That is an example from just outside the Nigerian nation&#146;s capital, which is a brand new city that is lovely to visit. It has a wonderful sports stadium and complex, yet only five miles down the road there is a problem of the type that I have described. I hope that it will have been rectified by the time that I return to Nigeria at the end of the year. I have written to new President about it, as I did to the old one; I have been in touch with various members of the Nigerian Government, and I have spoken to the high  <br>

 The hon. Gentleman may recall that I produced the International Development (Anti-corruption Audit) Bill. I also exchanged a few words with the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill when his Bill was going through, and likewise with the Secretary of State. The governance issue is a central one; corruption of the kind that the hon. Gentleman has described causes death, because it prevents sanitation and water from getting to where they are needed.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. Corruption is undoubtedly one of the major problems that Africa and other parts of the world must overcome, and achieving that is a matter of good governance. In this country, we might argue and complain that the Government are not doing this or that the Opposition are not doing that, but we are held accountable to the people whom we represent. In countries of the type we are discussing, nobody is held accountable. They do not have taxes as such, and the result is that elected representatives are not accountable to anyone. That is one of the problems in the world: that elected representatives are not accountable to the people whom they supposedly represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para10"><a name="07060543000057">The visit to the village just outside Abuja took place in the run-up to the Nigerian elections that were held a month or so ago, and there were posters all over the place. I asked the village elder who the local councillor was&#151;I knew what the answer was because there was a poster right beside him&#151;and he replied that it was the man in the poster. I asked when he had last seen the man, and he said, &#147;Oh no, we have never seen him.&#148; On asking what he meant, I was told that the councillor sends money and food every so often when there is an election on, so that people can have a party and so that everyone will vote for him. The elder seemed to think that I was the councillor&#146;s election agent, because he added, &#147;By the way, we will be voting for him.&#148; I said, &#147;Do not vote for that man. He has done nothing for you. Look at the state of your village and of your pipes. You have no decent water. Why are you voting for him? He is supposed to deliver for you.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para11"><a name="07060543000058">The people who have to receive these facilities should realise that they have a say. That is what I told the village elder: &#147;Keep electing somebody different until you get somebody who does something for you. Do not vote for this man.&#148; Nevertheless, I know that the village will have voted for the same councillor, that he will have been elected and that he still will not have been to the village, which is all very sad. We have a job of education to do, and I hope that some of that education will filter down to people as a result of good governance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para13"><a name="07060543000060">Governance is very important. That is why I believe, after two or three years when I believed something completely different, that when we invest in projects such as those on water, we should oversee them from start to finish. We cannot look at every water project for years to come, but when we walk away, we should know that we have provided the best quality materials, that the best effort has been made and that people have been shown how to maintain what has been done. That is the other problem: we do not show people how to maintain the equipment that we give them. We put in expensive pumps and we do not train people in how to use them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para14"><a name="07060543000061">The good news in Wudil was that that was not the case. We are training people to look after things for themselves, so that they will be able to maintain what has been achieved. I expect that when I return at the end of the year, the system will be fully up and running, and that one of the local engineers will be in charge of running it. If that is not the case, the same thing will happen as has happened in the past; the installation will rust, break and fall into disrepair and we shall be back to standpipes in the street. I hope that that does not happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para15"><a name="07060543000062">I have waffled on a bit, Mr. Amess, but this is an important subject, and it is important that we draw on what we have seen in order to explain what actually happens and to tell people the realities of life&#151;or in many cases death. I have not even mentioned the hospitals that we visited. Nobody in this country would go near them, but thousands of people sit outside them, waiting for ante-natal clinics that they never had in the past and that are the result of international investment. Those investments must be overseen too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para16"><a name="07060543000063">Water and food are life&#146;s necessities. Along with education, they are the resources that we should be giving to countries such as Nigeria, together with the rest of Africa and other third-world countries. My right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill is renowned for the work that he has done in such countries, and he knows&#151;from personal experience and better than anyone present&#151;how much needs to be done. I have been an MP for only six and a half years, but if I can learn about such matters in that short time, so can everyone else. One day we will have an EDM that bears every single MP&#146;s name, and we will have a debate in the main Chamber. I hope that the Prime Minister will implore the G8 to put in more money. A target of 0.7 per cent. of GDP is a start, but that is all. It is a target that we need to reach, and afterwards we need to go further.</p>

If we deny people access to life and the same rights as others, they will take matters into their own hands. Europe would not be able to cope with that kind of problem if it emerged in Africa, so it is important not just for Africans but for the rest of the world that we invest in poorer countries and raise their living standards to a reasonable level at which they can look after themselves and progress.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) on securing this vital debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para19"><a name="07060543000067">I pass on the apologies of my right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), who is chairing the International Development Committee and so could not be here today. He asked me to make two comments in connection with the Select Committee&#146;s recent report. First, he wants to emphasise that sanitation should be a priority, as it has a huge effect on development. That is set out in the report and has been raised in this debate. Secondly, he wanted me to mention his belief that the core problem is partly the fact that DFID has a staff shortage and that expertise in the field may be diminishing. It is vital that expertise is kept, in some form, preferably by funding expertise and people on the ground in the places where the problems actually exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para20"><a name="07060543000068">I shall not discuss the Select Committee&#146;s report now but wait until a debate is arranged specifically to discuss it. Instead, I will focus on the United Nations convention on the law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses and on British funding of the public-private infrastructure advisory facility, which I shall refer to as PPIAF, as the name is such a mouthful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para21"><a name="07060543000069">We have heard that water is life. In Britain, thankfully, we do not have to think of it like that. We moan if there is a hosepipe ban, but elsewhere in the world water shortages literally mean life or death. Water is a fundamental human need, and access to it is a basic human right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para22"><a name="07060543000070">It is a sad reality that political tension and conflict over water often go hand in hand. Therefore, it is vital to address water supply issues not only to help people in the developing world avoid health problems, as we have heard this morning, but to avoid wars. The Government must take a lead on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para23"><a name="07060543000071">The more that I learn about water, the more I think that we are, on the whole, a little weak in the area&#151;the Secretary of State will forgive me for saying that. The main issue is not sanitation but water, which has particular relevance to developing countries. There are already examples of political tension over water that crosses boundaries. There is conflict over water access and an increasing threat of mass migration away from areas of water stress. There will be migration and influxes of people. It is essential to secure access to water and, in particular, to secure the integrity and sustainable management of rivers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para24"><a name="07060543000072">The UN convention covers non-navigational uses of watercourses shared by two or more countries. It is vital in reducing conflict over water, but I understand that the UK has not yet ratified it. WWF drew my attention to that, and to the fact that, worldwide, there are 263 rivers that cross international boundaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para25"><a name="07060543000073">It is also my understanding that the UK sponsored the convention at the UN General Assembly in 1997. There is an urgent need for the UK to take an international lead on such matters, and I would be grateful if the Secretary of State would review ratification. Time is passing: the convention was first put into the arena 10 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para26"><a name="07060543000074">The second matter that I want to discuss is the importance of getting aid in connection with water right. The Secretary of State will know that I have already been banging on about that to some extent. For those of us who have been present during past debates and oral questions on water, it will not come as a surprise that I return to the topic of PPIAFs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para27"><a name="07060543000075">Realistically, constructive partnerships between communities, non-governmental organisations, Governments and the private sector are the only way for developing nations to get sustainable water supplies. The private sector often brings vital investment and expertise, but there is a problem around the PPIAFs. For the elucidation of Members, on 28 March, I asked the Secretary of State the following question:</p>
<a name="70605h0002.htm_brev0"><a name="07060543000365"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Is the Secretary of State aware that Norway has withdrawn its funding for the public-private infrastructure advisory facility, because its projects involving water have so often failed and been so widely criticised? How does the Secretary of State scrutinise the use of UK taxpayers&#146; money? If we are unable to do so effectively, is he likely to withdraw British funding from the PPIAF?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para28"><a name="07060543000076">In response, he stated:</p>
<a name="70605h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="07060543000366"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The PPIAF is having a real impact, not just in relation to water but in other areas. The one example that I can think of is that it has helped to improve the availability of mobile phones in Afghanistan, which is good for helping the economy there to grow and develop. As I said a moment ago, in the end I am interested in investing money in what works. There are examples of private sector water provision that work and there are spectacular failures. There are examples of public provision that work and there are those that have been spectacular failures. The conclusion that I draw from that is that it does not matter so much whether it is one or the other, we should be putting cash, effort and time into what really makes a difference. I will assess our contribution to the PPIAF on that basis.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28 March 2007; Vol. 458, c. 1481.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para29"><a name="07060543000077">I was discomfited to have a question on water answered with an example about telecoms. That demonstrates where the problem lies. I do not believe that the Government know much about the workings of the PPIAF or its effectiveness. At present, there is little or no scrutiny of it, and that is why it is allowed to continue working in the way that it does without much questioning. That is why it is allowed to continue to fail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para30"><a name="07060543000078">I am not saying that every project will be a success, but I urge the Government to assess the contribution of the PPIAF to ensure that the money that we are spending on aid and on such structures is delivering on the ground. The Secretary of State slightly evaded my question about the PPIAF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="70605h0002.htm_para31"><a name="07060543000079">I am sure that the Government are aware of a report called &#147;Down the Drain&#148;, that assessed PPIAF&#146;s work on water since it was created in 1999. The report gives examples of failing projects and criticises the PPIAF for a lack of transparency in its activities. If the facility is to continue, we ought to be fighting for it to be more transparent, so that we can understand what our money is achieving.</p>

I urge our Government to question our support of the PPIAF&#146;s work on water. On 23 and 24 May, the PPIAF had its programme council meeting in The Hague, and each donor had to review its funding of the facility.

I believe that the current programme is failing. I would like the UK to review whether our aid money for water&#151;and, for that matter, for sanitation&#151;is being spent effectively through the PPIAF, and to cease the funding if the evidence is that that is not the case.

He must review the work and ensure that our money is being spent effectively.</p>

I put it on the record that he has a passionate and keen interest in the developing world, particularly Africa. He is extremely knowledgeable and he articulated that knowledge in an informed way, as he described the serious water and sanitation problems in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para0"><a name="07060543000084">My hon. Friend rightly put the issue in the context of our own history in the United Kingdom and the significant efforts that were made in the 19th century to improve some of the appalling conditions that existed, particularly in our cities. The significant difference between the conditions that existed then in the UK and those that now exist in the developing world is the presence of powerful metropolitan boroughs and the infrastructure necessary to implement many of the recommendations that have been highlighted in the reports mentioned. That infrastructure does not exist in significant parts of the developing world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para1"><a name="07060543000085">My hon. Friend was also right to detail the significant impact of the millennium development goals on improving the lives of people in relation to health, education and other areas. I will return to that later, if I have time. He was also correct to say that the Conservative party is seriously considering in detail how to improve the delivery of water and sanitation, how the issue interacts with climate change and aid effectiveness monitoring and how we can achieve a faster more effective delivery of water and sanitation to help those who really need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para2"><a name="07060543000086">The right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) is a renowned expert on this matter and adeptly piloted his private Member&#146;s Bill through Parliament. Hon. Members from all parties made a small a contribution to the passage of his Bill  <br>

and, like the right hon. Gentleman, I hope that the issues raised by the Bill will be debated on the Floor of the House as soon as possible, because it has made a significant improvement to the DFID annual report, in which it has rightly been subsumed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para3"><a name="07060543000087">The right hon. Gentleman was correct not to focus only on Africa, but to highlight water and sanitation issues in other parts of the world. DFID also needs to focus its attention in that respect. However, he was also right to recognise DFID&#146;s contribution to the issue, although all hon. Members agree that more needs to be done. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone and the right hon. Gentleman were both correct to highlight the significant impact that organisations such as Tearfund, WaterAid and some of the other excellent non-governmental organisations have had on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para4"><a name="07060543000088">I had the privilege of travelling with the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) to Nigeria, where we looked at many of the issues that he mentioned. He is an expert on Nigeria with a high reputation and a high regard for those in Nigeria because of his expertise. When we were there, we both met the formidable DFID team who were doing an excellent job, sometimes in difficult circumstances. However, he would be the first to acknowledge the significant problem of how Nigeria can provide the necessary resources for water and sanitation if it does not have an accurate view of its own population. He was also right to highlight the financial impropriety in some parts of Nigeria, because that makes it difficult to deliver the necessary improvements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para5"><a name="07060543000089">The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) was right to press the Secretary of State to ratify the UN convention and right to raise the significance of water management in the developing world. She may be aware that WWF is doing significant work on analysing those issues. I advise the Secretary of State and his officials to look at that report when it is available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para6"><a name="07060543000090">I will not repeat the statistics that have been mentioned, but make two or three points to re-emphasise the significance of the issue. There are 5,000 child deaths a day&#151;I am not sure whether that equates to a child dying every 15 seconds, but it is a significant number&#151;because of unclean water and poor sanitation. However, there has been some progress. Some 10 million people gained access to improved drinking water in sub-Saharan Africa annually between 1990 and 2004. The problem is that the population is growing far faster than improved services can be delivered. It is estimated that, during that same period, 60 million more people did not have access to water. On sanitation, it has been estimated that the numbers of people who have access to facilities has risen by 5 per cent. since 1990. However, that has been outstripped by population growth, so an additional 111 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to sanitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para7"><a name="07060543000091">Water and sanitation is a key millennium development goal and, in some parts of the world, particularly in Asia, providing access to water is on track. Sadly, as with much else in sub-Saharan Africa, progress towards the millennium development goal for water and  <br>

sanitation&#151;I think it is No. 7&#151;is significantly off track. If we continue at the current rate, it will not be reached until 2076.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para8"><a name="07060543000092">I do not wish to paint a completely bleak picture, because there has been progress. Mauritius and South Africa are close to universal access to water. In Uganda, there has been a significant increase in the number of people with access to sanitation and water, with the figure tripling from 21 to 61 per cent. between 1990 and 2006. We acknowledge the perhaps belated progress that DFID has made on the issue by doubling the funding for water and sanitation to &#163;95 million and doubling it again by 2011-12&#151;whether that is enough is a debate for another day. We welcome the Government&#146;s acknowledgement in November 2006 that access to safe and affordable water is a right for all. However, the International Development Committee report that I, along with the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, hope will be debated in full on a separate occasion, was critical of DFID. It said that sanitation was neglected by DFID and in evidence to the Select Committee, the Secretary of State himself acknowledged that its eye had perhaps been taken off the ball regarding that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para9"><a name="07060543000093">The issue is a particularly complicated part of the international development sphere because there are numerous complex and interrelated challenges. I shall raise two or three key matters. Water and sanitation is a more challenging sector than health and education because there are often a number of Government departments, agencies and private contractors involved in the provision of the service. There is rarely one Department responsible and the issue is often the responsibility of local government, which in many developing nations does not have the absorptive capacity or infrastructure, and is regularly over-burdened, under-resourced and lacking the required expertise.</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="07060543000094"><a name="70605h0003.htm_spnew1"><a name="07060543000410"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 The hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) made a point about corruption and governance and I backed him up on that. I take the point that my hon. Friend makes about local government, but the history of the issue and the context in which we are considering it shows that it was the reform movement and the local government changes that took place in the mid-19th century that provided the mechanism to enable delivery. Would my hon. Friend like to pursue that point?</p>

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="07060543000095"><a name="70605h0003.htm_spnew2"><a name="07060543000411"><b>Mark Simmonds:</b>
 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s intervention as he is absolutely right. I was going to say that DFID can play a significant role in strengthening local government accountability and structure, and civil society in local areas. That would enable better and more effective streamlining of delivery mechanisms and instruments. My hon. Friend makes an additional point, which picks up on the point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West, about central Government accountability. He was right to highlight the dislocation that exists in Nigeria and elsewhere in the developing world because the electorate can bring to bear no accountability upon the individual who has been elected. There is often no taxation structure or system and that situation needs to be improved. That issue relates to the building of pluralistic civil societies, which I know DFID is involved with in many developing nations. We must make a greater and more significant impact on reforming institutions, reducing corruption  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Jun 2007">

<notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2007 : Column 17WH</b><br>
and strengthening legal frameworks. Without central Government commitment and accountability in developing nations, it will be difficult to improve access to water and sanitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para10"><a name="07060543000096">Another key point is that few water utilities are financially sustained with tariffs. It is rare to cover all operational and maintenance costs, not to mention the original funds for capital investment, so most utilities rely on subsidies, which presents significant challenges in weak and fragile states. I saw that for myself in Yemen, where Oxfam had put a water and sanitation system into a tremendously poor village just outside Aden. Not only was the system not sustainable because Oxfam would only be there for a certain number of years and the local government structures did not have the funds to improve it, but people in the village did not have the money to access the water supply and sanitation. That related to my hon. Friend&#146;s comment that often it is the poorest who are asked to pay more, which is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para11"><a name="07060543000097">Better water and sanitation could make a significant contribution to achieving all the millennium development goals. It could reduce the number of people suffering food scarcity and living on less than a dollar a day&#151;millennium development goal 1. It could boost school enrolment&#151;millennium development goal 2. It could promote gender equality&#151;millennium development goal 3. It could reduce child mortality&#151;millennium development goal 4. It could improve maternal health&#151;millennium development goal 5. It could protect people from HIV and other diseases&#151;millennium development goal 6. In addition, however, there is a moral imperative to improve access to water and sanitation. It has been established that improvements are cost-beneficial&#151;the potential economic gains significantly outweigh the costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para12"><a name="07060543000098">As the Opposition spokesman, I have three particular suggestions on which I think that DFID needs to focus. The first is greater efforts to promote sanitation and waste water treatment. Often the problem is not lack of water, but poor management, pollution and wastage, and lack of facilities. That might change as climate change has an impact; there might be more significant water shortages as rainfall and river levels drop, exacerbating water scarcity and water stress, which will lead to conflict and significant migratory flows, particularly into urban areas. It is important that we provide water and sanitation facilities, which will enable and enhance economic growth, thereby enabling developing nations to stand on their own two feet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para13"><a name="07060543000099">My second suggestion is that it is important that DFID encourage more flexible local, small-scale providers to strengthen capacity. In northern Bangladesh, I saw for myself a project run by an NGO involving microfinance and microcredit, enabling small villages to produce sanitation equipment, which they then sold to surrounding villages, which not only helped sanitation and watercourse cleanliness, but generated income for themselves, so that they could provide for their families and buy into other products and services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para14"><a name="07060543000100">Although subsidies will remain necessary to provide sanitation in rural areas, output-based aid and performance-based subsidies to support and incentivise service delivery are important. Tying subsidies to performance output to improve service quality and  <br>

<notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2007 : Column 18WH</b><br>
lower costs, thereby allowing increased coverage, could be a significant way forward. Indeed, recently, in Mozambique, 36,300 new connections have been made&#151;a 22 per cent. increase in Maputo alone&#151;via output-based aid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para15"><a name="07060543000101">My third suggestion is for subsidies for initial connection costs to increase access more rapidly, given that tariffs rarely cover operating and maintenance costs. That means ensuring sustainable long-term funding from donors and the internal national domestic budget allocations, which will enable utilities to extend their services and target areas to where the majority of poor people live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para16"><a name="07060543000102">I have two or three quick questions for the Secretary of State. The EU initiative on water and sanitation has not been a great success, even though it has improved. We are into the 10th round of the EU development fund, the replenishment of which will be finalised this year. Is DFID pressing for a reform of the EU water facility and, if so, what progress has been made? Will the Secretary of State say what progress is being made to harmonise the work of the 23 UN agencies currently involved in water and sanitation? It might be preferable to have one country plan, co-ordinating body and monitoring and evaluation strategy in each country working with the respective Governments to deliver the improvements in water and sanitation that we all want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para17"><a name="07060543000103">There was criticism in the Select Committee report about the lack of technical expertise in DFID. I hope that the Secretary of State will say today that that is being addressed, or has been already. The 2007 annual report states, in the context of the action plan that the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill mentioned earlier, that DFID is updating its policy work on water and sanitation. When will that work be publicly available, so that the House can consume and discuss it? We welcome the increased resources that DFID has pledged for water and sanitation and the fact that it has recognised concerns that there might not be significant absorptive capacity on the ground. Will he say what steps DFID is taking to strengthen the absorptive capacity of local government and providers to ensure that that funding has the maximum impact in the shortest possible time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para18"><a name="07060543000104">Effective investment in water and sanitation facilities is essential if we are to see improvements in living conditions, economic performance and the quality of life in the developing world. I plead with the Secretary of State to ensure that every penny of additional funding is delivered effectively for the benefit of those in the greatest need. He will find that the Opposition are supportive of the British agenda for water and sanitation.</p>

initiated by WaterAid, on encouraging all of us to do more. I welcome the International Development Committee report; the fact that it chose to carry out this inquiry and focus on this very important issue has been of great assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para19"><a name="07060543000106">The hon. Member for Stone summed it up when he talked about water being the stuff of life, but we have a world water crisis. The statistics are stark: 1.1 billion people lack clean water, 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation and 5,000 children die every day&#151;he said that one dies every 15 seconds&#151;because they have no water. In developing countries, the task of fetching and carrying water falls mainly to girls and women. On a recent visit to Malawi, I walked with some women and I ended that afternoon with an even greater appreciation of the sheer physical labour involved in that task. Those women walked six times that day the 15 minutes to the water points to collect the water, put incredibly heavy buckets on their heads and walked back. When girls are doing that, they cannot go to school. As he rightly said, the knock-on effects on their lives are enormous. They are less likely to have healthy children and be protected from HIV, and it is very clear that girls who have gone to school have greater knowledge and capacity to influence what happens to their lives and bodies than girls who have not. In Africa, an estimated 5 per cent. of gross domestic product is lost to illnesses and deaths caused by dirty water and the absence of sanitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para20"><a name="07060543000107">Everyone recognises that that must change. That is why we have the millennium development goal for water and sanitation, which is to reduce by half the proportion of people without access to safe water supplies and basic sanitation by 2015. As we have heard, some countries are on target to meet that goal, but sub-Saharan Africa is really lagging behind on water and most of the developing world will miss out on sanitation. As the debate today has shown, the real challenge is to get governance right&#151;to get the right institutions and systems. That challenge will become much greater owing to rapid population growth and rising urbanisation. As the hon. Member for Stone reminded us, we went through exactly the same process in this country in the 19th century. It is now being replicated in the developing world, first in Asia and then in Africa. In the next 50 years, the majority of people will live in towns and cities, but where is the clean water supply and sanitation going to come from? How did it change here? Contributions from social reformers, such as Chadwick and John Snow, drew attention to it. They insisted that the hand be taken off the pump in Broad street, which proved finally that cholera is caused by contaminated water. Remember the Great Stink in the 19th century when this Parliament finally got the message when it had to stop sitting because of the stink in the River Thames.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para21"><a name="07060543000109">Several hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West, made the point that the real lesson is about political will. The question is why it took our nation so long to get the message that lack of clean water and sanitation had a terrible impact on people&#146;s lives. The question is exactly the same in the developing world. In the end, the national Governments in those countries have to get the message. With the best  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Jun 2007">

<notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2007 : Column 20WH</b><br>
will in the world, we cannot do it for people. Those Governments have to hear the message direct from their own electorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para22"><a name="07060543000110">Let me explain one of the challenges. The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness was right forcefully to make the point he did about the problem of diffuse responsibility. In almost every country, there is a national education Ministry and a national health Ministry, but no national Ministry with responsibility for water and sanitation. The issue is dealt with regionally and by local authorities&#151;it is dealt with at a very local level. The part that we play is that of helping those who do have the responsibility to get the message and to get on with the practical work of providing the water and sanitation required. That is why in every country there needs to be one national water and sanitation plan and one national group that co-ordinates action, bringing together Government, civil society, local authorities and donors to see what progress has been made and what the obstacles are and to agree on who will do what.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para23"><a name="07060543000111">What contribution can the United Kingdom make to all that? We have done a fair bit already, but we need to do a lot more. The hon. Member for Stone kindly referred to the commitment to double and then double again our investment in water and sanitation in Africa by 2011. Included in that are plans to support a &#163;100 million water and sanitation programme in Ethiopia and an &#163;82 million joint health, hygiene, water and sanitation programme in Sierra Leone, because all those things are connected. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West referred to work in Nigeria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para24"><a name="07060543000112">I have to tell the hon. Member for Stone that global aid for water and sanitation is increasing again, having declined because the world took its eye off the ball, just as&#151;we have to tell the truth&#151;the Governments of some developing countries took their eye off the ball and did not give the issue the priority that it deserved. With the global call for action that I published last November anticipating the call that the hon. Gentleman made for the issue to be discussed by the G8, we are already on the case. The world needs to get its act together in ensuring that the contribution that we make as donors is more effective in helping change to happen on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="70605h0003.htm_para25"><a name="07060543000113">That is why we want two things internationally. One is an annual report to monitor progress towards the MDG water and sanitation targets. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, the architect of the Bill that resulted in the very thick but, I have to say, very good DFID annual report. He and others have championed the argument that shining a better light of transparency on the work that all of us are doing helps to move the politics on, because when people can see what is or is not happening, they can say, when things are not working, &#147;Oi, what are you going to do about that?&#148;</p>

 Well, whether or not all the other member states want to make the issue a priority for this G8 meeting, I have hopes that next year, under the Japanese presidency of the G8, we will see further progress. I am trying to report to the hon. Gentleman on the progress that we have already made in raising the issue at the highest level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para0"><a name="07060543000118">We want an annual report and an annual global meeting. With the World Bank and the UN Development Programme, I organised a side meeting at this year&#146;s World Bank spring meetings. We secured agreement on the creation of an annual global monitoring report, which will be put together by UN Water. It is likely to focus on sanitation next year, because next year is the global year of sanitation. We secured agreement that there should be an annual meeting, not an additional meeting in the calendar, because we have enough meetings. We need fewer meetings and more action. However, we can piggyback an annual discussion on how we are doing on to one of the many meetings that already take place. The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness mentioned the UN. I was pleased that, at that meeting, Kemal Dervis said that, within each country, the UN would identify one of its organisations that would take lead responsibility for co-ordinating its efforts on water and sanitation. That is a big step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para1"><a name="07060543000119">On the EU water initiative, the truth is that the situation has been pretty mixed. We support it because we want it to work better. In some countries it has had an impact; in others it has not. I am particularly keen on the EU water facility, because there is a great thirst&#151;pardon the pun, Mr. Amess&#151;out there for funding for investment in water and sanitation, and that facility has been oversubscribed several times over. I would like the EU to put more funding into the facility in the long term, particularly if it will provide support to those who have the direct responsibility for providing clean water and putting in the pipes and sewerage systems that will be needed in the growing towns and cities of the developing world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para2"><a name="07060543000120">We need to do other things, such as help to build capacity at local level. We need to promote south-south lesson learning to help water suppliers to find out what works. I agree with the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness that output-based aid has a contribution to make. He is right, as are other hon. Members, to draw attention to the problem of cost recovery and maintenance. People have to be able to build a system, but they also have to be able to maintain it. Part of the problem in the developing world is that systems were put in but were not maintained and they have fallen apart. That is one reason why some standpipes do not work any more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para3"><a name="07060543000121">People have to think through how they will make the system work. That is why water operator partnerships, proposed by the UN Secretary-General&#146;s advisory board, are a good idea. We have funded workshops to promote that concept. We are helping utility managers to get together and share their experiences of what works. We will also fund lesson learning about reform of public provision, so that that experience can be shared. I pay tribute to the World Development Movement for having made a push on that front. I listened, as I said I would, and the activity that I have described should help utilities and partnerships to  <br>

replicate successes elsewhere. That is how we will bring more clean water to people and undercut the private water sellers, who, as the hon. Member for Stone rightly said, charge five to six times as much for the water that they provide in buckets and plastic bags.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para4"><a name="07060543000122">The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green talked about the PPIAF. That facility responds to requests from developing countries for assistance, which is a pretty good place to start. Let me give her one example of how it has worked successfully in the water sector. It has supported the Ghana community water and sanitation agency with regulatory and legal reform&#151;because this is about getting the structures right&#151;to help the people there to improve small-town water services. That has allowed local water operators to provide clean water to communities for the first time. The communities themselves were involved in selecting the providers. The scheme has been successfully implemented in three towns, and Ghana wants to extend it to 300 small towns across the country. I will happily write to the hon. Lady with more information. The PPIAF makes a contribution, but it is not the only thing that we are doing. We should try all approaches to see whether they work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para5"><a name="07060543000123">On the broader question of public versus private, we have largely moved beyond that pretty sterile debate. As the report of the Select Committee on International Development says,</p>
<a name="70605h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07060543000367"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Simplistic public versus private debates miss the point&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para6"><a name="07060543000124">The question to ask is: what will work successfully?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para7"><a name="07060543000125">On sanitation, I thought that the Committee was a little unfair. After all, which country did most to get the sanitation target agreed at the 2002 world summit? The answer is the United Kingdom. Also, as hon. Members will be aware, we are funding in India a very big programme with UNICEF, implementing state programmes on sanitation that aim to reach 213 million people. We have school sanitation programmes in Malawi, Nigeria, Kenya, Pakistan and Bangladesh, including some small projects. We are supporting the community-led total sanitation programme in Bangladesh and helping it to spread throughout Asia. That is a cracking programme, because there is no embarrassment there. The people involved use very direct methods, walking round villages with whistles, shouting at people and saying, &#147;We&#146;re not going to have open defecation in our village,&#148; which in the end is how people begin to change attitudes. Then cheap pit latrines are provided. Communities taking responsibility will make a big difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para8"><a name="07060543000126">On water resource management, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green raised a very important question: what will the world do when people start fighting not about national identity and political ideology, but over water? Working to support countries to manage their water resources, as we are doing with the Nile basin initiative is therefore very important, not least because of the competing demands for water, especially from agriculture, which accounts for 80 per cent. of the world&#146;s water consumption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para9"><a name="07060543000127">This has been an excellent debate. I am very grateful to the hon.

It is political will that will change the situation, and that is just as true in the developing world.</p>

 It gives me great pleasure to introduce this debate today. It will not only draw attention to the important issue of maintaining balanced communities in our university cities, but it will recognise the fact that we now have a new all-party group that lobbies for small but important changes in legislation on housing and neighbourhood management to bring balanced communities into being. The debate will include consideration of what has come to be termed &#147;studentification&#148; and issues arising from a high concentration of students living in a particular area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para10"><a name="07060543000129">I wish to stress at the outset that the debate goes wider than that to encompass private renting more generally and the need to have balanced communities where there are households of different types. The desirability of that is reflected in the Government&#146;s revised planning policy statement 3, which states that one of</p>
<a name="70605h0004.htm_brev1"><a name="07060543000368"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the specific outcomes that the planning system should deliver&#148;</p>

<a name="70605h0004.htm_brev2"><a name="07060543000369"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A mix of housing, both market and affordable, particularly in terms of tenure and price, to support a wide variety of households in all areas, both urban and rural.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para12"><a name="07060543000131">That sets a framework that we wish to see applied locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para13"><a name="07060543000132">I hope that my hon. Friends and other members of the all-party group will agree that we do not wish to demonstrate or to whip up anti-student sentiment. Our aim is quite the reverse. We value the life, vitality and talent that students and universities bring to our areas. Indeed, it is because we want a strong town-gown relationship to flourish that we think that the Government need to look again at the housing and planning legislative framework on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para14"><a name="07060543000133">To that end, I am pleased to welcome a recent report from the National Union of Students, which is titled &#147;Students in the Community Working Together to Achieve Harmony&#148;. The report is helpful in a number of ways. It highlights the positive impacts that students can have in their communities through participation in community activities and voluntary action, although it recognises that a small minority of students cause problems, particularly those of noise nuisance, disrespect for local residents and, on the odd occasion, antisocial behaviour. The overall flavour of the report rightly emphasises the positive contribution that students can make in an area, and it is right to assert that many of the issues thrown up by studentification emerge because of the poor behaviour of landlords, poor communication and poor management, rather than because of student behaviour per se.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para15"><a name="07060543000134">I might like to have a debate with the NUS on limiting the number of houses in multiple occupation in a particular area, which it argues is not a way forward. It argues that we should concentrate on accreditation to regulate landlords and make use of existing legislation on HMO licensing, the housing health and safety rating system, environmental protection, pub licensing and so on. I agree with that and I have some sympathy with the view that applying limits on HMOs in a defined area might be difficult.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Jun 2007">

<notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2007 : Column 24WH</b><br>
Indeed, it might not tackle the problems at all because many student houses are private rented dwellings and, for licensing purposes, fall outside the definition of an HMO both in planning law and in the Housing Act 2004. If we are to support more harmonious and balanced communities, we will need to change the legislation. It might be that only a small change is needed, but it is important to do so to address some of the issues that we face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para16"><a name="07060543000135">At present, the planning law definition of an HMO requires a change of use class when a property houses more than six people not in a single household. That is not the same definition as that used in the 2004 Act, under which HMOs are subject to mandatory licensing. An HMO that is subject to mandatory licensing is defined by the Act as a house of which any part comprises three storeys or more and is occupied by five persons or more forming two or more households. Mandatory licensing means that a house would have to meet minimum standards on the number of bathrooms, provision of cookery and laundry facilities, and so on. Crucially, the local authority would need to be satisfied that the dwelling is managed by a person who is fit and competent to do so. Indeed, the local authority is required to give support to that end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para17"><a name="07060543000136">An already complicated situation is complicated further because local authorities have other types of licensing available. The Act allows additional licensing, so authorities can choose to introduce licensing of other types of HMOs that are not subject to mandatory licensing, but they must consult local landlords before so doing. They may also introduce another type, known as selective licensing, in areas where there is low demand or significant antisocial behaviour. In such areas, the houses do not have to be HMOs. Already, we have quite a confused situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para18"><a name="07060543000137">I wrote to the Minister last May and asked whether the Department for Communities and Local Government had any plans to bring in a uniform definition in housing and planning law. My letter acknowledged that planning law only applied to HMOs in use classes, so it was disappointing to get a lengthy reply that pointed that out to me, but which did not actually deal with the issue that I raised, which was the need to align housing and planning law on such matters in order to simplify it. I am having another go and today I ask the Minister to look at the issue again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para19"><a name="07060543000138">I have received no sensible explanation as to why anyone planning to shift a house from the category of single-family dwelling to that of multi-household dwelling should have to get planning permission only if there are more than six people living in house and not as a single household. My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) outlined the matter in the excellent ten-minute Bill he introduced to the House on 22 May which, I hope, he will have the opportunity to talk about later. The Bill deals with the point that the current definition simply excludes most households in multiple occupation in our communities. He suggests that the threshold for change of use should be triggered by more than four people living in a house not as a single household, rather than the current six people. That would have the advantage of being roughly but not exactly the same as the   <br>

<notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2007 : Column 25WH</b><br>
mandatory licensing category in housing law, and it would undoubtedly be a step in the right direction. Indeed, there might be an argument for lowering the threshold further by employing a definition for HMOs to be applied to houses of three or more people, but that is an matter for discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para20"><a name="07060543000139">A better or additional way forward might be for all private rented dwellings of more than one household to be subject to mandatory licensing, especially because it appears that non-mandatory schemes are not being used as extensively as they could be by local authorities. That way, a change in planning regulations covering use classes may be useful as a limiting mechanism and may deal with land use issues, rather than being a proxy tracking system for HMO concentration&#151;it is often relied upon for that at present, especially as regarding larger households.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para21"><a name="07060543000140">It is necessary to ensure that licensing and planning deal with the ramifications for a community of having too many HMOs in one area. In such areas, there are a lot of to-let boards at certain times. There might be poor physical upkeep of properties, or unsightly extensions. The point is that that can apply to small houses in multiple occupation as well as to larger houses. All need to be subject to regulation, but regulation and proper management of individual properties will not necessarily tackle urban blight, which leaves many streets abandoned for parts of the year. I should emphasise that that is not good for students, because there is additional crime risk in those areas, especially if students have left their belongings in a house over a vacation. Also, it is often very unpleasant for the few residents who are left living in such areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para22"><a name="07060543000141">We come back to the question of limits. If use class regulations were changed, it might be possible to exercise greater control over numbers in a given area. However, cities such as Glasgow have experimented with placing limits on the number of HMOs in an area. At the very least, the Government should seek an evaluation of such schemes, including a full evaluation of how the general issue of limiting the concentration of private renting is dealt with in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para23"><a name="07060543000142">I am requesting a step up in mandatory licensing, so that all local authorities and other agencies can track changes in neighbourhoods before the adverse effects of an over-concentration of HMOs manifest themselves in problems with parking, noise and so on. Tracking changes in private renting, particularly multiple households, could also flag up emerging issues, such as the need for more affordable housing where exiting stock goes over to non-family rented housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para24"><a name="07060543000143">The fact that such things creep up on local authorities is obvious in my constituency. Ten years ago, for example, we had two estates&#151;Gilesgate and Whinney Hill&#151;in the city centre, which offered good-quality, family, social rented housing. They were bought by tenants and then sold to landlords, who rented them to students and others. We now have not only a shortage of affordable housing, but changing neighbourhoods that no one has planned for, where no proper management exists and where change was not obvious until problems emerged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para25"><a name="07060543000144">The university, local residents and the students union are working hard to establish positive relationships, and the university has, to its credit, appointed a  <br>

community liaison officer. Had the area been subject to mandatory licensing, however, good management arrangements could have been implemented many years ago, and the council could have delivered earlier on its affordable housing policy. As things stand, it has not done so for a number of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para26"><a name="07060543000145">The Government have a golden opportunity to address such issues now through the local development frameworks that all local authorities are putting together to cover their local plans. Those frameworks should be made to include provisions on the concentration of HMOs and private renting in particular areas. Planning legislation is also in the pipeline, which could definitely deal with the change in use class.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para27"><a name="07060543000146">Let me turn next to a recent report on this topic by Universities UK, which does two things. First, the fact that such a report was produced at all last year confirms the importance of this issue to the university sector, particularly as the sector responds positively to the Government&#146;s widening participation agenda. Secondly, the report points to the need to support effective management and the integration of students into local communities. It outlines many examples of good practice, including the use of liaison officers, as I suggested, dedicated local authority support and sensible licensing. It also suggests encouraging students to participate in volunteering schemes and to attend residents meetings and encouraging universities to have an effective complaints system. Those are sensible measures, and the all-party group wants to share such good practice across all areas that have to deal with such problems. It is important to stress again that the focus should be on HMOs and private renting, not specifically on students. As we know, many students are not only hard-working, but good citizens and good neighbours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para28"><a name="07060543000147">Let me conclude by returning to the issue at the heart of this agenda: the need for balanced communities. That is what we are trying to achieve. Many city centres have lost too much family housing, and that has a negative impact on schools and shops, many of which are now under threat. That threat has arisen not only because of student housing, but because of the recent building of too many apartments, which are bought for investment and left empty or privately rented. Such properties are just as much of a problem as HMOs in terms of imbalance. I suspect that other areas also have a glut of them and I want the Government to give serious consideration to the incentives that can be put in place to encourage the market to return some of those houses and flats, which are currently let multiply, to single family accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="70605h0004.htm_para29"><a name="07060543000148">Balanced communities help everyone, including students, particularly given that many stay on beyond their period of study and therefore form part of the community. All communities need good services, open green spaces, good public transport and good local amenities and facilities, and we need to be in a position to plan for such things, rather than simply responding when things go wrong.</p>

inaugurating the all-party group. For those of us with university campuses in our constituencies, the issue that she raises is a particular problem, and it has increased over the years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para0"><a name="07060543000150">The world-renowned Brunel university is situated in my constituency. Indeed, I remember the time before the university was there, because I live in the same street where I grew up, and I remember walking around the disused dahlia nursery. I have therefore seen the university grow up, and we have always been immensely proud of the fact that it is situated in Uxbridge. Personally, I think it is a shame that it was not called Uxbridge university, because we could not only have got Uxbridge on the map, but could have got money from American donors who did not get the vowels quite right and thought that they would be making a massive donation to Oxbridge. However, that is the commercial side of me coming up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para1"><a name="07060543000151">For many years, Brunel existed almost literally in my back garden, so I should declare an interest as a local resident, as well as the constituency Member of Parliament. For many years, it has also been regarded as an asset to the local area, although it has been somewhat isolated as a campus university. Its impact did not really filter through into the town of Uxbridge, and the students kept themselves to themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para2"><a name="07060543000152">Over the past few years, however, there has been a massive expansion, as the university has sold off some of its other campuses around London and moved on to the Uxbridge site. That is quite exiting, and there are some wonderful sports facilities there; indeed, there is an excellent sports hall, where I was declared the local Member of Parliament for the first time about 10 years ago, in 1997. Brunel is therefore also close to me politically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para3"><a name="07060543000153">However, the university has brought problems, as the hon. Lady said, and I am sure that other hon. Members will say the same. Those problems have come to a head lately and almost led to confrontation between residents and the university, which is of course regrettable, because confrontation is the last thing that we want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para4"><a name="07060543000154">The first and most obvious form of annoyance for many local residents is parking, although the Minister will be delighted to hear that that is well outside the Government&#146;s remit. Uxbridge had pretty good public transport links, but changes have happened for a variety of reasons, and students will not necessarily live on campus, but in private rented accommodation or at home. When I was a student in London, there was no need for a car&#151;I did not want one and I doubt whether any of my fellow students had one&#151;but things seem to have changed, and there is now a huge parking problem. Of course, residential areas in suburbia have parking problems anyway. One morning, after Brunel decided that it would not let students park in the university grounds any more, we found roads blocked. Buses could not get down them. At that time the university said that it was the local authority&#146;s problem, and the local authority said that Brunel was causing it, but it was the local residents and the poor old bus drivers who suffered. That did not do a great deal for good relations.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2007 : Column 28WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para5"><a name="07060543000155">Over the years we have gone through periods in which the university has taken a more confrontational view of its relations with the local authority and residents. I am pleased to say that we are currently going through a good patch. That is indicated by the minutes of a meeting&#151;I have the minutes, because I could not attend&#151;held on 2 May. The pro-vice-chancellor of Brunel university, Professor Linda Thomas, is in charge of external relations, having taken over from Professor Steve Hodkinson, and a lot of effort is made to work with the local community and get everyone on side. The former vice-chancellor, Professor Steven Schwartz&#151;who may be known to hon. Members, as I think he helped out the Government with some advice&#151;was, I should say, an interesting character, who believed in getting things done in his own way. As we in this House are all consensual in our approach and never resort to anything but debate and good argument to get our ideas through, that came as a bit of a shock to those of us who were more used to a non-American or non-Australian&#151;I do not know which Professor Schwartz claims to be&#151;approach. He is a very interesting man with many good ideas, but I think that he saw people like the residents and me as standing in the way of progress. That era has gone, however, and I hope that we are now in a better period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para6"><a name="07060543000156">The parking problem is quite severe. As many hon. Members know, I was once described as a Dickensian mill owner, and at Christmas, I go to see retired members of staff, to give them Christmas cheer. I found one man, the widower of someone who used to work for us, who wanted to get his guttering fixed, but could not get anything done in his street because none of the local tradesmen could park there. Such problems happen regularly, if not daily, which causes great annoyance. Gradually some problems are being looked at. We now have a parking regime, which again causes a little annoyance, because there never used to be one, and we are all pretty dyed in the wool in Uxbridge&#151;we do not like change. However, that has to be considered. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para7"><a name="07060543000157">Another problem occurs when students park their cars all term. They do not make much use of them but park them so that they block streets. There has been some bad parking, too, so that people&#146;s drives are blocked, and so on. However, the university has been helpful, and if incidents are reported, it takes action. I think that the key to handling many of the problems is ensuring that there are good communications between the residents, the local authority and the university.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para8"><a name="07060543000158">Houses in multiple occupation are another major problem, which the hon. Member for City of Durham mentioned and which I am sure will be mentioned again&#151;I notice, in fact, that there is a half-hour Westminster Hall debate on it this afternoon. There are a variety of effects, such as the pushing up of prices in the private rented sector. We do not have enough private rented accommodation for those who need it, because there is not enough social housing around. That is obviously good for landlords, but it is not particularly helpful. Communities with a sense of having been established in a place for a long time see it as a problem when quite a large number of transient people move in, with, probably, a slightly different view of the hours of operation of their social lives. I was of course a model student&#151;or I think that that is what I  <br>

was told. What worries me a great deal is that students are blamed for much more than they are really to blame for, because they are an easy target. There is antisocial behaviour, and students are often blamed for it, when, I am pretty certain, it is not students who are responsible. They may be sitting at home making a bit of noise, but they are certainly not out on the streets causing some of the problems that we have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para9"><a name="07060543000159">The things that I have described are causing people concern. Things have now got to the stage of confrontation. I said that the local authority had organised a positive meeting. Today I received an e-mail from the local residents group, complaining about the university. I shall not go through it, but it involves a planning issue that will have to be dealt with. Much of what the group says is true: the university destroyed an old hedge a couple of years ago, without planning permission, and built on the site. I remember that because I took the matter up and was escorted off the premises by security for daring to photograph what was happening. Also, promises that are made are not always kept. There is a feeling, which I want to make public, that such large institutions must do more than be seen to keep, like everyone else, to the letter of the law on these matters. They should go beyond it, and, to use the current buzz word, be beacons of good behaviour and practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para10"><a name="07060543000160">Nevertheless, the university provides concerts and culture and all sorts of things for local residents, who do not know about much of what is available to them. I think that is a shame. I suggested a few years ago that a friends of Brunel group should be set up, so that residents could be kept in touch with what was happening on campus, and enjoy it more. The local papers could play more of a role, because little information about what is happening in the university appears in them. As I mentioned, a lot of sport is played at the university, and some of its teams do extremely well. A Brunel team was in the netball premiership, and became so popular that it had to move away and play elsewhere to accommodate more spectators. We should be proud of that. There is still a great desire among residents of Uxbridge and the surrounding area to be proud of Brunel.</p>

has now moved on so much that I now have to add that my daughter is a student and will be living in a shared student house next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para13"><a name="07060543000164">The problem on which I want to concentrate is straightforward and simple and does not involve any objection to students per se. It is the reality that, if there are areas in which the concentration of student housing is very great, there cannot be a balanced and sustainable community. If the great majority of the population changes from one year to the next, the number of settled, long-term residents is too few to sustain, try as people will, the community organisations and sense of neighbourhood&#151;the social capital, as it is called in the academic jargon&#151;that make our communities work. Now that the Department in which my hon. Friend the Minister works is called the Department for Communities and Local Government, it has the responsibility to grasp the nettle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para14"><a name="07060543000165">In my 1992 debate, I called for a change to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, which would have brought houses in multiple occupation into the planning regime. That route, and the route advocated by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead), remain the way forward. HMOs have to be brought within the planning regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para15"><a name="07060543000166">There has been significant improvement in the responses of many authorities in the past 15 years. At a conference of university accommodation officers, 15 years ago, I was told that, if local people did not like having students in their area, they should move out. However, that has not been the attitude of either of the universities in Southampton in the past few years. Within their powers, they treat this issue responsibly, as do the student unions. Liaison between local residents and students and the local night-time economy have improved vastly in the main areas of Southampton that are inhabited by students, so there have been real improvements through people working well together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para16"><a name="07060543000167">Of course, it is the antisocial behaviour of only a minority of students that causes the most extreme problems, but the sheer numbers living in a single area make it impossible to have a strong and vibrant community there. None of the relevant agencies can deal with this matter unless there are planning powers to constrain the spread of HMOs and thus send signals to the housing market that will encourage families back into those areas, over time, to turn rented houses back into family homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para17"><a name="07060543000168">This issue is not just about students. The great majority of the perhaps 750,000 new migrants from eastern Europe who have moved to this country in the past few years will not have been in a position to buy their own homes or to rent self-contained accommodation. Most of them have been accommodated in HMOs, most of which, I think, although I cannot prove it, have been newly converted from family homes in the buy-to-rent market. I do not make a case for the wider benefits, but also costs, of that migration; this issue is changing the nature of the communities in which people live, and it is a major planning issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para18"><a name="07060543000169">My hon. Friend the Minister might find, in the notes that have helpfully been provided to him by his civil servants, this comment:</p>

nature of the use of the land which is relevant. Land use is not about social, ethical or moral issues: the age, occupation or social background of residents whether they be students or anyone else, are not material planning considerations.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 23 November 1992; Vol. 214, c. 719.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para19"><a name="07060543000170">I say, in friendship to the Minister, that if he has those words, they did not sound any better in the mouth of the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry), who was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment in 1992, than they would today, although he would deliver them perfectly. It is nonsense to say that the change in character of a neighbourhood by a wholesale shift from family housing to shared rented housing, whether by students, migrant workers or whoever, is not a material planning consideration. If we are interested in communities, those are indeed material planning considerations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para20"><a name="07060543000171">My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham mentioned the high proportion of flats and the redevelopment of family housing for flats as examples of the changes affecting this issue. Such changes are altering the nature of many urban areas in a way that leaves local people feeling that they do not have a stake or a say in what is going on. I ask the Minister to reflect on the fact that, although Southampton&#146;s population is estimated by the council to be 225,000&#151;about 30,000 more than at the time of my last Adjournment debate on this issue&#151;the city is closing two secondary schools because there are not enough pupils. That shows the scale of the changes in the fabric and nature of not only my city and the city of Durham, but the many other towns and cities in the country with significant new populations or expanding student populations. We have to get a grip on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para21"><a name="07060543000172">In 1992, I aspired to a limit of 10 to 20 per cent. on family homes being converted to HMOs in particular areas. Now, there are several streets in my constituency on which one would be hard pressed to find 10 per cent., let alone 20 per cent., of family housing. All the rest has been lost, and the trend continues. The Government must accept that such a change in the character of a neighbourhood is a planning issue. They have to accept that local authorities must have legal powers to set limits, in their local development plans and policies, on the spread of HMOs in particular areas of towns and cities. That will allow, in the areas in which change has been over-concentrated, an inevitably slow and gradual movement of properties back into the family sector as houses come on to the market, so that we can achieve a wider spread.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para22"><a name="07060543000173">Ministers in previous Conservative Administrations and, I am afraid, in my own Government, have repeatedly made two arguments, the first of which is that these issues are not proper planning issues. Without labouring the point, I hope that I have set out why they are planning issues: they affect the nature of our communities and where we live, and they affect the people whom we represent. If planning is not about issues that affect communities, where people live and the nature of the communities in which they live, then I do not know what it is for. These are planning issues, whatever some planning lawyers say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para23"><a name="07060543000174">The second argument that I have come up against is that, if local authorities had such powers, they would  <br>

use them irresponsibly and say, &#147;We don&#146;t want to accommodate these people, so we&#146;ll send them to the next borough.&#148; But the Minister knows that the overall planning system requires local authorities to come up with plans, whether they be to provide new or affordable housing, that meet certain national criteria as local criteria. If a local authority produced a plan that simply said, &#147;We are not having them here,&#148; it would properly be struck down by an inspector at the local inquiry that always takes place. There is no substantive reason why such a change in planning law cannot be brought about.</p>

This problem has been around for far too long, and it should have been addressed much earlier, when the difficulties were becoming evident. Already, it will be a long job to bring balance back to some communities, but we can do enough to ensure that communities remain balanced in the areas that are coming under pressure and restore the balance of others over time.</p>

Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), I have a long interest in this matter, not as a Member of Parliament, but as a local councillor. I was first elected in 1993 to the then Avon county council for Cabot ward. That is the ward for Bristol city centre, which includes the university of Bristol precinct and the residential areas of Kingsdown and Cotham, which have high concentrations of student housing. I have been grappling with the question of how a university and a residential community can coexist in harmony, as well as considering the other pressures created by such institutions around the city centre. I have been the MP for Bristol, West for the past two years, and my constituency probably includes one of the highest student populations in the country. There have been various estimates, but at least 15,000 students from the universities of Bristol and of the West of England live in my constituency.</p>

Last Friday, I went to speak to the university of Bristol council working group on town and gown issues with the author of the report, Dr. Darren Smith from the university of Brighton, to flesh out some of the issues that affect my constituents. I shall share with colleagues one anecdote that I gave at that meeting to illustrate a point.</p>

Facebook group on it. Through that group, I got an invitation to a post-exam party, which I am sure was sent to many hundreds of students as well. It will take place in the High Kingsdown estate&#151;I shall not say the exact address, just in case anybody might want to turn up&#151;quite near where I live. It is scheduled to start at 7 pm and finish at 11 am the next day, or until the neighbours complain. Anybody can have a party&#151;one does not have to be a student to do so&#151;but that illustrates some of the effects on neighbours of a high concentration of students.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para28"><a name="07060543000180">The nature of the High Kingsdown estate leads on to a wider point, however. When it was built in the 1970s, it won awards as model family housing. It featured three and four-bedroomed houses, each with a walled garden, pedestrian access and a garage on the edge of the estate. It was model planning, and one of the few architectural successes that we can name from the 1970s. When I was first elected as a councillor in 1993, the estate was almost entirely inhabited by families, who sent their children to the local school. The associated block of two and three-bedroomed flats, which was also part of the estate, was largely occupied by families as well. Some 14 years on, the situation is quite different: the block of flats more or less resembles a university hall of residence, and of the 101 houses, almost half are occupied as houses in multiple occupation. They are not all occupied by students; some of the occupants are young professional people living together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para29"><a name="07060543000181">There is clearly an effect on the wider community, and not only on the school. The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) mentioned parking; the garages that were meant for family houses are now sometimes let out separately from the houses. Bristol perhaps has more affluent students than some other universities, and many of them bring their cars to the city. They do not park in the garages but in the neighbouring streets, which contributes to the congestion in the area. Those are just some of the problems that have manifested themselves as a result of the multiple occupancy of houses and flats that were meant for families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="70605h0005.htm_para30"><a name="07060543000182">I am pleased to support the comments of the hon. Member for City of Durham about multiple occupancy houses. I also agree with what the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) said during the debate on his ten-minute Bill the week before last. Like the hon. Member for City of Durham, I think that there is scope for lowering the six-person limit of HMOs, particularly in the case of flats. A two-bedroomed flat, which is quite obviously designed for a couple, perhaps with a child, might now be occupied by three or four people. The limit for flats&#151;it could be related to the number of bedrooms&#151;should be brought down.</p>

When I was a councillor, the biggest issue of social change that I had to cope with was the proliferation in the area of bars and nightclubs to serve the new, younger, transient population. At that time, planning use class A3 encompassed everything from a caf&#233; to a nightclub, so once somebody had planning permission for a caf&#233;, they could convert it  <br>

over time to a pub that was entirely different from the kind of place for which they had received the original permission. Owing to a long campaign by residents in Bristol and other cities throughout the country, there is now a class A4, to separate caf&#233;s, restaurants and bars. That is an interesting precedent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para1"><a name="07060543000184">It would be better if the Government were to trust local authorities to stratify the use classes themselves. The right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen said that central Government might not trust local government to do the right thing. We should devolve such issues to local authorities. Stratification might not be appropriate in many parts of the country, but it certainly would be in urban areas, and local government should have the power to stratify within the broad parameters of the use classes set by Parliament. Bristol city council, which was under Liberal Democrat leadership until a week ago, has set up a working group to consider town and gown issues and to appoint a dedicated officer. We have taken the initiative locally and have been working with the university on that front.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para2"><a name="07060543000185">The hon. Member for City of Durham made the point, which we need to emphasise, that this is in no way an anti-student discussion. Like the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen, I am a Bristol university graduate, and I lived in a shared flat in my third year. My constituency is full of similar people who originally came to the university but decided to settle in their adopted city. They have made it their home, and made it the vibrant place that it is. It is hard to imagine Bristol without either of its universities. The students make an enormously positive contribution to city life, through their charitable work, for instance. Through student community action, thousands of hours of community work are done in the city, which is probably largely unnoticed by the permanent population.</p>

housing types and arrangements can co-exist and contribute positively, rather than negatively as is often the case at present, to the working of cities and towns. HMOs are a necessary part of the landscape not only for students, but for young single people and people in transient occupations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para5"><a name="07060543000189">The irony is that we have an enormous amount of planning guidance about how towns and cities should arrange their domestic and commercial properties and links, and a number of desiderata about how that should be done when various things in those towns and cities are built, but after they have been built, the guidance effectively stops in terms of the traction of those towns and cities to do anything about maintaining balanced and sustainable ways of deploying land use and housing. As hon. Members have mentioned, that is because planning law in no way recognises different uses within the general class of a domestic dwelling. The plain fact is that over time the different uses make an enormous difference to how cities and towns work. I heartily endorse the plea that has been entered this morning. It is important for the future of balanced and sustainable communities that that reality is recognised in the planning system.</p>

I cannot offer paragraphs from quite such a long time ago, but I wonder whether the Minister has the following paragraph in his folder. It comes from a letter that was sent by the then Minister for Housing and Planning, my right hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Keith Hill), to my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson). It stated:</p>
<a name="70605h0006.htm_brev0"><a name="07060543000372"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Buildings which form houses in multiple occupation...will generally remain outside the scope of the order. Therefore, as a general rule, planning permission will usually be needed before a dwelling house can undergo a change of use to an HMO, otherwise this would be a breach of planning control...The essential element in determining whether a particular premises is an HMO is whether or not there is a single household occupying it. However, where there are seven or more occupants living together in a single household, but not living as a family, this could also be classified as an HMO.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para7"><a name="07060543000191">The curious truth about that statement is that it sets out how things are as far as planning is concerned, but it is diametrically opposed to what happens on the ground. As the test in planning law relates to whether a single household lives in an HMO&#151;indeed, courts have made decisions on that matter&#151;where a house is purchased, without any change having taken place, and it is then inhabited by up to seven people, the local authority cannot go anywhere near that house in terms of any sort of regulation. There are some exceptions to that, and I shall come to them in a moment.</p>

household definition. Most HMOs simply escape any planning regulation. The desiderata in the planning guidance are simply useless as far as those changes of use are concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para10"><a name="07060543000194">The Housing Act 2004 changed the definition of a household as far as the licensing of HMOs was concerned. The definition included people who are living under one roof but are not related to each other. A series of well drafted and well worked out definitions were placed into that housing legislation, which now enables local authorities to undertake a registration and licensing scheme for houses that are already in such a position. The scheme can include those people who are living in an unconverted house apparently, according to planning law, as one household.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para11"><a name="07060543000195">What is interesting is that even the 2005 letter that I mentioned accepts that, if numbers go above a certain level, that would be a material factor as far as a change of use is concerned. Again, as hon. Members have mentioned, that is a long way from the reality of the effect that HMOs have on any district or area. Saying that situations where seven or more people are involved should come to the notice of the planning authority, whereas those involving fewer than seven people should not, means that 10 per cent. or less of HMOs are subject to the planning regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para12"><a name="07060543000196">What is important is that planning law recognises that as a principle. In respect of my recent ten-minute Bill, I have suggested that if the argument is sound for seven people, it ought to be sound for numbers below that in situations where a demonstrable change of planning use has occurred. It may not be arguable in planning law that every single change of use makes a difference, but it is probably clear to all right hon. and hon. Members present that when a small number of people move into an HMO, which could happen for all the reasons that have been outlined, there is a considerable difference in how that HMO affects other houses in the street, the neighbourhood and the community generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para13"><a name="07060543000197">That is particularly the case where there is an accumulation of HMOs. I have recently mentioned that, in one Southampton street, 49 out of 56 family houses are now HMOs. That accumulation clearly makes a great difference in planning terms, even if the number of individuals in each of those houses is fewer than seven. A distinction can clearly be made, without even changing the nature of the use class orders, simply by reducing the number of people who are defined as making a change in land use terms as far as an HMO is concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para14"><a name="07060543000198">It would be ideal to change the housing use class orders. That has been done in Northern Ireland, although it was done on the basis of previous legislation that defined an HMO. It might be difficult to introduce such an approach into legislation in England and Wales, in which case perhaps the far simpler route of introducing a reduction in respect of numbers and a definition of a family&#151;an accurate definition is contained in the 2004 Act&#151;into how an existing use class order works would be an appropriate way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para15"><a name="07060543000199">We must recognise one way or another&#151;either by changing the use class order or by redefining it so that it bites as far as planning is concerned&#151;that there are different kinds of domestic dwellings and that who  <br>

occupies them is a matter not of indifference for the planning system but of important concern for it. It is important to make changes that recognise that and give local authorities the ability to appraise those changes of use when they come up. The system that we have put in place of registering and licensing HMOs is potentially important, but in a sense, it is systematically registering stables after the horses have bolted. It is important for the quality of the stables and for the horses&#151;a bad metaphor that I should not go any further with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para16"><a name="07060543000200">Nevertheless, the system does not gain any traction on the process by which those houses have become HMOs in the first place. The numbers that the housing legislation sets out are five and three storeys. In Committee, assurances were given that those numbers of storeys would be reviewed on the basis of the way in which the licensing worked. Obviously, the legislation is in its early stages, but I hope that it will be kept under review. My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham said that a more comprehensive licensing system that did not put a distinction on storeys, whereby local authorities would not have to apply to the Secretary of State for permission to make a more general licensing system over and above the statutory system, might be an appropriate development in parallel with the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para17"><a name="07060543000201">The important point is to try to ensure that those two areas of legislation are compatible, so that local authorities can regulate the way in which the environment develops and the changes are made. I hope that the changes will be considered. They are long overdue, and they could be considered on the basis of an hour&#146;s discussion in a room on an upstairs corridor in the House. Neither primary nor extensive legislation would be required. Relatively few words on a piece of paper, regulating the way in which HMOs might work differently over a period, would have an enormous effect on the way in which our communities might develop on a balanced, sustainable and harmonious basis.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) on securing the debate.

She made it clear that the issue is about not just HMOs and students, but HMOs and other users, and we must establish the fact that on this issue, we are not uniting against students, because as other Members have said, we welcome the skills that they bring to communities and the investment that universities bring.</p>

encourage students to stay on once they have finished their studies, and we heard how Members did so themselves. If we want universities to come to our area, we must address the issues; we cannot stand against them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para20"><a name="07060543000205">We heard the hon. Lady discuss the tools that are available. When we write to Ministers and their colleagues, we are all familiar with the reply that the tools already exist, that local authorities should consider their powers and use them more effectively and that there are better ways of dealing with the problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para21"><a name="07060543000206">We must focus on use classes, which are at the heart of the debate and the restoration of local people&#146;s confidence in the planning system&#146;s ability to plan for a sustainable and balanced community. We heard about the different definitions in planning law and housing law, and my party welcomes the tightening of HMO regulation on the housing side to ensure both that we provide decent accommodation for people and that unscrupulous landlords cannot get away with providing inadequate accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para22"><a name="07060543000207">Drawing the two areas together would help to simplify the process. During the introduction of greater HMO regulation, we heard complaints from landlords organisations, and a unification of planning and housing guidelines would help to simplify the situation. It would send out a clear message about the way in which we as a society would like to deal with the issues. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para24"><a name="07060543000209">The hon. Member for City of Durham was also keen to stress the positive role that the National Union of Students can play in acknowledging and dealing with the issues. It is in the interests of its members&#151;the students&#151;that the services they need are in the community. The services cannot exist if the area&#146;s population falls dramatically during recess. We cannot develop any infrastructure there.</p>

Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) moved bravely into the area of parking, and we could have had a lengthy debate about the issue, but I am glad that consideration is being given to it in Uxbridge. The hon. Gentleman and other Members, including the hon. Member for City of Durham, stressed the need for strong relations and open communication between the local community and the representative bodies&#151;local government, residents organisations and so on&#151;and the academic institutions.</p>

Luton and worked for only about 10 minutes&#151;fortunately, from my point of view&#151;on the conveyor belt separating the materials that come through the facility. It was wonderful to see the contribution that its workers make to the community in Luton, and to hear from the company what model employees they are. I could not help but wonder about their housing issues, but I did not have time to explore them. I am sure that I would have heard some positive stories, and some negative stories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para27"><a name="07060543000212">The right hon. Gentleman also referred to school closures. We should consider health facilities, shops and community facilities, too. In any area where the balance is tilted in favour of one group in the population, all such facilities are going to be under threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para28"><a name="07060543000213">My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams) outlined his work over several years as a councillor and as a Member of Parliament. He has been assiduous in that work, and I pay tribute to him. He discussed the suitability of housing, and the model estate of High Kingsdown, where family housing has been designed. Owing to studentification, the most appropriate housing for families had been taken away from that sector of the community. Equally, however, the issue is about whether such housing is appropriate for the needs of students. Do students get the best deal on housing? If we do not want them all crammed into HMOs in particular areas, we must look at what we offer them as an alternative. It is another key question, to which I am sure the Minister will want to return when we consider planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para29"><a name="07060543000214">My hon. Friend also raised the pertinent example of the way in which a change in use class orders has led to progress on a particular issue: the difference with licensed premises. It is a good example for the Government to pick up on. The hon. Member for Southampton, Test again highlighted the gap between HMO planning theory and community reality, and there was consensus in the Chamber about the need to consider the way in which use class orders can be changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para30"><a name="07060543000215">As a constituency Member, I am affected by the second homes issue, and I am delighted that the hon. Member for City of Durham and her colleagues have set up a group to consider balanced and sustainable communities, because there is a chance for those of us who have been working on the second homes issue to contribute to the debate. My hon. Friends and I have been arguing for many years that a change in use class orders would allow second homes to be classified differently, and we could consider the issue of ghost towns in our coastal communities, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para31"><a name="07060543000216">I should also like to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), who is a member of the all-party group, too. He has drawn to my attention the fact that there have been good student relationships in Bath and that, just as in Bristol, the local authority has established a body to deal with that. However, my hon. Friend has been saddened by the fact that the minority Conservative administration has decided to end that and to stop the progress being made, which is obviously a retrograde step.</p>

One issue that he raised in replying to a point that I had made about second homes is that there is real scope for looking at what tools local authorities and local communities need to meet local problems. I hope that, through the progress of the Bill, we will start to get some of those tools and to empower local authorities and local communities to take decisions&#151;in this case on planning orders, in others on spending commitments&#151;to address the specific problems that they face in their local areas.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) on securing this excellent debate and on speaking forensically and with real authority about an issue that affects not only her constituency but, as has been made clear in the debate, constituencies up and down the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para0"><a name="07060543000219">Since the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) and the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) instituted the practice of declaring interests in the debate, I should declare that I was a resident in an HMO when I was a student at the London School of Economics. I have been part of the phenomenon, although I hope that I did not cause too many problems for the neighbours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para1"><a name="07071349000001">My hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) recalled how it might have been useful for people to mistake the name of his constituency. He called to my mind the time I was at sixth-form college, when I went to see the teacher responsible for university admissions and said, &#147;I&#146;ve been reading a lot about this university of Oxbridge and thought it might be a good place to apply to,&#148; so I recognise what he said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para2"><a name="07060543000220">The hon. Member for City of Durham was one of the signatories to my early-day motion on changing to a different planning definition to help to preserve family homes with back gardens, and I could not help noticing during the debate that there are some parallels between the issues. At their heart, they come down to the same problem. People love their neighbourhoods; they have a great deal of affection towards them and they feel disempowered, frustrated and thwarted when their neighbourhoods change before their eyes through events over which they have no control. Some of the details are quite striking. We see residential neighbourhoods changing beyond all recognition in a short space of time&#151;in the case of this debate, HMOs replacing ordinary houses; in the case of gardens, blocks of flats replacing ordinary houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para3"><a name="07060543000221">In both cases, we see family homes being squeezed out of what were often family neighbourhoods. HMOs rarely cater for families&#151;indeed, they are totally unsuitable for that purpose. As several hon. Members have made clear, there is a domino effect. Once a house is converted into an HMO, neighbours sell up&#151;sometimes reasonably, although sometimes they panic and take flight. Roads change in character in a short space of time. We see that with gardens and we see it with  <br>

HMOs. That puts pressure on affordable housing, because many of the replacements for family homes do not provide affordable housing, whether they are HMOs or other developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para4"><a name="07060543000222">We also see the impact on social capital. Sustainable communities are so important&#151;the hon. Lady is to be congratulated on using the term in calling this debate&#151;and require that we build on and cherish the social capital that exists and the links between neighbours and fellow residents. We have a planning system that is often precise about quantities but remarkably vague about the quality of the planning decisions taken. The hon. Lady has done the House a service in bringing the qualitative aspect to bear in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para5"><a name="07060543000223">The term &#147;studentification&#148; has been used&#151;it is probably one of the ugliest terms in the English language and it is unfortunate that we have to use it, but it captures a phenomenon that we recognise. The problems are fivefold. First, where a family home is occupied by five, six or more people, the high density of residents brings about pressure on local services such as rubbish collection, policing and parking, as well as noise problems. Secondly, the phenomenon can give rise to quite a narrow community consisting of young adults of a similar age. Dispersed, they might not cause too much of a problem, but the intensity of such people can lead to problems of noise, traffic and waste, which can be difficult for local residents to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para6"><a name="07060543000224">Thirdly, such homes often lack what is termed internal management by the excellent Universities UK report, to which the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams) referred. When a group of students shares a house, often there is not one person in charge to put the rubbish out on the right day or to call time on a late-night party. That can result in problems. Fourthly, the transience of the population in HMOs can cause what has been described a groundhog day effect. Students are there for a year, beginning in September or October, and might make the effort to get to know their neighbours, who might also make the effort to get to know them. However, by the time the following September arrives, it is groundhog day again and a whole new set of people move in, making it difficult to build those ties and that social capital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para7"><a name="07060543000225">Finally, the seasonal nature of studentification is a problem. The fact that such areas are crowded during term time but can be deserted out of term time causes problems for local residents. They might find that their area has become attractive to burglars, who know that properties are left empty during that time, as several hon. Members have said. That can have the effect of increasing insurance premiums, which have to be paid by people who can perhaps ill afford the cost. Also, retailers struggle to run sustainable businesses throughout the year when the peaks and troughs during term and out of term can be so volatile. The problem is real and has been made evident today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para8"><a name="07060543000226">The parties involved&#151;universities, tenants, landlords, local authorities and the Government&#151;all have a role to play in resolving the problem. I was struck by the remarks that my hon. Friend made about the need for universities to exercise some responsibility and to see themselves as beacons of excellence. I was interested to hear that Brunel university has been going through a positive phase in that respect, on which it is to be congratulated. Loughborough university, which has had  <br>

problems in the past, has appointed an excellent community liaison officer. Alison Barlow is a point of contact for residents and helps to organise security patrols, which benefit both long-term residents and student residents. Students have a responsibility, too, and I am delighted that the National Union of Students is moving positively to recognise that student leaders can play a role in setting high standards. Local authorities have an important enforcement duty. It is important that they recognise that, if the character of an area changes, their response to enforcement in that area must change accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para9"><a name="07060543000227">However, the framework is set by national Government. The hon. Members for City of Durham and for Southampton, Test, and the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen raised the question whether we need a change in the planning arrangements. I should be interested to hear from the Minister what evaluation he has made of the pros and cons of doing so. We have quite rightly expanded the population of students, but we should recognise that they need somewhere to live. There would be no greater disaster than for us to over-regulate the housing market, for the supply of residential accommodation to dry up and for students to be admitted to universities, but with nowhere to live. We must certainly avoid that, so I should be interested to hear what advice the Minister has received on the likely effects of accepting some of the proposals that his right hon. and hon. Friends have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para10"><a name="07060543000228">Finally, the Sustainable Communities Bill has been mentioned. &#147;Sustainable communities&#148; is part of the title of the debate, and the Minister has been involved in debates on the Bill. What reassurances can he give us that the Government, and he in particular, will support the Bill on Report on 15 June? In particular, can he reassure us that it will not be watered down in any respect? The idea of passing power down to local communities, particularly through the grassroots ability in the Bill for local councils and community groups to influence a national action plan, could be a vehicle to exert some pressure and shape national policies. Can the Minister tell us whether any Government amendments are likely to be proposed to the Bill and, if so, can he reassure us that they will be tabled well in advance of 15 June?</p>

my hon.

Indeed, Alison Barlow, the Loughborough university officer, was there on that occasion. We met to consider the problems raised by the issue. My right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) said that it presents a challenge to my Department as the Department for Communities and Local Government, and he is right. It is not a matter of planning and housing law, but a matter of community policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para13"><a name="07060543000232">I shall set out my general approach and then try to offer a way forward. Like other hon. Members, I declare an interest. I am a former president of the NUS, and student housing has been close to my heart for many decades. The situation has, of course, changed since my day. The number of students is huge compared with what it was. The problems in Durham and, to some extent, in Southampton that have been described are familiar, although in those days we did not hear about such problems at Brunel, because the numbers were not that great. The town and gown interface has been debated in this country for hundreds of years, but we now face the issue on a different scale because of the number of students. I note that both Opposition parties welcomed the increase in student numbers. Of course, this is nothing to do with student bashing, which can be a serious problem in some towns and cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para14"><a name="07060543000233">The characterisation of the idea of a student is no longer possible. Two-fifths of UK higher education students study part-time and are already likely to be part of an established community. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency figures for 2003-04, 59 per cent. of students are mature students. One also has to bear in mind&#151;although this point has not been raised&#151;that student households are exempt from council tax. It is testament to residents&#146; groups and Members of Parliament that that point has not been raised, because it could lead to divisions and problems in communities if that were to be an issue. A student household is exempt from council tax and therefore from the council tax base of a local authority, so in effect others pay for that difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para15"><a name="07060543000234">We have a number of frameworks that we can use. The first is the code for sustainable homes, which came into effect in April. Any new home can be rated against the code. The second is the proposals in the now-published planning White Paper, which sets out some reforms. The third and most important, which relates to the issue of devolution raised by the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson), is partnership and local area agreements. In all the cases that have been raised, including that of Loughborough, the university is a member of the local area agreement. The possibilities for proactive planning of student accommodation, including directly provided accommodation and private sector flats, as well as the impact on local communities, are now subject to debates, agreements and policies within the local area agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para16"><a name="07060543000235">I will not repeat the definition of the problem with HMOs and the use classes order, as that has been well documented. We are debating that issue, and I shall explain where we are going in a minute. My difficulty   <br>

is about whether that is the route to a solution. We have the proposals from Northern Ireland and are considering researching the policy there. Incidentally, the policy in Northern Ireland was instituted against the independent recommendations and we need to see whether it will achieve the goals that it sets out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para17"><a name="07060543000236">We need to examine the issue and we will do so. Local authorities that recently held a conference on the matter have important points to make as to why they believe that the existing law is not sufficient. It is worth noting that most of the consultation with stakeholders has involved residents. There is clearly a difference of opinion between Government policy and practitioners in local authorities on what the problem is with the legislation. That is another matter that we will consider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para18"><a name="07060543000237">The question is whether amending the use classes order would necessary solve the social and environmental problems that have been attributed to high concentrations of HMOs. The guide that has been referred to noted that in Brighton, Manchester and Salford, those problems do not exist. I would not say that they do not exist at all, but they do not exist as they do in Uxbridge, Bristol, Durham, Southampton and so on. We need to examine why that is so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para19"><a name="07060543000238">Right hon. and hon. Members will agree that the law of unintended consequences is an important consideration. If we were to change the policy, which would not require primary legislation, as has been said, there could be a danger of creating further unintended consequences. That is because the problem is different in different areas. Some significant communities have families made up of two adults and four teenagers&#151;or more&#151;and we need to consider whether there would be unintended consequences in such areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para20"><a name="07060543000239">In short, more research is required. That is not a holding line. The issue has been raised by Members from across the House, and it is important that we consider it and respond to it. I have some serious concerns about whether the proposals would provide the solution that we are looking for, but it is important that we consider them.</p>

 Can my hon. Friend give us some comfort by saying when he expects to receive the results of the research?</p>

 I can tell my right hon. Friend that I met the delegation from Loughborough on 8 May, and the issue relates to housing and planning policies. My hon.

Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen that we are considering the matter urgently. Indeed, by pure coincidence, a meeting is taking place this afternoon that is one of a series to consider the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para21"><a name="07060543000242">I hope that, in the short time that I have had to reply to the debate, I have put across the point that we believe that we understand the problem&#151;I believe that I do&#151;and that there are options before us. We are concerned that the options that have been proposed by the campaign might not be the correct ones, but we will give the issue full consideration and report back shortly.</p>

<h3 align="center">Dorset Library Service</h3>
<a name="time_14"><a name="70605h0007.htm_time2"><a name="07060543000392"><h5 align="left">12.30 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_26"><a name="07060543000243"><a name="70605h0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="07060543000427"><b>Annette Brooke (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD):</b>
 I wrote to the Minister on 6 June and 12 June 2006 about Dorset county council&#146;s proposal to close 13 of its public libraries. He said that he was disturbed by the potential scale of the closures, that he would be checking the situation with the county council, that he would continue to monitor the situation and that he would in particular assess how the views and wishes of local people were being considered. I thank him for the responses that he gave at that early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para22"><a name="07060543000244">Following an enormous outcry from local people, the libraries were given a reprieve for a two-year, rather than a six-week, consultation period. One year on, and following yesterday&#146;s meeting of the council&#146;s community overview committee, there might be some light at the end of the tunnel. However, any recommendations of that meeting still need acceptance by the council&#146;s cabinet and by the full council, and much detail remains to be clarified. The devil may yet lie in that detail, and today&#146;s debate is therefore of great relevance to the future of the Dorset library service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para23"><a name="07060543000245">I declare a minor interest in the future of the service, in that I regularly hold surgeries in libraries in my constituency, two of which are among the 13 candidates for closure. I praise the staff of the libraries for the services that they provide, which I witness on a regular basis. The whole service has received high ratings. For example, it received the top rating for excellence from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in the Department&#146;s last formal measurement of performance against the public library service standard. Dorset county council is ranked as excellent in the Audit Commission&#146;s comprehensive performance assessment, and library scores played their full part in that. Furthermore, the service has high and increasing satisfaction ratings from users. A 2006 MORI survey found that 77 per cent. of respondents were satisfied with the libraries, compared with 73 per cent. in 2003. Clearly, therefore, there is much to celebrate, and praise should be given to all the library staff. There are also many exciting initiatives, for example in work with children and young people to help them to enjoy and achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para24"><a name="07060543000246">What, therefore, is the problem? Dorset currently has 34 libraries and 4 mobile libraries that cover what is essentially a rural county. There have been contentions to the effect that it has a relatively large number of libraries per head of population, but I feel that it is important to appreciate the local context, including the nature of the rural area and the very poor public transport and road network. Bournemouth and Poole are now separate unitary authorities, and as far as I know they have not been proposing library closures. Indeed, our local library where I live in North Poole has recently had its hours extended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para25"><a name="07060543000247">The uncertainty for the Dorset library service stems from an efficiency review. The county council is the lowest funded of all England&#146;s county councils, with &#163;80 of formula grant per head, compared with what I am told is an average of &#163;160 per head. It was forecasting a gap between spending and income of &#163;20 million by 2009-10, which prompted a review of all services, to consider efficiency savings. Savings were found, and the projected funding gap has been reduced  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Jun 2007">

<notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2007 : Column 46WH</b><br>
by half, but there appear to be fears that the gap could widen again depending on the outcome of this year&#146;s comprehensive spending review and on possible requirements for further efficiencies in the future. Clearly, the outcome of the comprehensive spending review is therefore of critical importance to Dorset county council, and I must emphasise to the Minister that Dorset residents feel badly let down by settlements that are so much lower than those for other county councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para26"><a name="07060543000248">The library service was for its part asked to find efficiency savings of &#163;850,000. Some savings have been identified, but at the end of the day the recommendation from the review was to close 13 predominantly rural community libraries. The efficiency review identified the need to modernise the library network and the need for investment to achieve a high-quality network, which in turn was to be supported by closing those libraries that were assessed as not viable on measures of performance, cost-effectiveness and size, or that were clustered in such a way that arguably there was over-provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para27"><a name="07060543000249">A number of issues have emerged during the consultation period. One of my constituents has undertaken a statistical analysis to show that some of the larger libraries are in fact less cost-effective in terms of cost per book-issue than many of the smaller ones. At the very least, that indicates that all libraries should be included in the detailed review and consultation. A year ago, councillors from opposition parties were asking why all libraries were not being put under the same spotlight as the 13. It seems that yesterday&#146;s decision at the county council has at long last taken on board the need to evaluate all the libraries in terms of efficiency and community involvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para28"><a name="07060543000250">I believe that the original library proximity criteria used for assessing closure were seriously flawed. At the same time that the proposed closure of Corfe Mullen library was announced, bus services to Wimborne, whose library it was suggested my constituents could use instead, were slashed. They have been further cut back this year, to such an extent that it cannot be said that the alternative library is accessible to those without their own transport. Corfe Mullen has a population of about 10,000, the latest figures published by the county rank it 15th in total book issues, and in addition the county council is supporting an extra 700 local homes in the regional spatial strategy&#151;although that proposal is not one that I supported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para29"><a name="07060543000251">I feel that there is a distinct lack of joined-up thinking by the county council. Potential growth and accessibility ought surely to be considered, and I see no evidence of the county council having a greater commitment to improve the bus services in that part of my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="70605h0007.htm_para30"><a name="07060543000252">Similarly, the other library proposed for closure in my constituency, Lytchett Matravers, should also be assessed in terms of accessibility to an alternative library, because public transport to the suggested alternatives is dire. Potential growth should be considered too, because usage at that library has steadily been increasing over the last few years. It is relevant that representations from that part of my constituency were made to the public examination stage of the regional spatial strategy that proposed the high growth in housing.</p>

own plan for the future of its library, with a push towards a community-led model. One positive outcome that has emerged has been the general willingness for some degree of community involvement and volunteering. That needs to be applied to all 34 libraries, however. Clearly, different arrangements will need to be worked out for each of the different communities, and I have heard from discussions with my local communities that they do not believe a community-led model to be sustainable. The input of a professional librarian is seen to be essential, because not all communities will be able to identify sufficient volunteers to run a service, and even those that might have that expertise available at the moment might not be able to sustain it over time. An insistence on a community-led model may deprive disadvantaged areas of a library service, which surely goes against any principle of equity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para1"><a name="07060543000254">There are issues about training volunteers, the use of the information technology system, the maintenance of book stocks, and responsibility for and the cost of the property. If property is passed to community groups, will it be offered at a peppercorn rent? We do not really have answers to any of those questions yet. In principle, many of the issues were mentioned in yesterday&#146;s council recommendation, but what exactly will they mean in practice?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para2"><a name="07060543000255">Along the line, suggestions were made that parish councils, for example, could set a precept to raise money for the running of libraries. That would be totally unacceptable to my constituents. Why should they pay twice to borrow books, in comparison with library users in other Dorset communities whose libraries are not under threat of closure?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para4"><a name="07060543000257">Recent guidance on the Department&#146;s website said that the closure of one or even a small number of library branches does not necessarily signify a breach of the Act. A library may be closed to ensure better overall provision. However, I am talking about a proposal to close 13 libraries that stems almost wholly from financial considerations. I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify exactly how the guidance would apply in such circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para5"><a name="07060543000258">Finance is a key driving force for Dorset county council because of the continuous financial pressures to balance the books. It has been said to me, &#147;Keep your library, but we will make more cuts in social services.&#148; I understand that there are pressures, but we must think about the overall quality of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para6"><a name="07060543000259">Charging for the loan of books was raised with me when I attended a council meeting recently.

Nevertheless, on behalf of that cabinet member, I would like to ask the Minister for his views on charging for the loan of books.</p>

it possible to maintain the book stock. I would find charging unacceptable, but some communities are very concerned about the potential loss of their libraries. Of course, there is the worry that the book fund will be cut and cut again. It has been cut to fund the retention of libraries during the consultation period. Obviously, it is vital that there are funds to maintain the stock of books, including those for children and the visually impaired. There must be a core stock of books available for all libraries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para8"><a name="07060543000261">Next year is the national year of reading, as I keep reminding Dorset county council. I have pointed out that it is not a terribly good idea to close 13 libraries during the national year of reading. Seriously, we are at a crossroads, in this country are we not? We want to improve children&#146;s and young people&#146;s literacy standards. We know that we have to engage boys, in particular, in more reading. This cannot be the time to be cutting back. It must be a time of finding innovative ways to engage children and young people with library services. There are excellent schemes&#151;Bookstart and the summer reading challenge, for example&#151;but there must be many more things that we could do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para9"><a name="07060543000262">Dorset library service has considered moving some libraries into schools, which may be a solution for some communities. It would not work for my two libraries, but I can see that it could be a solution. For my communities, I am interested in using the extended school money for extended school provision in the library. That would work so well in the two villages. Young people from all sorts of backgrounds could have sessions in the library as part of the programme. Joined-up thinking is needed to bring things together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para10"><a name="07060543000263">The library service cannot be static. Changes must be made, and innovative activities must take place in the buildings. It is important that this country retains its proud tradition of a free public library service, as it meets so many people&#146;s needs. I reflect on my own time as a young person. Using the library every night was an important part of my eventually becoming the first person in my family to go to university. I am passionate about the need for access to books, and indeed the internet, in the library, for young people from all backgrounds. It is not always possible for them to find at home the peace and quiet that they need for studying, and obviously not all families have resources in the home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para11"><a name="07060543000264">We talk a great deal about lifelong learning. Surely libraries have a crucial role to play in it. Not so long ago, people were predicting that cinemas would be a thing of the past, but that has not happened. Some people might feel that libraries are a thing of the past in a digital age, but I do not think that that is the case. I think that they are really important.</p>

Lady will recall that that was a significant problem just some five or six years ago&#151;an 8 per cent. increase in book acquisitions and visits rising to more than 290 million a year.

There will be increased autonomy for local authorities, which will give them the maximum freedom to use their resources to respond to the needs of their local communities and to involve those communities in the design and running of services. A new outcome-based performance framework will be in place from next year that will cover all local authority activities.</p>

Lady has said, Dorset library service is highly rated, scoring level 4 in the comprehensive performance assessment and meeting seven out of the 10 library standards. It is in the top quartile of library services in England, with user satisfaction of 94 per cent. for adults and 93 per cent. for children, and it is in the top six English counties for libraries per capita. That is a high-performing local authority, and for all the reasons that she mentioned, Dorset will want to ensure that that continues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para20"><a name="07060543000274">Dorset library service is innovative and has pioneered the simple use of e-mails and text messages to communicate with users. It is working to re-engage young people through out-of-hours sessions, and projects with young Travellers in their communities. Later this year, it will introduce a youth caf&#233; as part of the Reading Agency&#146;s &#147;book bars&#148; programme. It also provides a free reading group service for 210 groups around the county.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para21"><a name="07060543000275">Nevertheless, significant changes have clearly been proposed, and I recognise the public concern about some of those changes in Dorset. I wrote to the chief executive of Dorset to express my concern and views about the valuable contribution that libraries make to their communities. I asked my officials to remain in close contact with Dorset, and they have been in regular contact over the past year about the nature and detail of the review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para22"><a name="07060543000276">The Government have given local authorities the funding to deliver tangible improvements to their services, with a real-terms increase of 39 per cent. since 1997. The authorities have delivered on that, but there are always competing pressures for funding. I have provided a small list of what is happening in the Dorset library service, but more is always possible, and Gershon has encouraged authorities to focus on the detail of their expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para23"><a name="07060543000277">I am pleased that Dorset has not taken the easy way out chosen by some authorities and simply cut the book fund. It has taken stock of the whole library service, reviewed its costs and benefits and sought to evolve the service. The focus is on creating a sustainable and balanced base budget for the service in the medium to long term, and on providing a service that is appropriate to the needs of the county&#146;s demographically diverse communities, which are rural, suburban, and in particular elderly as against young.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para24"><a name="07060543000278">The Dorset review identified ways to hone procurement and stock management processes, to refine staffing structures and maximise the use of skills, to rationalise opening hours, making them clearer to understand and extending them in some areas, and to improve the library buildings. All of that is good and sound business management, although much of it lies behind the scenes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para25"><a name="07060543000279">The review also sought to provide a different means of service provision for 13 communities that are currently served by small libraries that experience low levels of use and have cost-effectiveness issues. As the hon. Lady has said, the process is not complete and  <br>

that consultation and discussion continues. I know that she has played an active role in making her views known, but there is still a risk that some of the libraries may be closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para26"><a name="07060543000280">There is no doubt that library closures can engender great passion in any community. That strength of feeling is valuable, and should be harnessed to help deliver a collective approach to the future of a service, but controversy does not negate justified change, and it may well be that it is right for some of Dorset&#146;s libraries to close, so that others may flourish. That is for the council and its communities to decide and to determine over the coming period. They have a difficult decision to make. It is true that more than 80 per cent. of library traffic in Dorset occurs in just 15 of the 34 libraries. However, libraries provide important services to rural and urban communities alike, and those needs cannot be abandoned. In advance of the council&#146;s decision, the most important factor is that the aim of the review is to improve the overall quality of the library service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para27"><a name="07060543000281">Libraries do sometimes need to close or be replaced, because of a number of common-sense factors, including demographic change. I have said before that any library closure is, of course, regrettable for that particular community, but I am pleased that discussions are taking place with communities in Dorset about other means of delivering the services. Cambridgeshire has 10 fantastically successful community-run libraries that are delivering good and appropriate services to their locality. Taking that leap of faith has enabled Cambridgeshire to keep those 10 sets of doors open and to harness the enthusiasm of their communities, while also freeing up resources to invest in the whole network of libraries in Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para28"><a name="07060543000282">The cabinet of Dorset county council will make the high-level decisions about the future of the 13 libraries this summer, and I am sure that the hon. Lady will join me in watching for news with interest. If community ownership is agreed as a viable option, some local areas are ready to take on that challenge, while others need further assistance to establish whether it will suit them. If there are absolute closures, I am keen to hear Dorset&#146;s explanations of how, through different means, it will meet the needs of those communities that will no longer have access to that library service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para29"><a name="07060543000283">The process will run until March 2009, and of course I encourage the hon. Lady and her constituents to play an active role in it. I expect that she will do so. I also encourage Dorset to continue to be involved, to consult its communities, and not to take decisions in a complacent manner. I appreciate that it is a difficult decision, but the Government have been clear about the standards that are expected and about the investment that is needed. The hon. Lady was right to emphasise programmes such as Bookstart and the summer reading challenge, which we have supported and invested in. I hope that Dorset will continue to have a comprehensive and efficient library service in the months ahead, although I recognise that some change may be necessary.</p>

 This is an unusual debate to the extent that, if they can catch your eye, Sir John, four of the Cumbrian Members of Parliament will speak in the debate. Two Cumbrian MPs will not be speaking, not because they do not wish to, but because they are Ministers and so are unable to do so today. My right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) has sent his apologies and my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Tony Cunningham), who is a Government Whip, is present, but unable to speak. That is a great pity, because he was, of course, the last directly elected Member of the European Parliament for Cumbria and his expertise would have been very helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para30"><a name="07060543000285">I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed) will be able to speak. He has not been in the House for very long, but has made a fine reputation for himself. He is a fine defender of his constituents and, as he was born and brought up in Copeland, knows the area very well. I am pleased to see that the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) has agreed to speak, although judging by his press release, I would have thought that this is his debate, and not mine. However, I am very grateful to him for coming today. Furthermore, this is probably the first time in 20 years that my neighbour the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean, and I have agreed publicly about anything, although I must say that we work together behind the scenes on behalf of our constituents fairly frequently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para31"><a name="07060543000286">What is the reason for this debate? I am frightened that the Government will make a mistake that will have an adverse impact for decades to come on the communities that make up Cumbria. That mistake would be to create a Cumbrian unitary authority. I shall provide a brief history of Cumbria&#151;it is brief because the county was created only in 1974 by a Tory Government. There was no logic behind its creation; it is an amalgamation of the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, the county borough of Carlisle, the Furness part of Lancashire, the country borough of Barrow and a bit of north Yorkshire, which was thrown in for good measure. It was realised at the time that Cumbria was a very large and diverse county, and six district councils were created to acknowledge that. I do not want this Labour Government to compound the mistakes made in 1974. Cumbria has never worked well, and I should know. I was a councillor on the shadow authority in 1973 until I resigned in 1988 and had the privilege of being the chair of Cumbria county council for two years. I do not blame the individuals involved in the county&#151;I blame its size.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para32"><a name="07060543000287">The Cumbrian bid document is called &#147;One council, One vision, One voice&#148;&#151;Cumbria has always been a bit short on vision. In the document, the county council states rightly that the unitary authority would not constitute a takeover by the county of the district councils, but would be a brand new authority that would take its own decisions. The document goes on to state that the new unitary council would cap council tax rises at less than 4 per cent. for the first three years. Will the Minister tell us whether those who produced the document have the power to do that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para33"><a name="07060543000288">The documents goes on about the &#147;one voice&#148;, but the diverse communities of west Cumbria, Eden Valley, Carlisle, South Lakeland and Barrow cannot speak with one voice. For a start, we have different accents and traditions, our industries are different and we vote differently politically. I am not being parochial; all I am saying is that the county is too big. Cumbria constitutes 48 per cent. of the land mass of the north-west region. It should be classed as a sub-region. Its largest centres of population are Carlisle and Barrow, which are 90 miles apart. The Minister has a fine reputation as the Member for Basildon&#151;I am sure that she is a good constituency MP&#151;but I wonder what she would say if we proposed to put Basildon in with Brighton, Sir John, or if we put Bournemouth in with Reading. They are 90 miles apart, but we would probably agree that it would not be a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para34"><a name="07060543000289">The Minister has just finished doing an excellent job as a Minister in Northern Ireland, where local government is about to be reorganised. Northern Ireland is twice the size of Cumbria and has three times the population, and yet seven unitary authorities have been proposed there, each with 60 members, plus, of course, a 108-Member Northern Ireland Assembly. Let us compare that with Cumbria, for which an 84-member council is being discussed. Does that imply&#151;I am sure that she will disagree with this&#151;that Northern Ireland is over-represented? No, it implies that Cumbria would be under-represented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para35"><a name="07060543000290">Let me deal with the 84 county councillors. If we are going to combine the responsibilities of the district and county councils, bearing in mind that councillors can spend up to three hours either going to or coming from a meeting, we will end up with full-time councillors&#151;and poorly-paid full-time councillors, because they do not get paid a great deal. In reality, that will mean that we will end up with retired councillors who will not be representative of the population or plugged into their local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="70605h0008.htm_para36"><a name="07060543000291">On stakeholder support, let us look at the county council&#146;s submission in the document, which contains 12 balloons from a variety of quangos and companies working extensively for the county council. They are supportive of the proposal, although not overwhelmingly so. The results of a MORI poll published today in Cumbria show that 72 per cent. of the population of the county think that a single council would be too remote. People are sometimes sceptical of polls. I asked for a referendum to take place in the spring, on the same day as the local county elections&#151;3 May&#151;but the deputy leader of the county council replied:</p>

However, that is not to be&#151;it may be for another day, but it will not happen now. However, the Government should insist on the district councils and the county council working closer together. They should say to the councils, &#147;We expect you to work together and we will require efficiency savings from you to ensure that you work together.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para4"><a name="07060543000296">The Government have often been accused of not listening. The choice in Cumbria is to listen to the quangos and, some of us suspect, the civil servants, or to listen to the Members of Parliament, who know their area and the communities and, unlike the councillors on both sides, do not really have an axe to grind. We will say what we believe is right for the area, and we are the experts on Cumbria. I hope that in July, when the Government take their decision, they will turn down the recommendation for a unitary Cumbria but insist on better co-operation between the districts and the county.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate and I congratulate the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) on initiating it. This is a unique occasion.

Thank goodness some of the district councils are commissioning MORI polls, so that we can get some idea of public opinion. I also agree with the hon. Gentleman that the stakeholders who have backed the county are in the pay of the county or work with it. They are part of the quangos; they are part of the same bureaucracy.

working together. The county should be dealing with some of the big strategic issues of inward investment, but are we seriously suggesting that a unitary Cumbria will deal with planning issues in Barrow, Carlisle, Alston and Workington? There will be no savings, because to deal with those matters, it will open sub-offices. Yes, we will lose our district councils, but the buildings will still be there. There will not be a chief executive, but you can bet your bottom dollar there will be deputy chief executives scattered all over Cumbria, as there are at present.</p>

The Minister should ask her colleagues in the Home Office&#151;the Department responsible for the police. When Cumbria and Lancashire police forces wanted to amalgamate, the savings were initially to be &#163;18 million. Then the figure went down to &#163;10 million. Then the move was cost neutral. Then the cost went up to &#163;5 million, then &#163;15 million and then &#163;22 million extra. The savings that the county projects in Cumbria are bogus; they will not materialise.

late Bill Minto OBE, understood all that when he began the process of council structure modernisation in 1997. In my view, he was the greatest leader the county council has had, and we should seek to apply the wisdom and integrity that he would have brought to the debate to solving the problems before us today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para12"><a name="07060543000307">Essentially, councils exist to serve the public, and it is the interests of the public, not the interests of the councils, that must drive change. Let me get to the heart of the matter. Whether they live in Copeland or Carlisle, ordinary people, public service users, businesses and others want better local government. They want local government to be more effective, accountable and flexible. They want local government to facilitate progress, not obstruct it. They despair of the bunker mentality that local authorities often display, passing problems from one department to another, seeking to shift blame and escape accountability. People want their local councils to be problem solvers, not problem avoiders. They probably also want fewer councillors, while at the same time wanting democratic representation to be as local as possible, but that tension must be acknowledged and addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para13"><a name="07060543000308">People want their councils to work in partnership with the local NHS to improve health services and health outcomes. They want their councils to work in partnership with business to grow the local economy and to protect and create jobs. They want their local council to be unrelenting in pursuing excellence in schools, in social services and in protecting and serving the elderly. They want their council to provide clean streets, safe roads and value for money through the lowest possible council taxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para14"><a name="07060543000309">People are right to want all that, and I believe that every hon. Member in this Chamber wants it, too. They do not want locally funded organisations using money that should be spent on local front-line services to fight one another over models of governance or representation. The public will not forgive that; it is not why they pay council tax.</p>

As the MP for Copeland and a former Copeland councillor, I will not countenance moves that lead to the loss of jobs in my constituency or the diminution of services currently provided. Nor will I contemplate any model that facilitates an anti-nuclear agenda or reduces the unquestionable primacy and moral legitimacy of Copeland borough council and the people of Copeland in matters relating to the nuclear industry.</p>

A solution that will satisfy all parties is waiting to be found, and it is incumbent on the county council and the borough councils to work together, in their mutual interest and, more importantly, in the interest of the council tax payer, to find and implement that solution. The present arrangement is not a good one; it does not serve the public as well as it should. I congratulate the Government on instigating the process of change. I believe that all parties agree that change must occur&#151;the status quo is not an option. That is the basis on which to move forward. I trust that the Government will make it clear to all the councils involved that they must work together without delay.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) on securing the debate and on being so generous with his time. I will attempt to use it efficiently to give the Minister ample time to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para17"><a name="07060543000313">I declare an interest as a member of South Lakeland district council, although I believe that MPs and members of councils, whether county or district, ought to think first of the people who put them where they are, rather than the synthetic bodies to which they happen to be elected. It is remarkable that in this Chamber there are four MPs from different parties all singing from the same hymn sheet. Looking at the issue objectively, I add my voice to the calls opposing the Cumbria unitary bid. I shall concentrate on three reasons and much of what I say will overlap with what we have already heard, so I will be quick.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para18"><a name="07060543000314">First, a unitary Cumbria would separate local people from their council. The centralisation of power in Carlisle&#151;no offence intended to the hon. Gentleman who represents that great city&#151;would increase people&#146;s resentment towards their local government and their sense of remoteness from it. Not only would the council be remote from its citizens, but councillors would be further removed from the people they represent. Three quarters of the county council wards in my constituency are significantly larger than the average parliamentary constituency. The county council is sensitive towards that line of attack, so it is trying to address it, as the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) pointed out, via local boards, but essentially we are talking about mini-quangos that will duplicate work currently done by parish councils but will not be elected and will have no mandate and, in the end, will be even less efficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para19"><a name="07060543000315">The second reason for objecting to the unitary bid is that the increased sense of remoteness and distance from the electorate is a principal reason why public support, as we have heard, is pretty close to zero. The MORI poll that showed that 72 per cent. of people opposed the proposal understates the level of opposition to the Cumbria county bid. My postbag reflects unanimous opposition. I have not had a single letter or a comment at a surgery that is in favour of the unitary bid&#151;a huge majority of people are opposed to it. The <i>Westmorland Gazette </i>conducted a poll recently and found that readers overwhelmingly oppose the bid. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para20"><a name="07060543000316">Thirdly, any attempt to reorganise local government, particularly in Cumbria, must take account of traditional identities and the likelihood of a new system winning the support of local people. With the best will in the world, as we have heard, Cumbria is an amalgamation of the counties of Cumberland, Westmorland, Lancashire over the sands and, in my patch, the West Riding of Yorkshire. Imposing upon the peoples of Cumbria a local government structure that flies in the face of their sense of identity, centralises power and removes accountability is a recipe for failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para21"><a name="07060543000317">I would support the campaign for enhanced two-tier working, because it could lead to more efficiencies than the county is able to claim for its own proposals. I shall finish by saying that a unitary Cumbria would be a contrived entity. It would be doomed to be the first up  <br>

for the chop the next time that local government is reorganised. On behalf of the residents of my constituency in Westmorland and Lonsdale, I call on the Minister to save time and to put the bid out of its misery now.</p>

 I thank all hon. Gentlemen for their comments, but particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) for securing today&#146;s debate. He has achieved something that does not happen terribly often in the House in that he has secured support from all quarters and from colleagues from all parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para22"><a name="07060543000319">I do not have time to go through some of the detail, but I should like to comment on some of the things that have been mentioned. My hon. Friends the Members for Carlisle and for Copeland (Mr. Reed), the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) and the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) have all spoken and put a powerful case for their views on the issue. It is clear that there is a strength of feeling among MPs. I can say that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Tony Cunningham)&#151;the silent one who has sat beside me today&#151;has also made his views known to me and to the Minister for Local Government. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton), who cannot be with us today, has brought a delegation from his local council, Barrow-in-Furness borough council, to see me. Indeed, I shall also have meetings with representatives of one of the other districts and representatives of Cumbria county council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para23"><a name="07060543000320">A great deal of debate and consideration is taking place on this issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle said that he hopes that the Government do not make a mistake. So do I&#151;but I can assure him that whatever the decision, it will be taken after a careful consideration of all the factors, including those that have been raised today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para24"><a name="07060543000321">To give the background, right hon. and hon. Members will be aware that in response to the invitation that the Government issued to local authorities, we received a total of 26 proposals from local authorities for the creation of unitary authorities. One of the bids was from Cumbria county council. I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will understand that I am somewhat constrained in what I can say today. We are in a legal process and matters of propriety must be taken into account, so I cannot get into the merits of specific proposals. I think that that is understood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para25"><a name="07060543000322">The reasons why the Government judged that 16 proposals could go forward to stakeholder consultation were set out in letters that were sent to councils on 27 March. The invitation for bids for unitary status was a response to the long-standing debate and consultation on the future of local government. My hon. Friend highlighted that in some cases, the existing two-tier arrangements are not as efficient and effective as we might wish. There are risks involved in a two-tier structure. There can be confusion, duplication and inefficiency between the tiers. There is a view that in some areas the appropriate  <br>

<notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2007 : Column 59WH</b><br>
way forward is to move to a unitary structure. We are looking to create more focused and better outcomes for local residents. Allowing councils that wish to take that route to come forward to make a bid is the Government&#146;s response to such views, and 16 were shortlisted for further stakeholder consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para26"><a name="07060543000323">The 26 proposals that we initially received were whittled down to 16, and we are using a set of criteria to consider them that it might be helpful to explain. A change to unitary structure must be affordable and represent value for money, and costs must be met from a council&#146;s existing resources. Proposals have to be supported by a broad cross-section of stakeholders in and partners of the local authority. In addition to the affordability and support criteria, the councils have to provide strong, effective and accountable strategic leadership; give genuine opportunities for neighbourhood flexibility and empowerment; and deliver value for money and equity on public services. The 16 shortlisted proposals were examined and taken forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para27"><a name="07060543000324">We are now in the process of a public consultation, which lasts for 12 weeks up to 22 June. I welcome today&#146;s debate as a contribution towards that consultation. I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will also make their views known during the more formal process. The Government have said that we would welcome responses to the consultation from key partners and stakeholders in the areas that would be affected by the proposals. That means that we welcome views from local authorities, the wider public sector and the business, voluntary and community sectors, but it is open to anybody who has a comment to make to respond to the consultation. I assure all hon. right and hon. Members that we will carefully consider all the views that are put to us before a decision is taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para28"><a name="07060543000325">I also take on board the comment that whatever happens with unitary structures, if anything, there have to be better ways for two-tier local authority areas to work. My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border said that. In some areas, authorities have offered to be pathfinders. We must recognise that, although a  <br>

unitary structure would be the most appropriate structure in some areas, it is not the case in every area. We need to see more effective working arrangements that overcome the risks of confusion, duplication and inefficiency. Those risks must be dealt with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para29"><a name="07060543000326">The process is based on a devolutionary principle. The bids come not from above from the Government, but bottom up from local authorities. That is why we issued an invitation to local authorities to come forward with their views on whether they thought that the process was appropriate for them. Those of us who are committed to the public sector and public service want to ensure that we get the best possible outcomes for local residents, whatever the structures and whatever the outcome of the process. That is why we are asking all local authorities, whether or not they have a unitary structure, to have better working relationships across local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="70605h0009.htm_para30"><a name="07060543000327">My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle asked a specific question about expenditure and read an extract from the brochure from Cumbria county council&#146;s bid for unitary status, in which it stated that it would ensure that the rate increase was capped at 4 per cent. for the first three years, I believe. It is for county councils to set their own expenditure plans, but a new authority would have the ultimate say on the expenditure plans because it would be a new authority. The implications of that are being worked through and a working group has been established to look at those specific issues. Key stakeholders such as the Local Government Association and the unions are involved. The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill will enable flexible arrangements, subject to its passage through Parliament. At the end of the day, although plans are set by county and district councils, any new authority would have the authority to make its own expenditure plans and to decide on the appropriate rates.</p>

I thank all Members for their comments. I assure them that all the comments made today will be taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="st_34"><a name="07060543000329"><a name="70605h0010.htm_spnew0"><a name="07060543000435"><b>Mr. Mark Lancaster (North-East Milton Keynes) (Con):</b>
 It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to raise what is a serious problem in Milton Keynes and other constituencies across the country. Indeed, having listened to the earlier debate here in Westminster Hall about sustainable communities, I know that there are real concerns on both sides of the House. I therefore welcome the Minister, who I am sure will demonstrate her reputation for fair-mindedness to us all this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para0"><a name="07060543000330">Let me make it clear at the start that I accept that houses in multiple occupancy are here to stay, but I do not accept the haphazard manner in which they are dealt with under existing legislation. In the short time available, I want to do two things. First, I want to highlight the considerable impact that HMOs have on social cohesion and infrastructure in Milton Keynes. Secondly, I want to outline some of the fundamental gaps in the legislation, which are causing considerable uncertainty for landlords and local authorities across the country that are desperately trying to do the right thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para1"><a name="07060543000331">Before I do that, however, let me spend just a few moments outlining some of the specific challenges facing Milton Keynes as one of the new towns that the Government have designated for growth. When I was first elected as the Member of Parliament for North-East Milton Keynes two years ago, I sat down with local authority representatives and asked what they felt the principal challenges facing the city were likely to be, and the one recurring theme was the strain that the forced expansion of Milton Keynes placed on infrastructure in the city and its satellite towns and villages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para2"><a name="07060543000332">As a direct result of those concerns, I started my &#147;I before E&#148;, or infrastructure before expansion, campaign, which was designed not to stop the expansion of Milton Keynes&#151;after all, our young people need affordable housing to live in&#151;but simply as a call for future expansion to be carried out at a sustainable rate. The key to such an approach is to provide associated infrastructure, such as schools, health care and transport, alongside, or preferably before, growth. Perhaps most importantly, there must be a recognition of the fact that growth must have the support of local people if communities are to be truly sustainable. That means returning decisions about whether, how, when and where the city should expand to local people, via the democratically elected local authority, and taking them away from unelected, unaccountable quangos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para3"><a name="07060543000333">The Government have told Milton Keynes to provide the seemingly arbitrary figure of 70,000 extra houses by 2031&#151;far more than is required for organic growth. Unfortunately, although the Government are content to force their will on Milton Keynes residents via unelected, unaccountable quangos such as Milton Keynes Partnerships, they seem reluctant to commit to matching funding to build and improve city infrastructure. Although some funding has been allocated, the funding streams are, crucially, all short  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Jun 2007">

term and do not match the much longer time frames to which the Government seem prepared to commit for housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para4"><a name="07060543000334">As a result, it is difficult for the local authority to plan effectively, and the net result is enormous pressure on the city&#146;s infrastructure. Milton Keynes general hospital, for example, was originally designed for a city population of less than half what it is today. Similarly, nearly 70,000 people in Milton Keynes are still unable to register with an NHS dentist. With existing infrastructure already creaking, the large recent increase in HMOs in the city has pushed some services almost to breaking point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para5"><a name="07060543000335">Milton Keynes needs more affordable housing&#151;all political parties in the city agree on that&#151;but that housing must be delivered in a sustainable, planned way. As I hope to explain, the retrospective, unpredictable manner in which dwellings are being converted into HMOs is not the answer. Perhaps one indicator of the nature of the problem is the fact that Milton Keynes has seen the amount of private sector rented housing double in the past seven years, increasing from 6 to 12 per cent. of the housing market. With a rapidly expanding city, the need for cheap, affordable housing close to the economic centre of Milton Keynes is vital. HMOs, many of which are unlicensed and unknown to the authorities, fulfil the needs of transient economic workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para6"><a name="07060543000336">I will deal with the legislation in a moment. Unfortunately, however, many HMOs in Milton Keynes are not covered by recent legislation because they are two-level, four-bedroomed flats with a garage that has been converted into a fifth bedroom. As such, they are not required to be licensed. The problems with such properties are fourfold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para7"><a name="07060543000337">First, the five bedrooms that are rented out tend to be occupied by five young adults, who might well only recently have started work, who might be immigrant workers and who might have recently graduated from university with a sizeable debt. Whoever they are, however, the one thing that they all have in common is that they are invariably financially unstable and lack security. In non-licensed HMOs, the chances of falling prey to the tiny minority of unscrupulous landlords is greater, either because of inadequate protection by contract or the potential for sudden rises in rent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para8"><a name="07060543000338">Secondly, HMOs bring with them a major increase in the risk of fire, particularly where five individuals all cook separately and overload electric sockets in a house that was originally designed for a single family. Milton Keynes council has confirmed that a large proportion of the recent increase in the number of fires in Milton Keynes has been in HMOs. Of course, the threat is not confined to Milton Keynes, and a recent article in <i>Inside Housing </i>magazine states:</p>
<a name="70605h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="07060543000377"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Fire brigade chiefs are warning councils that Eastern European migrants are living in potential death traps because increasing numbers are being crammed into houses in multiple occupation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para9"><a name="07060543000339">Thirdly, residents living in areas of Milton Keynes where HMOs are on the rise complain that the quality of life in their neighbourhoods is deteriorating rapidly and that they feel powerless to do anything about that. Typical of the issues that long-standing residents complain about is the increase in litter and noise pollution. One resident recently complained to me that  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Jun 2007">

<notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2007" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2007 : Column 63WH</b><br>
the character of the street where they lived had changed dramatically and that they no longer felt that it was a safe environment for their 10-year-old daughter to play in. They identified the source of the problem as three former family homes that had recently been converted into HMOs. Some of the properties were former four-bedroomed houses, but they had as many as eight residents, and all of the properties had transient tenants. Those tenants tended to be young&#151;normally in their mid-20s&#151;and to stay on average between four and 16 weeks. In the main, they failed to make any effort to integrate with the local community. Car parking had also become a nightmare, with up to 14 vehicles trying to occupy just six parking spaces. Litter had increased dramatically, as had noise from late-night parties. All those problems had dramatically changed the nature of what was once a quiet urban street.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para10"><a name="07060543000340">Finally, probably the greatest impact that HMOs have had has been on local infrastructure. Current infrastructure planning is done on the basis of recommendations regarding planning applications for ground space. For example, schools are built in response to a set of family dwellings, each with a clearly defined number of bedrooms, built in a certain location. It used to be relatively straightforward to estimate how many residents, both adults and children, there would be and even the likely number of car parking spaces that would be required. Unfortunately, the advent of HMOs has changed all that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para11"><a name="07060543000341">HMOs that sometimes have many more than five or six residents throw previously reliable planning assumptions to the wind. Like many other parts of the UK in recent years, Milton Keynes has seen a rise in its immigrant population, whose members have struggled to get on the council waiting list. Understandably, HMOs have been a logical step for many immigrant families, but I have heard reports of up to four families living in a house that was originally designed for a single family of three of four.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para12"><a name="07060543000342">The rise of HMOs is not just a Milton Keynes phenomenon, and they are prevalent in most towns and cities, particularly where there is a university. Milton Keynes is fortunate to have the world-renowned Open university, and although we do not yet have a dedicated undergraduate university, we may well have one soon if local business gets its way. Although I am supportive of the idea of the city having a dedicated undergraduate university, I am concerned that its arrival will only add to the pressure for HMOs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para13"><a name="07060543000343">I have highlighted the problems that a rise in the number of HMOs brings for the accurate planning of infrastructure and I now want to discuss the problems with the legislation. As I understand it, there are two principal issues. The first is determining what is and what is not an HMO; the second is the lack of joined-up thinking between the licensing and the planning legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para14"><a name="07060543000344">The definition of an HMO is contained in sections 254 to 259 of the Housing Act 2004, but to be frank, it is less than clear to me as a layman or, indeed, to a potential landlord. As I understand it, however, a building or part of a building is an HMO if it satisfies any, all or some of the following tests: the standard  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="5 Jun 2007">

test, the self-contained flat test or the converted building test. It is also an HMO if an HMO declaration is enforced under section 255 of the Act or if it is a converted block of flats to which section 257 of the Act applies. Of course, that was probably crystal clear to you, Sir John, and to the Minister, but unfortunately I and many landlords struggle to understand it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para15"><a name="07060543000345">It can be quite difficult for a landlord to find out whether they are required to obtain a licence or whether they are exempt from current licensing legislation. I stress that the vast majority of landlords want to play by the rules and do the right thing, but as in any industry, a minority does not, and the legislation provides sufficient uncertainty to allow unscrupulous landlords to abuse it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para16"><a name="07060543000346">Let us take, for example, the problems that are caused by the disparities between the planning and licensing of HMOs. Currently, the planning legislation that is used to turn family dwellings into an HMO and the HMO licensing legislation that was brought in last year fail to work effectively together. Under the Government&#146;s housing planning policy guidance note 3, of 2000, a landlord has the ability to purchase a house and make renovations to turn it into an HMO. As long as the renovations do not turn the dwelling into a house with more than five occupants with no family bonds and the building has fewer than three floors, the HMO is likely to slip into the gap between planning legislation and HMO licensing legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para17"><a name="07060543000347">There is a gap, which current HMO licensing legislation fails to fill. The current legislation suggests that only those HMOs with five or more tenants, with no binding household links, spread over three or more floors in a single dwelling, need to be licensed. That provision is clearly designed to protect Georgian and Victorian terraced houses, and while it is of course important that the quality of life is maintained in leafy Islington streets, it is also vital to recognise that in new towns such as Milton Keynes, where traditional Georgian or Victorian housing over three or more floors tends to be the exception rather than the rule, the current legislation is inadequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para18"><a name="07060543000348">The licensing provisions under the Housing Act 2004 in essence penalise honest landlords who are willing to sign up to pay registration fees and incur the cost of bringing their property up to the standard expected of a licensed HMO, while those who might be less inclined to follow the rules all the time get away without incurring those costs. I understand the benefits of the licensing scheme, but I am concerned that the legislation is too complicated and leaves many grey areas where less law-abiding landlords can hide from their local authorities. When licensing registration fees can cost anything from &#163;100 per property in Wigan to &#163;1,500 in Dartford, I am not surprised that some rogue landlords will avoid those costs if they feel that they can get away with it. Evidence suggests that, so far, they can. I have also had letters suggesting that some landlords&#151;and I am talking about a minority&#151;have been passing the licence fee directly on to tenants with little or no warning. As I have already explained, many of the tenants in Milton Keynes have little financial security, and have no other local place to move to, should they refuse to pay the sudden increase in rent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para19"><a name="07060543000349">There are, of course, also ways of legally avoiding the legislation. Landlords who own a three-storey property that contains five or more rentable rooms can simply choose not to rent one of the bedrooms, so that they fall outside the mandatory licensing arrangements. That enables them to step outside the cost that they would incur if they stayed within the rules and regulations set up in the 2004 and 2006 housing legislation, although in practice there is little difference in a property&#146;s potential risk to a community, or impact on it, after the removal of a single bedroom. If the Minister needs proof of such active avoidance of licensing, she need look no further than Milton Keynes, where only about 20 such licences have been issued since October 2006, although conservative predictions place the number of HMOs across the city at between 5,000 and 6,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para20"><a name="07060543000350">What should be done? Is it not logical that a landlord should need planning permission to alter a house to turn it into an HMO dwelling, before being given a licence to provide an HMO? Currently that is not the case. The irony is that, even if a licence is granted, planning permission still might be refused by the local authority, and vice versa. What is more, although new legislative guidelines suggest that the licensing and planning offices of a local authority should work closely together, and pass information about HMOs to each other, that is not mandatory. More alarming is the fact that if an unlicensed HMO remains in place undetected for some years, it can automatically be granted planning permission. When that happens, the landlord might face a minor fine, but that is not much of a disincentive, especially when planning permission is granted automatically. Surely if we are to find a solution to the problem of providing good quality HMOs, we need to give local authorities the powers that they need to ensure that landlords are licensed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para21"><a name="07060543000351">I do not pretend to have all the answers to this problem, but I know that much more work needs to be done to straighten out some of the legislation. To give the Minister credit, the current planning and licensing legislation on HMOs is an admirable attempt to provide safe and high quality living accommodation for a key segment of the population. However, it remains incomplete, and at the very least it needs to be recognised that not all buildings suitable for use as HMOs have more than three floors. It appears that HMOs are here to stay, but by their very nature they are having a major impact on the quality of life and social cohesion in towns and cities such as Milton Keynes. The time has come to deal with the issue before it gets even further out of hand.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) on securing this debate on such an important topic. The Government also value the contribution of the private rented sector to meeting housing need. Houses in multiple occupation provide affordable housing for a wide sector of the community. As the hon. Gentleman has said, the Housing Act 2004 introduced a system for the mandatory licensing of houses in multiple occupation of three or more storeys,  <br>

occupied by five or more persons not all of the same family. Authorities can introduce discretionary licensing schemes to cover smaller problematic houses in multiple occupation, subject to local consultation and approval by the Secretary of State. That allows them to tackle management and amenity problems in such properties that do not fall within the mandatory scheme. Consideration may need to be given to going down that route in Milton Keynes, given the problems that the hon. Gentleman outlined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para22"><a name="07060543000353">The licensing requirements run parallel to any planning permission that might be required. A local authority must apply the definition of multiple occupation contained in part 7 of the Act when considering its own licensing functions in part 2. It cannot simply refuse to consider whether to grant a licence, on the basis that planning permission for development has been refused, provided that the property remains a house in multiple occupation for the purposes of the Housing Act 2004 and is subject to mandatory licensing or a discretionary scheme. If the authority is unable to grant a licence for any reason, it must make an interim management order under part 4 of the Act. An authority should not confuse its planning functions with its housing duties. Furthermore, if there has been unauthorised development, the local authority should take enforcement action to remedy the breaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para23"><a name="07060543000354">To grant a licence, the local authority must be satisfied that the proposed licence holder is a fit and proper person, that adequate management arrangements are in place and that the property is reasonably suitable for the number of occupants permitted. The authority may impose conditions in the licence, relating to the use and management of the property, including the management of occupiers&#146; or visitors&#146; behaviour. A landlord or manager who operates a house in multiple occupation without a licence is committing a criminal offence and can be fined, on conviction, up to &#163;20,000. Licence holders who permit a licensed property to be occupied by more persons than are permitted also risk a fine of &#163;20,000, and a fine of &#163;5,000 if they breach any of the conditions of the licence.</p>

 In her opening remarks, the Minister is demonstrating how incredibly complicated and confusing the various provisions are. I feel strongly that the Government need to look at the matter again and tie it together. She was not here for the earlier debate, but the problem affects not only Milton Keynes but authorities throughout the country, which are struggling to implement the complicated legislation.</p>

 I beg to differ from the hon. Gentleman. I do not think that it is that complicated. In outlining the legislation, I am showing that it sets standards and establishes mechanisms to ensure that they are complied with, including fines for non-compliance. Whenever any legislation is put into force, it is surely right that appropriate compliance and enforcement mechanisms should be set up.</p>

no question of a local authority closing down an HMO because the landlord has not obeyed the rules. That would unfairly punish the property&#146;s occupiers for the failings of their landlord. It would also lead to homelessness and place a burden on the local authority to provide housing assistance to occupiers who are dispossessed of their homes. An authority may take necessary enforcement action against unauthorised development, which may lead to the property ceasing to be a licensable HMO, but while it remains licensable because it falls within the definition in the Housing Act, the authority must make an interim management order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para25"><a name="07060543000358">The Act imposes a duty on landlords and managers to apply for licences, and imposes a duty on authorities to promote the scheme. Local authorities should not sit back and wait for applications to come in, but should actively pursue them. Clearly, the hon. Gentleman is aware of the whereabouts of such properties in Milton Keynes, and these issues are being brought to his attention. As those issues are known about, action should be taken on them. Given that it is a year since legislation was introduced, enforcement action can and should be taken against persons who refuse to apply it. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="70605h0010.htm_para26"><a name="07060543000359">The Act provides a range of other means by which to address problematic HMOs, including the housing, health and safety rating system by which local authorities can assess risks from hazards in the house to the health and safety of occupiers, and require landlords to take appropriate action to eliminate them. In addition, management regulations apply to all HMOs and enable local authorities to ensure that properties are being properly managed and maintained. Failure to comply is a criminal offence that carries fines of up to &#163;5,000.</p>

that are not required to be licensed if their poor management, which includes failing to tackle antisocial behaviour, poses a risk to the health, safety and welfare of the occupants or of persons residing in the neighbourhood. Local authority housing and planning departments should, as the hon. Gentleman has recognised, take a co-ordinated approach when properties require planning permission and are subject to licensing. However, we must recognise that those systems meet different purposes and have different objectives.</p>

Ministers are happy to listen to representations on this issue and to understand in more detail the issues that affect particular areas, but I do not accept the hon.
