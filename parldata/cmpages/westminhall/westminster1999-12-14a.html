<P>

<a name="91214h01_para0"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That the sitting be now adjourned.--[<i>Mr. Sutcliffe.</i>]
<P>

<a name="91214h01_time0"><H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew0"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold):</B> 
 I am grateful for this opportunity to participate in a debate on the removal, donation and transplantation of human organs.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para1">The debate follows in the wake of the tragic Alder Hey case in Bristol, in which children's organs were removed, allegedly without their relatives' consent. I should make it perfectly clear at the outset that I do not believe that anybody could condone such behaviour. Whatever the status of the law--whether it remains as it is or is changed--I do not believe that anybody would wish to remove organs from any deceased person if the relatives concerned did not wish that to happen.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew1"><B> Mr. Tam Dalyell  (Linlithgow):</B> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew2"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: I should like to make a little progress and at least introduce the subject before I give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para2">The debate follows a previous debate in the House so excellently opened by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris). I am delighted to see him in his place today, because few hon. Members know more about the subject than he does. Indeed, before the debate in the House, he proposed a debate at the British Medical Association conference, as a result of which the BMA adopted, for the first time, a policy of calling on the Government to change the general presumption in favour of opting into a system of organ donation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: Before telling us that we should not condone something, can the hon. Gentleman tell us whether he has talked to the doctors at Alder Hey so as to hear their side of the story?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew4"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: I have had correspondence with them, but I have not discussed the matter with them personally. However, it must be a general presumption that, where the relatives do not wish organs to be donated, those wishes should be respected at what is a time of great sadness and grieving.
 
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para3">The debate is set against a worldwide background of a shortage of cadaveric organ donors, and waiting lists are lengthening all over the world. They currently stand at some 60,000 in the United States, 13,000 in Europe and 6,000 in the United Kingdom. More tragically still, there are more than 4,000 kidney dialysis patients, 1,000 of whom are under 30, whose quality of life--indeed, life expectancy--could be transformed by a transplant operation. I have to say that most will remain disappointed.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 2WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h01_para4">The challenge is to ensure that everyone in society is given the opportunity to think constructively and sensitively about whether they would like to donate their organs in the event of their untimely death, while ensuring that their relatives and dependents are fully aware of their views. Given the enormous benefit that recipients gain, it is surprising that only 26 per cent. of adults in this country have obtained a donor card, and that only 18 per cent admit to carrying one. Yet surveys have shown that, when people are asked about organ donations, 70 per cent. of the population would be willing to donate. Death is something that many of us find hard to contemplate. The removal of our organs after death, at a time when our relatives are grieving, is even more difficult to contemplate.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para5">It is worth recapitulating how the present system operates and the legal framework under which it does so. The Human Tissue Act 1961 stipulates the two circumstances in which organs may be removed--where there has been a specific request to that effect by the deceased person or, in the absence of such a request, if there is no reason to believe that the deceased expressed an objection and the relatives also do not object. That was the point that I was making in my opening remarks when the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) intervened. In other words, the deceased, or his or her relatives, must positively state that they wish to have the organs removed.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para6">There is a legal argument, which will need to be tested in the courts at some stage, as to who is legally in possession of the body. It is usually presumed to be the hospital until the body is claimed by those with a greater claim--namely, the relatives. The problem then arises as to which relatives take precedence in that respect. Irrespective of the law, it would be unacceptable to remove organs unless the relatives were all agreed on that.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para7">In some European countries the presumption is reversed, so that those who positively object will not be considered eligible for organ donation. The Government--including the Minister of State, who is here today--have ruled out that change in presumption on the basis that countries that have it, such as Italy, do not have a higher donation rate. However, I suspect that in the case of Italy that is for other reasons--for example, poor procedure and lack of public awareness. On this occasion, I agree--unusually--with the Deputy Prime Minister, who recently, during Prime Minister's questions, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Ministers have continually said that we shall consider all suggestions for improving transplant rates, but any proposed measures in that sensitive area will have to command public confidence and support."--[<i>Official Report,</i> 30 June 1999; Vol. 334, c. 343.]

That is something around which all hon. Members could unite.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91214h01_para8">On a positive note, what could be done to improve the present system under the current legislation? The donor card system was introduced in 1971. It is purely voluntary, and my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), who will speak in the debate, has some excellent proposals for publicising that. To put it rather brutally, the butchers' offal approach of the tick as to which organs one wishes to donate--eyes, heart, lungs, pancreas and so on-- tends to put many people off signing a donor card. I hope that the Minister will, if <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 3WH</B></P>
nothing else, consider whether the donor card wording can be altered so that one merely ticks the box if one wishes to donate any organs. I can see no reason why there should be a distinction between different organs. As a start, all Members of Parliament and all those connected with the medical profession should volunteer to carry one. I hope that all Members of Parliament will pledge to do that as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para9">The voluntary consent part of the driving licence is almost unknown to most people. When I first passed my test, far too many years ago to remember, I signed the organ donation part of the licence and put a little note in with it. However, that was a long time ago, and few people now realise that the driving licence contains such a provision. I am sure that the Government could do much more to publicise that avenue to allow people to inform those concerned that they wish to have their organs donated.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para10">The national organ register should be properly updated and overhauled. It should be computerised and made available on the internet, and the Government should be much more proactive in making the contents of the register known. Robert Sells, the professor of transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool University hospital, recently stated in a British Kidney Patient Association silver lining appeal brochure of December 1999, that in Spain, in 1986, the number of organ donations was drastically improved by introducing into hospital intensive care units a co-ordinator who was directly responsible to the chief executive of each hospital for counselling those who might be prepared to donate their organs. That dramatically increased the number of organ donations from six people per million in the population in 1985 to 31 per million in 1988. As a result, Spain's transplant waiting lists have fallen. Waiting times for liver and heart transplants are considerably shorter, and Spain now exports organs to other European countries. That is a very positive development, which the Minister may wish to consider. Robert Sells said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It seems clear beyond doubt to practically every transplant surgeon world wide that the adoption of such a system would produce an immediate increase in organ donation. I believe the effects would be particularly beneficial in this country where there are too few co-ordinators, who generally work within inadequate job descriptions and with inappropriate salaries."

It is arduous work, of course, and, in Spain,co-ordinators work within the system for only three to four years, after which they move on to other specialties in the medical profession. The introduction of properly trained co-ordinators who could counsel relatives at a time of grief and distress and advise on organ donation would be a positive step forward.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91214h01_para11">I call on the Minister to establish a task force with a cross-departmental remit, which could consider organ donations in the light of the cost to the NHS of, for example, daily dialysis. It could also consider whether the law should be changed. At the moment, the general presumption is that those who wish to donate organs should opt in to the system. That general presumption should be reviewed. As I said, the British Medical Association has, for the first time, changed its policy on <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 4WH</B></P>
the matter. I know that the Minister and his colleagues have said in the House that there would be no advantage in changing the general presumption. I am not sufficiently qualified to judge, but experts should consider the matter in depth.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para12">The third job for the task force would be to consider the issue of public awareness and education. It would have a remit to employ public relations consultants to consider whether a general advertising and publicity splurge would be of benefit. Such a campaign took place in 1995 and 1998 with only limited success, although it was perhaps not planned and conceived as well as it should have been. A campaign to increase awareness of the voluntary systems of donor cards, licence forms and the national organ donation register could have considerable benefit. It would enable people to consider the issue well in advance of an untimely death. The problem with the present system is that, when someone dies, people naturally suffer much distress and grief, and they often make decisions that they later regret. Therefore, if the public were educated well in advance of such events, it would be a great benefit to all concerned.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para13">Life is short. No one knows when a life-threatening emergency condition is likely to occur. Such a condition could occur to any of us tomorrow. I hope that the Minister has listened to my speech, and that a few notches of progress will follow. I pledge to apply for a donor card today. I hope that all Members of Parliament, and everyone connected with the medical profession, will, as a matter of course, carry donor cards, and make it known to their relatives that they have done so.


<P>

<a name="91214h01_time1"><H5>10.13 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew5"><B> Mr. Tam Dalyell  (Linlithgow):</B> 
 The House is in the debt of the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), for his choice of subject and for his constructive speech.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para14">I should like to begin by putting a question to my hon. Friend the Minister of State. What are the Department of Health's latest figures on the shortage of organs? In this Room last night, Professor Robert Winston was asked about organ shortage, and replied that the American figure was much more accurate than the British one. He put the American figure at 600,000. If we were to divide that according to population, our figure would be 140,000 to 150,000. Would the Department of Health accept such an estimate?
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para15">I have a history of interest in this matter. On several occasions in the 1970s I tabled a Bill to allow hospitals to take the organs of anyone other than those who had contracted out through the centre at Bristol. As often happens with Members of Parliament, my interest arose from a case in my constituency--an especially poignant case when I was a new Member of Parliament. It concerned a 23-year-old teacher called Grant Allen, whose parents begged for an organ to save his life. We did not succeed--there was no matching tissue to be had--but I undertook to those people that, as long asI remained a Member of Parliament, I would take an interest in the subject. It is tragic that so many useful organs go into the incinerator.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para16">I believe passionately that decisions on these matters--as the hon. Member for Cotswold mentioned--should not be made at the point of maximum grief. In 1969, I was <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 5WH</B></P>
parliamentary private secretary in the Department of Health to Richard Crossman when Sir Hector Maclennan, the distinguished doctor and father of the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan), chaired a report on organ donation. The recommendations of the Maclennan committee were somewhat ambiguous, but opting out was left as an option. With the encouragement of the then chief medical officer, Sir George Godber, and his deputy, Dr. Henry Yellowless, I conducted a survey--which took 42 days--of 1,000 people in my constituency. A Member of Parliament can talk confidentially as a pollster cannot, and I remember the results of the survey very well. Of those 1,000 people, 372 would have agreed to the opting-out scheme, while 316 preferred the voluntary system. A further 108 were passionately against it, on various different grounds. Of those, three state registered nurses separately told me to do something about the common hernia first, but that was 30 years ago. Expectations have risen since then, and people think that they have the right to sophisticated and, as my hon. Friend the Minister knows, extremely expensive operations. Will my hon. Friend consider whether the opting-out scheme should at least be tried? Hospitals would be able to take the organs of anyone other than those who had opted out during their lifetime, after clinical death has been established by two separate doctors, neither of whom is the renal surgeon.
 
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para17">My friend Roy Calne briefed me on the proposals that I put forward 30 years ago. The hon. Member for Cotswold referred to Robert Sells; he had great reservations about my proposal on the ground that it might lessen the number of available organs. I will not hide the fact that there was a considerable difference of opinion among distinguished renal surgeons, and I do not pretend that all the argument is one way. Given a desperate shortage of organs, different expectations, and the greater chance of success, however, the Department of Health should consider the introduction of an opting-out scheme.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para18">Ironically, the flow of organs was lessened by a new piece of legislation--the seatbelt legislation. Thankfully, that has reduced markedly the number of deaths from motor accidents. Therefore, organs, especially those of young people, are not as available as they were before.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew6"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, in 1997, the French changed the law in favour of an opt-out system?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew7"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: Yes, I am. Other countries have done so, and the hon. Gentleman's description of the Spanish scheme deserves a long and detailed answer. The French have succeeded, as has Israel, and with considerable effect. It is ironic that opposition comes from strange places. When I introduced a ten-minute Bill on the matter for a second time, the right hon Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir Edward Heath), the then Prime Minister, stayed to hear the debate, which was most unusual. Afterwards, he said that, although he personally sympathised with my view, I would never persuade Keith Joseph, the then Secretary of State for Social Services. I was a bit vexed, therefore, to discover <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 6WH</B></P>
that the former chief rabbi, the late Sir Immanuel Rehobovits, who passionately opposed the idea, managed to persuade Keith Joseph against it, even though Israel had introduced a successful system. There are a variety of views, but the hon. Gentleman has made an important point.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew8"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that it was Sir Keith Joseph who introduced the voluntary donor card system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew9"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: Yes, he introduced that system, but it has proved far less successful than he anticipated because none of us wants to contemplate our own demise. People forget to carry donor cards because they take the view that, if they are to step under the proverbial bus, at least it will not happen this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para19">The issue is complicated. A number of those who, in the heat of the moment, refused to donate the organs of loved ones have subsequently said, "If we had thought about the issue, we should of course have liked to help someone else." Many such people take the rather curious view that the organs of a deceased loved one are still alive. The subject provokes strong emotions. On conducting my survey, I discovered great differences in attitudes towards, for example, the kidney and the heart. I vividly recall one woman who told me, "They can take what they like from my husband, but not his heart. The heart is something different--that belongs to me." One might say that that is irrational, and that the heart is only a pump, but such feelings nevertheless remain.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para20">Last night, a fascinating meeting about the question of therapeutic cloning took place in this Hall. Perhaps the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), who was present, intends to discuss it. Professor Lord Winston, who was in attendance, argued that we must consider generating organs for the future. He explained the advantages of transplanting cardiac cells, for example, that could assist bladder transplants, and therapeutic cloning. He called for facilitating directed cell culture and emphasised that, potentially, embryonic cells could be used directly for specific purposes, particularly the improvement of chromosomal disorders. He cited the transplant of neurals, which would help in the treatment of Alzheimer's. Those of us who saw Mohammad Ali on television the other evening will recognise the possibilities of such developments.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para21">The growth and use of tissues and embryonic cells to cope with illnesses such as mitochondrial disorders are complicated issues. Has the Department of Health considered the possible legislative consequences of the remarkable developments at Hammersmith hospital, Imperial college and a number of other centres throughout Britain, not least in Edinburgh and Glasgow, with which I am particularly familiar? In view of the limited time, I close with that question.


<P>

<a name="91214h01_time2"><H5>10.25 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew10"><B> Mr. Desmond Swayne  (New Forest, West):</B> 
 I have one point to which I want briefly to draw the Chamber's attention. To a large extent, I share the views expressed by the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), and would countenance an opt-out scheme rather than an <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 7WH</B></P>
opt-in scheme. However, having spoken to a number of surgeons, it would appear that relatives refuse organ donations only rarely. As the hon. Gentleman noted, to some extent the supply of potential donors has declined because of improvements in the treatment of road traffic accident victims, a decline in the severity of such injuries, and a reduced number of intracranial vascular ruptures.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para22">However, the use of elective ventilation has helped partially to restore that supply. On behalf of Mr. Curry, who is a constituent of mine, I recently wrote to the Minister on the matter. In 1993, when elective ventilation was in its infancy, pioneering work was undertaken at the Royal Devon and Exeter hospital. With relatives' consent, patients who were close to death were placed on ventilators, enabling their organs to be made available for transplant. Had they been allowed to die, it would not have been possible to recover those organs. Elective ventilation increased the availability of organs at that pioneering centre by 50 per cent. in 1993.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para23">However, elective ventilation was reluctantly abandoned by the Department on the basis of legal opinion. I do not know whether that opinion related to the Human Tissues Act or the presumption in common law that medical treatment must benefit the patient. Irrespective of the consent of relatives, a person who is close to death cannot be placed on a ventilator for someone else's benefit. That is an anomalous situation. We allow minors--children under the age of proper, rational consent--to donate bone marrow for the benefit of others. They are subjected to a medical process that is not exclusively for their own benefit. In other words, the underlying principle is exactly the same as for elective ventilation. If we would not dream of doing without bone marrow transplants, why has the law been used to put an end to elective ventilation?
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para24">I urge the Minister to amend the law, so that we can overcome the presumption in common law against elective ventilation and restore what was a promising supply of potential organs for donation.


<P>

<a name="91214h01_time3"><H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew11"><B> Dr. Evan Harris  (Oxford, West and Abingdon):</B> 
 I, too, pay tribute to the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) for introducing the debate, and also to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) for his contributions over many years, and for the help and advice that he has given me. I also want to comment on a provocative and thoughtful--I will not say uncharacteristic--contribution from the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne).
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para25">It is important to make it clear that different issues relating to this matter are discussed in the media. First, there are the decisions about the use of tissues that have to be taken at a coroner's post mortem. Under current law, when cause of death needs to be established, there is no opportunity for relatives to say that there should not be a coroner's post mortem and that such tissues that are needed to make a diagnosis should not be removed. I do not think that there is a general call for relatives to be able to veto the actions of a coroner and a pathologist in establishing the cause of death.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para26">There is also the matter, both ethically and in practice, of the retention of organs for research purposes. We deprecate the fact that in at least one hospital it has been <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 8WH</B></P>
common practice after post mortems--whether coroners' post mortems or others--to retain organs for research purposes, or any other purposes, without consent being sought from the surviving relatives of adults, or from the parents of dead children. It is accepted as good medical practice--the only ethical medical practice--to seek that consent. Those research projects should seek ethical consent through a local research ethics committee, which would insist that adequate, informed consent procedures exist for such relatives, as did the committee on which I sat for some years.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para27">As the hon. Member for Cotswold recognised, those situations are different from the issue of organ donation for transplant purposes, which has occupied most of our time in this debate so far. The Human Tissue Act 1961 must at least be considered for significant repair because of the lack of clarity in its wording, and the problems that that causes for people awaiting transplants. I can give the hon. Member for Linlithgow the figures he seeks, as, I am sure, can the Minister. In 1998, 7 per cent. fewer organ transplants were carried out in the United Kingdom than in 1997, and in the same period the waiting list for those requiring organ transplants to save or transform their lives increased by 3 per cent.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para28">The increasing gap between supply and demand appears to be a continuing trend, and figures more recent than those that I quoted show a continuing decline in the number of organ transplants carried out, and an increase in the number of people on the transplant waiting list. The number of people on the waiting list is the tip of the iceberg, compared withthe number who would benefit from organ transplantation. Because so few people are likely to have a transplant, relatively few are given the false promise of being placed on a transplant waiting list.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para29">As I said when I introduced a ten-minute Bill on the matter to an empty Government Front Bench--the Minister has assiduously attended discussions on this issue since then--a silent tragedy is taking place. Thousands of people are dying for want of an organ that could save or transform their lives, while many organs are being buried or cremated with their hosts. Many of those hosts, had they thought about the issue and had an opportunity to register their view, would not have objected to their organs being used in the event of their death to save the lives of others. The tragedy of such preventable deaths is a stark one, not only for those of us who have worked in medicine on both sides of the donation and transplantation field, but for those on transplant waiting lists.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para30">One partial solution to the problem would be a shift, after a suitable period of education to obtain broad public consent, to a system of presumed consent. That would give people several opportunities to register the fact that they did not wish to have their organs used, whether through driving licences, tax returns, electoral registration or at post offices. Their views would be respected; they would be registered on a database which would be checked. That would strongly encourage, if not force, people to consider the issue of death before they might wish to do so, especially young people who are often tragically in a position to donate following traumatic injury. They think that they are immortal and do not like to think about death.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 9WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h01_para31">Public opinion polls ask whether people prefer the current system, in which they do not have to think about the issue unless choosing to seek a donation card, to one in which they would have to discuss the matter with relatives and register their views. The result of those polls, as the Government will suggest, may well be that people prefer the status quo. Of course people will say that, but we must recognise that there are other interests at stake--those of patients awaiting an organ transplant and their relatives.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para32">The evidence suggests that, if that system were introduced properly and carefully, the supply of organs could be increased. That would be one benefit. A second benefit would be that the wishes of the donor would be paramount, and the tragic situations that arise at the moment would no longer do so. At present, in a large number of cases, no one knows the view of the potential donor; and relatives, at the height of their grief, have to second-guess that view. I can tell the hon. Member for New Forest, West that as a result of surveys--I do not think that this is contentious--we know that, in about a third of such cases, relatives refuse consent when asked. I do not necessarily blame them for that, although we know from Spanish surveys that at least 30 per cent. of them regret that refusal a year later. That is not surprising: I would not trust myself to make those decisions at the start of a grieving period. Therefore, the presumed consent system would not only increase the supply of organs, which would save lives, but give primacy to the views of the donor, which is critical.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew12"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: The hon. Gentleman is a doctor, and I am not. Is it not asking rather a lot of doctors, when they have been struggling to save someone, to summon the energy to ask such terrible questions? Those questions would have to be asked within half an hour, otherwise deterioration would set in. I would not blame doctors for not putting those questions to relatives at such a time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew13"><B> Dr. Harris </B> 
: The people who have to seek consent--doctors, nurses and transplant co-ordinators--do a valuable job, and it is part of their role. Learning how to achieve consent should be, and in most places is, part of their training. As a doctor, I find it much easier to approach relatives when the views of the deceased are known. In my forecast scenario, one could explain to the relative that their loved one had not opted out of the scheme and might well have discussed the matter with them. In the light of that, one could ask the relative whether they had any subsequent knowledge that the deceased did not want his or her organs to be donated. The deceased person's views would be of primary concern. Only in the event of a fundamental objection from a relative should the presumed consent opt-out system be overruled.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew14"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: On the issue of presumed consent, what does the hon. Gentleman think of the idea that solicitors should be encouraged to ask clients of sound mind drawing up a will to include a positive clause stating that they wished to have their organs donated in the event of their death?

<P>

reasonable, except in a small minority of circumstances. However, if that promotes discussion of people's wishes with their relatives--the filling in of donor cards by the minority of people who carry them often does so--that can only be desirable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew16"><B> Dr. Liam Fox  (Woodspring):</B> 
 On this interesting part of the hon. Gentleman's speech, does he have any data to share with the House on the experience of countries with an opt-out system and the relative shortage or otherwise of organs? If he does not have the information, I am sure that the Minister can provide it. One fact to be considered when examining an opt-out system is whether it has worked in other countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew17"><B> Dr. Harris </B> 
: The hon. Gentleman makes a critical point. The BMA has adopted that policy. I would not want the scheme to be introduced if there was not clear evidence that it would increase the supply of organs if introduced in the most effective way, following best practice in Europe, where practice is variable. There should be a Government-sponsored programme of education and research because the worst that could happen would be to have this controversial debate--my postbag shows that it is controversial--with no evidence available. I have examined the Belgium system and there was a clear increase in the number of available organs. Useful controls were Holland, which has a similar culture, and some hospitals in Belgium, which did not change the system, but were subject to the same education process and publicity about the change in the law. Neither experienced the increase in organ donation that the Belgian hospitals which did switch experienced.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para33">In a consensus statement on meeting the organ shortage, the Council of Europe stated: 
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Presumed consent laws, when fully accepted, seem to benefit donation".

It went on to refer to a Belgian paper by Dr. Roels, which set out the evidence. Professor Gells, who was cited earlier, was a member of the European transplantation forum, headed by Professor Kennedy. In a paper in <i>The Lancet</i> a few years ago it stated why it believed that a presumed consent system could work.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91214h01_para34">I turn to the existing possibilities for improving the current system which the Government should consider. The donor register is a useful idea, but is unwieldy. People on the register are never taken off, even after they have died. There is no automatic link between certification of death and removal from the register. That cannot be sensible. People may change their names when they marry and for other reasons, but there is no link between the marriage certification system and the donor register.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para35">The Minister's colleagues at the Home Office and the Treasury have been apprised of the situation by the campaign group, Donor 2001, which proposed the use of electoral registration forms for registration on the donor register. In Taunton Deane borough, that produced remarkable results, with an increase in the number of people registering as donors--10,000 new registrations from a total of 44,000 people. That shows that presumed consent is not the only idea in my locker. I pay tribute to Councillor John Meikle, who promoted the scheme. People in Taunton Deane, as well as Donor 2001, are frustrated that the Home Secretary is not as <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 11WH</B></P>
enthusiastic about extending the scheme as the Government have been about extending all sorts of schemes with less strong data for the success of the pilot schemes.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para36">Elective ventilation is an interesting idea. As the hon. Member for New Forest, West suggested, under common law treatment should only be given for the benefit of the patient. Another practical problem is the chronic shortage of intensive care beds. Someone might have opted for future elective ventilation, but ventilators or intensive care beds might not be available. Despite my support for presumed consent, I believe that the Government could increase the supply of organ donors at a stroke simply by increasing the resources for, and the number of beds on, intensive care units. There is medical consensus for that. The legal barrier to elective ventilation could be circumvented if the law were changed to allow the existing donor card to offer an opt-in to future elective ventilation. Consent would then be given for that intervention, albeit not for the benefit of the person concerned.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para37">The increasing use of non-beating heart donations for kidney donation needs to be considered. The Government should promulgate a debate on the ethics and practicalities of xenotransplantation before irrational opposition on health grounds and spurious ethical grounds takes over the argument as it took over the argument on genetically modified organisms.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para38">Therapeutic cloning should also be considered. It was disappointing to many scientists and clinicians when the Government rejected the advice of their advisory groups--the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification--and set up yet another working party to consider whether research would be useful. The usual way of finding out whether research would be useful is to do that research. A huge amount of work remains to be done on transplantation and donation. The Royal College of Surgeons produced a report, the author of which was my constituent, Professor Sir Peter Morris, on organ transplantation. It suggested that, in addition to donor issues, a series of issues needs to be considered, including the organisation of transplantation services, an increased supply of junior doctors to become transplant surgeons and a national transplant service and strategy to deliver increased efficiency using available organs. I hope that the Minister will respond to that working party and adopt many, if not all, of its recommendations.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para39">I thank the hon. Member for Cotswold once again for introducing the debate.


<P>

<a name="91214h01_time4"><H5>10.46 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew18"><B> Mr. Nick Harvey  </B> 
(North Devon): I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) on introducing the debate. I saw the title of his intended debate last week and thought that it would provide the opportunity to bring together several different issues, but when I listened to the hon. Gentleman this morning, he suggested a closer connection between the issues than actually exists.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para40">Hon. Members may know that, for several years, I have been involved with the Bristol heart action group, which brings together the relatives of those whose babies <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 12WH</B></P>
died in the tragedy at Bristol royal infirmary. In that connection, I have recently taken an interest in events at Alder Hey hospital, and there is now a connection between the two groups of parents.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para41">The hon. Member for Cotswold said that no one was accusing doctors of deliberately removing organs without the consent of relatives--

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew19"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: I did not say that. I said that it was not acceptable for any organs to be removed when the consent of the relatives had not been properly given.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew20"><B> Mr. Harvey </B> 
: I am sorry. I misrepresented the hon. Gentleman and I am grateful to him for correcting me.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para42">It would be too benign an interpretation of what happened at Bristol, Alder Hey and, I suspect, many other places, if not generally, to say that doctors have not removed organs without the consent of relatives. That seems to have happened on an extraordinarily wide scale and has, understandably, caused great alarm. I have not seen any suggestion that the purpose of that removal of organs was in any way to assist with the supply of organs for transplantation. In a macabre way, that would almost have been more acceptable.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para43">The organs were retained principally for research. The Royal College of Pathologists is conducting a review of its guidelines and issued a document on which it is consulting. That document makes it clear that there are a number of sound medical reasons for retaining organs. It describes the ideal practice for pathologists when explaining to relatives the possible reasons for retaining organs and the advantages that might accrue from that. It also stated that, when that is done sensitively but determinedly, it is unusual for relatives not to give permission for organs to be retained. The considerable advantages that that involves include medical research benefits and the fact that a fuller understanding is later available about why the death took place when it did. The document also suggests--

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew21"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) make the same case. In the article that I referred to earlier, Professor Robert Sells states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Although there has been a significant rise in living organ donation during the last two years, 30 per cent. of relatives still object to organs being removed from a bereaved loved one."

That conflicts with the hon. Gentleman's argument.

<P>
<P>
</UL></FONT><a name="91214h01_spnew22"><B> Mr. Harvey </B> 
: In fairness, we are discussing two slightly different matters. I was discussing retention of organs after a post mortem when there has been a suggestion that doing so may teach us about the medical circumstances of the death. I was not discussing those who died in, for example, accidents.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para44">The royal college has made suggestions about what should be best practice in terms of explaining to and communicating with bereaved relatives. If such an approach were adopted in general, there would not be such a scandal about the retention of organs. However, that approach is not common practice. No one really knows what the scale of organ retention is--it has a chequered pattern throughout the country. Some hospitals that have retained organs on a widespread basis do not know why they are doing it, and in the most bizarre <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 13WH</B></P>
cases hospitals have lost documentation about the organs that they have. They might find some years later that they have all sorts of organs about which they had forgotten because they did not have the proper records.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para45">The situation throughout the country is a grim and grizzly picture. The previous Secretary of State rightly instructed the chief medical officer to conduct a national survey to establish, as best he can, a national picture. The Secretary of State helped me to speak to the chief medical officer about that matter; I believe that he has the right approach and that if he can obtain honest, candid and accurate responses from hospital authorities we could form a better idea about what to do next.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para46">This subject involves various strange developments. Parents at Bristol have had to go through three separate phases of grief. They suffered the initial grief of losing a baby unexpectedly. Years after they had got over that, they discovered that the circumstances of their baby's death was part of a wider picture involving the incompetence of medical professionals, which re-opened their wounds. Having come to terms with that, they suffered a third grief--they discovered that organs that they believed had been buried or cremated with their child had been retained without their knowledge or permission.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para47">Parents who cremated their babies are in strange legal territory because it is not legally permissible to cremate organs on their own. I am grateful to the Home Office for its response in this regard. When it learned about the parents' distress it adopted--or it encouraged a funeral director to adopt--a pragmatic interpretation of the law in this regard. That enabled people in the south-west and south Wales to go to that funeral director, whose approach disregarded the problem. The Home Office is aware that the subject needs to be revisited in a legal review.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para48">Several hon. Members have already discussed the shortage of organs that are available for transplantation. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) and the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) appeared to support an opt-out system. The key point, which has been made by the BMA and by my hon. Friend, is that our approach should be considered only after extensive public education, advertising and debate. The decision to go down that road should be made only when the process of education and advertising has advanced considerably. Evidence from other countries suggests that that approach can produce a better supply of organs, which has tangible benefits. There are various reasons why other countries have a better supply, and we need to be aware of them all when we consider the matter.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para49">I was struck by the evidence that the hon. Member for Cotswold quoted about the impact of counselling on the number of people who are prepared to sign up. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon and the hon. Member for Linlithgow mentioned breakthroughs in scientific advances, which will increase the need and demand for organs. I hope that the Minister of State will discuss that.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para50">The hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) rightly discussed ventilation, which has been stopped on legal grounds. I echo his call on the Minister to consider whether changes in the law might enable us to get around that problem.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 14WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h01_para51">My key point is that I do not believe that there is any connection between this macabre, horrible and widespread practice of organ retention--when the chief medical officer has completed his survey, I suspect that it may be found to have occurred on a larger scale than some press reports have speculated--and transplantation, both of which are serious issues. As many hon. Members said this morning, it is vital to obtain a better supply of organs for transplantation.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para52">Finally, I echo the words of those hon. Members who congratulated the hon. Member for Cotswold on securing a debate on these two interesting issues.


<P>

<a name="91214h01_time5"><H5>10.57 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew23"><B> Dr. Liam Fox  (Woodspring):</B> 
 I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) on securing this debate and on raising several important issues. I also echo the views of the hon. Member for North Devon (Mr. Harvey), who said that we are discussing distinct issues that should not be regarded as being exactly the same.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para53">My constituency shares borders with the relevant Bristol constituencies, and I entirely understand the despair of the parents who are involved. They discovered that their consent had not been sought at the time and later they were not given information about decisions. It is the latter fact that caused them so much grief so late in the day. As the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) said, all hon. Members must accept that the removal of organs for research without proper ethical consent is totally unacceptable. I am sure that there is no difference of opinion in that regard between the political parties.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para54">Our debate today is inevitably tinged with sadness. We are carrying the burden of the hopes of the chronically sick, who want something that we all take for granted--the chance to have a normal life span. We must balance that against the sadness of the untimely death of an otherwise healthy person and the inevitable grief of his or her relatives, who find it difficult to make rational decisions at that time.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para55">A third sadness is also involved--it concerns the small number of people who carry donor cards or who are donor registered. While my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold was speaking, I checked to see whether my donor card was in my wallet, but I discovered that it was not there. I wonder how often that happens. Those of us who believe that we are willing to give any of our organs for transplantation may walk outside and be hit by the proverbial bus, but we may find it difficult to have our wishes carried out. Of course, in that situation we would also be suffering the difficulty of having been hit by a bus.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para56">What reforms should be introduced? The purpose of debates in this Chamber is to raise issues and to give pointers about what should be done. We want the 4,000 patients who are awaiting kidney transplantation and who are on dialysis, and those who suffer from cardiomyopathies and who are awaiting a heart transplant, to be given the chance to have a healthy life style. As several hon. Members have said, we must avoid the heartbreaking situation that involves patients having to watch their chance of life being buried or cremated--they are denied the healthy existence that we all take for granted.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 15WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h01_para57">As the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) said, we are in some ways the victims of our own success. Our success in reducing death from road traffic accidents, not least through our seat belt legislation, has put us into a more difficult position in that we now have fewer organs available for transplantation from otherwise healthy adults. We created that problem through legislation and we have a duty to try to address it.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para58">I would like the Minister to reply to two or three specific points. At the moment, we are all consumed by millennium hysteria and all sorts of frivolous projects for our entertainment are being proposed. I hope that Parliament can give a lead by setting up some projects that will give a chance, not for entertainment, but for survival. We as a population have many contacts with health professionals and next year, as part of the millennium celebrations, I would like the Minister to dedicate a month in which everyone who has contact with a health professional--a GP, a hospital doctor, a pharmacist, or a dentist, for example--is given a form to register as a donor, and in which every health professional tells everyone that he or she comes into contact with what can be achieved, as part of a wider programme of health education. It will not cost anything and will take only a few moments of a health professional's time, but could make a huge difference in terms of public education and understanding.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para59">Will the Minister consult his colleagues to see whether it is possible to include a form with the annual communication that we all receive--those of us who fail to fill in the form on time receive several of them--on electoral registration? It would go to every household, at almost no cost to Government, and increase public awareness of what can be done simply by filling in a form. Those are cost-free measures that cut across Governments and across Departments and are easily achievable, giving vast benefit to all our society, not least to those who need a transplant. As the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said, we need an updated donor register, using the available information technology, to ensure that the information is always available at our fingertips at the correct time. It is all very well to spend an hour and a half debating the issues--an hour and a half immediately after death is a long time. The decisions have to be made very quickly.
 
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para60">In presenting this debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold talked about the difficult position of relatives at a time of great grief and reduced ability to make rational decisions. We all understand that, but it gives all the greater urgency to the proposal for an education project. My hon. Friend referred to the Spanish survey showing the number of people who make a decision that they regret later. I am sure that everyone present sympathises with that plight. It seems to add an unnecessary grief to those who have already undergone the pain of bereavement.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para61">We need to have the political debate on opting out. I understand why Ministers would find that difficult. I have no doubt that the civil servants advising the Minister will be saying, "But Minister, can you imagine the story in the tabloids when for the first time a mother says that her daughter just did not get round to opting out, but always wanted to, and that her organs have <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 16WH</B></P>
been taken against her will?" Ministers will face that unpalatable situation and we can all imagine the tabloid treatment that such a case would attract. However, we balance that against the real, on-going tragedy, not of those in elected office, but of those who are being denied the chance of a healthy life because of the shortage of organs for transplantation. We need to put the interests of those people higher up the agenda.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew24"><B> Dr. Harris </B> 
: I accept the necessity for the balance to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but it must be stressed that the system of presumed consent proposed by the BMA could involve a check with relatives--not necessarily to ask their views, but to ask whether they knew of any undisclosed wish on the part of the deceased to opt out. That would underline a respect for the donor's wishes. There will be people who never got round to opting out but who discussed doing so, and that must be recognised since I do not doubt that there might be controversial media coverage of occasional cases with any system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew25"><B> Dr. Fox </B> 
: I am sure that that is correct. My point was simply that there will always be political resistance to a Minister, of whatever party, being pilloried in the tabloid press and being made a scapegoat in what may be rather unpleasant coverage.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para62">I would like the Minister to tell us about the evidence from other countries on opting out and what difference it has made to the number of organs available. I note that one of his colleagues said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"More importantly, there is no evidence from European countries that have an opt-out that it would increase the number of organs available."--[<i>Official Report</i>, 19 October 1999; Vol. 336, c. 245.]
 
I would like to know the basis for that information and whether it can be published by Ministers so that we can have a better-informed debate.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91214h01_para63">My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) mentioned elective ventilation. Again, I would like the Minister to comment on what consideration is being given to that. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon mentioned the shortage of intensive care beds; that will be a major practical problem, but perhaps the Minister could deal with the theoretical rather than the practical aspect of that and let us know the Government's thinking on it.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para64">Finally, I hope that our actions and our words today remove a great source of sadness, despair and unnecessary death. We have a chance to give life and there can be no duty on us, as Members of Parliament, greater than that. I hope that we do not fail in that duty.

<a name="91214h01_spmin0"><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Mr. John Hutton) </B> 
: I warmly congratulate the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) on raising these important matters and on giving us the opportunity to discuss what has turned out to be a wide range of matters relating to organ donation and transplantation--matters which, as all hon. Members have said, touch on complex ethical, moral and legal considerations. I shall try to respond to all the points that have been made.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 17WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h01_para65">The hon. Member for Cotswold expressed his concerns about the developments at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool and about the issue of the removal of organs. The hon. Member for North Devon (Mr. Harvey) also spent considerable time on that point. Both hon. Members made good speeches, with thoughtful and substantial content. It may be helpful if I set some of the issues at Alder Hey into context and offer some thoughts about the legal background to them.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para66">Evidence given to the Bristol Royal infirmary inquiry in September indicated that organs removed following post mortems were being stored at hospitals elsewhere in the country, including at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool. Local investigations at Alder Hey revealed an additional issue, relating to organs allegedly retained in breach of protocols by a pathologist undertaking research into sudden infant death syndrome. Consequently, this debate is set against a background of increasing sensitivities and serious concerns around the protocols governing the retention of tissues and organs at post-mortem examination.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para67">The events at Alder Hey children's hospital are obviously enormously distressing for the families concerned and present major questions about children's organ retention in the NHS. I, as I am sure do all hon. Members, extend my sympathies to all the families concerned in this tragedy. An internal inquiry, which the local trust set up when the issue first came to light, is due to report early in the new year. It is essential that we now seek to restore public confidence in health services at Alder Hey children's hospital, a hospital with a fine reputation for high-quality care for children.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para68">On 3 December, we announced that we would set up an independent inquiry into the events at Alder Hey children's hospital, which will report to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State by the end of March next year. That report will be made public. A team comprising a patient's representative, a leading pathologist and someone with an appropriate legal qualification will conduct the inquiry, which will be entirely independent of the hospital. The inquiry will specifically consider what happened at Alder Hey to identify lessons to be learned, and to recommend to the Secretary of State further actions that might be necessary to reform organ retention practices at the hospital and to better support the families affected.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para69">Before the Bristol Royal infirmary and Alder Hey cases became the subject of media attention, my Department and the Royal College of Pathologists had begun work on new guidelines in recognition of the sensitivities around the issue and the need for greater openness. The new guidelines for the retention of tissues at post-mortem examination are being developed in the light of the need for greater openness and better public information, married to best clinical practice. Wide consultation has ensured that the views of patient representatives have been taken on board.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para70">The guidelines represent a dramatic shift in approach, with an emphasis on transparency and sensitive management of the bereaved, which are concerns that we have all referred to today. They also include a new model consent form for bereaved relatives to sign. We hope that the guidelines will be ready for dissemination in the new year, and the Department will clearly need to scrutinise them closely.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 18WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h01_para71">Several hon. Members referred to the present legislation regulating organ removal during post mortems, so it might help if I spoke about those provisions. It will not surprise hon. Members to discover that the legal situation is complex. I do not think that I have ever been asked to make a speech in which I have not been given that to say. The legal situation is always complex--a legacy from lawyers.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para72">As I understand it, the Coroners Act 1988 permits the removal of tissues and organs during the course of a post mortem called for by a coroner even without the agreement or consent of relatives. Rule 9 of the 1984 coroners rules permits the preservation of materials which, in a pathologist's opinion, bear on the cause of death. In relation to coroners' post mortems, organs can be retained only to establish the cause of death and for such time as agreed by a coroner. In Britain, 90 per cent. of post mortems are called for by coroners and are therefore conducted under the 1988 Act.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para73">Hospital post mortems are quite different. The Human Tissue Act 1961 refers to the relative not objecting to the removal of organs. However, the Act does not specifically require the relative's consent before the removal of tissues or organs. The Act therefore makes no provision to determine the purpose for which any retained organs can be used. Previous practice in relation to hospital post mortems may not seem compatible with the modern concept of informed consent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew26"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: I would not try to amend the 1961 Act. Dr. Gavin Thurston, then an inner London coroner, wrote an interesting paper on the problems that face coroners. It was written a long time ago but may have current relevance. Will my hon. Friend ask his officials whether it is somewhere in the departmental archives?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew27"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has a legendary memory. I shall certainly make that inquiry and see what we can dig up.
 
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para74">I want to refer to the chief medical officer's inquiry, as several hon. Members have already done so. We asked him in October to investigate the scale of organ retention in the national health service generally, including in children's hospitals, and how NHS pathologists undertake that important work. The report will ensure that clinical practice on the subject throughout the NHS respects the rights and wishes of patients, while enabling the study of illness to benefit patients. We should always bear it in mind that the pathological and clinical examination of tissues and organs is a proper and important function of medical diagnosis and of furthering the understanding of medical science. Of course, as many hon. Members have made clear, those benefits must be balanced against the need for public acceptance and informed individual consent.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para75">The chief medical officer, Professor Liam Donaldson, will ensure that lessons from the events at Alder Hey children's hospital can be learned throughout the NHS. As part of his investigation, he is conducting a census of organ retention and practice on consent in all NHS hospitals in England. I am especially grateful to the hon. Member for North Devon for his support of that work. The chief medical officer's inquiry will consider the <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 19WH</B></P>
practice of removing and retaining organs as well as the legal framework in which that takes place. Ministers have asked him to provide a comprehensive report on how such matters can be dealt with in future.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para76">Much of our debate has focused on organ transplantation. Patients who might become donors are typically people in intensive care units who have had a sudden brain injury, such as a stroke, or as a result of a road accident. Of course, doctors' principal duty is to make every effort to save a patient's life. If a patient dies despite their efforts and is certified brain stem dead, organ donation can be considered. First, two doctors must be called in who have no connection to the transplantation unit. Each will independently carry out a series of tests to confirm that a patient is brain stem dead. When that has been confirmed, the local transplant co-ordinator is contacted. He will check to see if the potential donor has a card or is registered on the NHS organ donor register. I shall respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) about the register in a moment.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para77">If the deceased has made his or her wishes clear, the transplant co-ordinator can approach the family to discuss donation with confidence. Objection is almost unknown if families are aware that their loved ones wanted to donate. The hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) drew attention to the fact that he did not have his organ transplant card with him. We always point out how important it is that people who are willing to donate their organs communicate that to their families, so that even the physical absence of an organ donation card will not stand in the way of organ removal and transplantation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew28"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: There is a practical problem. A lot of people do not have their donor cards with them for one reason or another--their wallets might have been stolen, or they might have lost them. Will the Minister consider establishing a better link between those who carry organ donor cards and the placing of names on the national organ donor register? That way, it would be possible in a matter of seconds, even if people did not have their cards with them, to establish that they were willing to donate their organs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew29"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
: I hope that that would be the case in most circumstances, but I shall certainly consider that point. However, if organ donors have made no record of their wishes and their families have not discussed the issue, the transplant co-ordinator's task is much harder. Overall, three of every four families generously and courageously agree to donation.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para78">Whether there is a formal record of the wishes or not, the transplant co-ordinator will talk to families and ensure that they have no objection. There is no question of a transplant taking place against the wishes of the family. The history of the donor will also be checked to confirm that there are no medical or social contra-indications to donation.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para79">If permission is obtained, the transplant co-ordinator will contact the United Kingdom Transplant Support Service Authority. It maintains the national transplant database, which contains details of all potential organ <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 20WH</B></P>
transplants and recipients in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. A search of the database is made to find the most suitable patients. Once the patients and their locations are identified, the doctors at those transplant units are alerted and asked to confirm acceptance of the organ. As they do so, the preparation of their patients for the transplant operation begins.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para80">A team of specialist surgeons is called to the donor's hospital to carry out the surgery to remove and preserve the organs for transport to the transplant unit. If necessary, special transport arrangements will be made to ensure that no time is lost. The process of recovery and new life can then begin for the patient. Meanwhile, once the first immediate pain of bereavement has passed, many donor families find profound comfort in the thought that their relatives' organs have enabled others to live.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para81">Several hon. Members referred to the shortage of organs suitable for transplant. So far this year, 2,517 people have received life-saving operations. My figures are accurate up to 10 December, which was Friday of last week. Organs from 900 donors give a new lease of life to more than 3,000 people every year in the United Kingdom, and a further 3,000 people have their sight restored. Transplants are now so successful that many more patients can be considered for such treatment, as my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) said. More people are being added to the waiting list each week, faster than organs become available.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para82">Currently, 6,730 people are on the waiting list for transplantation in the United Kingdom. The vast majority of them are waiting for kidney transplants, and will have a much-reduced quality of life on dialysis while they are waiting. For those waiting for hearts or livers, there is of course no alternative to transplantation. As several hon. Members have rightly said, the success of other policies has exacerbated the problem of availability of organs for donation. The main source of organs suitable for donation is people who have died from sudden brain injury, such as that which can be caused by a stroke or a road traffic accident. Partly as a result of the legislation to which the hon. Member for Woodspring referred, the United Kingdom now has one of the lowest rates of road traffic deaths in the world. Together with advances in neurosciences, that has resulted in a reduction by about two thirds in deaths from intracranial haemorrhage since 1970. Those developments are significant and are warmly welcomed, but, as hon. Members have recognised, they have implications for the subject of the debate.
 
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para83">It is obviously urgent for many more of us to agree that when we die our organs should be used for transplantation. Some people have argued--we have heard such arguments today--that the shortage of organs means that we should change the basis of organ donation in Britain to an opt-out system, as the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon strongly believes. Such an approach would mean that, unless people have registered their unwillingness to be donors, their organs could be taken and used. Some people believe that that approach would lead to a vast increase in the number of organs available for transplantation, but the Government do not believe that that is the case.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 21WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h01_para84">The hon. Member for Woodspring referred to a parliamentary answer. We do not think that there is any clear evidence that, where an opt-out approach has been introduced and rates have risen, it is the sole factor in higher donation rates. Other important factors include different cultural attitudes to the disposal of bodies, greater numbers of intensive care beds, more aggressive procurement policies and road death rates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew30"><B> Dr. Fox </B> 
: Can the Minister assist the debate by publishing the data that the Department has considered in relation to differences in other countries, so that all hon. Members might have the benefit of being able to make up their minds on their importance?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew31"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
: We shall certainly share with the hon. Gentleman as much information as we can. As I understand it, his argument is that such information relates simply to the difference between an opt-out and an opt-in system, which can be quantified and measured in the availability of organs. I am trying to tell him and other hon. Members who have advanced similar arguments that the matter is not that simple.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew32"><B> Dr. Harris </B> 
: First, I have never said that an opt-out system would "vastly increase", to use the Minister's words, the number of available organs. I do not believe that supporters of such an approach have suggested that, and such a suggestion should not be put up just to be shot down. Secondly, supporters of a shift to presumed consent do not offer their support solely on the basis of the organ shortage. I have already referred to the paramountcy of the donor's views and to the need for relatives not to have to second-guess those. Thirdly, the European transplantation forum considered the evidence, and suggested that an opt-out system, such as that used in Belgium, could well be a factor in increased availability of organs. That change involved a control group of hospitals that did not shift to the new system and shared everything else in common with those in the rest of the country, but did not benefit from an increase in the supply of organs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew33"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
: I am well aware of the hon. Gentleman's views on the subject. He will know, however, that only the BMA--which is not an unimportant source of opinion--has supported his suggestion of an opt-out scheme. As I understand it, the professional opinion of most other relevant bodies is either divided or hostile to the notion. For example, I am advised that the United Kingdom Transplant Co-ordinators Association would not accept any version of the opt-out approach that did not include a requirement to gain family agreement. During the debate and, I think, in the summer, it has appeared that the hon. Gentleman does not support that suggestion. As I understand it, he would support the removal of an organ notwithstanding whether the family involved wished to withdraw consent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew34"><B> Dr. Harris </B> 
: I am grateful to the Minister for giving me the chance to clarify my views. As I said at the BMA conference, when relatives strongly object to organ removal, despite a donor having indicated that he or she wished to donate by not opting out when the <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 22WH</B></P>
opportunity arose, the relatives' wishes should be respected. I believe that the majority of people operating within the BMA and promulgating its policy recognise that practical point. It is fair to say that professional opinion is split. However, the trend among bodies such as the National Kidney Federation, which has adopted a policy of considering presumed consent after an education period, is towards considering the option.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h01_spnew35"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying that point, and I am sorry if I misrepresented his argument. I have listened closely to his remarks, however, and I understood him to be suggesting that an organ may be removed and made available for transplantation notwithstanding the strong views of family or relatives. The hon. Gentleman referred to Austria and Belgium, which are often cited as examples of countries with opt-out systems and higher donation rates than our own. However, those countries have double the road accident rates that we have. Organs are suitable for transplant only if the donor patient died as a result of sudden brain injury and was receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit when death occurred. Many such deaths occur as a result of road accidents.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para85">The concerns expressed today are evidence that public confidence in the system in place is crucial. We know that there is public support for the current system of donation, in which potential donors opt in, rather than for an opt-out or presumed consent approach. For example, a Department of Health survey commissioned in July found that 50 per cent. of people were in favour of the current system and that only 28 per cent. were in favour of an opt-out system. The hon. Gentleman will be familiar with the terms of the survey, as we have already discussed these matters. It established that there is a strong preference for the current system.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para86">The sensitivity of the organ donor programme to adverse publicity, to which the hon. Member for Woodspring rightly referred, has been illustrated by events in France, which has opt-out legislation. There was a strong public reaction when a couple discovered that their son's eyes had been removed against their wishes. That is exactly the scenario to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The incident received widespread coverage in the French media, and led to a 20 per cent. drop in organ donation and to a 30 per cent. drop in corneal donation. It took three to four years for the donation rate to recover. Such considerations are important, and we must keep them under review. To reassure the public, French law was amended to require relatives to be approached when the donor's wishes are not clear.
<P>

<a name="91214h01_para87">Although opt-out implies that organs should be taken unless the dead person is known to have objected to donation, doctors do not in practice assert their right to take organs against the wishes of the grieving family. Apart from sensitivity to families' distress, there are also practical difficulties, such as the need to consult the family in case there was something in a potential donor's health or life style that would make him or her unsuitable for donation.

<a name="91214h01_para88">I am not sure whether I shall be able to respond in the limited time remaining to all of the points made. I shall try to do so as quickly as possible. The hon.

<a name="91214h02_spnew0"><B> Mr. Harry Cohen  (Leyton and Wanstead):</B> 
 I have great pleasure in introducing this Adjournment debate--my first in Westminster Hall--on equal funding for men and women in sport. The emphasis of the debate is on boosting the position of women in sport. In this country, women in sport get a raw deal from the private sector in terms of sponsorship, pay and prize money, as well as from individuals, sports associations and television. Women also get a raw deal from the state through virtually all its agencies: central and local government, sports councils, centres of excellence and lottery funds. They certainly get a raw deal overall. In fact, the situation is so bad that many women are discouraged from pursuing their sport, even though they clearly have talent.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para0">The situation in the United States is very different, at least with regard to federal funding. The Education Amendment Acts of 1972 included a provision known as Title IX. Apart from some exemptions--for example, for colleges controlled by religious organisations or the military--Title IX forbids any education programme that receives federal funds from discriminating on the basis of sex. It provides that federal aid to any programme or institution that refuses to comply may be terminated. Title IX ensures equal funding and equal opportunities for athletics programmes in US schools and universities, regardless of sex. That policy is not only fairer but has been rewarded with success.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para1">In July, the United States women's football team won the women's world cup in sell-out stadiums. About 90,000 people saw the final at the Rose Bowl and another 40 million people watched it on television. My American friends, mostly men, were enormously excited at the achievement of their team. One said to me, "You should have a debate on Title IX in Parliament."
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para2">The <i>International Herald Tribune </i>of 3 July attributed the success of their team to Title IX and said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The women on the soccer team are products of competitive college sports programmes that did not exist before the law. Girls can now dream of a professional career in athletics, something that seemed unattainable even five years ago."

Although the article acknowledged that equality in sport has a long way to go, it said that it
<P>
<BR>
"holds the promise of what women in America can achieve in sports."

About 7.5 million girls now play soccer in the US, compared with 50,000 in Germany, which is the best figure that Europe can provide. The defender Lorrie Fair said:
<P>
<BR>
"Title IX has given girls something to shoot for. It sent the message that if you work hard you have the chance to play your sport at a high level and get a college education. It lets girls know there are opportunities out there for them."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91214h02_para3">Before the law in 1972, one girl participated in school and college sport for every 27 boys; now the figure is one to three. Before Title IX, only one in 27 women in high school played sport. That number has risen to one in nine. Sports scholarships are now more readily available to young women. On 28 June, Reuters reported that many of the most recognisable sports stars in the United States are now women: Sheryl Swoopes of the basketball team the Houston Comets; the tennis <P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Assured, aggressive and media-friendly, they and the US women's soccer team are a far cry from the earliest American female athletes, who were relegated to such ladylike sports as badminton and archery, which could be played in long dresses."

<a name="91214h02_para4">The publisher Suzanne Grimes said:

<P>
<P>
</UL></FONT><a name="91214h02_spnew1"><B> Charlotte Atkins  (Staffordshire, Moorlands):</B> 
 Is my hon. Friend aware that, in one sport, the very ladylike sport of chess, less than 4 per cent. of the annual UK grant of &#163;50,000--itself a small amount--goes to the women's game? Is that not appalling, in view of the real progress being made by women and girls in that sport? For example, Harriet Hunt, the women's top board at the recent European team championships in Georgia was the first UK player to capture a board one gold, defeating strong women grand masters from Ukraine and Hungary. That success is replicated around the country. In my constituency, the Cheddleton and Leek club scored seven victories when seven girls entered the junior congress in Staffordshire.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h02_spnew2"><B> Mr. Cohen </B> 
: My hon. Friend makes her point well. I know that she has campaigned on that issue. The disproportionate funding for women in that game is mirrored in other sports.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para5">What a contrast there is between the United States and Britain. We are increasingly becoming a nation of couch potatoes, and in addition women are discouraged from taking up serious sport. Old sexist attitudes die hard--in fact, they are not dead at all. Buster Mottram is quoted in the <i>Daily Mirror </i>of 8 October. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Until recently, even heavy doses of Viagra would not have made 90 per cent. of women players attractive to 80-year-old men in lycra shorts."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91214h02_para6">We know that, in several countries, traditional culture or religion can pose barriers to women in sport. For us, the attitudes are stupid, sexist and deeply old-fashioned. <i>The Independent </i>on 14 July stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"But for all the men's complaints, Title IX has brought a sharp increase in girls' participation in sport that contrasts favourably with the decline in Britain, where the squeeze on extra-curricular activities and the sell-off of playing fields have contributed to a precipitate fall in school sport that has disproportionately affected girls."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91214h02_para7">On 4 July, referring to the women's world cup, the <i>Observer </i>said:
 
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Unfortunately, for Britain--still hidebound when it comes to popular attitudes to women in sport--we had no part in the finals. England, the highest rated British team, finished last in the qualifying group. Britain is not yet near to catching up Nixon-era America. Only about half of Britain's state schools offer football to girls as well as boys"--

I suspect that that is at varying levels of quality. Kelly Simmons, the FA women's football coach, said:
<P>
<BR>
"It is unfortunately dependent on the school having a PE teacher with an interest to push the sport."

The <i>Observer </i>concluded:
<P>
<BR>
"There is no requirement for British schools to offer equal sports opportunities to both sexes. Britain is doomed to watch this revolution from the substitutes' bench of history."

<a name="91214h02_para8">It is a great struggle for women competitors to train and compete properly. The <i>Daily Mirror </i>of 29 September referred to Sarah Winckless, the 25-year-old rower who hopes to take part in next year's Olympics. She relies on national lottery funding, sponsorship from Virgin and part-time work to stay afloat while she trains. Of course, the equipment she needs is very expensive. She cannot even afford to start a pension because she does not earn enough.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para9">In January, <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>reported a funding crisis in women's hockey. The women's hockey team had to cancel a tour of Australia in the build-up to the Olympics, and the appointment of a national co-ordinator was put on hold. Junior development programmes were completely dispensed with, and the UK Sports Council cut much of its world-class performance plan for hockey. One person said that lottery funding is okay for individuals, but not for teams, such as hockey teams. I do not know if the situation has changed since January, and whether the players did in fact go on tour, but it was certainly a great disruption to their effort in preparing for world-class standard.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para10">Women's football in this country does not meet international standards. Women footballers are paid next to nothing and given little access to top-class facilities. Lilleshall, the national footballing centre, makes no provision for girls while thousands of pounds are spent on each boy. Our best women footballers have to seek scholarships in the US. There is a slow increase in the linking of local women's teams with men's league clubs. That is a good thing, but it often amounts to little more than just providing them with the kit. Sometimes that is unhelpful because the clubs are tied to a single sponsor and the women's teams are precluded from finding their own funding.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para11">The Football Association lives up to its initials as far as women's soccer is concerned. After the first world war, larger crowds attended women's soccer matches than men's, so the FA banned those games. It is still not interested in women's soccer. How about equal access to and use of the new Wembley stadium?
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para12">There is a problem in our schools. <i>The Scotsman</i> on 3 February reported that girls are poorly served by mixed physical education classes and PE instructors are often insensitive to equal opportunities because they mark girls down. It referred to the trend of making PE a boys-only option. That is outrageous. Television, including the BBC, fails properly to cover and promote women's sport. When the television cameras are on, they are pointed at male athletes. Only 5 per cent. of sports coverage is devoted to female athletes.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para13">There are serious health and safety implications in our approach to women's sport. A report this week shows that the United Kingdom tops the heart disease league in Europe, but there is a trend, of which Princess Diana was a good role model, of women pursuing health and fitness in the gymnasium and through sport beyond their teenage years--for instance, hundreds of women compete in the London marathon. Women want to keep fit and, if they have the opportunity to do so, their sons and perhaps even their husbands will follow them. That will improve health and sport in general.
 
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para14">I want to express my own brand of chauvinism, which is British chauvinism. I want us to win more prizes and <P>

medals, but we are underperforming. Boosting women's sport would increase our medal count and, in the long term, improve our men's performances.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para15">What is to be done? I urge the Minister to prepare a comprehensive programme, with equal opportunities at its core, involving all official sports bodies. Schools and PE instructors must be included. We should open gyms, sports centres, playing fields and swimming pools so that women have equal access at an affordable price. The lottery should be forbidden to discriminate against women's sport; in fact, it should be required to boost it. No state money should be given to the official sports associations unless they have realistic women's sport development programmes. Lilleshall and the centres of excellence should operate effectively on behalf of women athletes. We should also encourage television, newspapers and advertising agencies to elevate the profile of sportswomen so that, as role models, they get young girls into sport.

<a name="91214h02_spmin0"><B>The Minister for Sport   (Kate Hoey): </B> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Mr. Cohen) on securing the debate. This important issue has not been discussed specifically in the House for a long time and the debate is overdue. I also welcome the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins). It is good to see her here.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para17">Many women believe that there is an injustice in the way in which funding for sport is distributed. More women than ever find that regular physical exercise improves health, self-confidence and well-being. There has been huge growth recently in women's team sports, especially football and rugby, which are among the fastest growing sports. The Government's sport for all policy is designed to ensure that that trend continues.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para18">As more women recognise the benefits of sport, it is important that they and their sports are able to access funding. However, it is vital that funding is not given for the sake of it as an artificial way of making up for past imbalances. As with all funding, we must ensure that it is properly targeted. Money that is given to women's sport must help to identify sporting potential and attract more women and girls into sport.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para19">I met a large number of governing bodies of all sports over the past few months including those that represent women's sports, such as rugby union, football, cricket, netball and hockey. I also met the Womens Sports Foundation. We explored how to give women's sport a higher profile and I heard important views on the recent equal opportunities report. Those organisations were keen to raise many of the issues that were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead. They told me about the difficulties that women's sport <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 28WH</B></P>
and minority sports, which might be played by men, have in obtaining sponsorship. They highlighted the problem of the link between sponsorship and media coverage. There is no doubt what difference it makes for women's sport to get coverage on terrestrial or satellite television. The women's netball team's recent bronze-medal win in the world championship in New Zealand was shown on the BBC's terrestrial programme "Grandstand" on Sunday afternoon. It had a huge impact on people who had not seen netball since their school days. It was clear how much the sport had changed; it is now faster and more professional. When I watched the team play, the game was very different from my days as captain of the school netball team.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para20">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport works closely with the sports councils and Departments across Whitehall, including the women's unit in the Cabinet Office, to consider what more can be done to use sport to help women in other aspects of their lives. I am keen that sport, be it men's or women's, is not an add-on or sideshow, but a central part of Government policy, because it can deliver in many ways. For example, it has an impact on social exclusion and helps to reduce crime and drug dependency among young people.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para21">Recent research by the Womens Sports Foundation in America shows a clear link between sport and teenage pregnancy. Young teenagers are much less likely to become pregnant if they are involved in active sport and recreation. They have greater self-esteem and self-confidence. I want us to do more work on that so that we prove it through research--although it is common sense to me--and women's sport gets the funding that it deserves.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para22">The subject of our debate is equal funding for men's and women's sports. Funding is an important part of ensuring that women are able to participate in sport and physical activities at both the grass roots and elite levels, but we must ensure that we remove all the barriers that discourage women from participating. We must further ensure that the funding is used wisely to the benefit of everyone.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para23">More than &#163;6 million of Exchequer funding goes to sports governing bodies. As one of the conditions of that funding, all governing bodies are required to have proposals for the development of women's sport. That did not happen in the past, but it is now making a difference to each governing body. That money also funds activities that are specifically designed to encourage more women and girls into sport. Moreover, all sports bodies are required to demonstrate how women's sport will be encouraged as part of any application to the lottery sports fund. Lottery funding requirements mean that all facilities should operate non-discriminatory access policies and their marketing policies and programmes of use should ensure inclusion.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para24">Organisations that cannot prove that they are doing that have already been refused funding. It is making a real difference to sports clubs' approach towards women. They may not be changing for the right reason, but they are having to change and to think through how funding is to be spent. The new rules have helped to raise the issue of discriminatory practice in club membership. Perhaps more than anything, they are helping to increase women's participation rates, including in some of the sports that have traditionally been seen as male dominated.
<P>

<P>

<a name="91214h02_para25">The world-class performance programme is another lottery-funded initiative. Of the 1,351 athletes--in the widest sense--currently supported by it, 596 are women, which means that they receive almost 45 per cent. of the total funding of &#163;84 million. That is a real improvement and shows that women are reaching the higher levels in terms of funding. It does not solve the problem of how to get more women to come through, but when they have come through and their talent has been identified, they are receiving their share of world-class performance funding. As well as going to individuals, that money has gone to team events such as women's rugby and women's cricket.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para26">The subject of equal prize money frequently comes up, especially in relation to Wimbledon. Everyone would accept that the contribution that sportswomen make to sporting competitions is just as good as that of men--if not better in many cases. The organisers and governing bodies have the final say on how much money people will be paid, but the subject is continually reviewed.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para27">Although there is some good news, I want to improve the rate of women's participation in sports generally. Clearly, if we get things right at the base and ensure that more women and young girls come in, our strength in sports will be greater and our importance to sponsors and the media will increase. Together with colleagues at the Department for Education and Employment, I am studying recent research into what turns young girls off physical education and school sport.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para28">Changes in the national curriculum for physical education will allow more flexibility at key stage 4, which I hope will help to ensure that young girls stay involved in some kind of sport and recreation. We must capture their interest and remember that many young girls in their early teens--a difficult age--are concerned with how they look and do not want to mess up their hair. They are concerned with their image and self-esteem, and the issue must be handled carefully; that is why a good physical education teacher can make all the difference. We are working with the Department for Education and Employment to ensure that we get things right in schools for girls and that physical education teachers are well trained and able to cope with the problems to which my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead referred.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para29">The issue of Title IX was prominent in my hon. Friend's speech. It governs the overall equity of treatment and opportunity in educational establishments. Clearly, it has been working in the United States, although there are different views on how successful it has been. Much evidence suggests that it has been successful in terms of participation, but some argue that it can hold back women's participation in some high-profile sports. It is also extremely difficult to enforce because, even on the rare occasions when schools and colleges have been taken to court, the penalty for non-compliance has hardly ever been dished out.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 59WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h02_para30">As my hon. Friend will know, sports structures in the United Kingdom are very different from those in America. In the United States, the highly commercialised sporting college concept is dominant, while the sports governing bodies are dominant here. It is not at all clear that the United Kingdom governing bodies as presently constituted would be able to meet the legal Title IX requirements for equal opportunities between men and women, especially without a greater commercial impetus. The Women's Netball Association pointed out that, if Title IX applied here, the Sports Council might have to withdraw funding from the English women's netball team if it could not demonstrate that it was providing equally for boys as well as girls. There are also problems in other sports.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para31">I would not like anyone to think that all the women's sports governing bodies are keen to go down the Title IX route, because they are not. They are, however, keen to ensure that support continues to flow to women's sport from the national lottery. They also want to ensure a higher profile for debates about how we project women's sport, how we win more sponsorship and how we ensure that the media see women as sportswomen and not as women first, which is the angle that the newspapers take at the moment. We must work together to build on the magnficient achievements of some of our famous sportswomen. My hon. Friend referred to many in America, but let us not forget our role models: Mary Peters, Virginia Wade, Tessa Sanderson, Sally Gunnell and Tanni Grey are all excellent athletes, and more are coming on. I hope that we will achieve more successes at next year's Olympic games.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para32">There are definitely some good news stories, but my hon. Friend is right to draw this issue to our attention. We must be careful that we do not assume that everything will automatically be all right if we carry on as we are. We must continually examine what we are doing and measure results to ensure that we give youngsters in particular the opportunities to get into sport. We have a solid foundation on which to build from the way in which the lottery has worked and how its equity principles have affected the thinking of sports governing bodies. Even the governing bodies that once seemed to take no interest in women's sport are now having to change.
<P>

<a name="91214h02_para33">We are determined to get more women to participate in sport at all levels. We must continue to produce athletes who will be the best in the world so that, as my hon. Friend said, they will win medals for this country and make us proud of our achievements--nothing makes us feel better than doing well at sport. I want to ensure that our country's success is measured not only in mainstream team sports such as cricket, rugby and football; there are many other good things going on in sport and in women's sport, and we must ensure that those achievements are trumpeted. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for introducing this debate. I shall take back to my Department all the points that he raised.

<P>

<a name="91214h03_para0"><i>On resuming--</i>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h03_spnew0"><B> Dr. Vincent Cable  (Twickenham):</B> 
 I am delighted to have an opportunity to discuss scientists in the national health service. This is the first opportunity that I have had to speak in Westminster Hall.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para1">The Minister is aleady well aware of the issue. There has been a succession of parliamentary questions from other hon. Members and me throughout the year and earlier in the year the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, which represents many of the members of staff involved, organised a big lobby. He is currently dealing directly with pay and conditions through negotiations, and is discussing his paper "Agenda for Change", which addresses many of the issues.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para2">I am not here as a spokesman for the union although, in this case, the issues that it raises are valid. I have two reasons for bringing the matter to debate. First, as often happens, I was approached by a constituent--a laboratory scientist in the NHS who works at Guy's and St. Thomas' hospital. He wanted to alert me to problems. I was taken on a guided tour of the laboratories, as was my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge), who has a personal and professional interest in the matter. I was struck by the combination of the dedication of the staff and their unhappiness, sometimes amounting to bitterness, about the extent to which they had been overlooked in successive pay negotiation rounds. Frankly, they were in a parlous economic position.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para3">Secondly, I represent a constituency with an exceptionally high number of professional scientists. It has two major physics and chemistry laboratories and many related scientific commercial enterprises. I therefore have an interest in promoting in Parliament science and the people who work in it. If one group of professional scientists is seriously undervalued, it sends the signal to all scientists that their qualifications and training are not valued.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para4">The specific issue that I wish to raise is the problem--many would call it the scandal--of low pay among what are now called biomedical scientists. They are scientists at BSc (Hons.) level who enter the NHS and can train for up to five years to achieve a qualification that, as the Minister explained to me in a written answer yesterday, is not enshrined in law and is not fully portable. They serve a long apprenticeship on low pay to work within that cadre of professions.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para5">For some years, the headline story has been of people at the bottom of the scale--trainees, laboratory technicians and trainee scientific officers--being hired on wages of approximately &#163;7,500 a year. That is only a little more than the minimum wage, and those of them with dependants would certainly qualify for family credit. The Minister will, no doubt, say that his offer to professionals, which he confirmed in a written answer yesterday, will take care of their problem. None the less, assuming that the pay offer is accepted, many young scientific officers will join the profession on about &#163;9,500 or &#163;10,000 a year. That is the status of the profession into which many of those people are moving.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 32WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h03_para6">Why is that a problem? First, many young professionals are emerging from university in near poverty. Unlike other workers, many have substantial debts--they have obtained student loans and have borrowed in lieu of student grants. They then have to enter a long and difficult apprenticeship on exceptionally low pay. Secondly, large differentials have opened up within the NHS. I welcome the advances in nurses' pay as much as anyone else--they are well deserved, long overdue and almost certainly inadequate. A grade D nurse, who is roughly comparable to those professionals in terms of educational qualifications and age, is probably joining the NHS on approximately &#163;14,500. I do not begrudge the nurses anything that has been given to them, but they attract emotional and political support that backroom laboratory workers do not enjoy. That has contributed to the big disparity.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para7">Invidious contrasts can be made with pay outside the NHS. People concerned with that group of workers and I have done some checking. The going rate for menial jobs in supermarkets, certainly in south-west suburban London, is probably between &#163;9,500 and &#163;10,000--roughly the same as that for scientists with degrees and student debts. The contrast is painful.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para8">The other contrast is with people in the private sector. Again, I rely on anecdote, but I gather that laboratory technicians are paid about &#163;16,000 or &#163;16,500 by Glaxo Wellcome--one of the leading groups employing staff on roughly comparable grades to the NHS--whereas in the NHS they would be paid &#163;10,000.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para9">The problem is not just that that is invidious but that hospitals are increasingly contracting out scientific work. My local district general hospital, West Middlesex University hospital, now has a contract with Glaxo Wellcome for much of that work. I am troubled not only by the unfairness but by the economics. Why is the NHS having to contract out work of such quality and importance to the private sector, in which pay is much higher? One assumes that the NHS is not making savings and that it is having to do so because it cannot attract enough staff of the right quality. The same is true of agency nursing. The position of nurses is being undermined within the NHS, and the practice is extremely uneconomic: I suspect that the same is happening with scientists.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para10">Why is there a wider problem? I have discussed the matter with people in the profession. Recruitment and retention are beginning to be seriously affected. The Government's figures, published in September, are helpful. They show that about 50 per cent of trusts have recruitment difficulties and 25 per cent have retention difficulties with scientific workers. The situation is not as extreme as it is with nurses, but it is much worse than with other groups of NHS workers and is becoming a big problem. The problem is especially acute in cytology--cancer detection. About a third of those scientists in the NHS are due to retire soon because of the age structure of their group. There is no sign that the NHS will be able to recruit on the scale required. That will affect the safety and security of cancer screenings and delay women waiting to receive test results. There is a particularly serious recruitment problem in that area. I realise that the Minister's offer acknowledged the problem, as there is a differentially favourable offer to cytology scientists. None the less, there is a major problem.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 33WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h03_para11">The issue of recruitment and retention reveals a wider problem: the integrity of the NHS as a whole. Any NHS hospital must operate as a team, with people in the front line and in the back room. Anything that weakens a key part weakens the whole system and I emphasise the importance of that group of professionals, the NHS scientists, in that context. The key area is cancer screening, as I said a few moments ago. We know from publicity about the failures in cancer screening that disasters can result, but that is not all. In the laboratory that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park visited, some of the key testing related to tuberculosis, which is now on a rapid growth curve, as the Minister explained to the press a few days ago. Early and accurate detection is critical in getting on top of a potential epidemic.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para12">The laboratory also carried out tests for MRSA--methicillin-resistant streptococcus aureus--the effects of which are not fully understood in the United Kingdom, but which is reaching epidemic proportions, with enormous consequences for patients and for the functioning of hospitals because patients suffering from MRSA need to be isolated.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para13">The problems arose from a political decision taken by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), when he was the Secretary of State for Health, to drop that group of workers from the pay review body. Why that decision was taken is shrouded in the mists of history, but it has had cumulatively disastrous consequences. As a result of successive rounds of settlements outside the pay review body structure, that group of workers has fallen roughly 30 per cent. behind. I know that the Minister is trying to tackle it now, but there is an enormous catch-up problem as a result of that decision.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para14">I return to what I think the Government are trying to do to tackle the problem and the extent to which they appear to be succeeding or failing. The Minister told me yesterday in a written answer that they are making a serious attempt to get to grips with the shocking headline figures at the bottom of the scale by effectively removing the two bottom rungs. However, the laboratory staff told me that only one of the 40 employees there would benefit. It may be an isolated extreme, but the unhappiness in the laboratory, which I am sure is replicated elsewhere, is happening because the more experienced scientists and those in the middle of the scale will get an increase, if the offer is accepted, of about 3 per cent. That is lower than this year's increase for the public sector as a whole and lower than for those on average earnings. One anomaly has, rightly, been tackled, but the consequences are that, for most people in the profession, the underlying inequity has not been dealt with.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para15">The Minister has addressed the issue of London weighting, which is welcome, because the problems of retention and recruitment are exceptionally severe in London. There will be a 13 per cent. increase in London weighting; applying the arithmetic to the current figures means that that is worth about &#163;260 a year. That is welcome, but given the magnitude of the problem, it has not been tackled in a substantial way.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para16">The key issue for the future--the real meat of the problem--is that the Minister has agreed that in future those categories should be brought within the pay review body structure, which is a welcome and positive <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 34WH</B></P>
step forward. The sting in the tail, however--perhaps the Minister will confirm it--is that he is suggesting that that should not happen until April 2001. People in the profession fear that by the time a review has taken place a year will have elapsed and by the time that negotiations have taken place on the basis of that review, another year will have passed. Therefore, it may be three or four years before the anomalies have been rectified; meanwhile, they are growing because the groups are not within the proper structure. Although I welcome the Minister's proposal, I ask him why it is not possible to bring these workers within the pay review body structure now, to start the process of examining their predicament. There is no overwhelming reason why that should not be done.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para17">I recognise, as an Opposition Member must, that all this has to be paid for. I am not being flippant about that; I know that the priority is to improve services and it is right that that should be done. However, there is a link between improved services and the pay and conditions of NHS staff. If pay and conditions are not right there is inadequate and poor-quality recruitment, with mistakes and delays. Thus, ultimately, the cost to the public purse will be greater than if the upfront payment were made. The economics are not totally unambiguous.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para18">As I said earlier, science is an important industry in my constituency and it is important, whether or not we are talking about the NHS, that scientists are recognised and rewarded appropriately and that the right signal is sent to people who are now aged 13, 14 and 15 and making choices about A-levels and careers. The present position is that there is a massive disincentive to go into science and a temptation to go for easier options. I hope that the bigger picture is not lost sight of within the minutiae of negotiation.

<P>
<a name="91214h03_spmin0"><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Mr. John Denham): </B> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on securing this debate. He has chosen to discuss the pay and conditions of NHS scientists. They are a small group of about 14,000 people within the health service, but they are, none the less, an important group of staff, who make a crucial contribution to patient care through their work in diagnostic techniques and treatment.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para19">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he made his case and for acknowledging some of the measures that the Government have already taken on the matter. I shall develop my remarks in the context of the wider changes in the pay system in the NHS to which he referred.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para20">It is important to acknowledge that both clinical and biomedial scientists work in the NHS on a range of activities that use scientific principles to determine the extent, cause and treatment of a wide variety of patient conditions. They have a crucial part to play in the treatment of people with life-threatening conditions, such as cancer and coronary heart disease--two areas that we have established as top priorities for the Government. We are introducing a national service framework for a 10-year modernisation programme for heart disease, mental health and diabetes, all of which require a skilled input from a well-trained scientific work force if diagnosis and treatment are to be effective.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 35WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h03_para21">For the first time since the NHS was founded, the approach to national service frameworks will give us the opportunity to marry up service, resource and staff planning. We want to ensure that those three processes come together. We will use the national service frameworks and our new work force review as the means of doing so. The work force review is wide-ranging; it will cover scientists and technical support staff and other groups.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para22">As the hon. Gentleman said, many scientists are involved in clinical-based research on new diagnostic techniques and treatments. All have a first degree in science, and often further training, some to masters or doctorate level. There are many distinct specialties such as medical physics, clinical chemistry, microbiology, histopathology and haematology. Those scientists are an important part of the health care team; they carry out tests on samples such as tissues and body fluids from patients to help doctors to diagnose disease and to monitor patients' progress, so that nursing care and drug and other therapies can be tailored to match.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para23">As the hon. Gentleman said, current pay for clinical scientists ranges from &#163;13,000 to &#163;54,000 and for biomedical scientists from &#163;7,400 to &#163;32,000. As he acknowledges, this year's pay offer addresses low pay at the bottom end of the biomedical scientists' pay scale by increasing it to &#163;9,400, a rise of 26 per cent. All scientists have been offered at least 3 per cent., significantly more than inflation, with some offered up to 7 per cent. To tackle special recruitment problems. Some trainees have been offered up to 26 per cent. by restructuring their pay scale.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para24">In addition, London weighting has been increased by 13.5 per cent. to restore it to 1995 values. Given the current circumstances, that is a fair offer. We were right, this year, to target the funds at areas with a demonstrably greater need to address recruitment and retention problems that would have damaged patient care. That is a bigger problem with some staff groups than others.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para25">Across the board, scientists are in a relatively healthy position in comparison with other disciplines--hard-to-fill vacancies lasting over three months account for a vacancy rate of only 1.1 per cent. across the discipline as a whole. However, there is a difficulty in recruiting staff at the bottom end of the biomedical scientist scale. Having recognised that, we have offered larger increases to staff at the end of the profession.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para26">I accept that those figures mask some local variations. London finds recruitment and retention more difficult than other parts of the country. However, local employers already have some flexibility within the national Whitley system to offer pay rates that are attractive enough to get staff with the skills that they need. For example, Whitley contains a provision to offer local pay supplements of up to 30 per cent. in the London area, specifically to address recruitment and retention issues where management consider that proven problems could be redressed by pay enhancement. That and similar action is being taken by London NHS employees, including those at Kingston hospital, in which the hon. Member for Twickenham will have an interest.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 36WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h03_para27">The hon. Gentleman acknowledged the wider changes that we are trying to bring about. We know that the current pay system is out of date and in need of review. That is why, on 15 February, we published "Agenda for Change", which sets out detailed proposals for modernising the way in which the NHS rewards its staff. We want to develop a new pay system based on efficiency, fairness, flexibility and partnership. That system must be able to offer all staff better career progression and fairer rewards for taking on extended roles, widening their skills and working in teams; modern conditions of service; and a fair basis for pay increases in the security of a national pay system.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para28">We intend to do that in tandem with considering work force issues from the point of view of the skills that are needed to deliver modern, fast and convenient services to patients. That is long overdue. On the ground, practice is changing. The traditional hard-and-fast demarcations between clinical professions are giving way to more fluid and flexible team working. Now is the right time to be considering the skills that the NHS of the future will need. It is time to examine the issues in a new way--across professions, sectors and services. All clinical groups in the NHS believe that to be necessary in order to ensure that patients get the timely and appropriate care that they need.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para29">As we try to make joined-up decisions on work force requirements, we will have to tackle some of the underlying barriers to change in the current system of pay and conditions of service in the NHS. In too many areas, employment practices in the NHS bear the stamp of 1948 rather than 1999. The NHS needs to become a 21st-century employer. It also needs to become a better employer, not least by offering greater flexibility in the way in which staff are employed. The current pay structure groups staff in ways that are increasingly less relevant to the way in which a modern health service works. Staff are defined by a combination of their titles, their pay and how they are trained, rather than by what they do for patients. Existing conditions of service, which often include a range of arcane allowances built up over many years, too often distort working patterns and inhibit the development of the around-the-clock, flexible services that patients need. Modernising the pay system is therefore one of our key priorities. It will help to deliver the new patient-centred services that both the Government and NHS staff want to see.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para30">The discussions that have taken place so far on our pay proposals have been positive and constructive. A national system of job evaluation will allow creative approaches to job design, to match exactly the redesigned care processes that are so vital to patients.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para31">In talking about the membership of the pay review body, the hon. Gentleman anticipated decisions and conclusions that have not yet been reached. We recognise that there are groups of highly qualified health professional who, for various reasons, are outside the pay review body's remit. That forms part of the talks that are underway with staff and representatives on the basis of "Agenda for Change". Those talks will include discussions about whether any new groups should be covered by the pay review body, but it is not intended that there should be any change to the fundamentally professional character of its coverage. It would be wrong of me to comment at this stage on the proposals that are being made for specific staff groups. However, <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 73WH</B></P>
I believe that pay modernisation will benefit all NHS staff, whether or not they are covered by a review body. The talks are part of a linked package of discussions and negotiations in which we are working constructively, and with a great deal of common purpose, with all those on the staff side in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para32">This is an opportunity to change the pay system for the better, so that staff can be fairly awarded for the work that they do rather than the titles that they hold. It will give us the flexibility to design jobs within the security of a national pay system, giving all staff better career progression and modern terms and conditions and, crucially, allowing managers and staff to deliver the quality of services that everyone wants.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para33">I confirm that, in the course of the constructive discussions that are taking place with the trade unions and the staff side, the MSF--which represents the groups of staff that we have been discussing--is playing a major part in ensuring that the views and aspirations of scientists in the NHS are being played into those discussions. We are working towards radical changes in the NHS, and the necessary changes cannot all take place overnight. If our negotiations are successful, I hope that we will have a fully agreed package by next summer, with implementation starting the following spring.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para34">A modern NHS should mean fair but affordable pay for staff alongside improved modern work practices. That is why our proposals for reform are a key part of the modernisation agenda for the NHS. We want to improve recruitment and retention, through fair rewards and better career progression; improve productivity, through more flexible job design and patterns of working; and improve quality of care, through rewarding the acquisition of better skills rather than applying automatic increments.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para35">I recognise that a substantial portion of what I have said has concerned NHS staff in general rather than scientists in the NHS in particular. However, I am convinced that the correct context in which we should <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 75WH</B></P>
discuss the future pattern of rewards and career progression in the NHS for that group of staff is within those wider changes. We must address the needs of the NHS work force as a whole and those of the NHS as a whole.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para36">I also recognise that, although pay and conditions are important, they are not all that we need to offer to staff, particularly highly qualified staff, to work in the NHS. Alongside our work on the pay system, therefore, is a substantial programme of work to improve the working conditions and environment of NHS staff. The new human resources framework that we have launched requires employers to address other key issues--for example, equality, staff involvement, personal development and the development of personal development plans, good employment practices and healthy workplaces. These will all add to the quality and attractiveness of working life in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para37">Many staff are concerned about striking the right balance between work and private life; many have responsibilities to care for dependent relatives. Flexible working arrangements that enable them to discharge those responsibilities and continue with their careers must be developed and encouraged.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para38">We must also ensure that staff have access to reasonable career progression. That is central to the hon. Gentleman's earlier comments. Career pathways must be developed and support must be given for staff to gain relevant skills. That is particularly true in the case of scientific disciplines, where advances in knowledge and technology continually open up new fields of specialisation and create demand for new services. We must grasp that opportunity in order to boost the work force that we want for the 21st century.
<P>

<a name="91214h03_para39">To get the work force that is required, we have to get the right calibre of staff into employment and then ensure that they can be retained. Our "Working Together" programme concentrates on better management and better human resources for the entire work force, and that includes scientists and technicians.

<a name="91214h04_spnew0"><B> Mr. Fabian Hamilton  (Leeds, North-East):</B> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to have this debate. The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), coined a phrase some time ago: "joined-up thinking". This debate takes place at an opportune time. First, it is on the topic of the day--transport. Secondly, it is about joined-up thinking and its relationship to the environment.
 
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para0">The Government's transport White Paper, "A New Deal for Transport", which was published in July 1998, states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We will continue to encourage the use of more environentally friendly fuels".

I should declare an interest at this point. Six weeks ago, I bought a dual-fuel vehicle, which runs on liquefied petroleum gas and petrol. I have been enjoying its benefits ever since, and I shall expand on that later.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91214h04_para1">The transport issue presents us with a number of problems: how to get around safely and quickly; how to travel longer distances in less time; how to ensure that we do not further pollute our towns and cities, causing damage to people and buildings; and how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the greenhouse effect on the whole world. I do not pretend to have all the solutions. However, I shall try to offer some helpful suggestions on how to reach those much-desired targets.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para2">A whole host of alternative vehicle fuels, which offer better economy and less environmental impact than petrol, now exist. Petrol is still the most common vehicle fuel, and, despite the removal of lead, it continues to emit many toxic and undesirable gases. However, the advent of the catalytic converter, and its compulsory addition to all cars manufactured after 1993, has had a dramatic effect on the reduction in harmful gases from petrol-driven cars. Ian McAllister, the chairman and chief executive of Ford UK, is fond of saying that the emissions from 64 new Ford Kas produce the same amount of exhaust gas pollutants as one 1977 model Ford Fiesta. An older bus carrying 30 passengers--or customers, as they seem to be called nowadays--produces more pollution than would be produced if those 30 people were all to drive new small petrol-engine cars. The congestion, of course, would be considerably worse. According to Mr. McAllister, it is almost impossible to commit suicide with a modern petrol engine car--it does not produce enough carbon monoxide.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para3">Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister launched the Government's transport strategy for the next 10 years. He spoke about investment of &#163;80 billion over that period, and said that he hoped that the entire bus fleet would be replaced in that time. I was amused to hear commentators on the radio deriding him for that--they said that the buses would be replaced within 10 years anyway. Clearly, BBC presenters never travel on buses--if they did, they would know that some of our buses are more than 30 years old, and that their ancient diesel engines cause heavy pollution.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para4">Liquefied petroleum gas--LPG--which is also known as propane, is not new. The gas is a by-product of the oil refining process, and is often burned off in the <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 40WH</B></P>
flares that come out of oil refineries. More than 4 million vehicles on the world's roads run on the fuel, which produces far lower exhaust pollutants. More than 1 million of those cars are in Italy, where the tax regime has been even more favourable to the gas. In Holland, which is a much smaller country than the UK, there are 400,000 LPG cars on the roads. Fewer than 8,000 such vehicles are driven on Britain's roads.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para5">LPG is a good alternative fuel, although it is by no means the only one available. It reduces the production of nitrous oxide by up to 85 per cent., carbon monoxide by 98 per cent. and hydrocarbons by 81 per cent. Carbon dioxide is also significantly reduced when compared with petrol. Benzene and butadiene are dangerous human carcinogens. LPG produces one thirteenth of the benzene and half the butadiene emissions of petrol.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para6">Having realised the environmental benefits of LPG, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor reduced excise duty on the fuel in his last Budget. The typical forecourt cost for LPG is 35p per litre, compared with more than 75p for petrol--it is probably much more in London. It is no wonder that I am delighted with my new Vauxhall Vectra. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will be aware, however, nobody is ever satisfied on tax. I appeal to him to reduce further the duty on the fuel from the current rate of 15p per litre to the European Union minimum of 8.3p. That would further stimulate the market for a gas that is readily available now and that most petrol engines can be converted to accommodate.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para7">Although I described LPG as readily available, one of the most frequently asked questions about my dual-fuel car is, "But where can you fill it up?" I am lucky to come from Leeds, which is a city overflowing with LPG filling stations--four, to be precise. That is far better than London, although there is a convenient garage nearby at Victoria coach station. Many Members of Parliament will remember the early days of the fax machine, about 15 years ago, when people asked, "Why should anyone buy a fax machine?" There seemed little point in doing so if there was no one to whom one could send a fax, as--although it seems incredible now--few people possessed a machine.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para8">The author Joseph Heller, who died on Sunday, will be for ever remembered as the author of "Catch-22". I am not sure whether he would have called LPG a catch-22 problem, but one of the barriers to wholesale conversion to LPG is the lack of infrastructure. There are only 200 filling stations nationwide, although many more are planned by Calor Autogas, Shell and BP over the next 12 months. Among the biggest problems facing the development of more LPG stations are the objections of local planning authorities. Petrol storage tanks are kept underground, but LPG storage tanks must be kept on the surface, and local planning authorities have objected on safety or aesthetic grounds.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para9">On 25 September this year, the <i>Financial Times</i> reported that Dean White, clean fuels manager for BP Amoco, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The government on the one hand is encouraging use of cleaner fuel, but local authorities are saying 'not in our backyard'."

The report continued:
<P>
<BR>
"BP Amoco has hoped to install LPG facilities at 70 filling stations this year. So far it has received planning consent for just three. Shell has cut its target for LPG sites from 100 to about 60 by <P>
</UL></FONT>



<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 41WH</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the year end . . .BP has set a target of providing LPG at 300 filling stations within five years. Officials admitted it was unlikely to achieve that target. Shell, similarly, said it was taking longer than expected to win planning consent. It had hoped to launch 200 sites by 2001."

It would greatly assist the planned target of 500 clean refuelling points by 2001, which is the aim of Calor, Shell and BP, if the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions would issue a circular to all local planning authorities encouraging them to approve applications within local framework plans. That would be a step towards joined-up government.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91214h04_para10">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor generously funds the Energy Saving Trust and its Powershift programme, which aims to assist in converison of vehicles to cleaner fuels. He recently announced three-year funding for the programme, but budgets are already under pressure because of the heavy demand for and massive increase in interest in sustainable clean fuels--not only LPG. I shall add to that burden by telling the House that grants of up to 75 per cent. may be paid towards the conversion of petrol-engine cars by approved conversion companies. That normally involves the removal of the spare wheel and the use of that space to accommodate the new fuel tank, which is a small price to pay for the cleanliness of the fuel.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para11">As most conversions cost between &#163;1,500 and &#163;1,800, the cost borne by the individual--assuming a grant from the Energy Saving Trust--would be recouped in a few months. For companies operating fleets, the cost savings alone would justify the relatively small investment, irrespective of the environmental benefits. Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot currently offer new cars already converted by the manufacturer.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para12">So far, I have talked about LPG, which is also known as propane, but there are other options. Larger vehicles--buses, refuse wagons and lorries--can run on compressed natural gas, which further reduces polluting gas emissions. The one disadvantage is the size and weight of the fuel tank. CNG, which requires a compression of eight atmospheres, must be stored in very heavy fuel tanks that are impractical for cars, but a number of local authorities have converted to CNG and are already feeling the benefits. Perhaps local authority electorates should press councils to make those conversions, especially in heavily built-up areas such as London and Leeds. I invite the Minister for Local Government and the Regions to make provision for this very good bit of joined-up government.
 
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para13">Last January, I chaired a conference at the Royal Armouries in Leeds, on behalf of the Energy Saving Trust, that sought to persuade public bodies to convert to cleaner fuels. At the conference, I had the opportunity to drive an electric car--the Peugeot 105. A fleet of Peugeot 105s has recently been purchased by Birmingham city council. I thought that that car, which produces no emissions, was the answer to the problems. Like most hon. Members, I suspect, I imagined that driving an electric car would be just like driving a milk float, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although it has no gears, it has good acceleration and is totally silent. I wondered whether it was the ideal solution, but there are problems.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para14">First, on a single charge, its range is only about 40 miles. Secondly, in producing the electricity that charges the vehicle's batteries, pollution is created in other places. Thirdly, the batteries use heavy metals that are <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 42WH</B></P>
not very environmentally friendly. However, if we were to use electricity generated by wind farms, or sustainable sources such as hydro-electricity, perhaps such vehicles would be cleaner.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para15">The car is also expensive, but the French--inevitably, it is the French--have established a network of recharging points that recharge much more quickly than conventional ones. The electric car has a little further to go before it is a viable long-distance vehicle, but it has a role to play in inner-city areas, where range is not an issue. I aplaud Birmingham for buying a fleet of such cars, and I hope that Leeds quickly follows suit.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para16">So far, I have not made much mention of diesel, which was the great hope for emission reduction. There are many diesel cars and goods vehicles on our roads, and huge advances have been made in diesel design, emissions and power. Diesel engines are far more economical, and the latest common-rail diesel engines are often indistinguishable from petrol engines. One can even buy a diesel BMW. However, cyclists know that diesel-engine buses produce the filthiest exhaust emissions. Although they help to reduce carbon dioxide, such vehicles produce particulates of unburnt fuel, which are the real killers. High levels of PM10s, which are the larger particulates, contribute to congestive heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular problems and asthmatic attacks. It is estimated that PM10s advance 8,100 deaths a year, so it is clear that a reduction in older, dirty diesels can only benefit the people of this country, as well as health service costs. There are other, smaller particulates--PM25s--that are even more dangerous because they can be absorbed into the bloodstream more directly. A reduction in those particulates would also greatly benefit public health.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para17">I have not had time to mention some of the other available fuels. The larger motor manufacturers are developing hydrogen fuel cell technology. Ford estimates that, within five years, it will make a fuel cell car available to the public. Fuel cell cars use biomass-produced fuels such as methanol, which is converted into hydrogen and burned in an internal combustion engine, and produce exhaust fumes that are purely steam or water vapour. I understand that Brazil uses a great deal of methanol. Such technologies are being encouraged and developed.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para18">I have hardly had time to touch on the issue of capital allowances. I know that the debate will not be answered by a Treasury Minister, and I apologise for raising taxation issues, but I want to make one point. The conversion to LPG of vehicles, particularly fleet vehicles and large commercial vehicles, would be greatly assisted not only by developing the vital infrastructure but by introducing 100 per cent. capital write-down for such conversion. When Treasury Ministers read this debate in <i>Hansard, </i>I hope that they will consider advancing alternative fuels in that way.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para19">I have raised a number of issues this afternoon. I hope that they will contribute to the debate on cleaner and better fuels to reduce pollution, improve air quality in inner cities and reduce carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases, in line with our obligations under the Kyoto agreements. I also hope that, as they become more common, those alternative fuels will help to improve public health and reduce NHS costs, as well as reduce the damage that sulphur dioxide emissions cause to our buildings. I believe that the issues I have raised are important. Conversion to LPG and other such fuels will <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 43WH</B></P>
not only lead to cost savings for motorists, but benefit the environment and public health, about which I care passionately.


<P>

<a name="91214h04_time1"><H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91214h04_spmin0"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Mr. Keith Hill): </B> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton) on securing this debate, and on giving notice of some of the key issues that he has raised. Alternative fuels is a subject of extensive interest, and the related issues deserve to be widely aired. We are now aware that, as an owner of an LPG bi-fuel vehicle, my hon. Friend has a particular interest in the subject. He is not alone: the Government car service converts its fleet to alternative fuels as vehicles are replaced, and my own ministerial car has been converted to gas.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para20">Now, more than ever before, we need a consensus on transport. We do not want to force people out of their cars or force hauliers out of business, but every sensible person who participates in the transport debate recognises that we cannot go on as we are. Congestion is costing the country billions of pounds, climate change is the greatest threat that the world faces today, and we are increasingly aware of the impact of poor air quality on health.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para21">Instead of wringing our hands over those problems, we must start solving them. The integrated transport White Paper, which was published last year, and the recently published Transport Bill are important steps towards providing solutions, but we cannot afford to be complacent. Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister set out the way forward for transport over the next 10 years. As he explained, we need an efficient transport system to support a prosperous economy, counter social exclusion and maintain our quality of life. We need greater investment from the private sector and the pubilc sector. Part of the answer is to improve public transport, but we recognise that the car will remain an important means of mobility for millions of people, so we must ensure that road vehicles are cleaner, quieter and more fuel-efficient.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para22">Here, there is good news. As a result of tighter vehicle emission and fuel quality standards, new road vehicles are already cleaner. As manufacturers gear up to meet the European Union voluntary agreements on new car fuel efficiency, vehicles will quickly become more fuel-efficient. In some areas, that will not be enough. Everyone recognises the scale of the problem posed by climate change, and noise is an issue of increasing concern. Although our health-based air quality standards will be met across the majority of the country by the deadlines set out in our air quality strategy, there will be pollution hot-spots, especially for nitrogen dioxide and particulates. Alternative fuels provide one way of addressing those problems.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para23">Gas fuels can offer significant air quality benefits. Compared with diesel engines, liquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural gas can offer substantial benefits with regard to particulates and nitrogen oxides, which are the air pollutants of greatest concern in road transport terms. Road fuel gases produce less visible smoke and odour than diesel, and such vehicles can be substantially quieter than their diesel counterparts. That <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 44WH</B></P>
can benefit night deliveries of goods, for example. If one takes into account life cycle, rather than tail-pipe emissions alone, CO2 emissions from those fuels will be lower than from petrol.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para24">Battery-electric vehicles, which produce no exhaust pipe emissions, are even better than gas fuel vehicles in that regard. However, we must remember that, essentially, those emissions will be transferred to power stations. None the less, on a life-cycle basis, battery electrics may benefit the climate and improve local air quality. Hybrid electric vehicles can be significantly more fuel-efficient and quieter than their conventionally fuelled counterparts. Potentially, fuel cells offer virtually non-existent tail-pipe emissions and life cycle benefits in respect of CO2.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para25">I should like to explain our approach to deciding between different policy measures. Solutions have to contain three elements. They have to be practical, timely and cost-effective. It is the duty of every responsible Government to ensure that taxpayers' money is carefully spent, and this area is no exception.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para26">The Government fully support alternative fuels. We have introduced fiscal incentives for gas fuels, so that the difference in duty between liquefied petroleum gas--LPG--and compressed natural gas and diesel is the widest in Europe. This year we increased the funding to the Powershift programme, which provides grants to help fleet operators to offset the additional capital cost of alternatively fuelled vehicles, by 40 per cent. compared with last year. In the last Budget we doubled the vehicle excise duty rate for the cleanest buses and lorries to a maximum of &#163;1,000.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para27">Projects and initiatives at a local level are already starting to make a difference. The ALTER project is designed to produce concerted action by cities across Europe to give preferential access to certain areas to vehicles with zero or low emissions. Some local authorities are discussing the possibility of using low emission zones to reduce vehicle-related pollution in towns and cities. It is likely that gas-powered vehicles will fall into the categories of vehicles allowed to enter such zones, because they tend to be significantly cleaner than their conventionally fuelled counterparts.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para28">Local authorities and other public sector fleets are at the forefront of pushing forward the market for alternative fuels. The London borough of Southwark in London, for example, is involved in the ZEUS--zero and low emission vehicles in urban society--project. That is a consortium of local authorities in London, Coventry and other European cities examining the use of cleaner fuels and technologies to improve air quality and promote energy efficiency. It has negotiated competitive prices for a range of electric vehicles. The City of Westminster council has just taken delivery of the first commercial fuel cell vehicle, for which the Powershift programme, sponsored by my Department, provided a partial grant.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para29">Police forces have also shown their keenness to use alternative fuels. Humberside police in Yorkshire, for example, were awarded Powershift funding for more than 100 LPG vehicles at the end of last year. I am delighted to report that Leeds city council, which is certainly in Yorkshire, has been offered a Powershift grant towards the purchase of two electric vans.
<P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 45WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91214h04_para30">However, the debate should not be limited to gas fuels. Battery-electric vehicles have a role to play in niche markets. More exciting are the alternative fuels and technologies of the future. Hybrid electric vehicles use two power sources: a conventional engine and an electric motor. They are, therefore, substantially more fuel-efficient than conventional technology. Hybrids are already on sale in some parts of the world, and we can expect to see them here in the next few months.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para31">Fuel cell vehicles offering high efficiency and low emissions are slightly further into the future, but will be on the roads in the next few years. It is no exaggeration to say that the way in which vehicles are powered will have changed more in the last 10 years of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st, than in the 90 years before that. Who would have thought, looking at the first steam-powered vehicles of the 1890s, that 100 years later we would be contemplating the sleek, clean, quiet fuel cell vehicles of the near future?
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para32">Those dramatic advances are being supported by the Government. Through the fuel cell programme, we are supporting research and development on advanced fuel cells to the tune of &#163;2 million, with that amount being matched by industry. So far, we have supported 109 projects with a total value of about &#163;56 million. We expect the next phase of the project to support around 15 proposals with a Government contribution of around &#163;3 million.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para33">The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council has recently approved a number of fuel cell projects under its new and renewable energy programme. The Foresight vehicle programme, aiming at the 15 to 20-year horizon, is a further example of Government-sponsored research. It is an umbrella programme of industry-led automotive research that aims to co-ordinate Government funding across Whitehall, focusing on advanced technologies for the future. The programme has proved a great success and includes projects investigating advanced propulsion systems and innovative fuel systems. Hybrid and electric vehicle technologies are also included. The Government have made more than &#163;12 million available for these and other Foresight projects. The portfolio continues to increase as the programme moves forward.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para34">My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East has suggested that vehicle excise duty should be based on a wider range of environmental impacts. Taxation is, of course, a matter for the Chancellor, who has said that he will announce full details on graduated VED at the next Budget. Meanwhile, I am sure that he will keenly read the observations made by my hon. Friend. He has already said that there will be four VED bands, based on CO2 emissions, with the potential to reward less polluting fuels. The system developed by the Environment Agency is interesting, and my officials have had discussions about that system.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para35">It is important that the Government take into account all the environmental impacts of particular fuels. However, we are not yet at the stage where we can adopt a fully comprehensive system. Many uncertainties remain about the exact life-cycle emissions of different <P>




<B>14 Dec 1999 : Column 46WH</B></P>
fuels and technologies. That is one reason why my Department, through the cleaner vehicles task force, has commissioned research to assess how much information is already available about the life-cycle emissions of different fuels and vehicles.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para36">I said earlier that the solutions to the problems of poor air quality, noisy streets and the threat of climate change must be practical, timely and cost-effective. We cannot afford simply to assume that alternative fuels are the way forward. We have, therefore, asked the cleaner vehicles task force to take a closer look at alternative fuels. We asked the alternative fuels sub-group of the task force to do three things: to consider the merits and longer-term potential of alternative fuels and technologies; to examine the barriers to introducing alternative fuels to the marketplace; and to consider the mechanisms for removing those barriers and developing an improved infrastructure to make those fuels more widely available. We have stressed that this work must be set within the context of practicability, timeliness and cost-effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para37">The group is near to delivering a final report, which we expect to publish early next year. Cost-effectiveness analysis has been a key parameter to its work. When we receive the task force's recommendations, we will use them further to refine Government policy on alternative fuels. I do not anticipate a major change to our current belief that, from an environmental perspective, the best use of gas fuels is in urban areas to replace vehicles that would otherwise use diesel. We hope to ensure that those fleets are given every opportunity to switch from diesel. Hybrid electric and fuel cell technologies are likely to become more widely applicable, especially as one of their major benefits will be in the area of CO2 emissions, which are a global rather than a local issue.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para38">Another issue raised by my hon. Friend is that of problems experienced by some fuel suppliers in obtaining planning permission for new LPG refuelling sites. My Department is aware of that issue. It is important that local authorities take their planning and health and safety responsibilities seriously, but we must bear in mind the contribution that gas fuels can make to meeting our air quality targets. I can, therefore, promise that we will address the issue of planning guidelines for LPG refuelling points in the final version of PPG13--the Department's planning policy guidance on transport issues to be published next year.
<P>

<a name="91214h04_para39">I end by re-emphasising our commitment to alternative fuels. We cannot continue to use energy in the way that we have, or to ask those who are suffering from respiratory problems to suffer further as a result of traffic-related pollution. We firmly believe that alternative fuels and technologies are part of the answer in creating a sustainable transport system. The role of the different fuels and technologies varies--some are best suited to niche applications, others are more widely applicable. However, we have no doubt that they must be part of our strategy for delivering a transport system suitable for the next century.
