Clwyd (Cynon Valley) (Lab):</b> I advise the television
cameras not to come too close. To dispel any rumours, I met the ground
rapidly, which accounts for my rather strange appearance this
morning.</p><p><a name="06071880000011">As chair of
the British group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union I want to use
today&#146;s debate to raise awareness of the IPU&#146;s work,
especially on human rights, and to ask parliamentary colleagues and the
Government to continue to support that important work. First, I shall
give some background. It is amazing that people can be Members of
Parliament for many years without being fully aware of what the IPU
does. I hope that many more people will join it when they realise what
kind of work that is. The IPU is the international organisation of
Parliaments of sovereign states and was established as long ago as
1889. It is the focal point for worldwide parliamentary dialogue, and
works for peace and co-operation among people and for the firm
establishment of representative democracy. To that end, the IPU fosters
contacts, co-ordination and the exchange of experience among Members of
Parliament of all
countries.</p><p><a name="06071880000012">The
British group of the IPU organises incoming and outgoing delegations.
In the past 12 months the British group has hosted visiting
parliamentarians from a number of countries, including Lebanon,
Tunisia, Croatia, Ukraine, Burundi, Bahrain and Colombia, and has
organised or assisted visits to, among others, Iran, Thailand, Gabon,
Peru, the Palestinian Authority and Saudi Arabia. There are plans afoot
to host inward delegations in the next year from, for example, Gabon,
Brazil, Israel, Japan and Moldova, and to organise outward delegations
to Israel, Mexico, Albania, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and Jordan. Only two years ago, I led the IPU delegation to Lebanon,
and those of us who were present during the visit know with what great
pride the Lebanese showed us the reconstruction of their country. All
of us who have been watching the events of the past few days will be
deeply saddened at the damage that has been inflicted on that country
and its people.</p><p><a name="06071880000013">The IPU deals
with questions of international interest and concern, and expresses its
views on such issues to bring about action by Parliaments and
parliamentarians. In the past year, the IPU has considered such issues
as violence against women, abandoning the practice of female genital
mutilation, the role of national Parliaments, various forms of
financing for development, HIV/AIDS, and women in politics. The IPU
also contributes to the defence and promotion of human rights&#151;an
essential component of parliamentary democracy and
development&#151;and I shall talk in more detail about the work of
the committee on the human rights of parliamentarians. The IPU also
organises seminars for parliamentary human rights bodies, and we shall
be holding one in October on the administration of justice.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 2WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000014">The IPU
currently has six main areas of activity: human rights, representative
democracy, international peace and security, sustainable development,
women in politics, and education, science and culture. More than 140
national Parliaments are members of the IPU and seven regional
parliamentary assemblies are associate members. Most members are
affiliated to one of the six geopolitical groups that are active in the
IPU. Of course, the IPU is financed by its members mainly from public
funds. Today I shall concentrate to some extent on the IPU&#146;s
activities in promoting and defending international human rights,
because one of its main objectives is to contribute to the defence and
promotion of human rights, in the knowledge that respect for human
rights underpins parliamentary democracy.</p><p><a name="06071880000015">The work of the committee on
the human rights of parliamentarians, which was set up in 1976 and is
celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, serves as a concrete way
for the IPU to protect the human rights of parliamentarians and their
wider communities. Parliamentarians are given a mandate to represent
the people in their countries, and to do their work effectively they
must be able to carry out their mandates free from persecution, threats
of violence and imprisonment and other human rights abuses. It is
essential that we, as Members of Parliament, support our colleagues all
over the world who are being harassed, abused, tortured, detained or
even killed just for doing their work.</p><p><a name="06071880000016">Often,
however, the abuse of parliamentarians is simply the tip of the
iceberg. If those who are well known and to a large extent protected
are abused, others are often being ill treated as well, so by raising
the awareness of the position of the MPs, the committee also raises
awareness of the wider situation in the country in question. In
addition, by actively and publicly defending parliamentarian
colleagues, the committee helps to foster in many of the relevant
countries an arena for public and peaceful debate and dialogue. Once
the parliamentary arena is secured, that public forum can often be
widened and greater protection can be extended to all the
country&#146;s citizens. By working on the cases of parliamentarians
who have not been able to carry out their mandates that are brought to
the attention of the committee, we help to foster good governance and a
climate of respect for human rights.</p><p><a name="06071880000017">I have had
the honour of chairing the committee internationally for the past three
years, and have been a member for five years. Its working methods are
not widely understood and I should like to explain them. The committee
has five members, representing different geopolitical areas in the
world. It meets four times a year, in private, to consider the cases of
MPs who are thought to be under threat. We receive the initial
complaint about the situation of a Member of Parliament from a variety
of sources, and the source can remain confidential if that is
requested. The committee must first decide that a case is within its
remit. The allegations in question are then transmitted to the
authorities of the countries concerned, so that they can make their
observations. We act as a channel of communication between the
parties.</p><p><a name="06071880000018">The committee
can do much more. It can ask for information, send trial observers and
organise on-site missions. I was a member of an on-site mission to
Syria, where there was agreement to receive members of the 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 3WH</b><br>committee to the country, but, after three days of argument, we were
refused a visit to the parliamentarians in question, who were in
prison. To my knowledge and that of the IPU, Syria is the only country
to have done that. That deeply regrettable incident was made public at
the time. I am pleased to say that the two MPs have been released in
the past six months, but we have failed to get further information
about their conditions and state of health.</p><p><a name="06071880000019">If the
authorities involved are not dealing with a case satisfactorily, as in
Syria, and when the alleged abuses are of a serious nature, the
committee can turn up the pressure and go public. That is when others
get involved and raise awareness of MPs&#146; cases. When I gave my
report to the delegations in Nairobi earlier this year, only two
countries got up to protest: Turkey and Zimbabwe. It is interesting
that the person who came to protest on behalf of Zimbabwe was Mr.
Mugabe&#146;s nephew.</p><p><a name="06071880000020">Committee
members sometimes want to comment immediately on cases that involve
serious violations of MPs&#146; rights, but we have to exercise
restraint. Last week, at a meeting in Geneva, we discussed changing the
rules of the committee, because it is extremely frustrating for members
of the committee to give a press conference, as we did in Nairobi, and
not be able to comment on various cases because they are still private.
However, irritating though it is to have to sit there and keep quiet,
especially to a former journalist such as myself, that method works
quite constructively in that when we make representations to the
relevant countries on behalf of the MPs who are in trouble, those
countries are more likely to come to an agreement privately than if we
had gone public and made a big song and dance about it. Many of the
committee&#146;s success stories were dealt with under the
confidential procedure. I cannot talk about them, but I assure hon.
Members that many cases were solved with pressure from the
committee.</p><p><a name="06071880000021">The cases in
which the committee&#146;s work&#151;often alongside that of other
parliamentarians&#151;has been an important factor in securing the
rights of MPs include those of Mr. Yorongar, the former presidential
candidate from Chad; Alpha Conde, the former presidential candidate
from Guinea; and Anwar Ibrahim, the former Deputy Prime Minister of
Malaysia. I shall quote their words to give hon. Members a flavour of
how people feel when they know that somebody else is speaking on their
behalf. Mr. Jorongar
said:</p><a name="06071880000401"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I was
heartened when the IPU took up my case and its mission to Ndjamena
played a decisive role in my release. I strongly encourage them to
continue their efforts on behalf of political prisoners throughout the
world who are rotting in dictators&#146;
jails.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071880000022">Mr. Conde
said:</p><a name="06071880000402"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I want
to express my heartfelt gratitude to the IPU and salute the struggle
for freedom it waged alongside us during all those years of
suffering.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071880000023">Mr. Ibrahim,
the former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, said,</p><a name="06071880000403"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I was held in solitary
confinement in Malaysian prisons for six years and at the worst moment
when my situation seemed desperate I received a note from the IPU. It
revived my hopes to know that someone in a far corner of the world who
cared about democracy and human rights had taken up my
case.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071880000024">As
politicians, we are all focused on getting results. Against that
yardstick, the committee is one of the IPU&#146;s most effective
mechanisms. Some of the cases 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 4WH</b><br>that it is reviewing now have been made public. In our May session in
Nairobi, the committee considered 64 cases in 35 countries, many of
which involved more than one parliamentarian, and held face-to-face
meetings with 12 delegations. We considered seven cases for the first
time. Taking into account both public and confidential cases, there are
now, unfortunately, a record number of human rights cases before the
committee.</p><p><a name="06071880000025">Recent
positive developments reviewed by the committee in Nairobi include the
release from prison of opposition MP Cham Chainey in Cambodia and the
ability of the Cambodian opposition to work more effectively in
Parliament. Also, the committee is working with the Parliament of
Burundi to ensure that the deaths of former MPs are properly examined,
in the context of work that is being done to bring about peace and
reconciliation there. The committee is also being helped by the Rwandan
Parliament in connection with the disappearance of MP Mr. Leonard
Hitimana, who disappeared in April 2003 and still has not been found.
The National Assembly has submitted his case to its national human
rights commission, which is now also
investigating.</p><p><a name="06071880000026">I wish
to remind UK parliamentarians, the UK Government and the wider world
about the plight of parliamentarians in certain countries. In Burma,
the situation is particularly tragic. No real progress has been made,
despite all our efforts to allow elected MPs to take up their mandates.
If anything, the situation is worsening. Recently, a
parliamentarian-elect was sentenced to a 90-year prison term, and the
imprisonment of two others was extended under draconian laws. There is
continuing pressure on parliamentarians elect to resign their mandates
and membership of the National League for Democracy, and the
authorities have totally ignored the NLD&#146;s proposal to convene
the Parliament that was elected in 1990. The committee has constantly
condemned that state of affairs, and has appealed to everyone to do
what they can to help to bring democracy to
Myanmar&#151;Burma&#151;and its
people.</p><p><a name="06071880000027"><b><a name="06071880000428">John
Bercow (Buckingham) (Con):</b> I endorse wholeheartedly what
the right hon. Lady says about the appalling plight of long-suffering
political prisoners in Burma. Does she agree that it might be
beneficial if the IPU committee were, at some stage, either publicly or
privately, to press for a second discussion of the behaviour of the
Government of Burma in the United Nations Security Council, with a view
to achieving the successful passage of a binding resolution instructing
the regime to cease abusing the human rights of its citizens and start
respecting
them?</p><p><a name="06071880000028"><b><a name="06071880000429">Ann
Clwyd:</b> I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. In fact,
various people have made similar suggestions. One positive development
is the setting up of the Association of South East Asian Nations
inter-parliamentary Myanmar caucus, with MPs from Cambodia, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. The caucus has been
putting pressure on the Burmese authorities and will continue to do so.
I agree that all forums should be used to try to exert pressure in what
is obviously a totally unacceptable situation. We know that Members of
Parliament who were elected in 1990 are dying off in 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 5WH</b><br>prison, detention or exile. A lot of pressure has been put on the
authorities in Burma to release the leader of the NLD, Aung San Suu
Kyi, from her continued house arrest, but we are particularly concerned
about the elected politicians. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will
continue to exert that
pressure.</p><p><a name="06071880000029">In
Bangladesh, there are two serious cases which the committee is
considering. The first is that of Mr. Sha A. M. S. Kibria, who was
killed by a grenade explosion on leaving a meeting in his constituency
in January 2005. Although several suspects were arrested, the
investigation has failed to address essential questions, and there are
allegations of testimonies being obtained under torture. The
investigation was closed, and the Supreme Court in Bangladesh is now
considering whether it should be reopened. The committee is keen to
follow the proceedings closely, and has recommended sending an
observer. Grenades were also used in the second case, but Sheikh
Hasina, the Opposition leader, was more fortunate. She survived the
attack, which took place on 21 August 2004, during a meeting of her
party; however, 25 people were killed and more than 100 maimed. An
investigation has been ongoing, but sources and the authorities have
different views about its results so far. A judicial inquiry commission
has been set up, but its report is confidential, and not even the
aggrieved parties know what is in it. In both cases, it has reportedly
been impossible to raise the attacks in the Parliament of Bangladesh.
Nevertheless, our committee has concluded that that Parliament has a
responsibility to ensure that both crimes are properly investigated,
and we have called on it to follow the investigation more
closely.</p><p><a name="06071880000030">The committee
continues to press for a full royal pardon for Mr. Anwar Ibrahim, the
former deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia. It has once more called on
the Prime Minister of Malaysia to provide the King with the necessary
advice so that he can consider the pardon petition that a large group
of Malaysian citizens have submitted. When Anwar Ibrahim was released
from jail, he came to Geneva to thank the committee for the efforts
that we had made on his behalf, and the same is true of many of the
people who are released as a result of IPU pressure. Other examples
include MPs from Zimbabwe and the former President of Indonesia, Mrs.
Megawati, who was in trouble before she became President of Indonesia,
but who was able to carry on her activities because of the
IPU.</p><p><a name="06071880000031">Unfortunately,
the committee has been unable to report any positive developments in
either of the cases in Pakistan that it has been examining. Mr. Asif
Ali Zardari was released on bail in November 2004. His name was struck
off the exit control list and he was issued with a passport. However,
he has been declared an absconder, despite the fact that the
authorities know that he is receiving medical treatment abroad and he
is regularly represented in court in Pakistan by his counsel. More
important, the authorities have done nothing to identify and bring to
justice those who tortured him in May 1999 during his
interrogation.</p><p><a name="06071880000032">The other
case in Pakistan is that of Mr. Hashmi, who is serving a seven-year
prison term, which was handed down in April 2004. The committee is
concerned not only about the conduct of the trial
proceedings, but about how long it is taking the courts to
hear Mr. Hashmi&#146;s application for suspension of the
sentence and his appeal. The committee is also worried because 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 6WH</b><br>the information that the authorities and sources have provided about his
conditions of detention is quite different, and it considers that an
on-site mission would help it to gain a better understanding of the
case. I found it particularly disappointing that senior legal
representatives from Pakistan who come before our committee constantly
tell us different stories. It is appalling that such senior officials,
including attorneys-general, can come before our committee and give
quite misleading statements, to put it mildly.</p><p><a name="06071880000033">In Sri Lanka,
the committee has been examining the case of Mr. Dissanayake, who was
sentenced to two years&#146; imprisonment for contempt of court. In
early February, the President of Sri Lanka remitted the remainder of
the sentence, with the result that Mr. Dissanayake was released on 17
February, several weeks before he would normally have been entitled to
release on the grounds of good conduct. The committee obviously hopes
that he will be fully pardoned, because, like Anwar Ibrahim, he will
not be able to resume his political role unless he receives a pardon.
It is therefore important that pardons are tagged on to the release in
countries that have such a system.</p><p><a name="06071880000034">Another case
from Sri Lanka involves the murder of Joseph Pararajasingham, who was a
well-known human rights advocate. He was shot dead in his local
cathedral during the Christmas eve mass last year. The fact that the
cathedral is located in a high-security area and additional security
forces were on duty that night suggests that the murderers enjoyed the
complicity of the security forces. However, the investigation has not
made much progress so far. Again, the committee has stressed that the
authorities have a duty to conduct a prompt, thorough and independent
investigation. It also expresses concern at the potential effect of
that murder on the willingness of parliamentarians in Sri Lanka to
speak out on human rights issues and minority
rights.</p><p><a name="06071880000035"><b><a name="06071880000430">Mr.
Nigel Evans (Ribble Valley) (Con):</b> In praising the
IPU&#146;s work on these matters, will the right hon. Lady also
recognise the bravery of politicians in some countries, who know the
hostility and danger that they will face if they speak out on human
rights issues, but who are still prepared to do so, even if they face
death? I feel nothing but pride and admiration towards such politicians
for speaking out in the manner that they do.
</p><p><a name="06071880000036"><b><a name="06071880000431">Ann
Clwyd:</b> Yes&#151;that is a good point. That is what comes
over from the testimony of some politicians when they come to us in
private, as happened recently in Geneva. I happened to be sitting in a
room, when a Member of Parliament from another country&#151;I will
not say which country&#151;came in with a letter for me. He said,
&#147;I&#146;m just leaving this letter. If they knew I&#146;d
come here to see you and what was in the letter, I wouldn&#146;t be
safe going back to my own country.&#148; However, he wanted us to
know what had happened, because when we raised his case during an
interview with representatives from his country earlier in the day,
they denied everything that we thought had happened. However, his
letter confirmed that it had happened. There are people, even in the
delegations that come to Geneva or to the IPU&#146;s annual
conferences, who risk their lives just by approaching us at those
conferences. The man whom I met had been tortured in custody, but the
authorities denied everything that he said had happened.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 7WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000037">On Lebanon,
there is a lot more that I should like to say, but that is not my role
today. However, the committee is considering the case of Mr. Gibran
Tueni, who was murdered on 12 December 2005. His assassination took
place the day after his return from Paris, where he had been staying
because of death threats. An investigating judge has finally been
appointed by the competent authorities, and the National Assembly has
initiated a civil court action.</p><p><a name="06071880000038">Again, there
is much that I should like to say in relation to Palestine, but I shall
confine myself to saying that the Committee continues to monitor
developments in the cases of two Palestinian Members of Parliament who
are in Israeli jails. One is Marwan Barghouti, who was re-elected as a
Member of the Palestinian Legislative Council in the January 2006
elections and who continues to serve his prison sentence. The committee
has great concerns about the fairness of the judicial proceedings to
which Mr. Barghouti was subject. We have reiterated our desire for a
committee member to pay Mr. Barghouti a private visit. In the case of
Mr. Hussam Khader, a former member of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, the committee observed his trial in Israel and has
considerable concerns about the fairness of the proceedings. Again, the
committee has stated its wish to pay Mr. Khader a private
visit in prison.</p><p><a name="06071880000039">In
Turkey there is long-standing case, which has been made public,
involving 15 former members of the Turkish Parliament who, back in
1994, were charged with separatism. The case of four of them, including
Leyla Zana, is well known and has had plenty of media coverage,
especially when they were released from prison in July 2004. The
European Court of Human Rights has concluded that their trial failed to
uphold fair trial guarantees. As a result, a review of the trial was
ordered and is under way. Six of the former MPs went into exile; should
they return to Turkey, they will be arrested on charges of separatism.
The committee is trying to find out what grounds and facts support the
separatism charge still pending against those former MPs. One former
parliamentarian, Mr. Sincar, was murdered. Some time ago, the Turkish
IPU group informed the committee that several persons have been brought
to justice for his murder, but we failed to receive further
details.</p><p><a name="06071880000040">Eritrea is a
country where there is great cause for concern, particularly in
relation to Eritrean MPs. Since September 2001, 11 MPs have been
languishing in jail and their fate has largely been forgotten. No one
knows where they are held or even whether they are still alive and they
have never been brought before a judge. They were arrested after the
publication of an open letter in which they called for democratic
reforms. The Government state that they committed crimes against the
sovereignty, security and peace of Eritrea during its war with Ethiopia
and that they can therefore be tried only once the peace process has
been completed.</p><p><a name="06071880000041"><b><a name="06071880000432">Mr.
Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold) (Con):</b> The right hon.
Lady is giving moving accounts of individual cases. For some countries,
there comes a time when they want something. Turkey wants to become a
member of the EU, and human rights are critical to that membership. How
does the IPU interact with individual Governments and with the EU in
particular to try to secure the release of people in prison, these
separatists who are not allowed to return to Turkey, and others who are
still in jail?</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 8WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000042"><b><a name="06071880000433">Ann
Clwyd:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the human
rights requirement is one of the conditions of EU membership. The
situation is much improved in Turkey. I hope that Turkey will join the
EU&#151;indeed, it is imperative that it does. I have many friends in
Turkey. I visited Leyla Zana, for example, when she was in prison. I
was given special dispensation as an individual to go and visit her and
I spent one and a half hours with her discussing her circumstances.
Turkey is very sensitive to international criticism. Certainly, when I
talked in Nairobi about the situation of those parliamentarians the
Turkish representative could not wait to get to the platform. The
Turkish delegations and I have had that conversation several times over
the past few years.</p><p><a name="06071880000043">I
know Turkey well and I know when it is making progress. It has made
progress since I was a member of the European Parliament, as was the
Minister, and my right hon. Friend knows, too, that the topic of Turkey
was often raised. It is incumbent on us all to take every opportunity
both to congratulate the Turks on the progress that they have made and
to encourage them to make further progress. They must make further
progress. The situation in south-east Turkey is still precarious. There
are younger political activists now among the Kurds in south-east
Turkey who will not put up with the situation. Although progress has
been made on language rights, for example, the Kurds are nevertheless a
minority in Turkey and deserve much improved treatment from the Turkish
Government.</p><p><a name="06071880000044">In the case
of Eritrea, the committee has gone back to the Eritrean delegation and
reaffirmed that, in our view, the human rights of the MPs in jail are
being grossly violated and that nothing can justify such a violation.
That is also the view of the African Commission on Human and
Peoples&#146; Rights, which concluded in November 2003 that the state
of Eritrea had violated those MPs&#146; right to liberty and
security, their right to fair trial and their freedom of expression. It
urged the state of Eritrea to order their immediate release and
recommended that they should be compensated. The committee has put out
an urgent appeal, particularly to our African colleagues, to make every
effort to ensure that the recommendations of the African commission are
applied and the former parliamentarians released.</p><p><a name="06071880000045">We are all
aware, unfortunately, of the situation in Zimbabwe. I want to highlight
the cases of two members of Parliament: Mr. Job Sikhala and Mr.
Abdenico Bhebe. Mr. Sikhala was tortured in January 2003 and gave a
detailed statement about it to the court, which had widespread media
coverage in Zimbabwe. In his official complaint, he provided names and
medical certificates. Although the Zimbabwe police initially spoke of
progress being made, more recently they said that there had been no
progress owing to Mr. Sikhala&#146;s lack of co-operation. The
committee found that hard to understand and has emphasised the duty of
the state to investigate the crime with all due diligence and
thoroughness. Mr. Bhebe was almost beaten to death in May 2001. He
reported that to the police and provided them with the names of those
responsible. When the case was to be heard in January 2005, it turned
out that the case file had been lost. The committee trusts that the
case file will reappear so that justice can take its course.</p><p><a name="06071880000046">Six cases relating to Colombia
have been made public. They raise a wide range of human rights issues.
The first involves parliamentarians who were 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 9WH</b><br>assassinated and justice, again, has not been done. The second involves
a former parliamentarian who was forced into exile because of death
threats. In both cases, the parliamentarians were members of the
Patriotic Union party, whose members were and still are the target of
what has been termed political genocide. The third case, that of Piedad
Cordoba, also raises the question of impunity.</p><p><a name="06071880000047">The fourth
case is quite different, because it concerns parliamentarians who were
kidnapped by FARC, the main guerrilla group in Colombia, and who have
been in the hands of the FARC for several years. The likelihood of a
humanitarian agreement has recently receded but will, I hope, be a
priority of the next Colombian President. The committee has always
believed that negotiation is the only way forward and that the
Colombian Parliament has an essential role to play in arriving at a
national consensus.</p><p><a name="06071880000048">The case of
Mr. Lozano, a member of Parliament and the victim of fundamentally
flawed judicial proceedings, raises questions on fair trial guarantees,
and the committee is in contact with the Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights to help address those matters. Lastly, the case of Mr.
Petro, who is also an MP, involves a number of death threats made
against him by paramilitary groups, and the authorities not taking
appropriate action to protect him. As do the other cases, the case
demonstrates that impunity can only encourage the continual repetition
of such crimes.</p><p><a name="06071880000049">The cases
that I have mentioned represent only a small selection of those that
the committee is considering. I have thoroughly enjoyed my five years
on the committee. I believe that it is worth while because one
day&#151;although I hope not&#151;we could all be in a similar
situation to our colleagues all over the world. We are lucky; we have
freedom of speech and we can speak out. It is incumbent on us to do so,
and I encourage all my colleagues to do so on every occasion . We can
use the Floor of the House of Commons and Question Time, and we can
make points of order. When we are members of delegations, it is
sometimes a bit embarrassing to have to raise issues with our
counterparts, particularly if we are meeting one of the countries that
are responsible for violations, but it is necessary that we do so on
every occasion that presents itself.</p><p><a name="06071880000050"><b><a name="06071880000434">Mr.

there and raising the issues of human rights at every opportunity did
some good? It appears to me that the Iranian Government got no succour
from it but we have established some relationship with parliamentarians

listen to because they obviously had worthwhile discussions with the

with the Iranians in Geneva the previous year to try to set up such a
visit, and we found that exchange to be useful. It is worth going to
listen to some of the reports that people make about their important

very annoyed with at various times is worth while and must deflect the

years&#146; service on the committee. It would be safe to say that
the IPU, which is an admirable organisation, her fellow
parliamentarians and, above all, the victims of human rights abuses are
very appreciative of the service she has given. There has been no more
consistent or passionate champion of human rights over a very long
period than she.</p><p><a name="06071880000058"><b><a name="06071880000442">Ann
Clwyd:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman very much. It has
sometimes got me into trouble, but we must use the opportunities that
we have, even if that sometimes means getting into trouble. It is
important that we do so because we have a voice and platform, and we
should use them. I never understand the view of people who feel
negative towards this place; I consider it a great privilege to be
here, and if Members do not use the opportunities it gives, they are
missing a lot. I encourage my fellow MPs to stand up for the rights of
their colleagues. They should do so in our Parliament, in the media and
through the IPU. The information contained in the cases that the
committee makes public can be used in all kinds of forums, as I
said.</p><p><a name="06071880000059">The Government,
too, should raise the cases when meeting their counterparts abroad.
Such lobbying would feed into their work on good governance. I know
that we all ask questions of Governments such as, &#147;When you met
so and so, did you raise this?&#148;. The answer is usually yes, but
all too often I am afraid that such issues are nowhere near the top of
the list of subjects that are under
discussion.</p><p><a name="06071880000060"><b><a name="06071880000443">Mr.
Clifton-Brown:</b> I wholly endorse the comments made by my
hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) about the right
hon. Lady; a great tribute should be paid to her. She has been talking
about her interaction with the Government. How often does she meet
Ministers to discuss these cases? What interaction does she have with
other multilateral and supranational agencies, for example the EU. The
IPU does a lot of work with the UN, does she meet its senior officials
regularly to discuss these cases?</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 11WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000061"><b><a name="06071880000444">Ann
Clwyd:</b> I shall start with the last question. The IPU has a
presence in New York and would like more interaction with the UN than
it currently has&#151;that is one of the aims of its reform
programme. Obviously, I talk to my Government colleagues on a range of
these issues, sometimes with more satisfactory results than on other
occasions. Nevertheless, it is important to continue to push certain
issues. As my colleagues know, Iraq has preoccupied me quite a bit
during the past few years, and I suspect that it will continue to do
so. However, it is not for me alone to do that work; it is for
everybody in this place. All of us, in our various ways, can make those
contributions. We can call Government to account, and, particularly
when they are having bilateral meetings with colleagues from other
countries, try to push human rights up the
agenda.</p><p><a name="06071880000062">It
is a great pity that the only group on human rights in this
House&#151;the all-party group on human rights&#151;is completely
reliant on outside help. We would not have our very good parliamentary
researcher were it not for the Barrow Cadbury Trust supporting us. When
I consider the other all-party groups in this place and the huge sums
that are available for the activities of some of them, , which I shall
not list because we all know them, I think that it is a disgrace that
an important issue such as international human rights is not given more
financial support. I shall end with that plea, and I hope that my
colleagues will join in the
discussion.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000407">10.17

Nigel Evans (Ribble Valley) (Con):</b> I intend to speak only
very briefly, because I know that not much time is left in the debate.
I congratulate the right hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) on
raising the issue of the IPU and all the good work that it does. She
mentioned the fact that there are a number of inward and outward
delegations from the United Kingdom. The dialogue that is established
between members of Parliaments is very important. It is not just about
us talking to the rest of the world; we listen to what they have to say
as well, because we do not have the answers to all the problems in
other countries. We can learn by some of the practices operated in
those
countries.</p><p><a name="06071880000064">I
recently chaired a luncheon with the Chinese delegation that we had
here. We all recognise the importance of China throughout the world
now. In 50 years or less, one can only imagine what sort of status it
will have in the world. Very different cultures are involved, and there
are human rights issues in China as well. The death penalty in China is
one such issue; I believe that its use of the dealt penalty is one of
the highest in the world. I have issues with the way that the penalty
operates in China, but it would be completely irresponsible for me then
to walk away from China and say, &#147;Well, that&#146;s it. We
will not have anything more to do with you.&#148; The fact is that we
must recognise the influence that China now has throughout the rest of
the world and, thanks to some of the IPU visits that I have made, I
have seen that influence.</p><p><a name="06071880000065">I hope that the Minister will
say something about those parts of the world where we have little or no
representation. For example, an IPU delegation, of which I was
privileged to be a member, recently visited Gabon and we co-chaired
that visit from Yaound&#233; in Cameroon. That it is not the best way
to have British representation in that part of the world, but China is 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 12WH</b><br>there big time. There are huge issues in Gabon concerning the
environment, as well as democracy, that we need to address&#151;for
example, illegal logging and China&#146;s influence. On our visit, we
learned that the Chinese are responsible for building not just one but
two parliamentary buildings in Gabon and we must question why we have
little or no presence when other countries, such as China, are doing
well there.</p><p><a name="06071880000066">I was at an
international conference in Tonga in the summer. We have pulled our
flag down there, yet the Chinese are increasing their representation. I
hope that the Minister will say something about the representation that
we have throughout the world and whether pulling the flag down in a
number of countries, as we have done, and lessening our representation
in other countries, including Germany and the United States of America,
is the best use of money.</p><p><a name="06071880000067">In some ways
and in some countries, it might be better if we reduced our
representation rather than cutting it. I hope that the Foreign Office
is looking carefully at something like a Tesco Metro appearance in some
of those countries rather than no appearance whatever. With a limited
and fixed budget, we shall have at least some influence in those
countries, particular with those with which we have had long
relationships over centuries. To walk away after putting in huge
investment over a long period is a grave
mistake.</p><p><a name="06071880000068">I praise Ken
Courtenay and his staff in the IPU who give great support to all
delegations, both inward and outward. They do a fantastic job,
sometimes at incredibly unsocial hours, and must deal with all sorts of
problems that arise with inward and outward delegations when huge
pressure is put on them by parliamentarians of all countries. I praise
their
work.</p><p><a name="06071880000069">The
right hon. Member for Cynon Valley mentioned Colombia, which we visited
under the leadership of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr.
Kilfoyle) who did a tremendous job. The one thing we learned there was
the importance of the Chevening scholarships and the fantastic work of
the British Council throughout the world. Being able to visit some of
those countries means that we see at first hand what it is doing on the
ground. President Uribe was a Chevening scholar and when we visit such
countries, we can get privileged access because of the earlier
investment.</p><p><a name="06071880000070">The point
about the Chevening scholarships is that we tried to recognise people
who would have influence at a later stage and bring them to the United
Kingdom so that there would be a dialogue because they would already
know what the United Kingdom was all about. My goodness, that paid
dividends when we visited Columbia and met the President for an hour
and a half in private audience. That was tremendous and it was superb
to talk to him. He has a great fondness for this country. Again, I hope
that the Minister will say something about the Chevening scholarships.
I know that they have been overhauled, but I hope that they will not
lose the essence of what they were all about. We look at certain
countries to work out which people will have influence at a later stage
and we bring them to this country so that there will always be
dialogue.</p><p><a name="06071880000071">Tremendous
joint work was done recently at the Africa conference between the IPU
and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. A number of
parliamentarians came here from Africa. We went to the British Library
over a three-day period and there 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 13WH</b><br>was superb dialogue between members of Parliament from Africa and the
United Kingdom. Going back to what the right hon. Member for Cynon
Valley said, there is a huge advantage in having a private dialogue
with them when they are outside their own countries because they feel
more comfortable talking to us privately about some of the issues in
their own countries. We can talk about those issues in relation to the
United Kingdom and the democratic processes in this country, which they
can see first hand. They take that back with them to their countries. I
cannot overestimate the importance of our recent conference, which was
a tremendous
success.</p><p><a name="06071880000072">Almost
finally, I want to talk about the Iran trip. I am a member of the
Council of Europe and when I spoke to representatives of the opposition
to the Iranian regime, they told me about the public executions that
take place. Two young lads were recently executed because they were
accused of being gay. The photographs that appeared in our newspapers
shocked every decent, thinking person. Women are publicly stoned for
adultery. It is incredible that that goes on in the 21st century. When
I heard that a delegation was going to Iran, I thought that it was the
right thing to do. I was delighted to speak to one of the members of
that delegation who said that it spoke privately to members of
Parliament from the Majlis and was able to get across human rights
issues so that they could better understand where we are coming from.
It is not a case of just wagging the finger. The delegation spoke not
to the Government but to the members of Parliament, who clearly must
operate within the current regime. I take my hat off to those who are
opposed to the regime but work within it to try to alter it for the
better.</p><p><a name="06071880000073">The visits and
conferences that I have described all cost money and I understand that
the IPU&#146;s budget is under pressure this year and next year. If
the budget remains frozen in real terms, there will either be a cut in
the number of inward delegations and what we can do when they come here
or in the number of outward delegations. That will hit at the
group&#146;s work. I hope that the Minister, as well as
parliamentarians generally in this country, recognises the hard work
that is being done. We have heard what is done in the committee work
behind closed doors. Many people do not even know that that goes on.
There is work in dialogue and constructive help for parliamentarians
throughout the world daily. I hope that the Minister will be able to
reassure us that the budget for forthcoming years will be maintained to
recognise the IPU&#146;s work.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000408">10.26

Wayne David (Caerphilly) (Lab):</b> I shall also try to brief.
I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann
Clwyd) on securing this debate and on her consistent work over many
years. She has championed human rights even when it has not been
popular to do so and when it has been at great cost to
herself.</p><p><a name="06071880000075">I
want to refer briefly to a visit that I made to central America under
the auspices of the Inter-Parliamentary Union when I led a delegation.
It was a good example of the effective work that the IPU can do on the
ground to serve human rights. That visit occurred in the early part of
June to two countries in central America: Guatemala 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 14WH</b><br>and El Salvador. Visiting two countries was a useful experience in
itself because we could develop a regional perspective and we saw the
contrast between two neighbouring countries in central
America.</p><p><a name="06071880000076">In El
Salvador, we found a relatively stable, democratic process. The two
parties, the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación
Nacional and the ARENA party, which had been at war during the 1970s,
1980s and early part of the 1990s, were pursing a peaceful democratic
process and had laid down their arms. The ARENA party was in government
and the FMLN was in opposition, and we thought that there was genuine
determination across the political spectrum to make the peace accords
of the 1990s work effectively. Of course, we saw great problems in the
country&#151;land issues, high criminality and widespread
poverty&#151;but there was great optimism and that came across
clearly from everyone we met.</p><p><a name="06071880000077">To be blunt, the situation in
Guatemala was quite different. The country was less prosperous with
less business confidence, widespread corruption and high criminality,
particularly from the &#147;maras&#148; gangs. It was pointed out
that more people in Guatemala lose their lives through crime than died
during the civil war of the 1980s and 1990s. Before we went to
Guatemala, the delegation had graphic briefings from Amnesty
International. Its two basic concerns were the ongoing land disputes
and the high level of evictions. It was concerned about the human
rights abuses and the way in which peasants and rural workers in
particular were being treated.</p><p><a name="06071880000078">Secondly, Amnesty International
was concerned about the violence against women. I would like to read an
excerpt from one of its reports that graphically shows the appalling
situation in Guatemala. A mother, referring to her daughter,
said:</p><a name="06071880000404"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;My
15-year-old daughter Maria Isabel was a student and worked in a shop in
the holidays. On the night of 15 December 2001, she was kidnapped in
the capital. Her body was found shortly before Christmas. She had been
raped, her hands and feet had been tied with barbed wire, she had been
stabbed and strangled and put in a bag. Her face was disfigured from
being punched, her body was punctured with small holes, there was a
rope around her neck and her nails were bent back. When her body was
handed over to me, I threw myself to the ground shouting and crying but
they kept on telling me not to get so worked
up.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071880000079">We had the
opportunity to raise such issues when we were in Guatemala during a
long discussion with President Oscar Berger. Naturally, his responses
were unsatisfactory from our perspective. What came across clearly to
us in Guatemala was that although the political will might have existed
among decent people to get to grips with such problems, the political
or civil infrastructure was not in place to do so. The police in
Guatemala suffer from widespread corruption and the judiciary is both
corrupt and inept. Many of the large property owners do not feel that
they have a stake in the country; in fact, many live in Miami and visit
the country only occasionally.</p><p><a name="06071880000080">Above all else, we did not find
the same commitment to democratic politics in Guatemala as we found
in El Salvador. That is largely for historic reasons. During
the civil war in El Salvador, it was recognised that neither side could
win&#151;neither the left nor the right, neither the FMLN nor the
ARENA party. A historic compromise was therefore reached, with both
sides 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 15WH</b><br>laying down their arms and making a genuine commitment to the peace
accords and the democratic process. That did not happen in Guatemala.
There the army won, and democratic politics suffered as a consequence.
What political parties exist in Guatemala have shallow roots. To build
up respect for human rights and to crack down effectively on
criminality, there is a need to enforce democracy and the political
process. That is one of the lessons that we learned, and one aspect of
our international work that we must continue to pursue.</p><p><a name="06071880000081">In conclusion, the example of
our visit to central America shows clearly the worth of the IPU.
Parliamentary democracy has a central role to play in promoting human
rights. The IPU, as the international manifestation of parliamentary
democracy, therefore has a crucial role to play. One the of the most
telling moments that I experienced in El Salvador was when one of the
members of the assembly who belonged to the left-wing FMLN said to me,
&#147;Mr. David, at one time my colleague&#148;&#151;he pointed
to a friend of his from the ARENA party&#151;&#147;and I were
literally trying to kill each other in the civil war. Today, although
we have political differences, we are nevertheless friends in the
legislative assembly.&#148; That better than anything else
illustrates the importance of parliamentary democracy and the work of
the
IPU.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000409">10.34
am</h5><p><a name="06071880000082"><b><a name="06071880000447">Mr.
Jeremy Browne (Taunton) (LD):</b> I shall speak briefly
because this debate is drawing to its conclusion. I congratulate the
right hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) on her introductory
speech and the work that she undertakes through the course of the year
on behalf of the IPU. I am a member of Amnesty International and I
thought that there was a lot of overlap between what she said about
work at the parliamentary level and what I am sure all hon. Members
wish to promote more generally&#151;respect for human rights and the
right of every individual to live free from an oppressive
state.</p><p><a name="06071880000083">Certain
benefits continue to make the IPU relevant, even though it was founded
more than a century ago. First, it is important that Parliaments
throughout the world assert themselves. People often ask me why I
became a politician&#151;they wonder what the benefits of
parliamentary life are and what the role of Parliament is. They ask,
&#147;What about big business? What about the internet and the
media?&#148; However, Parliaments are still the way by which people
can decide their priorities and administer their affairs in a logical,
coherent and accountable manner. It is in our interests to promote
parliamentary democracy throughout the world, particularly in the face
of some of the alternative sources of power, which have become more
prevalent in recent decades and which perhaps make the IPU even more
relevant.</p><p><a name="06071880000084">When I talk
to constituents and others, I am struck by the increasingly
international dimension to politics. The big issues that concern people
who organise high street petitions in my constituency and elsewhere are
the effects the globalisation&#151; whether they regard them as
adverse or positive&#151;the global environment, particularly the
warming of the planet, and the effects of global policy, such as
population increase, immigration, work permit arrangements and so
forth. 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 16WH</b><br>More and more, we live in an interdependent world, so we need to relate
to other countries&#151;not just those that we find it the most
amenable to have relations with, but those that are perhaps more
challenging to deal with directly. The IPU plays a key role in
that.</p><p><a name="06071880000085">The
final positive aspect, of many, is that the IPU is a means by which we
can spread best practice. We can advise parliamentarians in less mature
democracies than ours about procedures and how scrutiny can be
improved. As was mentioned by a previous speaker, however, it is only
reasonable that we learn from others too. After all, one of the two
Houses of our Parliament is non-elected and the other one has a
majority Government with the support of 35 per cent. of the electorate.
Occasionally it does us no harm to stand back and reflect on how others
might see us and on whether we can learn any lessons from
parliamentarians elsewhere in the
world.</p><p><a name="06071880000086"><b><a name="06071880000448">Mr.
Ian Davidson (Glasgow, South-West) (Lab/Co-op):</b> When I and
a number of others were recently in Saudi Arabia, extolling the virtues
of democratic elections, those we spoke to pointed out that their
Majlis, which is entirely appointed, has many similarities with the
House of Lords. We agreed that the abolition of both of them was a good
idea.</p><p><a name="06071880000087"><b><a name="06071880000449">Mr.
Browne:</b> I do not want to stray too far from the brief, but
I have a lot of sympathy for what the hon. Gentleman says. British
parliamentary democracy has been established over many years and has a
great deal to recommend it, but we should be cautious about assuming
that our models are superior to others. He cites a particularly good
and topical
example.</p><p><a name="06071880000088">I
want to raise one or two more points that perhaps the Minister will
touch upon if he has enough time. One is that the IPU faces challenges
from a number of competitor organisations. I see, for example, that you
are the chairman of the all-party British-Czech and Slovak group, Mr.
Cummings, and there are many other groups that conduct bilateral
relationships between our Parliament and other Parliaments, as well as
Commonwealth, NATO and other groups. The IPU needs to ensure that it
continues to be relevant and punch its weight. It is a source of great
concern to me, and I hope to others, that the United States, which is
the most powerful country in the world and has an impressive democratic
tradition, is not playing its part in the IPU. The organisation is
clearly diminished by its absence.</p><p><a name="06071880000089">As the hon. Member for Ribble
Valley (Mr. Evans) mentioned, the IPU always faces the challenge of
defining precisely what its role is. It is clearly beneficial for us to
continue to have discourse with countries around the world, but in
Iran, for example, to which there was a trip earlier this year, not
everybody is free to stand for Parliament in the first place.
Iran&#146;s parliamentarians are a group of people who have been
elected only after satisfying the people in positions of authority that
their views are broadly aligned with those of the regime.</p><p><a name="06071880000090">The IPU is engaged in a
difficult balancing act. I congratulate everybody on the IPU executive
in Britain for trying to strike that balance and for their vigilance
and their determination to represent the cause of parliamentary harmony
and discourse around the world. I hope that, in another 117 years, it
will be functioning as successfully as it does
today.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 17WH</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000410">10.40

Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold) (Con):</b> I am delighted to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings. I congratulate the right
hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd), not only securing the third
of what I gather have become annual debates&#151;I hope that we will
continue to hold them annually&#151;but on her long-standing work on
human rights in various guises. She is the Prime Minister&#146;s
special envoy to Iraq, but she did not even touch on Iraq in her
speech. However, she gave numerous examples of human rights abuses by
some pretty nasty regimes, and she is to be congratulated in the
highest terms for her work. We have also heard excellent speeches by my
hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) and the hon.
Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David).</p><p><a name="06071880000092">I shall touch on only one or
two points, because time is pretty limited. One of the main functions
of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is the strengthening of democracy and
good governance around the world. The dreadful news that we see on our
television screens and read in the newspapers each day tends to cloud
our thinking and make us think that democracy is perhaps on the wane
and that human rights abuses are getting worse. I am not sure that that
is the case. If we consider the historical context, we see that some of
the worst abuses in human history occurred in the last
century&#151;the second world war, Pol Pot&#146;s killing fields
and Stalin&#146;s gulags, to give a few examples. The IPU&#146;s
work has huge influence around the world, and it is vital that it is
continued and strengthened. Those involved are doing a great job of
work.</p><p><a name="06071880000093">As I said, the
right hon. Member for Cynon Valley is the Prime Minister&#146;s
special envoy to Iraq, where in December last year 75 per cent. of
those eligible to vote turned out and voted in the National Assembly
elections, despite huge intimidation. In Afghanistan, despite enormous
threats from the Taliban, supporters turned out en masse and elected a
president in 2004. Ukraine saw the orange revolution in 2004, and
Georgia the rose revolution in 2003. The bulldozer revolution in Serbia
brought Milosevic down in 2000. There are great examples of democracy
being spread throughout the world. The IPU&#146;s contacts with
parliamentarians in those democracies do a great deal to strengthen
them and bring about better human rights and well-being for the peoples
of those
countries.</p><p><a name="06071880000094">As
I said in my intervention on the right hon. Lady, the IPU could build
better relationships with multilateral and supranational bodies such as
the EU and, in particular, the UN. The latter does a great job of work,
but with the resources that it is given, it could do an even greater
job. Last year, it had an historic summit, but the process of reform
seems to have stalled. It is the job of parliamentarians&#151;the IPU
is well placed&#151;to have high-level contacts within the UN, to
ensure that that process
continues.</p><p><a name="06071880000095">One
of the main successes of that reform, as the right hon. Lady will know
well, was the creation of the Human Rights Council, which had its first
meeting in Geneva recently. We will all look to see how effective that
organisation is, and how it deals with those of its members who have
bad human rights records. Relationship building, not only with
individual countries and Members of Parliament, but with organisations
of that sort, could go a long way to helping to improve democracy 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 18WH</b><br>and human rights. Relationship building and education are critical parts
of the IPU&#146;s work. The hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr.
Davidson) referred to the visit to Saudi Arabia, a country that has a
faltering human rights record, but which is an important ally of the
United Kingdom and a very influential country in the current middle
east conflict. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West
(Mr. Brady) spoke warmly about the success of that visit to Saudi
Arabia and the two nations&#146; conference. Through such contacts
and networking, the IPU can do a great deal of
good.</p><p><a name="06071880000096">My hon. Friend
the Member for Ribble Valley referred to engaging with young people,
which is another critical part of the IPU&#146;s work. If one can
engage with young people at the start of their parliamentary careers,
they rise up through the system and can eventually become influential
people in their own country. My hon. Friend also referred to the work
of the British Council and to the Chevening scholarships given by the
Foreign Office. Those are excellent things, but it is a pity that the
remit of the Chevening scholarships has been narrowed recently. I ask
the Minister to look into that
carefully.</p><p><a name="06071880000097">As
my party&#146;s spokesman on trade, I was particularly interested to
read in the 2005 annual report about the work of the IPU in a symposium
and steering committee chaired by Lord Paul in Geneva on 21 to 23 April
on the subject of the Doha trade round. It demonstrated that really
successful initiatives, such as that symposium, should be followed up
when the right things do not happen. This is a critical time for World
Trade Organisation talks, and I wonder what sort of emergency
procedures the IPU has to enable it suddenly to summon a new symposium
to find out what further impetus the IPU could give stalled WTO talks.
The WTO talks are one of the best ways of improving human rights and
standards of living in the poorer countries of the world. If those
talks stall, it would be a great
setback.</p><p><a name="06071880000098">We are all
talking about the environment these days, but I did not hear the words
environment and sustainability mentioned once, although sustainability,
the environment and human rights are one and the same thing in terms of
good governance. What work could the IPU do to encourage some of the
less well functioning democracies of the world to improve their
environment and
sustainability?</p><p><a name="06071880000099">My
hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley mentioned embassy closures.
The hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) mentioned two visits to
central American countries. We now have embassies in only three of the
six central American countries. In addition, I note that we do not have
an embassy in Madagascar, from which an inward visit is envisaged. The
Foreign Office is closing embassies and removing British
representation, all for the sake of a very small amount of money,
compared to, say, the overspend of the Department for Work and
Pensions. The Foreign Office closes embassies and saves perhaps
&#163;1 million, but the Department for Work and Pensions overspend
far exceeds that.</p><p><a name="06071880000100">Through those closures, we are
cutting off our nose to spite our face. I hope that the Minister will
reflect on the strong concerns expressed in this debate, and that he
will think about whether we cannot have at least a very small
delegation in such countries, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble
Valley suggests. This 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 19WH</b><br>week, my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir
John Stanley) asked an interesting parliamentary question about how
many embassies are manned by one person. The answer is that there are
quite a lot around the world. However, that is a better model than
closing an embassy, because that way there is at least some presence on
the ground when something goes wrong, when some dreadful tragedy
occurs, or when some human rights abuse takes place. There is at least
someone to make representations to the relevant
Government.</p>

<p><a name="06071880000101">The
work of the IPU is vital. I again pay tribute to the right hon. Member
for Cynon Valley for her work, and to her staff in the IPU. I see that
Mr. Kenneth Courtenay is listening to the debate: as has been said, he
does a great deal of work and organisation, often at very antisocial
hours. The work of the IPU is vital, as is the work of its sister
organisation, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which has not
been mentioned this morning. I hope that they continue. I hope also
that the right hon. Lady continues to strengthen her work, particularly
in dealing with some of the nastier regimes throughout the world, to
help to alleviate the suffering of those parliamentarians who are
caught up in such regimes, and that through her work, human rights will
be improved and the well-being and good governance of those countries
will continue to improve.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000411">10.50

Minister for Europe (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</b> I, too,
congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann
Clwyd) on securing this debate. I pay tribute to the role that she
plays in the British group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and its
important work to foster good relations with parliamentarians
throughout the world. It is encouraging to hear about the positive work
that the IPU undertakes on a range of difficult and topical
issues.</p><p><a name="06071880000103">I have heard
in the debate and from my officials about the active inward and outward
visits programme, and the important role that it plays in encouraging
good government through a strong parliamentary system. Engagement with
Members of these Houses of Parliament can only help the sharing of good
practice with other Parliaments throughout the world. Hosting the
inward visits programme gives Members the opportunity to share the
strengths of our system, and travelling overseas allows many of us to
experience at first hand the problems and challenges facing our
colleagues in other countries.</p><p><a name="06071880000104">The Foreign
and Commonwealth Office has been delighted to be involved in the
programme of visits during the past year with delegations from Africa,
the middle east, Latin America and eastern Europe, and we were pleased
to offer help before and during overseas visits to regions including
Latin America, the middle east and Africa. The visits complement the
FCO&#146;s traditional diplomacy. A recent good example mentioned by
Members is the IPU visit to Iran, which added a welcome parliamentary
dimension at a sensitive time in our relationship with that country. We
look forward to continuing to help IPU programmes.</p><p><a name="06071880000105">My right hon. Friend raised the
question of human rights generally and specifically. I have already
told her that I shall deal in correspondence with individual 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 20WH</b><br>cases and countries where appropriate and necessary. The Foreign and
Commonwealth Office and Her Majesty&#146;s Government are committed
to protecting and promoting human rights, democracy and good governance
throughout the world. Those fundamental values lie at the heart of our
foreign policy. Democratic countries that respect the rights of their
citizens are more likely to settle disputes peacefully and respect
their international commitments and obligations. The promotion of
democratic practices and values is essential if we are to help other
countries achieve the high goals that are set for emerging
democracies.</p><p><a name="06071880000106"><b><a name="06071880000452">Richard
Burden (Birmingham, Northfield) (Lab):</b> I was an IPU
observer of the Palestinian elections at the beginning of this year. In
addition to addressing the point made by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) about the two Palestinian
parliamentarians who have been in prison for some time, will my right
hon. Friend the Minister say something about the 21 further Palestinian
parliamentarians who were picked up in the past few weeks, and the four
Palestinian parliamentarians who are having their east Jerusalem
residency rights revoked by Israel, apparently on the ground that they
refuse to give allegiance to the state of Israel, when the city in
which they live is occupied territory? He knows that those provisions
are illegal under The Hague convention.</p><p><a name="06071880000107"><b><a name="06071880000453">Mr.
Hoon:</b> I have referred to those cases, and I shall deal
with them in correspondence with my right hon. Friend the Member for
Cynon Valley.</p><p><a name="06071880000108">We very much
value the IPU&#146;s work in working towards the goals of achieving
democracy and respect for the rule of law. As chair of the IPU
committee on the human rights of parliamentarians, my right hon. Friend
has been active over the past few years. She recently presented her
newest report, which details 118 cases in 21 countries where the rights
of parliamentarians are curtailed or worse.</p><p><a name="06071880000109">The ability
of members of Parliaments to speak freely and question Governments
properly is fundamental to a democracy. The curtailing of that right in
some parts of the world is totally wrong. I am pleased that some cases
have been brought to a satisfactory conclusion through IPU action. My
right hon. Friend&#146;s update is welcome, and it shows yet another
aspect of the IPU&#146;s positive work.</p><p><a name="06071880000110">The British group continues to
contribute positively to the work of the IPU through its active
participation in the six-monthly assemblies. The Government strongly
welcome the bilateral meetings that the IPU organises in the margins of
the international conferences, and indeed, the feedback that we receive
from them. Such meetings are vital if we as parliamentarians are to
understand better what happens in other countries.</p><p><a name="06071880000111">The work of
the three standing committees is ably assisted by contributions from
Members of this House, and that work in turn contributes to our efforts
to alleviate the suffering of many people throughout the world. This
year the committees have focused on combating violence against women,
the control of small arms and the environment. They are all important
ambitions, and it is right that the world&#146;s parliamentarians
should consider such matters of global importance.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 21WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000112">I am pleased
that the IPU continues to work closely with the United Nations. It is
important that there is a dialogue between parliamentarians and the UN,
and it is right that the IPU plays a leading role in that dialogue. As
the UN continues to strengthen its links with civil society, the
parliamentary dimension becomes even more important, and as the major
global parliamentary group, the IPU has much to offer the UN&#146;s
work in support of democracy.</p><p><a name="06071880000113">The Foreign Office takes part
in regular discussions on the future programme of the British group of
the IPU. Our geographical desks continue to offer briefings before
visits overseas and our embassies contribute to the success of IPU
visits, and that help will continue.</p><p><a name="06071880000114">In response
to the points raised by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans),
the Foreign Office deploys its resources to meet its strategic
priorities. I was intrigued by his Tesco Metro approach, and I hope it
means that he will give strong support to our efforts in several
countries to co-locate our embassies and staff with those of other
countries. I know what an enthusiast he is for the European Union, and
I am delighted to hear him advocate the way in which we have sought to
anticipate his suggestion.</p><p><a name="06071880000115">There may be
times when we do not have a resident ambassador and it is not possible
for diplomats to visit a particular country at the same time as the
British group of the IPU. Those occasions should be rare, and I am sure
that hon. Members will understand that in those circumstances our help
might be more limited than that which we would usually expect to offer.
However, we look forward to another year of continued co-operation. The
Foreign Office and our posts stand ready to give what support they
properly can.</p><p><a name="06071880000116">In
closing, I repeat my congratulations to the British group of the IPU
for its effort and successes of the past year. I wish it well for the
coming year, and I know that the British group&#146;s participation
in a range of activities will contribute enormously to the spread of
democracy and good governance throughout the

Pritchard (The Wrekin) (Con):</b> I am grateful for the
opportunity to raise this important issue.</p><p><a name="06071880000123">Shropshire
has a proud and long history of serving this country in Her
Majesty&#146;s armed forces. There are 6,000 people employed in the
defence sector in Shropshire, and long may that continue. The
Shropshire work force are committed and skilled, and they are dedicated
to continuing for many years to come the service that they have
provided to the county and the nation.</p><p><a name="06071880000124">Earlier this year, the Army
Base Repair Organisation lost almost 100 jobs, but 770 jobs were saved
as a result of the Government listening. They listened because of an
Afghanistan inquiry by the Select Committee on Defence. I thank my
right hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot),
who agreed to hold that inquiry, which considered attrition on vehicles
such as the Warrior. I believe that as a result of the inquiry, the
Ministry of Defence changed its mind about closing the ABRO facility at
Donnington. That decision was only a three-year stay of execution,
however, and I hope that today the Minister will commit to a further
extension of the facility&#146;s life. I ask for that because the
deployment to Afghanistan will last at least three years&#151;that
has been put on record by Ministers and many in this House believe that
the deployment might last beyond that. If that is to be the case, it is
only fair that the work force should know. That would also make sense
as far as military planning is concerned. Of course, we also have what
I suggest will be a very long commitment in Iraq. I hope that the
Minister will allow the ABRO work force to hear that the three-year
extension has been agreed at long
last.</p><p><a name="06071880000125">I put on record
my thanks to the Minister with responsibility for the armed forces, the
right hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr.
Ingram) and to the former Under Secretary of State for Defence, the
right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), now in the Privy Council but
on the Back Benches, for their flexibility in the allocation of MOD
resources.</p><p><a name="06071880000126">I
turn to the Defence Logistics Organisation. Sadly, it was announced two
weeks ago that several hundred jobs will probably be lost at Sapphire
House in Telford, the neighbouring constituency to mine. The DLO work
force have given many years of service and commitment to the armed
forces and this country. I question whether the merger of the Defence
Procurement Agency and the DLO is right, but if I put that aside and
accepted that it is, I would still ask whether now is the right time.
Given our deployments around the world&#151;not only in Afghanistan
and Iraq, but in the Balkans, Congo, Cyprus and Gibraltar; we have more
commitments now than since the second world war&#151;is it right to
make a fundamental, key change to the operating framework of the DLO? I
think not.</p><p><a name="06071880000127">If we
agree with the principle behind the argument that the timing of the
ABRO decision was wrong, that argument can apply equally to what is
happening with the Defence Logistics Organisation. I hope that the
Minister will say that the timing is wrong and that the plans to move
some jobs&#151;only some jobs are involved&#151;to Bristol and the
south west will be parked 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 23WH</b><br>for the time being. There is also much concern among DLO workers about
how the consultation has taken place and the new consultation that has
been announced. I hope that the consultation period will be extended
from 30 days to 90 days so that the case for Sapphire House can be made
again to Ministers.</p><p><a name="06071880000128">I also want
to comment on RAF Cosford. Unemployment in Shropshire has increased by
30 per cent. in the past year and it continues to increase because of
an outflow of manufacturing jobs. Sadly, we are seeing the same all
over the west midlands. I hope that the west midlands will reinvent
itself and become a centre of environmental technology manufacturing,
rather than try to hold on to the manufacturing of years gone by. The
situation is a little like that which followed the second world war,
when munitions factories were turned into car manufacturing plants.
Perhaps we need to convert some car manufacturing plants. They could
become involved with new types of technology&#151;for example, they
could make parts of wind turbines or biomass machinery, or do biofuels
engineering.</p><p><a name="06071880000129">RAF
Cosford is key to the future of defence jobs in Shropshire. About 2,500
people are employed there, and we want that number to expand. I am
talking not only about direct military and civilian jobs at Cosford,
but the supply chain, not only in Shropshire but in the west midlands
more generally. Hon. Members will know that the west midlands has a
proud record of serving the aerospace industry. Given recent changes at
Airbus, I hope that the Government will be mindful of their need to
remain committed to keeping the aerospace industry and the
sector&#146;s skills, technologies and work force commitment
throughout the west midlands within our region. That can come only
through Government commitment and Government leadership. I hope that we
shall have some response from the Minister today.</p><p><a name="06071880000130">RAF Cosford
is key. The defence training review, which we hope will be announced in
a few months, must come to Shropshire, and not only because of our high
unemployment. Around the other competing site, St. Athan,
unemployment has decreased considerably, and I give all credit to the
Government for that. However, if they are serious about addressing
employment issues, they need look no further than the west
midlands.</p><p><a name="06071880000131"><b><a name="06071880000459">Daniel
Kawczynski (Shrewsbury and Atcham) (Con):</b> I congratulate
my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. As he knows, many of
those who work at RAF Cosford are my constituents, so I am grateful to
him. Does he agree that the threat to RAF Cosford and the jobs there is
indicative of the Government&#146;s lack of attention to Shropshire
as a whole? Does it not show that, despite their lack of representation
in that county, the Government need to take Shropshire far more
seriously?</p><p><a name="06071880000132"><b><a name="06071880000460">Mark
Pritchard:</b> I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s
intervention; he makes some valid points. In the past week or two, the
sugar beet industry in Shropshire has been under threat as a result of
British Sugar&#146;s announcement of the closure of the Allscott
factory. If the Government are serious about climate change&#151;I
digress slightly, but am answering my hon. Friend&#146;s
point&#151;they should come to Shropshire and encourage the extension
of biomass plants. There is one at the Harper Adams agricultural
university and another over 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 24WH</b><br>the border in Eccleshall; there may be one in north Shropshire as well.
Sugar beet can be used to help to reduce climate change and carbon
emissions through the use of biofuels, so I hope that the Government
will consider what they will do to save the livelihood of 700
Shropshire sugar beet farmers, as well as the factory work force. My
hon. Friend is right to underline the link to RAF Cosford, and the fact
that the Government need to show commitment to the west
midlands.</p><p><a name="06071880000133"><b><a name="06071880000461">Richard

debate.</p><p><a name="06071880000138"><b><a name="06071880000465">Chris

Pritchard:</b> I am happy to invite the hon. Gentleman to RAF
Cosford to see the fabulous facilities there. He asked about Wales. I
have extrapolated some points from the vast amount of data available in
the defence training review&#151;I hope that the Minister is taking
notes. The review calls for a reduction in the number of sites from 10
to two in a phased four-year programme. The key is a phased programme
that is sustainable, that maximises previous investment and that does
not require significant investment in local
infrastructure.</p><p><a name="06071880000140">Shropshire
has a marvellous road network, and we know that the Government and the
private sector are committed to extending the M6 toll road and linking
it with the M54. What better road than one to link up with Cosford?
There is also a commitment from local 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 25WH</b><br>railway companies&#151;it is part of the
bid&#151;to regenerate Cosford Halt station, which goes right into
the heart of the Cosford airbus area. What better railway than one
going into
Cosford?</p><p><a name="06071880000141">Cosford
also has access to Birmingham regional airport. Some Members may
disagree with me, but I would be happy to have an extra runway at
Birmingham rather than at Heathrow, as it would attract investment and
jobs to the area. In addition, the Cosford bid provides for new
accommodation and training facilities in the first year, not in the
second, third or fourth
year.</p><p><a name="06071880000142">Most
of all, Shropshire has a vibrant community. The Albrighton Traders
Association recently handed me a petition that I handed in at 10
Downing street. It asks the Government to consider the consequences to
the whole of the community if Cosford does not win the bid. The
decision is not just about the military or the work force, although
those people clearly are important. It is about the communities of
Albrighton, Shifnal and the wider Shropshire area. The impact on local
schools if we lost the bid would be dramatic: pupil numbers would fall,
budgets would fall and schools would have a difficult time. What would
be the impact on traders, bed and breakfasts, hoteliers and local
public houses? Even hairdressers&#151;I use the same barber as many
of the people at Cosford, as hon. Members can probably tell. My hair is
rather
short.</p><p><a name="06071880000143"><b><a name="06071880000467">Daniel

will take an holistic, regional view of the effects should Cosford not
win the
bid.</p><p><a name="06071880000148"><b><a name="06071880000471">Daniel
Kawczynski:</b> At present, I am negotiating with the chief
executive of Arriva Trains, Mr. Holland, significantly to improve
Arriva&#146;s service between Shrewsbury and Birmingham, which passes
through Cosford. Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be far more
difficult for local MPs and organisations to campaign for better rail
services if Cosford were not
successful?</p><p><a name="06071880000149"><b><a name="06071880000472">Chris
Bryant:</b> He said that the infrastructure was already
there.</p><p><a name="06071880000150"><b><a name="06071880000473">Mark
Pritchard:</b> We must improve on a rail system that, for the
most part, is a good service. My hon. Friend is right to push for
improvements, and Arriva Trains, Central Trains or whoever might win
future franchises must ensure that they continue to improve the
services. This is&#151;forgive me&#151;a twin-track process,
whereby the railways would benefit from Cosford, and Cosford would
benefit from the railways. Obviously, the local community would benefit
from
both.</p><p><a name="06071880000151">That
links nicely with the education sector. Wolverhampton university is an
excellent university. It works closely with organisations in the West
Midlands technology corridor, which is a cluster of aerospace and
technology companies. I hope that that will be a key 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 26WH</b><br>factor in the decision-making process of the Ministry of Defence. There
is an important geographical economy of scale as far as Cosford is
concerned. There is a skills set right on its doorstep, and that should
be a central
consideration.</p><p><a name="06071880000152">People
who might be required, asked, invited or told to move to St. Athan,
should it win the bid, may not go. We are seeing that in the Defence
Logistics Organisation. Much of its work force are unable to move to
Bristol and the south-west. The fact is that the house prices in St.
Athan are 30 per cent. above the regional average. Compare them with
the house prices in Cosford, which are 30 per cent. below the regional
average. If the Government think that everybody will up sticks and go
to St. Athan, they are mistaken, as they were mistaken in respect of
the DLO.</p><p><a name="06071880000153"><b><a name="06071880000474">Chris

this will be such an opportunity. I told him earlier that I was unable
to take his intervention, given that he has an opportunity to raise the
issue during Welsh questions. I look forward to his tabling a question
on St. Athan for the next Welsh questions. No doubt he will also ask a
supplementary on Cosford.<i>

Cummings (in the Chair):</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not

Pritchard:</b> Thank you, Mr.
Cummings.</p><p><a name="06071880000157">The
education sector is important. I pay tribute to Professor Caroline
Gipps, who is the vice-chancellor of the University of Wolverhampton,
and to all the work that is being done to help RAF Cosford to win the
bid. It is vital that the Government take a regional and holistic view.
I come back to that point, as the decision will be critical to the
local education sector&#151;not only primary and secondary schools,
but the university sector as well. The university works hand in hand
with RAF Cosford and the Defence College of Aeronautical
Engineering.</p><p><a name="06071880000158">In
the context of what is happening around the world, it is likely that
there will be more emphasis on aeronautics and, dare I say it, even
missile technology. Should Britain become part of the ballistic missile
defence shield&#151;I am not saying that it should, but there must be
a debate in the House at some point&#151;Cosford will play a part in
that. Therefore, we should not disrupt Cosford at this
time.</p><p><a name="06071880000159">I
conclude on a wider point. This is a personal view, not a party view. I
question whether this country&#146;s defence privatisation has gone
too far, and I say that as a Conservative. These are not party
political matters. National security goes beyond that. It is the duty
of all Governments first and foremost to protect their citizens, and
that is also the duty of humble Back Benchers, which most of us are. I
question whether the present Government, in their desire to be more
machismo on privatisation than the Conservative Government, are
privatising too much and undermining our national security in the
process. Secondly, do they compare post-privatisation or possible
privatisation outputs with public sector outputs?</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 27WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000160">Thirdly,
the Government may be underplaying the importance of the military ethos
within such organisations. Many civilians working at Cosford, for
example, are ex-military. Not all of them are, and people do not have
to be ex-military to be good at their job, but there is a clear link
between the military ethos and the hard work, commitment and dedication
of employees at Cosford and, indeed, the
DLO.</p><p><a name="06071880000161">I
hope that the Government will put a brake on some of their
privatisation plans. For example, there has not been an in-house bid in
respect of RAF Cosford. I would like to see an in-house bid. How can we
have an open consultation process without one? How can the Government
consider economic factors, specific training factors and the wider
socio-economic factors&#151;the hard and soft measures&#151;when
they have not considered an in-house bid? I should be interested to
hear what the Minister has to say. The Government have denied that the
review is about an estates package; they say that it is not about
property and buildings but just about defence training. If that is the
case, let us see an in-house bid and if that is not good enough, so be
it. But we need to tread carefully before stepping forward to even more
privatisation when there have been some pretty big disasters.</p><p><a name="06071880000162">There is a
certain so-called British company that seems to win virtually every
defence order at the moment in this country, yet a lot of its defence
manufacturing is undertaken abroad. How is that British? How is that
protecting British jobs? I shall mention that company: it is BAE
Systems. It may be said that they employ a lot of people in this
country; they do, and I am grateful for that, but do we want to put all
our eggs in one basket? BAE seems to be winning virtually every
contract under the sun and I ask whether we should require the company
to commit to undertaking a larger proportion of its defence
manufacturing in this country rather letting it say, &#147;We are
listed on the stock market in the UK, therefore we are British and we
are protected from any criticism about outsourcing manufacturing
abroad.&#148;</p><p><a name="06071880000163">Shropshire
has a proud history and heritage in the defence sector. It is committed
to serving this country and Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces. It
wishes to retain and expand its 6,000 defence sector jobs; it wishes to
see an extension of the lifeline to the Army-based repair organisation
at Donnington in my constituency and a proper consultation process in
respect of the DLO at Sapphire House in the Telford constituency. Many
of my constituents travel across the parliamentary boundary to work at
Sapphire House. It also wishes to see a commitment to provide the best
defence training for the 21st century, which, in my humble view, can
only be delivered view through the skills set provided and experienced
at RAF Cosford. Overall, it wants a commitment from the Government to
jobs in Shropshire and the west
midlands.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000413">11.22

McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</b> I will be brief,
as I know that local Members will want to speak. I speak simply as the
Chair of the Public and Commercial Services Union parliamentary group
to make one plea in relation to the Defence Logistics Organisation, the
defence training review and the supply-chain initiative. There has been
a distinct lack of consultation with the PCS as the trade union
representing the staff in all the organisations.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 28WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000165">The hon. Member for The Wrekin
(Mark Pritchard) referred to Sapphire House in Telford and the
potential loss of 400 jobs. The Ministry of Defence admits that the DLO
co-location will save less than &#163;8 million. A survey of the
staff at Sapphire House was undertaken and 96 per cent. made it clear
that they will not move. Their main argument, which the hon. Gentleman
mentioned, is that the move to Bristol is unaffordable for them. Let us
look at the salaries of staff working within the DLO: more than 60 per
cent. of PCS members working at the DLO earn less than &#163;16,000 a
year. The average price of a two-bedroom property in Bath is about
&#163;285,000. It will be physically impossible for a number of the
staff to take up any potential offer of a job under relocation. That
will result in not only in discomfort for the individual families and a
potential disturbance to their future well-being, but in a considerable
loss of expertise to the
service.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060718/halltext/60718h0343.htm"/>


<p><a name="06071880000166">The
DLO has attempted to recruit elsewhere, within the Bristol area. It
attempted to recruit 12 commercial officers in Bristol, but failed to
do so because the pay offer was too low. The challenge of recruiting to
fill 4,000 posts in the new area will become insuperable. The various
consultations that have taken place have not included the staff. On a
number of occasions, the union has sought representations with
management but it has been rebuffed. I ask the Minister to pass the
message back through the DLO management structure that the staff need
to be fully engaged in the discussions. At present, the trade unions
have not been kept informed about emerging proposals on co-location; in
many instances, management have simply refused to talk.</p><p><a name="06071880000167">On the
defence training review, I share the concerns that have been expressed
across the House about privatisations going too far. PCS members have
organised a 24-hour vigil today outside the Ministry of Defence and I
invite hon. Members to attend to meet the staff involved. They are
dedicated, committed professionals who want to provide a service in the
future but who are now threatened with privatisation. As hon. Members
have said, people from Cosford and St. Athan are involved and face the
potential of considerable disturbance to their lives and families as a
result of forced moves. I repeat, we will lose their
professionalism&#151;a professional capital that will be difficult to
build up elsewhere. The savings involved appear to be relatively minor.
In addition, we risk of creating what is virtually a monopoly in
awarding the
contract.</p><p><a name="06071880000168">Finally,
I want to talk about Stafford. The in-house option &#147;Do
Different&#148; has been determined, which I welcome on behalf of the
PCS. However, no information has been provided on how or why Stafford
was earmarked for closure; there has been inadequate consultation and
discussion with staff, which has caused considerable concern. Many of
those anxieties could be overcome not only by changing the
decision-making processes within the Department but by ensuring that
there is a free flow of information, adequate consultation and full
involvement of what is, I repeat, a very dedicated team of staff in all
these establishments, who have served this country well over the
years.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000414">11.26

Philip Dunne (Ludlow) (Con):</b> I start by congratulating my
neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard),
on securing 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 29WH</b><br>this important debate. I am pleased that there has already been a
measure of cross-party consensus on the issue of Cosford, to which I
shall come
later.</p><p><a name="06071880000170">I
congratulate the Minister on his new post, and I start by emphasising
the long tradition of defence within Shropshire. It has an important
role not only in terms of employment in Shropshire and the west
midlands, but in the nation as a whole. The barracks at Copthorne are
one of three regional divisional headquarters in the United Kingdom.
The general there is responsible for 40,000 troops, and service
personnel from Coventry in the east to the Irish sea, and from Cornwall
to north Wales are commanded from Copthorne primarily because of its
importance geographically. It is roughly in the centre of the country.
I shall come shortly to why that is important for Cosford.</p><p><a name="06071880000171">The people of
Shropshire supply regiments in the armed forces; the Regular Army has
the second battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment currently in Iraq;
Territorial Army soldiers from Shropshire are serving in Iraq and in
other commitments abroad at the moment. In these particularly difficult
times, it is important for the Minister and incumbent on him to provide
security for their families back home in terms of the job prospects
that they have to look forward to. The more uncertainty there is
because of the reorganisation of the defence establishment, the more
difficult and challenging it is for our service personnel to perform
their duties, and I hope the Minister will respond to that.</p><p><a name="06071880000172">The RAF has an important role
in Shropshire. Along with RAF Cosford, there is RAF Shawbury, which is
an important base. It is not in my constituency but I am sure that my
hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) will refer
to it.</p><a name="06071880000400"><p>The
subject of the debate is employment in the defence sector and it is
important to recognise that we are going through a slightly more
difficult time than we have done in recent years in relation to
employment in the west midlands. In my constituency alone in the past
12 months, unemployment has increased by 35 per cent. admittedly from a
very low base. In Ludlow, unemployment rose from 1.2 per cent. to 1.6
per cent. in the year to June, which is a matter of increasing concern.
That is happening particularly in the manufacturing sector. Relatively
few residents from the defence establishment live in my constituency;
they may not have been affected thus far, but I anticipate that further
job cuts will have an impact on my constituency and many others in
Shropshire.</p><p><a name="06071880000173"><b><a name="06071880000480">Mr.
Si&#244;n Simon (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab):</b> Does the
hon. Gentleman agree that, given the astonishing increase in
unemployment in his constituency that he has sketched out and given
that four of the 15 constituencies with the highest rates of
unemployment are in the city of Birmingham, the west midlands surely
has the highest claim of any region, including Wales, to be looked on
favourably by the
Minister?</p><p><a name="06071880000174"><b><a name="06071880000481">Mr.
Dunne:</b> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
welcome intervention. It reflects concern among representatives from
across the west midlands about the threat of increased unemployment
there. However, I would point out to him that there is a political
connotation.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 30WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000175">My hon. Friend the Member for
The Wrekin was very restrained in not seeking to score party political
points, but there are 10 Labour-held seats in the west midlands in
which Members have majorities of less than 3,000&#151;roughly
equivalent to the number of jobs at stake at Cosford&#151;and it is a
shame that not one of the Members representing those seats is in the
Chamber to argue their case.</p><p><a name="06071880000176">The hon.
Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon) speaks with
considerable authority about unemployment in Birmingham, and I have
much sympathy with that. I also pay tribute to the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden), who intervened earlier, for
his work in drawing together cross-party consensus to try to secure
jobs for those who were put out of work through the bankruptcy of
British Leyland. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Excuse me. I meant the
bankruptcy at Rover.</p><p><a name="06071880000177">That brings me to the main
topic, which is to argue that RAF Cosford should secure a position as a
national centre of excellence in the defence training review&#151;a
decision that I understand is due to be made in October. I shall be
accompanying my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin tomorrow to argue
the case with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I thank my hon.
Friend for securing that meeting, although the decision rests primarily
with the Ministry of Defence. From separate conversations, I am aware
that the Ministry is under considerable financial pressure; any help
that the Treasury can give to relieve that pressure will, I am sure, be
welcomed by the Minister. We will try to argue the Minister&#146;s
case for funding, particularly for
Cosford.</p><p><a name="06071880000178">The
&#147;Let&#146;s Fly&#148; campaign, spearheaded by Advantage
West Midlands, to champion Cosford&#146;s case, has presented a
compelling case for Cosford to be selected under the defence training
review. I am sure that the Minister will have received many
submissions, not least from me, to argue Cosford&#146;s case, but I
shall focus on three
aspects.</p><p><a name="06071880000179">First,
the skills inherent in the area are considerable. They include not only
the aerospace and motor vehicle engineering skill base of the west
midlands&#151;with the possible exception of parts of the south-west,
it is the centre of excellence in the UK&#151;and there is no
question but that it could provide an additional work force for
recruitment that does not exist in the competitive market. We have
heard that it is unlikely that many of those employed at Cosford would
relocate in the event of the wrong decision being made&#151;if
Cosford does not secure its future.</p><p><a name="06071880000180">I am told
that there are 1,386 technical and manufacturing companies in the area
immediately surrounding Cosford that employ 22,000 people in the
aerospace industry, and there are another 300 related companies in the
region. In addition, a strong and growing university capability can be
built upon to provide for the training requirements of Cosford.
Unfortunately, we do not have a university in Shropshire, although we
have various tertiary education establishments that cover other sectors
and there is the move to develop one that I suggest would merely
increase the skills
base.</p><p><a name="06071880000181">The second
aspect is the transport infrastructure, to which my hon. Friend the
Member for The Wrekin referred. The county is not as well served as
others in terms of the county town&#146;s access to London. As it 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 31WH</b><br>happens, Cosford is well served because of its proximity to the motorway
network. One cannot get any closer than Cosford is to the M54; the M54
is within a few miles of the M6, the north-south trunk road that leads
to the south, to the M42, to the M1 and to London. The railway passes
within a few hundred yards of the entrance to Cosford; although the
station is not served by a large number of passing trains, it is
capable of coping with more regular trains. As has been said,
discussions are ongoing with a couple of train companies to provide a
more regular service.</p><p><a name="06071880000182">The infrastructure is there; we
need to encourage the operating companies to use it more. My hon.
Friend has already touched upon the airport infrastructure. I endorse
his comments about Birmingham being more suitable for any increase in
air transport facilities than Wolverhampton business airport in my
constituency. The latter is little more than a general aviation field,
and is not suitable for significant
expansion.</p><p><a name="06071880000183"><b><a name="06071880000482">Mark
Pritchard:</b> Although I support the expansion of Birmingham
airport rather than of Wolverhampton business airport, any increase in
air traffic and in air routes should not result in planes flying low
over the Shropshire hills, causing noise pollution and disrupting the
Shropshire way, birdsong or animal welfare in an area of outstanding
natural beauty.</p><p><a name="06071880000184"><b><a name="06071880000483">Mr.
Dunne:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for highlighting
the fact that approximately 88 per cent. of the South Shropshire
district council, which is entirely within my constituency, is in an
area of outstanding natural beauty. There is considerable concern about
the recent rerouting of the flight path into Manchester airport and the
consequent increase in air traffic that has resulted from the lower
flight path ceiling. It is primarily civilian traffic, but some noise
irritation also results from the helicopter training from RAF Shawbury.
One reason for that is that the area in which they have chosen to do
their training descents happens to be on the edge of an area of
outstanding natural beauty that is also in my constituency. However,
that is somewhat of a side issue in relation to the future development
of RAF Cosford for training, as I understand that no flights will
emanate from that site.</p><p><a name="06071880000185">Thirdly,
aside from the central transport infrastructure of the location, the
general location of Cosford is important in relation to the nation as a
whole. The nationwide review is there to provide a national centre of
excellence. To site such a centre in the middle of the country means
that it will be accessible to an immediate catchment of the 4 million
people living within one hour of Cosford. The comparative figure at the
competing site of St. Athan is approximately 1 million, so Cosford
seems relevant, not least because of its accessibility to all parts of
the country for military use and for recruitment and training. That
should be welcomed by the Minister.</p><p><a name="06071880000186">Finally, I
should also add that Cosford lies just outside my constituency, but
within Bridgnorth district council, which is predominantly within my
constituency. I have had discussions, as has my hon. Friend, with the
chief executive of the council and council leaders. I understand that
the planning situation for RAF Cosford is that if it ceases to be used
for military purposes, it will revert to its original use for
agriculture. If the Department imagines that there is a honey pot to
exploit from the redevelopment 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 32WH</b><br>of the site, it should be under no doubt that that will be fiercely
resisted by the local authorities in whose domain the planning decision
would
lie.</p><p><a name="06071880000187"><b><a name="06071880000484">Daniel
Kawczynski:</b> Will my hon. Friend say in front of the
Minister that he shares my view about the strength of feeling among
local people in Shropshire? They feel passionately that they wish to
stay in our county and do not wish to move down to Bristol. All of us
who represent Shropshire are Salopians: people of Shropshire who feel
proud of our county and want to stay rather than be forced to
Bristol.</p><p><a name="06071880000188"><b><a name="06071880000485">Mr.

championing the cause of Shropshire from my hon. Friend and
neighbour&#151;he does so with considerable aplomb and style at every
opportunity.</p><p><a name="06071880000189">There is no
doubt that people who work and live in the surroundings of Cosford will
want to stay there, particularly the non-service personnel. The service
personnel obviously are used to moving around the world and country at
the behest of their superior officers, but the civilian
personnel&#151;who make up approximately half the people employed at
Cosford&#151;would find it difficult to move for the reasons
explained by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)
and would have no inclination to move.</p><p><a name="06071880000190">Many people who work at Cosford
live in the Bridgnorth area of my constituency and I have met many of
them who have explained that they are concerned that the results of the
proposed review will come out the wrong way. I urge the Minister to
accept the arguments that have been put to him in favour of RAF
Cosford. We look forward to the right result from this training
review.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000415">11.43
am</h5><p><a name="06071880000191"><b><a name="06071880000486">David
Wright (Telford) (Lab):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for
The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) on securing this debate&#151;he has done
us a real service. From the range of Members present, we can see that
this is an important issue across the west midlands and it is also nice
to see a full set of Shropshire MPs here. I can speak in defence of
jobs in the county as a Shropshire lad who was born and raised
there.</p><p><a name="06071880000192">I want to
focus my brief remarks on three areas. First, I want to talk about
ABRO, which is in the constituency of the hon. Member for The Wrekin,
who I was going to call my hon. Friend&#151;indeed, I will do that. I
also want to talk about Cosford and particularly Sapphire house and the
Defence Logistics Organisation at Sapphire house. We have had a
problematic time in Shropshire over the past 12 months. A number of
announcements in relation to defence jobs have been very negative and,
on Sapphire house, the Ministry of Defence is plain wrong.</p><p><a name="06071880000193">The
organisation at Sapphire house has a large number of highly skilled
people who procure equipment for our armed forces. It is easy to think
that those people sit around, press buttons on computer screens and
make default decisions assisted by a computer in relation to equipment
provided for the armed forces. That view is completely wrong as those
people are in regular contact with the front line and take telephone
calls about the provision of equipment for the armed forces from people

<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 33WH</b><br>who are war fighting on the front line. If we proceed with the proposal
to move jobs out of my constituency to the Bath and Bristol area, we
will lose that experience. There are generations of families who have
worked at Sapphire house and the culture of supporting defence
procurement has existed for more than 60 years in the wider Telford and
Shropshire area. The loss of those jobs would be extremely negative for
the Ministry of Defence and for the local economy.</p><p><a name="06071880000194">Yesterday, I
took a number of trade union colleagues and Councillor Keith Austin,
the chair of the local defence support group, to see the Minister. The
Minister suggested he would look at making the consultation period for
the decision in relation to Sapphire house more flexible. I hope that
there will be flexibility and that the Minister will seriously consider
the representations made to him by the trade unions
yesterday&#151;PCS members put together a strong and coherent case.
We need to preserve the skills and capacity at Sapphire house. There is
a community and generational aspect to the support given to Sapphire
house and there will be recruitment and selection problems if the
facility moves to the Bath and Bristol area. Hon. Members have already
discussed the difficulties in recruiting staff in that
area.</p><p><a name="06071880000195">There
will be a significant problem given that, when the trade unions
consulted their members&#151;more than 400 at Sapphire
house&#151;97 per cent. said that they did not want to move to Bath
or Bristol. There are a number reasons for that and they include family
ties and connections, house prices and income. The Ministry of Defence
actually gets a very good deal out of Shropshire people. I do not want
to talk down salaries, but the Government get a very cheap deal and
good value for money in terms of the people who work at Sapphire house,
who are committed to the organisation and to the Ministry of Defence
and go the extra mile. Those people deserve to be listened to and the
Minister needs to take the message to the Government that they need to
think again about Sapphire house.</p><p><a name="06071880000196">A number of
the integrated project teams on that site are saying that they do not
want to move. The drive for efficiency will not secure the savings that
the Ministry of Defence require. We will see a fall in the quality of
the service and that is particularly damaging at a time when our armed
forces are heavily committed around the
world.</p><p><a name="06071880000197">The
Minister decided to change his view on ABRO, which is in constituency
of the hon. Member for The Wrekin, largely due to the pressure brought
to bear by the trade unions, the defence support group and by Members
from across the political spectrum, particularly the Shropshire five as
we could call ourselves. We need to go forward now and ensure ABRO has
not just a medium-term future, but a long-term future based at
Donnington. A number of Amicus trade union representatives from ABRO
came to see me at my surgery a couple of weeks ago. They are keen to
work constructively with the Ministry of Defence and with management to
make sure ABRO at Donnington is extremely efficient and indispensable.
The trade union representatives are developing new opportunities for
on-site training and are flexible in their approach.</p><p><a name="06071880000198">We would like to explore in
more detail the proposals that the Government are considering in
relation to a Govcom for ABRO and we need to go out and win more
private sector work, which I know the work force 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 34WH</b><br>are keen to do. When there is a surge in demand for armoured repairs
because troops are in action, the only real place that can deal with it
is ABRO. The people who work at ABRO, like those at Sapphire house, go
the extra mile&#151;if there is a job to be done, they make sure it
is done. They do not watch the clock, they turn up outside their normal
hours and do the work for our front line troops. This means that when
there is a surge in demand because our troops are under threat and they
need armour to be repaired, they can rapidly go back out onto the front
line. There is great commitment both in Sapphire house and ABRO to our
front line, and we should thank all the civilian staff involved in that
work for ensuring that our armed forces are supported professionally
and will continue to be supported professionally as long as those jobs
are retained in Shropshire, in Telford and in
Wrekin.</p><p><a name="06071880000199">I shall finish
by speaking about Cosford, which is crucial for the long-term future of
our manufacturing base in the west midlands. Cosford is ideally placed
to be the defence training establishment for the UK. It is central
geographically, as the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) said, and the
transport links to the site are superb. The M54 runs probably one mile
away from the site, and the rail link is virtually on the site. There
is also a great history and heritage about the RAF at Cosford. With the
aerospace museum and the new museum on the cold war based on the site,
there is a real connection between modern-day training and the history
and heritage of the RAF. That is significant when it comes to getting
people through the training environment and ensuring that they
understand the history of the RAF and the future dynamic of the RAF and
other
services.</p><p><a name="06071880000200">Given
the knowledge, skills and training base across the west midlands, we
have an unsurpassed level of expertise. As part of the proposal,
Advantage West Midlands, the regional development agency, proposes to
create a national manufacturing skills academy focused around the
Cosford site. That is very
important.</p><p><a name="06071880000201"><b><a name="06071880000487">Mark
Pritchard:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman support me in
supporting the idea of an in-house bid for the defence training review?
Would he like to put that on the
record?</p><p><a name="06071880000202"><b><a name="06071880000488">David
Wright:</b> I am happy to put it on the record that I have
always supported the idea of an in-house bid. I met PCS colleagues
before the hon. Gentleman was elected in order to talk about an
in-house bid. I supported that idea right through the process and was
very disappointed when the MOD did not allow an in-house bid to be
made. However, we are where we are, and it is crucial now that we
compete with St. Athan and win the proposal. That said, I supported
hon. Members who wanted an in-house option. I hope that they will be
reassured by the fact that there is unity across this Chamber today and
that we arguing for jobs in Shropshire to be protected. That is the key
thing that we want to deliver
today.</p><p><a name="06071880000203">On the
manufacturing sector, we have heard about the number of companies that
are connected to RAF Cosford and about the strategy of Advantage West
Midlands for that area&#151;the western side of the conurbation, if I
can put it like that. The technology corridor along the M54 is
particularly significant. We 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 35WH</b><br>have university sites in both Telford and Wolverhampton. We also have
the excellent Telford college of arts and technology, which is the
leading college in the UK, as shown by its recent Ofsted marks. It is
keen to key in to training and skills in relation to Cosford and to
connect companies in Telford to the defence training activity that it
is hoped will take place at
Cosford.</p><p><a name="06071880000204">I am
conscious that other hon. Members want to speak and that those on the
Front Benches need time to respond to and wind up the debate, but I
have three messages to give. They are about a long-term future for
ABRO, the defence of jobs at Sapphire house, the DLO site in my
constituency, and the proposals for Cosford being supported by the
Minister to deliver long-term manufacturing job growth in the west
midlands.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000416">11.53
am</h5><p><a name="06071880000205"><b><a name="06071880000489">Mr.
Owen Paterson (North Shropshire) (Con):</b> It is a great
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood&#151;it
takes us back to the good old days of the European Scrutiny Committee.
It is a great pleasure also to follow my near neighbour, the hon.
Member for Telford (David Wright). Like him, I congratulate most
heartily my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) on
landing this debate at a critical time. Time now is short and I shall
be brief. I would like to mention three
subjects.</p><p><a name="06071880000206">The
first is RAF Shawbury, which is the jewel in the crown as far as
Shropshire&#146;s defence activity is concerned. It supports at least
1,500 jobs locally and injects &#163;20 million into the
local economy. It is immensely important locally, but it is also hugely
important nationally and, potentially, internationally, as it is the
seat of the defence helicopter flying
school.</p><p><a name="06071880000207">My
comments to the Minister are simple. Ten days ago, I went on a
simulated flight in the Bell simulator round most of north Shropshire
and then did exactly the same thing in a real helicopter to compare the
difference. As I said, Shawbury is immensely important locally, but a
small number of people living close to the airfield are aggravated by
noise, and it was most interesting to learn that 30 per cent. of day
flying can be done in a simulator and 70 per cent. has to be done for
real but at night it is half and half. It was clear from that exercise
that people had to do the real thing. When we came to land, for
instance, in the simulator, I always thought that we were about 30 ft
higher than we actually were according to the simulator, so it has to
be done for real and I stress that Shawbury has enormous support
locally. Many farmers are very co-operative and offer landing sites,
but there are two other points to be
made.</p><p><a name="06071880000208">First,
a small number of people are very badly affected&#151;the Slater
family, for instance. I saw a predecessor of the Minister, who is now
Lord Moonie, about that. At the time, there were discussions about
insulation materials and there were NATO trials. Can the Minister tell
us what new technologies are coming along? We welcome the helicopter
training at Shawbury, but for a small number of people there is
aggravation, although I take my hat off to the RAF authorities for the
way in which they have liaised with parish councils and done their bit
to mitigate complaints. However, the local question is: what is the
form on new technologies coming along for low-frequency
noise?</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 36WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000209">The other question, which is of
national consequence, given the demands particularly in Iraq and the
extreme demands for helicopter pilots in Afghanistan, is: what steps
are the Government taking to speed up the training of helicopter
pilots? The Minister gave me a reply last week, saying that it took 87
weeks to train a Royal Navy pilot, 71 an Army pilot and 110 for a Royal
Air Force pilot. When I went to Shawbury, I glibly said, &#147;Well,
we used to stick Spitfire pilots in the air after 10 hours,&#148; but
I was told, &#147;Yes, and a lot of them crashed.&#148; The people
there insisted that it was extremely difficult to shorten the training.
However, given the demands on our forces, particularly with the
increasing role in Afghanistan, it seems that there will inevitably be
a shortage of pilots, so can the Minister explain what steps the
Government are taking to increase the number of pilots and what part
Shawbury will play? Obviously, Shawbury will play a key role and will
welcome
that.</p><p><a name="06071880000210">Sadly,
two soldiers from Tern Hill barracks in my constituency were recently
killed in Iraq. They were killed by an explosive device hitting a Land
Rover. I have asked the Minister questions on this issue and I
understand that he is being cagey for operational reasons, but I
understand that there are vehicles that will repel those explosive
devices. Lord Drayson, in the other House, has stated that a vehicle
called the Mamba was trialled in Bosnia and sold off because it was
unreliable. I have read reports in the press, which I would like the
Minister to verify, that actually the Mambas were sold to a private
security firm and are now running down the most dangerous road in the
world&#151;the one between Baghdad airport and Baghdad town
centre&#151;carrying personnel of pretty high importance. I have also
read a report that a Mamba has sustained two direct hits and all those
in it got out alive. Therefore, can the Minister explain the
Government&#146;s position on putting our troops in extreme danger in
soft-skin Land
Rovers?</p><p><a name="06071880000211">To
take another country, Canada yesterday cancelled a major element of its
FRES&#151;future rapid effects system&#151;programme. We are
planning to spend &#163;14 billion on FRES. That is a very grandiose
expensive scheme down the road. Canada has decided that its troops need
help now&#151;that for operational reasons they need improved
equipment&#151;and it is diverting some of its FRES money now into
improved equipment for deployment in Afghanistan. We have Alvis in the
constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin.
Could&#151;</p><p><a name="06071880000212"><b><a name="06071880000490">Mr.
Jimmy Hood (in the Chair):</b> Order. May I ask the hon.
Gentleman to address the subject of this Adjournment debate, which is
defence sector jobs in Shropshire and the west
midlands?</p><p><a name="06071880000213"><b><a name="06071880000491">Mr.
Paterson:</b> Absolutely, Mr. Hood. The vehicle that I am
about to mention, called the Scarab, was made at Alvis in the
constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin. My question
to the Minister is: does he have plans to divert some FRES money into
investment immediately to provide vehicles for our troops in
Afghanistan or in Iraq that would be more resistant to explosive
devices than the Land Rovers used currently and that could be made in
the west midlands, where we have a long history of vehicle
manufacture?</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 37WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000214">Finally, I
will touch on the points that other hon. Members made on the importance
of Cosford. I will not repeat them, but we must consider what has
happened with Sapphire house, the British Sugar closure at Allscott and
the recent comments by Professor Les Worrall. He
said:</p><a name="06071880000405"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If I
were a betting man, which I am not, I would have a few quid on the
Shropshire economy being in for a tough time over the next
year&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071880000215">Given the experience of
the benefits that Shawbury brings, we need a mixed economy. It is
inevitable that there will be a reduction in the importance of
agriculture and manufacturing. Therefore, the establishment of what is
proposed at Cosford is of immense importance to the economy. I shall
not repeat the comments that were made earlier&#151;that would be
invidious&#151;but I stress that they have the support of all
organisations across the county, and, I think, across the west
midlands. I should like the Minister&#146;s comments on what is going
to happen at
Cosford.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000417">12

Burt (Solihull) (LD):</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your
wise guidance this afternoon, Mr. Hood. I shall try not to repeat the
comments of other hon. Members, because I am sure that we all want to
hear what the Minister has to say. However, I congratulate the hon.
Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) on bringing this important
subject before the House for debate today&#151;as well as the hon.
Members who have spoken, and those who have not had the
opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="06071880000217">I want
to see whether I can come at the subject from a slightly different
angle. As west midlands Members of Parliament we are all keen that the
area should prosper. However, the job of the Ministry of Defence is to
find the best service for the best price. I want to argue that the west
midlands is in fact the best area to choose. The hon. Member for The
Wrekin has described the west midlands as a centre that reinvents
itself&#151;and it does. It is the birthplace of industry, and that
is particularly true of the area that the hon. Gentleman represents. It
happens all the time. As industry develops and things move on, we take
our knocks. We remain competitive by inventing new industry, such as
environmental manufacturing, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That
is an exciting development and I echo what he said about it.</p><p><a name="06071880000218">I understand
that the announcement about the Defence Logistics Organisation was made
about two weeks ago. However, the MOD bought the premises in Bristol, a
point that the hon. Member for The Wrekin raised in May 2005, before
the consultation was concluded. I wonder what the Minister&#146;s
view is about that, given the relocation of staff who do not want to
leave the west midlands and who would prefer to stay where they are.
There may be a great skills shortage, resulting in a challenge to the
Government in the provision of the service, because of the lack of
people who want to move.</p><p><a name="06071880000219">Members on both sides of the
Chamber have spoken about the defence training review and have raised
the question whether privatisation has gone a step too far. Although I
am a Liberal I am not a great fan of privatisation, and I should also
be interested to know from the Minister why an in-house bid was not
considered feasible. The justification was that outside 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 38WH</b><br>expertise would be required, but how did the Government know that the
expertise was not available if no in-house bid could be made?</p><p><a name="06071880000220">On the
question of the appropriateness of Cosford as a site for the defence
training review, hon. Members on both sides have talked about the
infrastructure, the universities, and the existing skills base and
supply chain. I take issue with comments by Conservative Members on
only one issue, in relation to the second runway at Birmingham
International airport. I certainly do not consider that Wolverhampton
Business airport would be at all appropriate. However, there is no need
for a second runway at Birmingham International airport. It can expand
with the lengthening of the main runway, and with other proposals that
are being made as part of the plan there is no necessity for the second
runway.</p><p><a name="06071880000221">I should be
grateful if the Minister would take on board the comments of hon.
Members on both sides of the House about the suitability of
Cosford.</p><p><a name="06071880000222"><b><a name="06071880000493">Chris
Bryant:</b> Is the hon. Lady actually saying that she has set
out the official Liberal Democrat position, and has cleared it with all
her Liberal Democrat colleagues in the south-west of
England&#151;and, indeed, Wales&#151;who would benefit if the
defence training review went to Wales? Is she seriously saying that
their view is that the review must go to
Cosford?</p><p><a name="06071880000223"><b><a name="06071880000494">Lorely
Burt:</b> The hon. Gentleman is implying that there must be
exclusivity and that the defence training review must go either to one
area or another. As I understand matters, a number of sites are being
considered.</p><p><a name="06071880000224"><b><a name="06071880000495">Chris
Bryant:</b>
Two.</p><p><a name="06071880000225"><b><a name="06071880000496">Lorely
Burt:</b> Since there are two sites available I am merely
putting the case for Cosford. As I said at the beginning of my remarks,
it is up to the Ministry of Defence to decide which is the best place.
However, Cosford is uniquely placed because of its educational and
communications infrastructure, its skills and its supply chain to
fulfil the requirements of the Ministry of
Defence.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000418">12.07

representing 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 39WH</b><br>constituencies in Shropshire and the west midlands,
who have spoken very eloquently about many local issues. They ably
represent their constituents on this subject.</p><p><a name="06071880000231">I want to touch on two
issues&#151;the merger of the Defence Logistics Organisation and the
Defence Procurement Agency. We accepted at the last election that there
was a need to introduce effective through-life management of major
capabilities. Indeed, in 2003 the National Audit Office found that one
of the barriers to through-life management was the relationship between
the DPA and the DLO. It certainly makes sense that there should be one
organisation to manage that capability from its inception to the
completion of its service life. We felt that that justified a merger
with the capability functions of the DLO and the DPA.</p><p><a name="06071880000232">We feel that
the full merger of the two organisations has the potential to create a
very large and cumbersome organisation, and there seems to us to be no
reason why the purely logistical functions of the DLO should be
included in a merger with the DPA. Consumables such as ammunition and
nuts and bolts do not need to be provided by the same organisation that
has responsibility for procuring aircraft, ships and tanks. The risk is
that the Government will create a huge, unwieldy empire that will not
perform either task particularly well. We support merging the
capability functions, but think that there should be a separate
logistics command specifically to take account of the logistics items,
as opposed to the large procurement areas.</p><p><a name="06071880000233">On the defence training review,
hon. Members will know that my constituency is beautifully positioned,
being adjacent to both Wales and the west midlands. I therefore find it
easy to take a balanced and neutral position between the two bids. Hon.
Members from the west midlands and Shropshire have put their cases very
ably, and no doubt others will make strong cases for their bids. I am
sure that the Minister will make a very wise decision on behalf of Her
Majesty&#146;s
Government.</p><p><a name="06071880000234"><b><a name="06071880000501">Chris
Bryant:</b> All the joshing apart, does the hon. Gentleman
agree that the most important issue that the MOD has to decide on this
is not whether there is a higher level of employment or unemployment in
one area or another, or the level of relative deprivation between
areas, but which bid will provide the best level of training for our
forces? If we were to do anything other than that, we would be failing
in our duty to our
troops.</p><p><a name="06071880000235"><b><a name="06071880000502">Mr.

decision about the defence training review&#151;indeed, all decisions
about MOD responsibilities&#151;should absolutely be made on the
ground of providing the best possible defence for our nation and,
therefore, the best possible training for our forces. That should be
the criteria on which the decision is
made.</p><p><a name="06071880000236"><b><a name="06071880000503">Mr.

Member for The Wrekin drew attention to the defence industrial
strategy&#146;s references to sovereignty and what is meant by the
term 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 40WH</b><br>British. As far as I am concerned, we mean the ownership of intellectual
property, companies being based in this country and, very importantly,
contracts and companies that will ensure the security of supply of
defence capability for this country. Taking those three things
together, we can focus on what the defence industrial strategy means by
sovereignty and a preference for British companies.</p><p><a name="06071880000239">I repeat that the absolute
priority of the MOD must be to ensure that we maintain the standards of
service and support that our forces deserve and need. However, it is
worth making one more point about the defence training review as a
caution: whatever decision the Minister takes, it should not undermine
the military ethos of that training. We are training soldiers and
servicemen, and that is not the same as training people for a role in
private business. We ask a great deal of those who serve in our armed
forces. Our training should recognise that, and the military ethos
should be properly preserved to recognise that we ask our armed forces
to do a very separate and distinctive job. We must ensure that we
maintain the military ethos and professionalism of the armed forces on
which we depend, as we have in the past and will in the
future.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000419">12.13

Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) should be congratulated on
securing the debate. He talked about taking an holistic approach. I
shall give an holistic response if I can. Before I begin to talk about
some of the key issues, I must say that never in the field of party
political conflict have so many press releases been owed to the
<i>Shropshire Star</i>. I say to the famous five from Shropshire,

he will be able to find alternative employment.</p><p><a name="06071880000243">On a serious
note, the hon. Gentleman raised several points. I shall talk about the
defence training review at the end of my speech, because I want to talk
about wider defence issues across the region, if hon. Members will
allow me to. This debate has been a thinly-disguised opportunity for
Members to lobby for the defence training review, but I do not object
to that, in the interests of fairness, because, as the hon. Gentleman
will know, I was invited to talk to the Select Committee on Welsh
Affairs about defence in Wales, and that was also a thinly-disguised
lobby on behalf of St. Athan. I expect hon. Members to argue for their
regions.</p><p><a name="06071880000244">I commend my

that later&#151;information systems, personnel and estates, and
training. They apply to all service and civilian personnel, not only in
the west midlands region, but throughout the UK and
worldwide.</p><p><a name="06071880000248">We are
managing the defence change programme as a single, coherent effort with
the goal of modernising and improving our defence business processes.
That will allow us to reallocate our scarce resources from back-office
functions towards the front line in order to improve our operational
capability. That is the best way to make sure that we can go on giving
the best support to our servicemen and women in the future, to which so
many have referred today. That means that we have to do things better
and cut out waste.</p><p><a name="06071880000249">The hon. Member for The Wrekin
made a point questioning privatisation. I hope that that comment will
not come back and haunt him as he progresses through his career in his

commitment for or against privatisation in the MOD, we pick a view
that&#151;</p><p><a name="06071880000250"><b><a name="06071880000508">Mark

am saying that it needs to be undertaken on a case-by-case basis and
should be done objectively rather than driven by some ideology. With

approach and his arguments for protecting jobs in the region. I am
certain that they can reach a consensus today about how we should
protect jobs in the region rather than open up to the market. That
allows me to answer the central point of my future leader&#146;s
argument about consultation. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am only joking.
He would not expect a former trade union official not to want greater
consultation.</p><p><a name="06071880000252">I
understand that my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Ministry of
Defence, who has responsibility for the armed forces, yesterday met a
delegation that was led by my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David

cost savings of &#163;400 million. The unions have not been provided
with a copy of the investment appraisal, or financial data setting out
how any of those savings are to be provided. That level of information
would give some assurance to members of staff working in the field that
they can have a guaranteed

Kawczynski:</b> On privatisation, the hon. Member for Telford

privatisation; ordinary workers and members of the public are concerned
that the British defence industry could end up in the hands of foreign
companies that have no good will towards this

Shropshire and from across the region, and I would be delighted to show
the hon. Gentleman the room where they are trying to lobby. He could
put to them his view that he stands for ordinary workers in Shropshire,

privatisation.</p><p><a name="06071880000257"><b><a name="06071880000514">Mark

Watson:</b> In that case, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman
will attend the Amicus meeting straight after this event to put those
points.</p><p><a name="06071880000265">I have a lot
to say about defence and jobs in our region, so let me move on. I know
that hon. Members want me to talk about the defence training review,
and I shall try to get through my comments as quickly as I can so that
we can talk about my position on the review at the
end.</p><p><a name="06071880000266">Our goals are
ambitious. We have committed ourselves to achieving &#163;2.8 billion
of efficiency savings by 2007-08. That money will be reinvested to
maximise front-line capability and will come partly from cutting
numbers elsewhere. We are committed to reducing the number of civilian
posts by at least 10,000 and the number of military posts in
administrative and support roles by at least 5,000.</p><p><a name="06071880000267">As I am sure that the hon.
Member for The Wrekin is aware, the Defence Medical Services branch of
the Ministry of Defence already enjoys a strong presence in the west
midlands. The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, which is based in and
around Birmingham, has recently benefited from a &#163;106 million
refit, which I am sure that all hon. Members welcome. That refit was
carried out in partnership with the regional development
agency.</p><p><a name="06071880000268">In that
respect, perhaps I can answer some of the cogent points raised by the
hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), who talked about the
&#147;Let&#146;s Fly&#148; campaign led by the RDA. That is the
west midlands RDA at its best, and I hope that we will be able to stand
up for it when we talk about the future of RDAs in other forums,
because it is the only body in our region that could mount such a
campaign. I know that the hon. Gentleman will want to stand up for RDAs
up and down the country, given that some hon. Members believe that
there is a question mark over their future.</p><p><a name="06071880000269">The chief
executive of the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency is now
leading a programme to improve accommodation and support facilities for
military medical personnel in Birmingham and is exploring a number of
options to consolidate the command, control and training elements of
the Defence Medical Services. That is intended to create an
international centre for clinical excellence and to provide a suitable
environment for DMETA military and civilian personnel, including those
who are currently serving in Birmingham without access to MOD
accommodation or facilities. That would result in significant numbers
of staff and jobs being relocated to the west midlands from around the
country, and I know that all hon. Members will support the Government
in trying to achieve that goal.</p><p><a name="06071880000270">In the few
minutes that remain, I should like to move straight on to the defence
training review. The in-house bid was not considered appropriate,
because it could not have provided comparable technical innovation,
performance discipline and risk transfer. The DTR programme is about
improving training and its environment, as well as managing the risk of
demand ebb and flow without compromising the quality of training. A PPP
arrangement will offer the best value-for-money solution, while still
meeting the MOD&#146;s critical requirements.</p><p><a name="06071880000271">Our initial studies identified
six streams of specialist training, which are currently being conducted
on about 30 separate sites around the country. Together, those 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 44WH</b><br>streams offered the greatest potential benefits from the rationalisation
and harmonisation, and hon. Members have referred to that.
Consequently, they have been grouped into two packages for what my
officials describe as maximum synergy, or what I would describe as a
common-sense solution. Package 1 comprises training for engineering and
communications, while package 2 will provide training for logistics,
security, policing and administration.</p><p><a name="06071880000272">Our overall procurement
strategy has required bidders to select sites as part of their training
proposals. They were given a free hand to decide which MOD or non-MOD
sites offered the best solution. That geographical freedom has been
essential for bidders to develop coherent value-for-money proposals
that take full account of the service training requirement, their
training design and delivery solutions, the necessary personnel and
skills, and the environment in which solutions would be
delivered.</p><p><a name="06071880000273">There are
two bidders for each contractual package. The evaluation process is
drawing to an end, and I can provide an assurance that an extensive and
robust evaluation methodology has been in place to ensure that
bidders&#146; proposals meet defence requirements and are evaluated
on an equitable basis. All factors are being considered. The process
has been led by a Ministry of Defence project team, although it has
involved several hundred other training and estates subject matter
experts. The relevant procurement rules have been carefully applied,
and the work has been overseen by our own private finance unit
specialists and independent academic experts to ensure there is a level
playing field.</p><p><a name="06071880000274">The
project team and those involved in the evaluation have been commended
by Professor Molyneaux, the independent auditor of our evaluation
process and a leading expert in learning technologies, for operating
with the utmost professionalism and objectivity throughout the process.
The evaluation process has properly weighted the training element of
bidders&#146; proposals, including the ability to deliver distance
learning in front-line command units, above other supporting and
enabling capabilities, such as the future estate. It has also strongly
emphasized the application of innovation in that
process.</p><p><a name="06071880000275">We therefore
have good reason to expect a solution that best delivers value for
money for defence specialist training. However, lower-priority factors,
such as location, regional economic and sociological impacts, transport
links and other related points will not be ignored. I am aware, for
example, of the proposal to establish a national manufacturing skills
academy in the west midlands. We welcome that initiative, which would
have a role in achieving the Department&#146;s desire for national
centres of excellence as part of preferred bidder negotiations,
whichever bidder is successful.</p><p><a name="06071880000276">As I have explained, I can make
only limited comments on any likely use of sites at this competitive
phase of the project, as I am sure that hon. Members understand. Those
who have spoken have raised several specific points that go beyond the
DTR, but I have not been able to cover them, because of time
limitations. However, I shall make myself available to anyone who needs
me to pick up any of those points afterwards or who needs to write to
me.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 45WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000277">However, I can
also assure the House that there is no question of the MOD
systematically withdrawing from the west midlands. Many options remain
available for the use of existing MOD establishments in the region. I
acknowledge that there might well be closures in the future, but we are
actively pursuing numerous possibilities. We certainly recognise that
change can be unsettling for individuals, so staff and the trade unions
are being kept closely informed of the latest developments.</p><p><a name="06071880000278">To conclude, I congratulate the
hon. Member for The Wrekin on allowing us to talk about the excellent
future that defence has in the midlands. I also congratulate all other
hon. Members who have made a
contribution.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 46WH</b><br>

pm</h5><p><a name="06071880000279"><b><a name="06071880000522">Ms
Karen Buck (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab):</b> I
am grateful to have the opportunity to introduce this topic. I ask your
forbearance for the first minute or so, Mr. Hood, because during it you
might wonder whether I have drifted into the wrong speech. If you bear
with me, you will see that my opening remarks are extremely relevant to
the substance of the discussion.</p><p><a name="06071880000280">Last week, a
famous institution closed its doors for the last time. North
Westminster community school achieved many great things over the years,
and many fine people worked and studied there, but ultimately, it was
overwhelmed by the scale of the challenges it had to face. It had three
times as many pupils entitled to free school dinners as the national
average, twice as many pupils with a lower level of English as an
additional language than even the Westminster council average, 64
languages spoken among its pupils and a fifth of its pupils were either
statemented or had a school action plan. We needed something
extraordinary, but in fact we had a huge, three-site school that was
simply too hard to manage as effectively as was needed to deliver a
quality education to those
children.</p><p><a name="06071880000281">Over the
next 15 months, North Westminster community school will be replaced by
three new academy schools. They will bring in &#163;70 million-worth
of new investment, which will help transform secondary school provision
in the borough. All of our three schools will be in wards that are
among the most deprived in the UK. One of the academies, opening next
year, is sited in Church street, which was found to be the most
deprived ward in London according to the 2001 census.</p><p><a name="06071880000282">Academies originally sponsored
by Chelsfield and the United Learning Trust are opening in the Harrow
road and Westbourne wards, both of which qualify for neighbourhood
renewal funding on the basis of their deprivation. The neighbourhood
served by the three academies has higher unemployment than Jarrow, from
where the hunger marches originated, and a higher proportion of
children in households dependent on benefit than most of Liverpool and
Newcastle, areas traditionally associated with the highest deprivation
in the country. Statistics produced by the primary care trust in its
recent annual public health report showed that the ultimate indicator
of inequality&#151;life expectancy&#151;varied by a staggering 16
years between the most affluent wards in Westminster and the Church
street ward. Almost all our low-income families live in flats, and
outside or open space is at a premium.</p><p><a name="06071880000283">The level of
need is starkly obvious not just for the schools themselves, but for
what the buildings and facilities could contribute to improving the
quality of life in the communities they serve. Yet, perversely, the
buildings serving the neediest populations are saddled with a burden
which will restrict the very thing we need the most.</p><p><a name="06071880000284">The core of the problem is that
academies, unlike local education authority schools, incur a liability
for VAT on aspects of their construction and use. Academies are
organised as charities, of course, which means that they can recover
VAT, quite reasonably, on the construction of new schools. However,
there are 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 47WH</b><br>three problems. First, VAT can be recovered only on
the construction work itself. Architectural, surveying and other
professional fees all attract VAT, which can amount to up to 10 per
cent. of the cost of a building.
</p><p><a name="06071880000285">Secondly,
zero-rating applies only to the construction of a new building. Full
VAT is payable where an existing school is refurbished or an extension
is built on to it. Given that land in areas such as
mine&#151;Westminster&#151;is at such a premium, and that other
restrictions frequently apply to its use, such as listed building
status, that seems to impose a unnecessary penalty to making the best
and most imaginative use of such space and facilities as we
have.</p><p><a name="06071880000286">Thirdly,
and most relevant of all in the context of my remarks about
deprivation, is the restriction that applies to the community use of
the building. A relevant charitable purpose is defined, for this
purpose as</p><a name="06071880000287"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;use by a
charity in either...otherwise than in the course or furtherance of
a
business&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071880000288">or</p><a name="06071880000289"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as
a village hall or similarly in providing social or recreational
facilities for a
local&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071880000290">authority.</p><p><a name="06071880000291">Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs regards the letting of facilities
to community groups or others as constituting a business purpose, and
as such, the amount of VAT that can be recovered is determined by the
scale of lettings in the first 10 years. I also understand that the
method of calculating the level of the VAT refund tends to result in a
disproportionate part of the construction costs being attributed to any
such business
use.</p><p><a name="06071880000292">Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs seems to take the view that
anything generating income is, by definition a, business activity. That
includes even the letting of a sports hall for a community football
scheme such as that operated by our Bangladeshi-led London Tigers team;
a parents&#146; class supported by Sure Start; healthy-living
activities operated by the primary care trust; or a forum organised
under the auspices of our neighbourhood management
programme.</p><p><a name="06071880000293">In
other words, the better the academies serve the community, by opening
their doors and promoting the use of the buildings for
extended school activities, the greater the penalty. On the one hand,
we say that we want, and, in the case of academies, we specifically
require through the nature of the funding agreements, school buildings
to be open in the evenings, and on weekends and school holidays for
adult learning, sports clubs, supplementary schools and so forth. On
the other hand, we treat such lettings as a pure business activity,
thereby, of course, making them more expensive than they need to be,
and therefore either reducing demand, or shifting towards a different
demographic from that which we want to appeal to most.</p><p><a name="06071880000294">There is, of course, a 10 per
cent. concession&#151;on time, space or footfall&#151;built into
the calculations. However, it is not only inadequate to meet the needs
and demands of full community use, but it imposes its own
administrative burden. The school&#146;s management has constantly to
monitor lettings to ensure that they do not exceed the permitted level.
The United Learning Trust, for example, faces a frustrating and
unnecessary constraint in letting facilities such as its art and music
studios at the Lambeth academy, the state of the art rubber crumb pitch
at the Northampton academy, which has a sports
specialism and is much in demand 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 48WH</b><br>within the local community, and the sports facilities at its two
Sheffield academies, which are used for about a quarter of the time
that the school is not in session. The ULT states that it is committed
to allowing community use to the maximum extent possible under HMRC
regulations, but it is simply not enough to meet the demands on its
services.</p><p><a name="06071880000295"><b><a name="06071880000523">Simon
Hughes (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> The hon.
Lady and Ministers will know that in my constituency we have had the
same long-running argument, meetings with Ministers and questions
answered. We were led to believe that there would be a satisfactory
resolution, particularly in relation to our city academy which has
recently opened. Part of its premises took over a community park. That
was agreed to only on the basis that it would be then open to the
community not just for 10 per cent. of the time or less&#151;or for
10 per cent. of the cost or less&#151;but in the school holidays, in
evenings and on weekends. There is great frustration that the promise
of Government has not been fulfilled.</p><p><a name="06071880000296"><b><a name="06071880000524">Ms

It, too, will be taking over a series of sports facilities, which,
although currently unsatisfactory, are free and open to the community.
There are huge advantages in terms of safety and quality of service in
having the academy take over some of that space, but implicit in the
agreement was that its use would be open to the community. Yet, if a
resolution is not found, we shall find ourselves coming up against
exactly that same
barrier.</p><p><a name="06071880000297">At the risk
of treading on political corns, I suggest that we need to do all we can
to ensure that academies win hearts and minds, in the face of an
indisputable fear in some quarters&#151;one that I believe is
wrong&#151;that they will not turn outwards to the community. What
seem to be arbitrary restrictions on the level of community lettings,
or higher than necessary charges for such use, will do little to
deliver those hearts and minds, and above all, will not help the still
much needed transformation of our much challenged
neighbourhoods.</p><p><a name="06071880000298">As I
have said, an LEA school does not have to bear a comparable cost,
because it is able to recover VAT under a specific legislative
provision: section 33 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994. What I am
requesting, therefore, is that academies should either be brought into
line with LEA schools for this purpose, or that a less restrictive
application of the village hall exception be applied, to reduce the
liability. Granting section 33 status would, I believe, resolve the
problem more or less in its entirety. Applying the exclusion for
business activities in a less restrictive manner, or accepting that,
when letting our facilities, an academy functions as a building similar
to a village hall in providing social or recreational facilities, offer
two alternative, albeit slightly less satisfactory,
options.</p><p><a name="06071880000299">I
have talked about academies because they are the starkest example, but
many of the same points apply to colleges of further education, such as
my much appreciated City of Westminster college, which occupies a prime
site 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 49WH</b><br>in central London just off the Marylebone road and serves a very
deprived student profile indeed. When that facility decides to decant
and rebuild we will face exactly the same problem, even though ideally
we would like the rebuilt City of Westminster college to do everything
it can to ensure that its open and outdoor space serves the communities
around it. I understand from the Association of Colleges that colleges
as a whole paid more than &#163;200 million in irrecoverable VAT last
year.</p><p><a name="06071880000300">I
fully accept that EU rules limit the Government&#146;s flexibility. I
also accept that, by definition, if VAT could not be recovered from
academies and colleges in that way money would be lost to the Exchequer
and other provision would be required. However, my worry is that, as in
so many other examples&#151;we have neighbourhood renewal funding, a
neighbourhood management programme, Sure Start and a positive futures
programme for young people&#151;we are putting public money into
community services such as our primary care trusts and our healthy
living provision only to have a certain proportion returned in fees and
charges for such facilities and if VAT is charged it goes back to the
Treasury. There seems to be a bureaucratic spiral of money chasing
itself, which we should be able to cut
out.</p><p><a name="06071880000301">I do not see any
need to keep the subject under further review. My academies will open
this year and we need those facilities to be in full community use
straight away. We must act as quickly as possible or give a clear
indication that action will be forthcoming. I look forward to hearing
the Minister&#146;s response and I hope that, depending on what she
can say today, we might be able to meet, perhaps in September, to
discuss how this can be taken
forward.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000421">12.42
pm</h5><p><a name="06071880000302"><b><a name="06071880000525">The
Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b> I congratulate my hon.
Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) on
raising this issue. I want to respond to her two central points and to
her final point to suggest a way in which we can move the matter
forward.</p><p><a name="06071880000303">My hon.
Friend&#146;s two basic concerns about academies are, first, VAT on
conversion and extension of existing schools that become
academies&#151;the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
(Simon Hughes) also touched on that in terms of responsibilities that
may be combined&#151;and, secondly, the interaction between VAT
relief for the construction of charitable buildings and the wider
community use of academy facilities. My hon. Friend made a strong case
and I agree that one of the purposes of academies is the wider use of
their facilities by the
community.</p><p><a name="06071880000304">On
the first point, I want to make clear what happens with VAT. VAT is
chargeable on the conversion and extension of existing school buildings
but, consistent with the general funding of public services and bodies,
those VAT costs are taken into account by the Department for Education
and Skills and the Treasury when funding is allocated for academies,
including their educational activities. That VAT cost is not,
therefore, an unfunded liability to the
academies.</p><p><a name="06071880000305">The general
principle is that we do not have a tax on a tax. Academies are directly
funded by the DFES, which receives its allocation from the Treasury,
plus its 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 50WH</b><br>VAT liability to balance the books. There is no circulation or movement
of money because it is front-loaded. It is different from local
authorities and the use of section 33 of the VAT Act 1994 simply
because local authorities raise local taxation, so there is a slightly
different interaction. Section 33 provides for the equivalent of what
is given to the DFES to neutralise the VAT. My hon. Friend touched on
further education colleges and it has always been understood that their
funding arrangements and settlements take account of VAT
costs.</p><p><a name="06071880000306">An entirely new
set of questions is now being asked. Having been given the VAT costs
and perhaps spent it on other things, the academies now want to return
to the pot for the VAT cost that they have already been funded for.
There is some confusion and complexity there and my hon. Friend raised
the important point of sorting the matter out clearly so that
responsibilities are understood and academy facilities are properly
used in the community. That deals with the central funding point. The
VAT is provided when they receive the money. It is not
unfunded.</p><p><a name="06071880000307">The second
point, which has been raised by a number of hon. Members in the House,
concerns the operation of VAT rules and the 10 per cent. I should make
it clear at the outset that the VAT rules do not prevent any academy
from making facilities available for extended community use and making
a small charge if they decide to do so. VAT should have no real
impact&#151;this is part of the problem and the quizzical
&#147;Why?&#148;&#151;on the extent to which a converted or
refurbished school building is part of wider community use. However, I
recognise that the VAT rules can impact on the extent to which some
academies can offer their facilities on a chargeable basis. If they do
not charge a fee, there is no VAT impact. The problem arises when they
want to charge and that is the point that my hon. Friend made about the
10 per cent. That is the core issue that I want to address in my
closing
remarks.</p><p><a name="06071880000308"><b><a name="06071880000526">Ms
Buck:</b> My right hon. Friend may not be able to answer this
question now, but one of the key reasons for charging is to cover the
cost of caretaking, security and insurance, for example, and I wonder
whether that is liable to VAT or whether it is purely a profit element
over and above the running costs.</p><p><a name="06071880000309"><b><a name="06071880000527">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Rather than going into the vagaries of the VAT
system&#151;that is not pertinent&#151;I can give an example. The
problem seems to be the scale of academies&#146; use, and whether it
tips past the 10 per cent. and is therefore considered business use if
they make a charge. The method that Her Majesty&#146;s Customs and
Revenue uses to calculate the extent of relevant charitable use of a
building is to take a year as a whole and an academy with 1,000
students could charge for extended services for an average of 50 people
a day without any impact on the VAT relief for construction and still
remain within the zero rate regardless. The issue is the scale of that
use and whether it becomes a business use. The problem&#151;I am sure
that my hon. Friend will know this because she has served on Standing
Committees of Finance Bills&#151;is to protect the whole VAT system.
It is a European tax so we are prevented from extending the zero rate
and we cannot behave unequally if something happens to be in the 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 51WH</b><br>public sector because the position of other designated charities and so
on would need to be addressed. I concede that that would not deal fully
with the issue of unrestricted use that my hon. Friend raised, but it
would represent substantial progress for
academies.</p><p><a name="06071880000310">The
position with regard to VAT is that under our European agreements we
cannot extend zero rates, because the academies are funded through the
public sector. Instead, we put extra money in, and say,
&#147;Here&#146;s your funding plus the 17.5 per cent. VAT.&#148;
That way, one does not have a VAT liability, because the VAT is
included in the funding in the first place. That is how academies are
funded. Although there have been discussions with representatives from
the academies on the subject, we need to attempt to do that
again.</p><p><a name="06071880000311">My hon. Friend
the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, will appreciate
that our European agreements govern how VAT reliefs work, and we cannot
step outside of them. Access to section 33 has been for public bodies
that raise local taxes, which academies do not; that is why they are
not provided for under section 33. We fund them up front, so they have
already got their VAT. We could not possibly attempt to extend zero
rates beyond its current operation; the European Community would not
allow it. However, I recognise that concerns are still being raised on
the issue, including by my hon. Friend
today.</p><p><a name="06071880000312"><b><a name="06071880000528">Simon
Hughes:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</p><p><a name="06071880000313"><b><a name="06071880000529">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I shall just make this point first. The hon.
Gentleman has to address the issue; as a good European, he will
appreciate what I am saying. If the academies are funded, and not only
their construction costs but VAT costs are paid, why would we again
fund the costs that we had already met? It would not be possible to
make academies unique without causing problems elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06071880000314">I have spoken to my officials,
and I would like them to have discussions with academies again, because
the issue still has not been sorted out, even though I understand that
they got their financial advice from their accountants. I want to be
absolutely satisfied that the existing VAT rules and the operation of
the allowance within the zero rate are being used to the fullest
extent. If not, we must make sure that they are, and we must discuss
what assistance the Departments can give to ensure that. That has to be
the first step, so although I am happy to meet my hon. Friend the
Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, again in September or
October, the first thing is to once more get representatives from the
academies round the table with the officials, to find out exactly what
the issues are and to find a way through under the current rules. If
any matter is outstanding after that, my hon. Friend and I might need
to have a discussion. That offers a positive way forward, because I
absolutely accept the points made by my hon. Friend and the hon. Member
for North Southwark and Bermondsey about the urgency with which we must
sort out the
issue.</p><p><a name="06071880000315"><b><a name="06071880000530">Simon
Hughes:</b> I am sure that, like me, the hon. Member for
Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) has been
encouraged by Paymaster General&#146;s response. First, about a year
ago I went to see one of the Paymaster General&#146;s colleagues in
the 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 52WH</b><br>Department for Education and Skills. I was told that we were within
sight of a combined Treasury-DFES decision&#151;one that came within
the European rules, which we all have to accept. What happened to that
prospect of an immediate solution? It seems to have disappeared.
Secondly, does she accept that the practical problem is that new-build
city academies cannot plan maximum use of their space unless they have
enough private funding coming in to cross-subsidise the community
activity that will keep them open effectively round the
clock&#151;well, not 24 hours a day, but 18 hours a day, which is
what was
intended?</p><p><a name="06071880000316"><b><a name="06071880000531">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first point, I
have been the Minister with responsibility for the subject for some
considerable time, and I am not aware that we had any imminent
solution, but I shall certainly go back over the records. Perhaps he
might like to disclose to me privately which DFES
official&#151;</p><p><a name="06071880000317"><b><a name="06071880000532">Simon
Hughes:</b>
Minister.</p><p><a name="06071880000319"><b><a name="06071880000533">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Sorry, which Minister told him that.</p><p><a name="06071880000320">On the second issue, and on the
point that I am trying to make, I am a little perplexed, in that
academies&#146; VAT is fully funded&#151;it goes into the core
grant&#151;so why is the issue being raised? They have had the VAT
money. However, sometimes we are talking about the interaction between
charitable and business purposes, and that is always a difficult
boundary. Where the academy offers its facilities for free, VAT is not
an issue. It becomes an issue when academies wish to charge on a
business basis for the use of the facilities. Then, the category
becomes rather a difficult matter, as always in VAT law. That is what I
want my officials to explore with the academies.</p><p><a name="06071880000321">We will write to the
academies&#146; representative body after the debate, and I will send
my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, a
copy of the letter. We will ask them, as a result of this debate, to
come in again for discussions on the specific issue&#151;not to
discuss section 33, but to discuss the operation of VAT. When I have
the report of that meeting, we can focus, and I shall be happy to meet
with my hon. Friend to consider the issues. Clearly, there will need to
be discussions between the Treasury and the DFES on why they are
experiencing the difficulty, and how the money from DFES to the
academies is being processed.</p><p><a name="06071880000322">I should make
it clear that academies are entirely and wholly funded by the DFES, and
therefore their VAT costs should be met. The problem occurs when the
use of academies&#146; facilities flips over into business use; then,
rules apply that the rest of the economy has to work with, too, and we
need to be careful about the boundaries. That is the point that I want
to explore, so that there is no longer the detrimental effect that my
hon. Friend, and the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey,
clearly identified today. That detrimental effect could undermine
future community use, and that would not be acceptable. If my hon.
Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, is happy to
leave the discussions until September, I will move them forward as
quickly as I can.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 53WH</b><br><p><a name="06071880000323"><b><a name="06071880000534">Simon
Hughes:</b> I am happy to give the Paymaster General
any other information. Will she add to her considerations the issue of
those charitable bodies that are semi-educational, including youth
clubs such as the Salmon youth centre? They have the same sorts of
Treasury and VAT issues. I am happy to write to her to make sure that
she is fully briefed about them,
too.</p><p><a name="06071880000324"><b><a name="06071880000535">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> No, I shall not add that to my considerations.
The Treasury has undertaken two reviews into that difficult subject
since 1997, one of which I conducted. Charities were given lots of
concessions on the direct tax side&#151;gift aid to name but
one&#151;because of the difficulties surrounding VAT business use and
charitable use. Opening up our discussion into a wider debate about all
charities will prevent us from finding a solution to the problem before
us. The hon. Gentleman can certainly write to me, but I will not lump
that subject with the subject of academies. I will address the question
of academies with my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and
Kensington, North, after my officials have had the meeting. I apologise
to the hon. Gentleman, but I will not move on that
point.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 54WH</b><br>

pm</h5><p><a name="06071880000325"><b><a name="06071880000536">Mr.
John Randall (Uxbridge) (Con):</b> I am grateful to Mr.
Speaker for allowing me to raise this important subject. I believe that
today, in Vienna, the seventh round of talks on the future status of
Kosovo is taking place. I do not intend to undertake an historical
resum&#233;, but my speech makes it clear that although we must move
forward, we are wise when dealing with Kosovo or anywhere else to take
lessons from the past and to remember that some issues run deep in the
psyche of the nations involved and have done so for a long
time.</p><p><a name="06071880000326">I have taken
up the subject of the Balkans because of my studies at university, but
despite that, over the years in this place, I and others who have
raised the matter have been regarded as apologists for certain
regimes&#151;in particular, the Milosevic regime. Before I entered
this place, I was a member of a voluntary group in my constituency
trying to ensure press freedom in what was then Yugoslavia, and I
actively opposed many policies during that period.</p><p><a name="06071880000327">The subject is far too
important for us to engage in polemic. Whenever Serbia is mentioned,
the stumbling block is compliance with the requirements of the
International Criminal Court in The Hague. General Mladic would be top
of the list&#151;Radovan Karadzic is regarded as being not
necessarily within the confines of Serbia. Every time I meet visiting
politicians from the region, I say that I wish the situation could be
resolved. Many&#151;not all but most&#151;of the visiting
politicians and Serbs share that view. The Minister, because of his
previous incarnation as Secretary of State for Defence, probably knows
better than a mere Back Bencher such as myself whether there is
anything that our country or NATO can do to help. It is a stumbling
block, but we must get round it because it is so important,
particularly in relation to the status of Kosovo.</p><p><a name="06071880000328">We can always argue about
whether mistakes were made, but what happened in 1999 happened and
there is a de facto independent state within what is now Serbia and was
previously Yugoslavia. Kosovo is a virtual protectorate, but whether it
is run by the United Nations, NATO or the European Union, it cannot
continue like that. The situation must be resolved. I am pleased that
efforts to resolve its status have moved on in earnest in the past
year. The Minister recently answered some questions from my hon. Friend
the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), and I was
encouraged by much of what I read. I do not envy the Minister or
anybody involved in that area, because there are no easy answers. The
negotiating skills of all those involved will be tested.</p><p><a name="06071880000329">The general aim seems to be to
sort out the situation by the end of the year. Although that may be
necessary and worth while, we must be careful not to rush into a quick
and&#151;apparently&#151;easy answer. As we know from elsewhere in
the world, if we get the answer wrong, it will come back to bite us and
the region.</p><p><a name="06071880000330">Serbia is
an important country; it is fundamental to the whole Balkan region. It
is important that we bring the Serbian nation back into mainstream
European politics. I was delighted that last week the British
Government invited Bosnian and Serbian delegates to come over together
as part of a plan for European 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 55WH</b><br>integration. We would all be pleased to go down that road, although it
is a little way off. Some aspects of European integration are not as
easy as they might seem on paper; although we might wish for them, they
cannot be realised that easily.</p><p><a name="06071880000331">The problem that worries me
about the future status of Kosovo is the message that we might send
out. If Kosovo were to become an independent country, there would be a
question about its viability. Before all the problems, few people had
heard of Kosovo. I have travelled around it, and although I do not know
its equivalent size, it is not much bigger than a large English county.
It is landlocked and poor, and I doubt that it could be a viable state.
Recently, Montenegro became independent, and in the greater scheme of
things, if there were a wider Balkan organisation, there might be some
means of Kosovo becoming independent, too. Currently, however, an
independent Kosovo would have to align itself with one or two other
countries. An obvious country would be Albania&#151;I doubt that
Kosovan Albanians would be particularly delighted to work closely with
Belgrade, however much we might wish it.</p><p><a name="06071880000332">The British
Government&#146;s position was, and officially still is, that Kosovo
is a part of the country that was Yugoslavia, became Serbia and
Montenegro, and is now Serbia. To change its status as proposed might
set a difficult precedent for other regions of the world, and I would
be interested to know how the Minister feels about the message it would
send to other small regions where movements are trying to gain
independence from the larger part of their country. Even in Serbia
there are potential problems. I do not know what consideration has been
given to the future status of Vojvodina, to the north, and whether
granting independent status to Kosovo-Metohija might mean that more
people in Vojvodina want to go down the same path. Historical
differences exist, but thankfully, there has been no conflict, recent
or otherwise, in that area.</p><p><a name="06071880000333">Another
problem is how we in the west, the contact group, or whomever, are to
instil confidence in the minority peoples. In Kosovo, there are not
only Serbs, but a variety of minority peoples, and no ethnic group
lives within fixed borders. That is true throughout the Balkans. There
is a mixture. You are probably aware, Mr. Hood, that the French for
fruit salad is &#147;mac&#233;doine&#148;, meaning Macedonia,
because it is a mixture of different things. That is what makes the
problems so difficult to resolve.</p><p><a name="06071880000334">As most now
realise, Kosovo runs deep in the heart of Serbian statehood and
nationhood for historical reasons. Monuments going back to the middle
ages testify to that integral part of its cultural and spiritual life.
Unfortunately, a large number of them have been destroyed in recent
years. Some have been protected by troops, but there are so many that
it is probably impossible to protect any but the most important. There
is real worry. The monuments are not just buildings&#151;they mean a
lot to the Serbs and, by the same token, for the Kosovan-Albanian
population they stand for something else. I hope that we can get the
message across that the monuments are part of their culture
too.</p><p><a name="06071880000335">However, that
will be difficult. In Britain, we have got used over many centuries to
waves of immigration, and by and large we have a pretty sound view on
such things. As I have said in other debates, years ago I 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 56WH</b><br>remember being almost physically
attacked&#151;certainly verbally attacked&#151;just for speaking
Serbian. I then realised that it was no good my showing off that I
could speak the language; it was better for me to revert to English,
which was safer all round. That reflects the nature of what has
happened in the region over the
centuries.</p><p><a name="06071880000336">We need to
give confidence, and the form of words will be crucial. Although, as I
said, there may well ultimately be a European solution, I think that
that, unfortunately, is decades away. What we do in the meantime is
important. As the Minister knows&#151;sadly, we all know
it&#151;such problems keep flaring up. We have only to look at the
middle east today to see how, every so often, perceived or perhaps
real, rights, wrongs and injustices are allowed to flare up in the
hands of extremists, who want neither peace nor stability but have
their own agenda. I worry that if we do not get the resolution right,
it may seem that we have sorted it for the time being, but a generation
or two down the line, that poor, unfortunate area of the Balkans will
become the centre of strife in our own continent.</p><p><a name="06071880000337">The most important thing is not
flags and symbols, but getting people together to give them confidence.
I end by telling the Minister that if in our own small way there is
anything that I or the other members of the all-party group on Serbia
and Montenegro can do to help work something out, we will be happy to
do what we
can.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000423">1.14
pm</h5><p><a name="06071880000338"><b><a name="06071880000537">The
Minister for Europe (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</b> I
congratulate the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) on
securing this debate at an important stage of the Kosovo status
process. I shall respond directly to his offer of help; given his
knowledge and experience of that part of the world, in which he takes a
keen personal interest, I shall ascertain whether there are any
opportunities to enlist him in our efforts. It is in the UK&#146;s
strategic interest to work to ensure that the key part of Europe that
we are discussing continues to leave the tragic events of the 1990s
behind and moves ahead to a stable, prosperous, democratic European
future.</p><p><a name="06071880000339">I shall set
the context for this debate by providing a brief update on the UN-led
status process. Last week, UN special envoy for Kosovo and former
Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, whom I saw very recently, briefed
the UN Security Council on progress so far on technical-level talks on
status-neutral issues such as decentralisation and the protection of
religious sites. Those talks are continuing; indeed, negotiations on
the protection of religious and cultural heritage sites are taking
place in Vienna today.</p><p><a name="06071880000340">Martti
Ahtisaari also signalled his intention to move in parallel to the
important next phase: direct, high-level talks on status. That stage
will continue over the summer, and he plans to brief a ministerial
meeting of the contact group in the margins of the UN General Assembly
in New York in September. We expect him to work with the parties and
the contact group to draw up and agree proposals for a settlement, and
to present his recommendations to the Security Council in the
autumn.</p><p><a name="06071880000341">President
Ahtisaari was appointed by the UN Secretary-General, and his
appointment was endorsed by the Security Council. The Government
support him 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 57WH</b><br>and his team fully, and stand ready to assist in our national capacity,
as well as through the contact group, the Security Council, the
European Union and NATO.
</p><p><a name="06071880000342">The hon. Gentleman
asked about the Government&#146;s thinking on the status
process&#146;s possible outcomes. It is for Martti Ahtisaari to make
his recommendations, and as I said, he will have our full support. Our
hope is that the issues can be resolved through a negotiated agreement.
However, if in the UN special envoy&#146;s view, an agreed settlement
is not possible, the international community must be prepared to draw
the necessary conclusions and face up to its
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06071880000343">The
contact group has set out conditions for the negotiating process and
the outcome in a set of guiding principles, endorsed by the Security
Council, and in a ministerial statement following a meeting in London
in January. The texts make clear that Kosovo cannot return to the
situation of before 1999; that it cannot be partitioned; that it cannot
join in union with any, or part of any, other country; and that the
settlement must be acceptable to the people of Kosovo.</p><p><a name="06071880000344">The
conditions also stipulate that every effort should be made to conclude
the process by the end of 2006, and that, having started, it cannot be
blocked. There seems little to be gained by extending the process
because one or both parties refuse to engage constructively, but there
is a considerable risk of instability and unrest if the negotiations
become bogged down or appear to be open-ended. In the interests of
Kosovo, of neighbouring countries and of the region as a whole, it is
important that the status process conclude as soon as possible, and in
a way that achieves a sustainable, democratic, multi-ethnic
Kosovo.</p><p><a name="06071880000345">It is not for
me to prejudge where the current negotiations might end up or what will
be the recommendations of the UN special envoy. However, it is fair to
say that there is growing international recognition that one option is
likely to involve some form of independence&#151;qualified 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 58WH</b><br>by a robust international civilian and military presence, and with
cast-iron guarantees protecting the rights and security of the
Kosovo-Serbs and other minorities. Such an outcome would be consistent
with the guiding principles and ministerial statement agreed by the
contact group.</p><p><a name="06071880000346">It is
perfectly understandable why the Kosovo-Serbs feel insecure in this
period of uncertainty and transition. Belgrade should seek to ease that
insecurity and encourage the Kosovo-Serbs to take practical advantage
of the new arrangements designed to improve their lives as an integral
part of Kosovo society.</p><p><a name="06071880000347">No one in the
international community wants to damage the interests of Serbia.
Indeed, for the first time in its long and difficult history, Serbia is
being offered the prosperity and security that would come from
membership, ultimately, of the European Union and NATO. Serbia should
look to the future, to accept that regional stability requires a
settlement acceptable to the people of Kosovo and that events since
1989 have created political realities and shaped public attitudes in
Kosovo.</p><p><a name="06071880000348">For its own
sake, and that of the Serbian community in Kosovo, Belgrade needs to
think through its current approach. Although not strictly relevant to
the Kosovo debate, that also applies to Belgrade&#146;s attitude to
co-operating with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The
Hague.</p><p><a name="06071880000349">Nobody
pretends that there is a perfect solution. Dispassionate analysis of
the options is needed to identify and define the one that stands the
best chance of delivering the outcome that we want for Kosovo and
Serbia: stability, democracy, prosperity, multi-ethnicity, and with
sights firmly set on a future in the European family. That is why we
remain fully supportive of the UN process, led by UN special envoy
Martti Ahtisaari.

Ham)</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000425">1.25
pm</h5><p><a name="06071880000351"><b><a name="06071880000538">Lyn
Brown (West Ham) (Lab):</b> I want to deal with three things
that affect poverty and income in my constituency: the minimum wage,
the campaign for a living wage for Londoners and the poverty trap,
which contributes to continuing high levels of worklessness, limits the
aspirations and economic advancement of those on low wages in London
and holds back reductions in child poverty and health inequalities.
Finally, I want to suggest for consideration things that could be done
to improve the lot of those living in my constituency on low
incomes.</p><p><a name="06071880000352">Despite the
popular image of London as a roaring economic success&#151;the London
of city bonuses and champagne charlies that holds a place in the
national imagination&#151;there is also a London of real economic
deprivation and hardship in which many struggle to survive. Those
people are the workless and the hundreds of thousands of workers who
service London&#146;s economic success: the cleaners, caterers and
porters, to name a few. Their stories are shaming, and the facts are
stark.</p><p><a name="06071880000353">If we exclude
pensioner households in 2003-04, one half of the people in
income-deprived households had someone in employment in their homes; in
other words, one half of the problem of poverty among non-pensioners is
now about poverty in work. The UK is the fourth biggest economy in the
world, and London is at the core of its wealth, yet 41 per cent. of the
children in London are growing up in poverty. London is way ahead of
the region with the second most deprivation. In the west Midlands, 32
per cent. of the children are affected by
poverty.</p><p><a name="06071880000354">Poverty costs
us as a country and as a society, yet it was almost impossible to get
official recognition of the existence of poverty among British
citizens, particularly working British citizens, before this Government
came to power. We have moved on since then with the introduction of the
minimum wage and a system of tax credits, but we need to go
further.</p><p><a name="06071880000355">I pay tribute
to the living wage unit, which has led some ground-breaking work at the
Greater London authority. It has been aided by technical support from
the family budget unit, which is a charity that undertakes comparative
living standards and living costs analyses. It defines a low-cost but
acceptable standard of living as one that achieves an adequate level of
warmth and shelter, a healthy, palatable diet, social integration and
avoidance of chronic stress for earners and their dependents. It uses a
shopping basket technique to arrive at an across-the-board average for
meeting the standard. The figure for Londoners after benefits and tax
credits are taken into account is about &#163;6.15 an
hour.</p><p><a name="06071880000356">The figure is an
average. As many people fall below it, the unit increases it by 15 per
cent. to &#163;7.05 to come up with the difference between a poverty
threshold wage and a living wage. To give a reality check, the families
in such households do not smoke or drink, and do not have a
car.</p><p><a name="06071880000357">The family budget
unit&#146;s original estimates were based on living costs in York.
For London, costs have been calculated to be 31 per cent. higher than
those in 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 60WH</b><br>York for a couple&#151;one working full-time and one working
part-time&#151;with two children, 35 per cent. higher for a working
single parent, and 28 per cent. higher for a single person. Those are
staggering figures.</p><p><a name="06071880000358">It
is in private rents that there is such a huge gulf between costs faced
by Londoners, who cannot afford to buy and cannot get into social
housing, and the rest of the country. Private rented, two-bedroom flats
subject to housing benefits claims in 2004-05 averaged &#163;165 a
week in London, &#163;77 in the north-west and &#163;92 in the
south-west and that is what we need to focus on.
</p><p><a name="06071880000359">My constituents raise
the issue with me constantly. Unless they live in the public sector and
have a relatively low rent they find it so difficult to work. We must
acknowledge the difficulty in establishing national minimum levels of
disposable income while these inequalities in housing costs exist;
&#163;7.05 is a living wage for a low-cost but acceptable standard of
living, assuming that all benefits and credits are received, so how
does the national minimum wage compare? The answer is not very well; it
has been catching up fast, but progress now appears to be at risk.
Between September 2005 and October 2006, the minimum wage will have
risen from &#163;4.85 to &#163;5.25, an increase of 8 per cent.
However, in the Low Pay Commission's report this year, Adair Turner
writes that</p><a name="06071880000360"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;looking
forward, the Commission will start with no presumption that further
increases above average earnings are
required&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071880000361">That is not
good news for Londoners.</p><p><a name="06071880000362">Supported by the Mayor,
London's living wage campaign has begun to deliver real successes and I
pay tribute to the Mayor and to The East London Community
Organisation&#151;Telco&#151;for their very effective strategies,
which have been really successful. Telco and the Transport and General
Workers Union campaigned to raise the hourly rate of cleaners working
in banks who were earning as little as &#163;4.20 an hour.</p><p><a name="06071880000363">In 2004, Barclays bank
increased the pay to contract cleaners to &#163;6 an hour in its new
headquarters in Canary Wharf, with 15 days' entitlement to sick pay and
eight extra days holiday; two months later, HSBC topped that. Following
threatened demonstrations, the Deutsche bank in the City agreed to pay
its cleaners a significant increase to a living wage level. Deutsche
bank made a profit of &#163;674 million in the last quarter. The
increase in pay to its cleaners will cost it an estimated
&#163;350,000 a year, which clearly will not cause the bank any pain
or any detectable dent in its profits.</p><p><a name="06071880000364">It is time to change the
culture; employers need to know that we as taxpayers are not prepared
to subsidise bad employment practice, because that is effectively what
we are doing. Despite the successes I have mentioned, and others, there
is a long way to Go; in London, one in seven employees receives less
than the poverty wages of &#163;6.15 an hour, and one in five less
than the living wage of &#163;7.05 an hour. London is Britain's
low-wage capital as well as its snouts-in-the-trough capital.</p><p><a name="06071880000366">The reason for this debate is
to put some important questions on the table: is it possible to have
differential minimum wage policies for different regions, thus
recognising the massive differences in the cost of living within the
United Kingdom? Would the London 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 61WH</b><br>economy sustain differential wages? What would be the impact on the
regional and national economies?</p><p><a name="06071880000367"><b><a name="06071880000539">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry (Portsmouth, North) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Given that
there is already a London weighting allowance, does my hon. Friend
agree that that analogy should apply to the minimum
wage?</p><p><a name="06071880000368"><b><a name="06071880000540">Lyn
Brown:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that example, which is a
logical extension of the issues that are clearly seen in the pay of
civil servants and, indeed, Members of Parliament. There is a London
weighting for those in inner-London constituencies which there is not
in the minimum wage.</p><p><a name="06071880000369">In my introduction I said that
I wanted to reflect on the poverty trap, which will not be solved even
by the living wage. Wage increases mean that some lose their tax
credits, some their housing benefits, and some pay more tax and
national insurance; all pay a marginal tax rate that would make a
banker&#146;s eyes water. This is not an argument against the living
wage&#151;far from it&#151;but an argument that seeks to highlight
the other difficulties faced by communities who want to
work.</p><p><a name="06071880000370">I shall give an
illustration of how the poverty trap works. The social regeneration
unit of the London Borough of Newham&#151;a fabulous, dedicated group
of people&#151; worked out the consequences of an increase from the
national minimum wage to the living wage for my
constituents&#151;from &#163;5.05 an hour to
&#163;7.05&#151;for a couple with a three-year-old child who
between them work a 50-hour week, and who pay an average private rent
for the area and average council tax. Let us imagine that the employers
have an &#147;A Christmas Carol&#148; moment, and decide to move my
constituents up from the minimum wage to that magic living wage figure
of &#163;7.05 an hour, an increase of 40 per cent. in gross earnings.
What happens? They get &#163;100 more in gross income; less tax
credit; less housing benefit; less council tax benefit; more PAYE; more
national insurance. They see &#163;10.31 of their &#163;100
increase. In other words, a marginal tax rate of 88.7 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06071880000371">I have lost
count of the number of constituents who have raised this issue with me.
I have constituents who have asked their employers to retract their
wage increase because they were worse off than they were before they
received it. I have constituents who work part-time who want to
increase their hours to full time, who want to progress at work, to
have a career and to access shared-ownership housing schemes but who
simply cannot afford the additional rent they would have to find for
their private rented accommodation to take that first step. They find
themselves in the poverty trap, and cannot find their way
out.</p><p><a name="06071880000372">We must do
something to ensure that the real gains of this Labour Government are
not defeated by the poverty trap. In the case that I described the
hourly rate of the individuals concerned would need to be doubled to
ensure that their wages took them beyond its grasp. Doubling wages is
unrealistic, so we have to find alternative solutions.</p><p><a name="06071880000373">The poverty trap is too complex
an issue to address in detail here, and there is no easy consensus.
There are attractions in addressing housing benefit, for example, which
is at the end of the food chain of the tax and benefit system, by
increasing earnings disregards and reducing the rate of withdrawal of
benefit as income 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 62WH</b><br>rises. But I am aware that that moderates but also extends the problem
up the income scale, and it is only tinkering. We need to be bold;
frankly, we need to think outside the
box.</p><p><a name="06071880000374">I have four
over-riding questions. First, is there a way to recognise the huge
differential in living and housing costs through some form of
differential minimum wage policy for the capital? We would need to
assess the impact of such a policy on regional labour
markets.</p><p><a name="06071880000375">Secondly,
can we, and should we, raise the threshold of income tax and national
insurance to larger groups of workers? Should that be nationwide or
regional? Should there be regional variations in tax codes, for
example?</p><p><a name="06071880000376">Thirdly, can
we address some of the underlying factors that make the problem of
poverty pay such a difficult nut to crack&#151;for example, the
continued existence of a deep poverty trap, and a shortage of housing
that is affordable to those who want to work? Would the Government
consider appointing a panel of experts to make one more effort to solve
the poverty trap that is the key to working incentives?</p><p><a name="06071880000377">Fourthly, should we make a
commitment to continue to increase the national minimum wage at a rate
that is significantly higher than inflation, as we have done in recent
years, as a major contribution to the promise to reduce child poverty?
Such a commitment needs to take account of the painless increases in
the minimum wage in past years, and the real benefit of local spending
to the economies of deprived areas.</p><p><a name="06071880000378">It would be reasonable to ask
what my proposals are on such an issue. I have argued that London has a
particularly acute problem of low wages, which impacts gravely on child
poverty and health inequalities, a cycle of deprivation that is
reflected in the poverty indices. It is exacerbated by a cost of living
far in excess of that of most of the rest of the country. Finding
solutions to these problems is clearly not easy, otherwise we would
have found them.</p><p><a name="06071880000379">It
is a complex subject. We need to review the inter-relationship of the
benefits available to in-work families and the taxation paid by them,
with a view to diminishing the deep poverty trap. We need also to build
on discussions with the Department of Trade and Industry about socially
irresponsible contracting; to create an equivalent to the Greater
London authority&#146;s living wage unit in all regions of Britain;
and to review the terms of reference of the Low Pay Commission.
Finally, we need to create regional living wage strategies that
integrate with neighbourhood renewal and regeneration, particularly to
ensure that workers in low-paid sectors in deprived areas benefit from
Government investment. I accept that they are not glamorous or
headline-grabbing proposals, but neither are they
impractical.</p><p><a name="06071880000380">One
thing that the Government have done really well over the years is to
change the terms of the debate and to shift the middle ground. I want
the middle ground to be shifted again so that it will no longer be
acceptable for the armies of low-paid workers to remain unrecognised at
the cost of society&#146;s well-being. A wage that achieves an
adequate level of warmth and shelter, a healthy and palatable diet,
social integration and the avoidance of chronic stress for earners and
their dependents is an entirely reasonable policy step. It 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 63WH</b><br>would build on the concept of the minimum wage, and it is an essential
prerequisite for the objectives that would reduce inequality to which
we on this side of the House are fiercely and strongly
committed.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071880000426">1.41
pm</h5><p><a name="06071880000381"><b><a name="06071880000541">The
Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b> I congratulate my hon.
Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) on securing the debate,
which is on the impact of the Government&#146;s economic policies on
worklessness and poverty in West Ham. Those listening this afternoon
will immediately have recognised why she deserves her reputation as a
great champion for her constituents, particularly those who, because of
grinding poverty, are least able to speak for themselves.
</p><p><a name="06071880000382">I shall outline the
Government&#146;s strategy in tackling the issues that my hon. Friend
has identified, touch on London&#146;s particular problems, and
conclude by answering the points that she raised. The
Government&#146;s long-term goal is employment opportunity for
all&#151;a modern definition of full employment&#151;and ensuring
that employment pays, which is what my hon. Friend wants. Delivering
that requires that everyone should be provided with the support that
they need to find employment and to develop skills&#151;and, indeed,
to earn a decent wage. As she knows, the Government are firmly of the
view that the best route out of poverty is paid employment of the sort
that enables people to live their lives constructively.</p><p><a name="06071880000383">The Government have taken many
important decisions to help achieve that goal. As my hon. Friend said,
we introduced a national minimum wage, and I shall return to that
subject later. We have also reformed the tax and benefit system, and
substantially increased the gains of working for most groups. In
particular, the working tax credit ensures that everyone has improved
incentives to work, which consequently tackles the unemployment trap. A
single person living in London, with housing costs of &#163;80 a
week, would see a &#163;40 per week gain from full-time work at the
national minimum wage; and a lone parent facing housing costs of
&#163;120 per week would gain &#163;63 per week when working
full-time work at the minimum
wage.</p><p><a name="06071880000384">The number of
people in employment has risen by 2.4 million, and our employment rate
is 74.5 per cent., the second highest among the G8 and close to record
highs. However, as my hon. Friend said, London&#146;s labour market
poses particular challenges. Of all the regions, London&#151;if I may
call the capital city a region&#151;has shown the smallest
improvement in employment rates since 1997.</p><p><a name="06071880000385">In 2005, London&#146;s
employment rate was 69 per cent., compared with 75 per cent. in the
rest of the UK. That is despite the fact that London has created new
jobs at an average rate of 70,000 a year since the early 1990s. The
people coming to London have made the difference. London&#146;s
population differs from the rest of the country in many ways. It is
home to more people with the characteristics associated with
disadvantage in the labour market, and it is home to more people with
multiple barriers to work. Skills and mobility problems are key factors
in the relatively high rates of worklessness in the capital. Another is
housing.</p><p><a name="06071880000386">Our policy
response has been based on national welfare-to-work policies, including
the new deal and, 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 64WH</b><br>more recently, pathways to work. Those policies have helped. We have
seen them working in West Ham; between 1997 and 2006, we saw a
reduction of more than 2,000 in the number of unemployed claimants.
Indeed, the new deal has made headway; as my hon. Friend acknowledges,
it has helped nearly 4,000 people in West Ham.</p><p><a name="06071880000387">The Government are also
providing additional resources for area-based initiatives. For
instance, my hon. Friend is aware of the action teams, one of which
operates in the Newham area. The actions teams target those who face
serious challenges to getting work or staying in work, and they often
concentrate on the groups that are hardest to reach, including the
long-term unemployed.</p><p><a name="06071880000388">In addition, in the welfare
reform Green Paper, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Work and Pensions proposes a city strategy to address questions of
worklessness in urban areas. The strategy is aimed at improving
co-ordination at the local level. It will be a valuable tool, and we
will need to build on it to address the points raised by my hon.
Friend.</p><p><a name="06071880000389">My hon.
Friend has been a great champion for the Olympics in 2012, as they will
provide some 12,000 jobs. We must ensure that investment in the
Olympics creates decent jobs that will go to my hon. Friend&#146;s
and other constituents who live in the area.</p><p><a name="06071880000390">The Government&#146;s
strategy has four separate strands. They are to provide financial
support for families that need it; to support employment opportunity
for all; to tackle material deprivation, which is what my hon. Friend
rightly concentrated on; and to deliver excellent public services, one
of which is housing. We are providing financial support and making the
necessary reform, but we need to build on that. We are creating
employment opportunities, but we need to do more. We are tackling
material deprivation by promoting financial inclusion and improving
housing, which is a great challenge in the capital. We are also
delivering excellent public services in order to improve
children&#146;s life chances and to deal now with the poverty that my
hon. Friend describes. I know that she wants us to break that vicious
cycle.</p><p><a name="06071880000391">My hon. Friend
went on to raise further matters, and I shall briefly respond. We need
to explore, outside today&#146;s debate, how the city challenges in
the welfare Green Paper might focus much more on London and working in
partnership. I turn first to the national minimum wage.</p><p><a name="06071880000392">Variations in the national
minimum wage are already vast, and not just between London and the rest
of the country. There are also variations within regions. For instance,
my region of the south-west includes Cornwall and Bristol, but the
variations can be enormous in terms of labour market opportunities.
Trying to respond to regional differences would make the national
minimum wage impossible to operate and, more important, impossible to
police. It would increase the chances of it being exploited by those
few employers who would try to pay below the national minimum
wage.</p><p><a name="06071880000393">We take advice
from the Low Pay Commission, which has considered the issue. The
commission is our expert panel and is independent. I do not know
whether it is possible to ask the commission, in the 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 65WH</b><br>light of the welfare reform Green Paper, to consider specifically the
issues in cities. Those who represent rural areas might say that the
situation is the same in some isolated rural areas, but perhaps we can
pick up the issue and see whether the commission can take it forward.
However, regional variations in the minimum wage would be a nightmare
and difficult to
enforce.</p><p><a name="06071880000394">Housing
benefit already takes into account regional differences in housing
costs, and of course people&#146;s eligibility fluctuates according
to whether their rent is lower or higher. A great deal of work has been
done on trying to reduce the tapers and the effect of the tapers on
housing benefit and therefore the marginal rate of tax that my hon.
Friend described. The solution is to provide decent jobs that are well
paid and to invest in public services, and the Government are confident
that that can be done in
London.</p><p><a name="06071880000395">My hon. Friend
touched on the use of tax codes. The Government strategy has been to
try to lift families out of paying tax, and I think that she will be
familiar with the following figure because she heard me give it only
last week. In 1997, fewer than 2.5 million families paid no tax; now,
more than 3 million families pay no tax. The effect of our measures,
particularly tax credits and child benefit, has been to lift families
out of tax.</p><p><a name="06071880000396">The recent
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures show
that the gross tax of a one-earner family of two adults and two
children on 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 66WH</b><br>about &#163;21,000 a year has gone down from just over 19 per cent. to
about 9 per cent. Their exposure to tax has been reduced. Again, that
has been done by using the main planks of policy that I have
described.</p><p><a name="06071880000397">I encourage
my hon. Friend to keep pushing the points that she has made and to keep
challenging the Government in this crucial area, which is about people
getting out of the poverty trap and breaking the cycle. We need to
recognise the combination of factors involved, including housing,
employment, lack of child care, other social deprivation indicators and
special additional support in respect of skills or language if English
is not the first language. In particular, we need to continue with the
strong partnership that has developed with the Greater London authority
and the Mayor&#146;s office in examining the particular challenges in
London&#151;not in wealthy parts of London but in constituencies such
as that represented by my hon. Friend&#151;to ensure that the
Government&#146;s policy finally puts an end to the vicious poverty
cycle that her constituents are experiencing. She is so right to
champion their cause, and again I congratulate her on obtaining the
debate. I do not have instant solutions for her today, but I hope that
she will be reassured that the Government have the levers in place,
although we need to do
more.</p><p><a name="06071880000398"><i>Question put
