<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51129h01_spnew0"><b> Frank Cook  (Stockton, North)</b>  (Lab): Good morning, Mrs. Humble. I congratulate you on having attracted so many attendees to today&#039;s event. Will you register with Mr. Speaker my gratitude for his allowing me the debate? In the hundreds of long hours when, as Deputy Speaker in this esteemed place, I have occupied the Chair in which you now sit, I have pondered whether I would ever have to speak from the Floor. However, I did not expect to do so with the sadness and dismay that I bring with me today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para0"><a name="stpa_0">We have so much to consider and so many questions that need to be answered that I shall do my best to be brief. If the Minister seizes the opportunity today, she will be able to shine like she has never shone before. I promise hon. Members that she has the chance to save the Home Office from a fate worse than death.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para1"><a name="stpa_1">Allegedly, we are in consultation throughout the country, except in Scotland, and we have until 23 December to consider how to treat our police forces, but have we? Last week, in response to a business question from the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale), the Leader of the House replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;The first stage of the consultation is scheduled to be concluded by 23 December, but that will happen only where police forces agree to amalgamation.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 24 November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 1669.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para2"><a name="stpa_2">At the same time in Belfast, the Association of Police Authorities stated categorically and unanimously that it will not voluntarily enter into any form of amalgamation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para3"><a name="stpa_3">There have been certain contradictions. Mr. Giffard, the esteemed chief constable of Staffordshire, is heading the review board. He said that investing further resources on options not shortlisted would be useless and that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;any additional options should not be pursued at the expense of these shortlisted proposals.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para4"><a name="stpa_4">For the north-east, there is only one proposal, which is    the merger of Northumbria with Durham and Cleveland. There is no prospect of giving consideration to anything other than that. That seems to be a denial of consultation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51129h01_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ashok Kumar  (Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland)</b>  (Lab): The Home Secretary decided to go for a reduction in the number of forces in the country and said that that was okay because it would be a cost-cutting exercise. However, within days it was put in the public domain that the Home Office review unit had decided that we need a single force for the area. Does my hon. Friend find it extraordinary that, only a few weeks earlier, the Home Secretary wanted a consultation 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 2WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
process to go out, yet a few weeks later a review emerged from nowhere that boxed in all the forces to reach a known conclusion that existed in the Home Office? Is that not a Machiavellian plot, or does he regard it as a coincidence?
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51129h01_spnew2"><b> Frank Cook </b> : I could hardly give the Home Office the       credit of being Machiavellian. However, &quot;extraordinary&quot; is the understatement of the century. A serious game is being played. Mr. Giffard&#039;s statement about one option only was made on 9 November. On 16 November, Ministers said that no options will be closed. That is another contradiction. The political world is going mad.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51129h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner  (Isle of Wight)</b>  (Con): In light of what the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar) said about Ministers saying that no option would be closed, is the hon. Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook) surprised that my authority&#151;the Hampshire police authority&#151;was told that it was not to consider amalgamation with Dorset or Wiltshire because those authorities were on the wrong side of the arbitrary Government office boundaries?
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51129h01_spnew4"><b> Frank Cook </b> : Yes, it certainly seems strange that so many questions are being answered even before they have been asked.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51129h01_spnew5"><b> Peter Bottomley  (Worthing, West)</b>  (Con): The hon. Gentleman has done the House a great service in initiating this debate. Although most of the debate will be about the north, not a single person from west Sussex and Sussex has written to me to say that they want to see an amalgamation. I hope that he will not blame Mr. Giffard for what he has said, because I expect that he is a man under instructions. Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the Home Affairs Committee report into this? Has the Minister been questioned at length and does he think that that would be a better step than this rush before Christmas?
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51129h01_spnew6"><b> Frank Cook </b> : If the hon. Gentleman is looking for an argument he had better change the subject. Of course I agree. The sad thing about all this is that it has been introduced at such a pace. I cannot do better than cite Christopher Booker, who in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;Most people are aware that the Government plans to restructure the 43 local police forces of England and Wales on regional lines. What is not so widely known is the astonishing speed at which the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, is bulldozing this through.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">Using the usual excuse, &#039;the need to fight terrorism&#039;, his plans first surfaced on September 16. Six days later he gave the 43 chief constables an ultimatum: they must come up with their plans for a mass-merger by November 28, and by Christmas the entire plan must be agreed. The most fundamental restructuring of Britain&#039;s police in 170 years is to be rushed through in just 12 weeks.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51129h01_spnew7"><b> Bob Spink  (Castle Point)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate at this time. He believes in listening to the people: I know that because I know him well. Do his constituents feel 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 3WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
like mine that local policing should be kept local so that local people can have control of their police forces and identify with them? If so, does he believe that we should have a major three-hour debate before the House rises for Christmas?
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51129h01_spnew8"><b> Frank Cook </b> : There were two questions there. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to stop writing my speech for me. A MORI poll has been conducted and the results will be published today. It will not surprise hon. Members to learn that it was commissioned by the Cleveland police authority, but it was conducted right across the country. I have the full results here for anyone to examine. I will gladly pass it on to the Minister if he would deign to look at it. Of those questioned, 8 per cent. want a single police force for Northumbria, Durham and Cleveland. Does that not mean that 92 per cent. do not want it? That reflects the resounding rejection of a north-east regional assembly less than 12 months ago.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51129h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham)</b>  (Lab): Does my hon. Friend think it right that Cleveland police authority has spent over &#163;100,000 of public money defending its cause? Can he also say how many of my constituents in Durham or in south Durham have been consulted on the bonkers idea put forward by the chair of the Cleveland police authority to split a very successful force like Durham in half?
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51129h01_spnew10"><b> Frank Cook </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising those matters. I was going to refer to them anyway but I will do so now. The simple truth about Durham is that it already operates on two distinctly separate commands: one in the north and one in the south. <i>[Interruption.] </i>My hon. Friend says from a sedentary position that that is not the case. I promise him that it is. The suggestion that has been made from Cleveland is that the Cleveland force goes with the south of Durham and that the Tyne and Wear forces go with the north of Durham.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51129h01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Jones </b> : Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51129h01_spnew12"><b> Frank Cook </b> : Not at the moment. That is why the chief constable of Durham has said that this splitting of the force will make it operationally dysfunctional. It already operates on that basis, but for some reason he thinks that adding it to Cleveland will render it dysfunctional.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51129h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. John Redwood  (Wokingham)</b>  (Con): I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for securing the debate, and for giving way. Does he think it particularly odd for the Government to bring forward the proposal to merge north-eastern police forces into a regional structure so shortly after the people of the north-east made clear their views on regional government by voting comprehensively against elected north-eastern government? Does he agree that there is no great sense of regional identity in the north, although there is a lot of pride in counties and cities?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51129h01_spnew14"><b> Frank Cook </b> : There is merit in some of the points made by the right hon. Gentleman, but to say that there is no 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 4WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
regional identity in the north-east is, frankly, flying in the face of what exists. I advise the right hon. Gentleman to go to a football match and hear the crowd singing &quot;The Blaydon Races&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51129h01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Roger Gale  (North Thanet)</b>  (Con): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51129h01_spnew16"><b> Frank Cook </b> : Yes, but then I really have to make progress.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51129h01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Gale </b> : The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr.   Jones) seemed to suggest that it was somehow improper for Cleveland constabulary to spend money defending its case. Could the hon. Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook) say whether he or the Home Office have given any indication of the cost of the entire exercise? The chief constable of Kent, a force that has no borrowing at the moment, has said that he would have to borrow considerably&#151;it would take up to 10 years to pay it back&#151;just to complete the exercise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51129h01_spnew18"><b> Frank Cook </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for dragging me back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones). On that very point I can quote Andy Ford, the head of the police resources unit at the Home Office. He told police authorities last week that the money for the restructuring across the whole country will
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;have to come from borrowing as part of your business cases, as the government does not have the money&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51129h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : Can my hon. Friend answer the question I put to him earlier: has Cleveland police authority and its chairman consulted anyone in Durham about proposals to split the highly successful Durham force in half?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51129h01_spnew20"><b> Frank Cook </b> : I do not know, but I go back to the MORI poll. People in Durham were consulted in that poll; the samples went to Durham, just as everywhere else.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51129h01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth  (Aldershot)</b>  (Con): I add my congratulations to the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. He refers to the MORI poll; Hampshire police force tells me that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;At an independently run, public focus group consultation event held with residents, on November 19th our residents&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para5"><a name="stpa_5">in Hampshire
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;were unanimous across all groups that Hampshire Constabulary should not be amalgamated and should remain a single force.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para6"><a name="stpa_6">Does that not add to the argument that is suggested by the results of the MORI poll?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51129h01_spnew22"><b> Frank Cook </b> : The answer is so obvious that the question does not even warrant a reply, though I thank the hon. Gentleman for making the point.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para7"><a name="stpa_7">Before I leave the subject of finances, I point out that in Cleveland we estimate that the restructuring&#151;we will have to borrow for the restructuring&#151;will cost in the region of &#163;50 million. The borrowing would have to be financed, and we reckon that the finance charges on it would be about &#163;5 million a year. Where will that charge 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 5WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
fall? It will fall to the police precept, and the precept will be added to council tax. How will we answer our constituents if such a measure is adopted?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51129h01_spnew23"><b> Tim Farron  (Westmorland and Lonsdale)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. He mentions that there are tight finances and no additional money. Does he recognise the problem facing my constituency in Cumbria, where the force could be merged to become part of a much larger north-west force? If one were chief constable of that larger, north-west authority, one might feel the temptation to borrow police from the apparently peaceful streets of Kendal and place them on the less peaceful streets of unnamed towns in Lancashire or Merseyside. Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that that means a real challenge for rural areas, which could lose police officers as a consequence of the move?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51129h01_spnew24"><b> Frank Cook </b> : That problem is evident across the country. I did not want to focus this debate purely on Cleveland, Durham and Northumbria. The point about the different characteristics of the region is important. If I can highlight them&#151;<i>[Interruption.] </i>My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham, who seeks to delay my speech, could easily have applied for the debate himself. He knows the northern region very well. We are asking the police force, if there is one force up there, to deal with the rural characteristics of Northumbria as well as the characteristics of Cleveland, which has a nuclear power station, a huge chemical complex and the deepest mine in Europe, the Boulby potash mine. Those are totally different characteristics. Can we really expect one police force to cater for them all?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para8"><a name="stpa_8">Let me describe what happened to the chief constable of Cleveland when he was addressing a meeting at a community centre on Rossmere way in Hartlepool. I am a Hartlepudlian myself and am rather proud of the awkward characteristics of the Hartlepudlians. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Be careful now. We hung a monkey once and we can hang one again; we have plenty of rope left. That is not meant for the Minister.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para9"><a name="stpa_9">At the meeting at the community centre, a member of the audience got up and said, &quot;Mr. Price, if we have only one police force for the whole north-east, do you think we could get the chief constable to come down here and answer our questions?&quot; Mr. Price was polite enough not to respond. I suggest that the answer, if it were true, would be in the negative, because the area would be too big for a chief constable. Big is not necessarily the answer to everything.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para10"><a name="stpa_10">What did the Met do when we had the bus and train bombings? It borrowed constables from Cleveland and all over the country, so big does not answer the problem. It is communication that is important. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Absolutely. It is communication and co-operation that are important. That is the secret of how to defeat the terrorism that is used to justify these insane measures.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51129h01_spnew25"><b> Peter Viggers  (Gosport)</b>  (Con): Although this is not relevant to the main thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument, is he aware that police forces, through the Home Office, intend to introduce one national telephone line for the police, apart from the 999 number, so that anyone in the whole of the United Kingdom can telephone one number? It would be for assistance other 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 6WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
than through the 999 number. The system is being trialled in Hampshire. Does the hon. Gentleman think that that will be an efficient improvement?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51129h01_spnew26"><b> Frank Cook </b> : I was unaware of that proposal until the hon. Gentleman brought it to my attention this morning. In my experience&#151;I have been here only 22 and a half years&#151;hon. Members regularly receive complaints from constituents who say, &quot;I telephoned the police but no one turned up.&quot; That is the situation now, so what on earth will be the consequence of the system that the hon. Gentleman describes?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"><a name="51129h01_spnew27"><b> Mr. Patrick McLoughlin  (West Derbyshire)</b>  (Con): The hon. Gentleman is a senior Back Bencher from the governing party. Does he think that the fact that the Government have cancelled this Thursday&#039;s debate, which would have given the whole House a chance to express its views, is a sign that the Government have been caught out and will not be allowed to get away with the measure quite as they wanted to, by slipping it under the carpet before Christmas, and that they may be rethinking the issue?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51129h01_spnew28"><b> Frank Cook </b> : I hope that the right hon. Gentleman is right, but of course the only person who can answer his question is sitting in the ministerial seat. I hope that the Minister will give us some indication in that regard, because 12 weeks for the type of reorganisation that we are discussing is totally inadequate and unacceptable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51129h01_spnew29"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): My right hon. Friend the Minister knows what I will rehearse. The problem is that the police reorganisation is taking place    against a background of ambulance trust reorganisation, fire service control reorganisation and NHS reorganisation. There is no stability in the way in which those emergency services are being reorganised. Surely it is time for the Government to consider a level of coherence before bringing other services into that pattern. Does my hon. Friend agree?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51129h01_spnew30"><b> Frank Cook </b> : All sorts of holes have been blown in the speech that I had prepared. It is only the second time in my life that I have prepared a speech; I usually use bullet points. My hon. Friend is right. Part of the thesis that I was trying to put forward right at the beginning was to depend upon the concept of city regions that the Deputy Prime Minister has proposed. If he is calling for city regions, why on earth are we cutting across that and saying that individual police forces will extend right across the country? All emergency services&#151;the fire, ambulance and health services, and the coastguards; the whole shebang&#151;should be based on the city region principle. They would be related to particular communities, knowing fully their characteristics, and would be able to respond more expeditiously and rapidly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51129h01_spnew31"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51129h01_spnew32"><b> Frank Cook </b> : I will do so for the last time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"><a name="51129h01_spnew33"><b> Mr. Jones </b> : My hon. Friend puts forward this argument, but what has a small village in rural Weardale in common with inner-city Middlesbrough?

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51129h01_spnew35"><b> Dr. Kumar </b> : Surely the answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) is that the Cleveland police force is in its strongest position ever. In the MORI poll that was mentioned, 70 per cent. strongly supported the existing position of Cleveland police authority.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51129h01_spnew36"><b> Frank Cook </b> : My hon. Friend does the Chamber a service by offering a response to a question that I thought was so fatuous that it did not deserve to be asked. That was going to be my answer, but I thank him.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para11"><a name="stpa_11">I must try to address points that have not been made, which might take some jiggling and shuffling around. The review has been rushed without proper thought and is a knee-jerk reaction to the London bombings. It is rather characteristic of the Conservative Government&#039;s reaction to pit bulls, which was equally insane, or, of course, to both Governments&#039; reaction to small-bore weapons&#151;hand guns. That did not do a damned thing apart from deny perfectly law-abiding families the exercise, two or three times a month, of putting holes in pieces of card from a range of 25 m. There are more firearms on the street than ever before and Jack the lad can get them wherever he wants.

He became the Earl of Stockton, but he was once the Member of Parliament for Stockton. Apparently, when he was Prime Minister he used to get up in the morning and say, &quot;How are things today? Are they quiet? Good, let&#039;s leave them that way.&quot; It is a pity that Mrs. Thatcher did not adopt the same kind of principle, but there we are.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para13"><a name="stpa_13">Cleveland, which is the only force in the country with a multi-agency planning unit, has spent &#163;100,000 putting forward its arguments. It is nothing to do with size; it is to do with the expertise required, how it has been gathered and the way it has been needed because of the different characteristics within the Cleveland constabulary unit and the area that it has to police. There are nuclear power stations, petrochemical plants and the serious storage of all sorts of volatiles. We have enormous subterranean depositories of the most volatile substances imaginable; if ethylene oxide ever goes off, there will be such a very big hole in Teesmouth that the North sea will disappear. Cleveland is ahead of the game; on inspection, it was one point behind Northumbria and several points ahead of Durham. Cleveland has had its problems in the past, but it has a right to have its options considered&#151;not for everything to be put in one pot and to be told by Mr. Giffard, &quot;You can&#039;t consider anything else.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para14"><a name="stpa_14">What about the nightmare situation of a single region stretching from the Scottish border to the north Yorkshire moors? How on earth could that possibly have the concentrated expertise or resources to respond to measures? That answers effectively the point about Weardale and central Middlesbrough.

The flaw in the argument on the finance side is that forces and police authorities will have to borrow to fund the measure. It would take the Gloucester police force, for example,  in the context of the proposals for the south-west, 25 years to save enough money to close the gap in protective services. Not only will this measure be expensive, it will not even deliver the improvement in policing that the Government say will happen.

Are there going to be representatives from all those authorities in the police authority? I suspect a sneaky plot; perhaps this is one way for the Government to get a north-east regional assembly, which they failed to get last year.

I therefore state candidly that I cannot accept the proposals. I never usually make a statement before going into the Chamber and hearing the debate, but on this occasion I am doing so.

I hope, Mrs. Humble, that you will convey to Mr. Speaker, as I personally shall do, the anger of so many of us that we are forced to make only brief remarks in this Chamber on this vitally important subject, rather than being able to debate it properly and fully on the Floor of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para23"><a name="stpa_23">I have in front of me a document from the Home Office called a 60-second brief, which somehow seems appropriate. It might be better named a back-of-the-fag-packet brief, because that is the type of plan that we have had for police restructuring in England and Wales.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para24"><a name="stpa_24">This policy exercise has been conducted scandalously. I say that as a former Minister with responsibility for the police, who has deep respect for Home Office civil servants and for Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary. However, I know that when the Government and Ministers ask HMIC to come up with independent recommendations, it can usually come up with recommendations that are convenient or conducive to what Ministers want. That is the smell that I have from this report&#151;that HMIC has suddenly concluded that forces with fewer than 4,000 officers are no longer fit for purpose. Where is the logical argument for that? Where is the detailed debate on it? If that was HMIC&#039;s genuine conclusion, we should have had some months of debate on the size and structure of forces based on that report. The first scandal is that we have not had that debate. The Home Secretary immediately decided that Her Majesty&#039;s chief inspector&#039;s report was excellent. What a surprise: did he not know that it was going to come on to his desk? He then ordered police forces to restructure. No, that is not quite correct: he asked police forces to restructure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para25"><a name="stpa_25">The next scandal is that so many of our so-called independent county forces fell over themselves to follow the Home Secretary&#039;s and the Minister&#039;s urging. Some of them&#151;scandalously, in the case of my force in Cumbria&#151;made that decision and went public before 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 12WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the police authority pronounced. That is absolutely disgraceful. As a former police Minister and someone who has never criticised the police force or the police service in his life, it grieves me to say that my own constabulary had a meeting with the Home Secretary one day and rushed out a statement the next day practically licking the Home Secretary&#039;s boots, saying that it was going to go ahead with all that he wanted. Two days later, the police authority put out a statement saying that it disagreed with the Home Secretary, and wanted to see an independent Cumbrian force. Last week, after the Home Secretary said that the only options would be those that he and John Giffard had recommended, the chief constable of Cumbria was ahead of the game and made a pronouncement that now that the Home Office had determined that, he had no option and was going to go along with its recommendations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para26"><a name="stpa_26">Once again, the police authority, the body that is supposed to be in charge of the police&#151;the democratically accountable body&#151;was left a few days later to say that it still wanted an independent Cumbrian force, but as its own police service had pulled the rug from under it, it was now stuck with the Home Office&#039;s options. The speed with which this is being conducted is a scandal. It is a scandal that local opinion is being ignored. The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) was complaining that no study had been done by Cleveland force on what it wanted in Durham, but no study has been done by the Home Office on what we want in Cumbria, or anywhere else. It is a Home Office plan, foisted on police forces that have no option but to go along with it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para27"><a name="stpa_27">If the Minister genuinely wants to see more strategic forces&#151;let us not pay too much attention to the term &quot;strategic&quot;, as the Government attach it to everything these days, and &quot;strategic police forces&quot; is a meaningless, nonsensical phrase&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"><a name="51129h01_spnew59"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way, but I will not take lessons from someone who was a member of a Conservative Government who abolished Cleveland county council without consulting anybody in Cleveland, and the Tyne and Wear authority without consulting anybody in Tyne and Wear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"><a name="51129h01_spnew60"><b> David Maclean </b> : If indeed that were the case, surely the hon. Gentleman is not using it now as justification for the dictatorial way in which the Home Office has foisted this on everybody. If the Minister wants to see larger forces, offering better protective services, why were not Cumbria and Northumberland allowed to have discussions on amalgamation? We have seen the Government&#039;s political agenda: they want to see regional police forces. We do not particularly want police forces to be combined, to work together at a so-called strategic size, but they want them combined into a political regional structure, so that they have regional political control.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para28"><a name="stpa_28">If there were a case for Cumbria to amalgamate with another police force, it would be with Northumberland, which shares similar problems in the north Pennines and the north of England. Instead, it will be amalgamated with Lancashire, or possibly with Liverpool. I say to the Minister that the only good news for us in Cumbria, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 13WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
without opening up another political subject such as support for hunting, is that we will not have a single copper left in Cumbria to enforce the hunting legislation, because Cumbria will always haul its officers down to the higher crime areas. That is not a criticism of Lancashire, Preston or Liverpool, but there is a higher level of crime in those areas, and Cumbria will be cleaned out as a result of officers going there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para29"><a name="stpa_29">All regional commissars or commissioners will&#151;I suspect that this is another reason behind some senior officers in all our forces being so keen to go along with the policy&#151;envy the Met. I visited every police force in this country a few years ago, and they all envied the size, wealth and power of the Met. We all know what the outcome will be: new regional commissioners will be created. They will be on the same salary as Ian Blair, and all the other chief constables will be assistant commissioners. They will create a huge new police service with regional commissars and regional commissioners. There will be no democratic accountability to local people; it will not be possible to build that in. The Home Office will have control; it has always wanted to get control of every police service, and to cut out local democratic accountability. It wants a system such as that in France, where the police answer purely and simply to the Home Department.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para30"><a name="stpa_30">The Minister&#039;s time scale is outrageous. If there is merit in any of the proposals, they will stand up to scrutiny over a longer period. Let us get John Giffard to appear before the Home Affairs Committee, and let us question him about issues such as the viability of the minimum threshold of 4,000 officers, or 6,000 staff in total. Let us also look into having a sensible time scale, and if the House then concludes that some of our county police forces need to be larger, let them amalgamate with the best nearest police force, in order to give us the best possible size of force. We must not force them into the artificial straitjacket of the Government&#039;s regional structures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para31"><a name="stpa_31">We know what will happen. Our ambulance service was stripped down and is now controlled from the regions. Our fire service in Cumbria will now be controlled from Warrington. Our strategic health authority and police are also controlled regionally. In a few years&#039; time, the Government will say, &quot;Oh dearie me, you are not controlling anything in Cumbria any longer, because everything is being controlled from the region, so you had better have some democratic accountability now.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para32"><a name="stpa_32">That will also happen in the north-east. The people there say, &quot;We have nothing left in the north-east. Nothing is controlled from the county any more. Everything is controlled regionally.&quot; However, they will end up voting for a regional assembly, because it will be better for people to have a democratic regional assembly controlling their services than to have the bureaucrats controlling them from London.

There is a tremendous spirit of cohesion&#151;of people working together, instead of everybody fighting each other.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para36"><a name="stpa_36">However, I also sincerely say to her that something is seriously wrong. I cannot understand something.

That is boxing us in by pushing us in a direction that we do not necessarily want to go in. We might want to go in that direction in due course, but do not tell us the conclusion before we have decided to go down that road. Give us time.

I cannot support that because, for five or six years, I was very critical of the police force, certainly in our area. There are strong feelings about this. My hon. Friend mentioned the MORI poll. The first choice of 70 per cent. of people is to keep Cleveland as it is. We are talking about a local model and local communities. That is still the spirit of what people want for our police force. On the one hand, we as a Government are saying that we want to transfer power to local neighbourhoods and local areas, and, on the other hand, we are moving power somewhere else. That is the danger with the north-east police force.

However, if my hon. Friend thinks that this should be about local community policing, why is the argument that we should amalgamate the Cleveland police force with half of a very successful force in Durham, rather than that we should retain Cleveland as a police force?
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51129h01_spnew67"><b> Dr. Kumar </b> : My ideal solution would be to keep the police force as it is, but the point is that the local authority has decided on a wider model in order to co-operate and try to move away from a fixed position, in order to move the debate onwards and try to work together. The Cleveland police authority has decided that it is willing to look at that road. It is trying to move from a fixed position. However, I am happy with the Cleveland police force model as it exists. At the same time, I am happy to let the debate flow. If we come to a different conclusion, that is fine. I am not taking a fixed position at the moment.

The Cleveland police force, in seeking to move its position to in some way accommodate what it sees at the wishes of the Home Office, undermines all our efforts to maintain the traditional county identities.

<a name="51129h01_para40"><a name="stpa_40">I support the spirit of Government policy, but if we go for a north-east force, there is a danger of the disaggregation that we saw previously. When Cleveland county council was abolished, we were told that the final cost would be far less than we had bargained for. However, the figures have proved the opposite. There are great dangers and we have learned from that bitter experience, which never delivered. I could give the Minister figures, but other hon. Members wish to speak and I want to keep my comments focused. I can tell the Minister that I have genuine fears about a monolithic force for the north-east because it would stretch from the Scottish borders to the North Yorkshire moors at the south end of my constituency. That would be massive and far too big. We in Cleveland and Teesside do not wish to be policed by a force that is about 50 miles down the A19. That is not practical. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North mentioned the difficulties faced by ordinary constituents who try to contact the police and find that no one ever responds. We want neighbourhood policing; that is the focus of Government and everything they are trying to do.

I express my concerns as a loyal friend who has never voted against the Government or abstained on a Government vote. During the years when I was fighting battles over Cleveland police&#039;s Operation Lancet, the Minister took very seriously the concerns that I expressed, and has always subsequently taken my concerns seriously. I ask the Minister to recognise that the force is making a tremendous effort. Many changes have been introduced and the new chief constable is trying very hard. He is on the front line and is making things happen. We do not want bureaucrats to turn everything upside down when our officers are trying so hard. We are trying to improve the quality of life for our constituents and citizens.

Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook) on securing the debate and for making a splendid speech, which covered many points. I shall be as brief as possible. I represent North Shropshire, which is policed by West Mercia constabulary, which was rated the most efficient of the rural police forces. It is the fourth largest police force geographically and the fourth lowest funded, yet it is to be crashed into a new regional force for the west midlands for reasons that I do not understand and for which there is no popular support. I have not received a single telephone call, e-mail or letter from any constituent demanding that change. The West Mercia constabulary is a responsive force. The new chief constable in my patch took on board the reopening of cells in Oswestry and Market Drayton. He will meet Members of Parliament, but there is no way that we shall have any influence over the creation of a vast new regional force.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para43"><a name="stpa_43">My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) and I met senior policemen in Shrewsbury soon after the announcement of a new regional force. They were utterly dismayed, because they know that they do a good job. One policeman told me, &quot;We are a most efficient force and we work.&quot; They do not understand where this is coming from. Since &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; was published, there has been no report that presents evidence for the change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para44"><a name="stpa_44">I wrote the most forceful letter that I have ever written to a Minister to the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety on 10 November to ask what the evidence is for the change, why that evidence has not been published, why it has not been peer reviewed and why on earth there is this extraordinary rush for change.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51129h01_spnew73"><b> Mr. Philip Dunne  (Ludlow)</b>  (Con): I, too, would ask the Minister to explain in her closing remarks why in May, at the Association of Chief Police Officers&#039; professional standards in policing conference, the criteria for assessing the strategic force size was 2,500 officers, and why that figure has now risen to 4,000 officers. There is no discussion in the &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; report on the subject.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51129h01_spnew74"><b> Mr. Paterson </b> : My hon. Friend is absolutely right to mention the totally arbitrary figure of 4,000. The West Mercia constabulary has 2,380 officers in what is, I repeat, the fourth largest policing area. We are being forced into an enormous west midlands force. The unsigned letter that the Minister sent me on 9 November dismisses the other option of going in with Staffordshire. The letter says:

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para46"><a name="stpa_46">Moreover, that is not what the chief constable and the chairman of the police authority wanted when all eight Conservative Members for the region met them at Westminster; nor is it what they wanted when they roasted the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) at an impromptu meeting in the caf&#233; downstairs two weeks ago. The Minister could not attend the debate for understandable reasons: she was at the Report stage of the Terrorism Bill late into the day. It is absolutely ridiculous, however, for her to write me a reply that says:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;HMIC&#039;s analysis has been broadly accepted by the police service and in light of these findings&#151;and the implications for public safety&#151;it would be negligent to retain the current ineffective structure of policing.&quot;</p>

Will she guarantee that she will allow that analysis to be put out for peer review? Will she state where the arbitrary figure of 4,000 came from? The IRA blew up Tern Hill barracks and Shrewsbury castle, and West Mercia police performed magnificently. Our chief constable previously worked for Thames Valley police, where three counties work alongside a Goliath in the shape of the Metropolitan police, but it worked. There is no operational necessity to force us in with a monster force. That marks the beginnings of a national police force.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para49"><a name="stpa_49">Nine chief constables will sit down in one room with the Home Secretary to receive their orders. We can all forget it; we shall be absolutely irrelevant. We shall have no say in and no impact on the policing of our people. This is totally contrary to our traditions. In Elizabethan times, citizens were expected to perform both jury service and police service. That will go. We have never had a gendarmerie or a carabinieri in this country. When Robert Peel first set up the police force, the issue of a national force was debated for days in Parliament before it was rebutted. It was decided then that policing should remain close to local people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para50"><a name="stpa_50">This very brave chief constable has been put in an impossible position. Like the other chief constables, he has had to destroy his life&#039;s work. He is bravely working on West Mercia as a strategic force. Will the Minister give equal credence to his studies and promise to see him so that West Mercia can be kept intact but carry out strategic operations? Will the Minister pass on to the Speaker my view that it is a disgrace that this debate is not being held on the Floor of the House and we cannot vote on it? The timetable is so tight that the debate must be reinstated&#151;the chief constables tell me that final option justification must be sent to the Home Office on 20 December. It is an utter scandal.

It is important, too, that the debate should have a Welsh dimension because the Home Office has proposed a national police force, which has made progress to this stage as a result of its assessment. That is totally unacceptable.

The Minister works hard with that force and knows the progress that it has made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para52"><a name="stpa_52">The issues that have been outlined by hon. Members in the debate suffer from the added problem in Wales of being blurred with politics. There are many in the National Assembly for Wales who feel that if they cannot get their own way they will be happy with a national force under their powers, devolved from the Home Office. I want the Minister to respond firmly to that point, on the record.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para53"><a name="stpa_53">The response from Mr. Giffard, the director of the police structures review unit, said that one option was available&#151;that of a national police force. However, there is a contradiction in what he said in his response to the chief constable, of which we all have a copy. He said that any proposed partnership between North Wales and the neighbouring force&#151;Cheshire&#151;would cross Government boundaries and there was no compelling argument that that should happen. He then contradicted himself, stating that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;any future structure would continue to foster partnership arrangements between North Wales and Cheshire out of operational necessity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para54"><a name="stpa_54">There is an operational necessity for neighbouring forces in England and Wales to collaborate. The police authority feel that that is the best option, and I support it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"><a name="51129h01_spnew77"><b> Mr. David Jones </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern that the regional agenda is being promoted by the Secretary of State for Wales, who came out strongly in favour of an all-Wales force? He suggested that the chief constable should oversee that new force by helicopter, travelling between north and south, which led to the headline in the <i>Daily Post</i> &quot;Stand by for super copper in a chopper.&quot;
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51129h01_spnew78"><b> Albert Owen </b> : That was a rather long intervention. I often disagree with the Secretary of State because I am here to stand up for my constituents and, in this case, north Wales, and I am happy to do so. A North Wales police force works well within some of the limits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para55"><a name="stpa_55">I shall mention costs briefly, as I am short of time. The North Wales police authority estimates that restructuring in Wales would cost about &#163;50 million, and that to meet the criteria on terrorism and organised

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
crime would cost in the region of &#163;3 million. It would be false economics to spend all that money on restructuring; I want it to be spent in regions such as north Wales to retain a regional dimension.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para56"><a name="stpa_56">My final point is on the experience of the North Wales force. The port of Holyhead in my constituency is one of the busiest in the United Kingdom. The traffic to the Republic of Ireland is about 2.5 million people a year. The North Wales force works on terrorism, smuggling and other big issues, and has done for many years. An all-Wales police force would diminish that experience, and I urge the Minister to reconsider the options to allow for a north Wales dimension in policing in Wales.

Members that we will be able to vote on the matter at some stage after a substantive debate in the main Chamber.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para58"><a name="stpa_58">I advise the Minister to think about the breakneck speed of the timetable and the rushed and cursory consultation that has been undertaken, to which many hon. Members have referred, but I ask her not to spend time on matters about which we agree. There are themes in the &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; report about which I am sure we all agree: the unique challenges facing modern policing or the potential weakness of police force structures in areas such as intelligence and level 2 policing. No one disputes that there may be weaknesses, but what is the best way to address them?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para59"><a name="stpa_59">The value of community policing is common ground among people of all parties. However, none of those issues suggest that we should take a next step of having huge police forces. As the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who is no longer in his place, said earlier, there is a worrying trend for things such as ambulance trusts, primary care trusts, fire control centres and planning powers to become less and less local. It may be a fantastic coincidence that all of those things are becoming less local at the same time. Perhaps each

decision has been based on careful analysis of the evidence, but as many hon. Members have said, the evidence seems to be lacking.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"><a name="51129h01_spnew82"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b>  (Con): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that such is the pressure applied to police forces and authorities by the Government that operational changes are already taking place? In Northamptonshire, for example, the four police basic command units have already been halved to just two on the basis that they will be unsustainable under the inevitable merged police force.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51129h01_spnew83"><b> Martin Horwood </b> : I was not aware of that; the hon. Gentleman makes a very important point. The &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; report says that the basic command units will allow local connection to be preserved, but it also underlines the fact that during a three-year period the number of basic command units has already fallen from 320 to 230. Clearly, they too are becoming less local and it sounds as if the hon. Gentleman has a concrete example of that already happening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para60"><a name="stpa_60">I recommend that hon. Members read &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; in full because it contains a lot that supports our case, not that of the Government. Point 1.11 is very instructive in this regard because it says that one size should not fit all and emphasises that performance is influenced by very many factors, including, most significantly, local leadership, and not necessarily structure. That does raise the question of why there is such restructuring instead of an improvement in performance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para61"><a name="stpa_61">The question of the purpose of Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary is also raised. Is its purpose not to identify weak performance and help forces to improve in areas of weakness, such as level 2 policing, rather than to come up with a structural solution? Point 1.25 in the report refers to the lack of comparative financial information on the cost of protective service outcomes. As the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) pointed out, some of the maths behind the proposals is distinctly dodgy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"><a name="51129h01_spnew84"><b> Mr. Harper </b> : On that point, is it not the case that the &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; report, which was finalised only just before it was published, had its chapter on finance removed because the team responsible for producing it did not agree that the Government&#039;s conclusions were supported by their analysis? The whole theme is that the reorganisation will cost a huge sum, much of it in IT expenditure, and it is not sensible to divert money away from operational policing to this unnecessary reorganisation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"><a name="51129h01_spnew85"><b> Martin Horwood </b> : I entirely agree. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the cost of closing the protective services gap in the proposed five/four south-west mega-force has been estimated by our Gloucestershire constabulary as &#163;21 million. The set-up costs of the merger have been estimated at &#163;64 million, &#163;40 million of which will go on IT. The point is well made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para62"><a name="stpa_62">There is a clue as to where the pressure on finance is coming from, because the &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; report, where one would hope to find a financial analysis, states:

<a name="51129h01_para69"><a name="stpa_69">The best piece of advice that I can give the Minister at the moment is to quit while she is behind, because this argument is running away from her. The devastating analysis that has been applied to the Government&#039;s apparent policy has been shot at her with great force by right hon. and hon. Members in all parts of the Chamber. I want to thank them all for their contributions this morning, because it will bring home, not only to the Minister but, hopefully, to other Members of the Government, that this is not a single issue nimby group that is complaining. We are talking about a feeling that is emanating from our constituencies&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I did not hear what was said, so I will not bother to reply to it. This theme is emanating from our constituencies and from our police authorities&#151;from the places that we represent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para70"><a name="stpa_70">I want briefly to urge the Government to consider this matter. This looks to us like a growing regionalisation across the whole provision of emergency services; it looks like the nationalisation of the police. We know that the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) was probably the most authoritarian Home Secretary since the war, and he wanted to control everything. The new Home Secretary has unfortunately had to inherit that agenda and the Minister is having to pick up the pieces. She went to Belfast on Wednesday and Thursday last week to listen to the Association of Police Authorities and came back, if I may say so, with her policies somewhat singed. This is an expensive and undemocratic waste of time, and this is all that the Government can come up with. We want policing by consent and by the citizen in uniform and police to be connected to the constituencies and the areas that they police.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para71"><a name="stpa_71">Of course there is a case for pragmatic co-operation between police forces. Of course there is an argument for concentrating expertise in particular forces&#151;expertise in nuclear and chemical inspection, for example. Cleveland was mentioned in that context. Of course the Metropolitan Police Authority is the centre of excellence on terrorism. However, that does not mean that one size fits all and that one form of regional policing needs to be applied to everybody.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para72"><a name="stpa_72">I shall finish on a local point, made from my own, constituency point of view. The Leicestershire police authority has been advised by the HMIC report and those behind it that the Government are looking at two possibilities. One is to form one force by combining the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire forces and form another by merging the Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire forces. One has only to put those positions forward&#151;and then look at a map, perhaps&#151;to see how ludicrous they are.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
on securing this debate but on tapping into an issue that is demonstrably of concern to Members across the House. I am genuinely pleased that this debate is so well attended. I had no intention of slipping things under the carpet&#151;one phrase that has been used&#151;and trying to get rid of this debate before Christmas. As hon. Members know, I am always perfectly prepared to engage, discuss, challenge and consider the issues, and I am delighted to have the opportunity to do that.

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="51129h01_spnew92"><b> Hazel Blears </b> : I genuinely want to deal with some of the issues. If I give way during my eight minutes, I shall be criticised for not having answered some of the questions, and I want to try to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para74"><a name="stpa_74">I, too, am sorry that we will not have the debate on the Floor of the House on 1 December. I would welcome another three-hour debate in this Chamber, although that is clearly a matter for Mr. Speaker. We are trying to ensure that there is a debate on the Floor of the House&#151;after Christmas, if necessary. I absolutely want to be able to have debates on the issues so that every single Member who is concerned about the future of their police service has an opportunity to contribute. I am delighted that the police service conjures up the great emotion and passion that has been exhibited by all Members who have spoken today. That should continue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para75"><a name="stpa_75">However, as well as having the passion and strong feeling exhibited particularly today by the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), the best kind of debate is also informed and constructive. I say to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) that I did go to Belfast last week and listen to members of the Association of Police Authorities. I found them constructive and willing to engage. They were dealing with some difficult issues, but I found that they were genuinely concerned to try to maximise the performance of their police services. That is in all our interests.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para76"><a name="stpa_76">I should like to say a word about neighbourhood policing. That concerns many Members, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar), who is extremely concerned that his neighbourhood policing should continue to perform at its best ever level and that it should be in touch with local people and reflect their priorities. One of the very reasons why we are going down the route of strategic police authorities is to try to make sure that for the long term we can protect the neighbourhood policing that is so important to our constituents. That is the policing that they see, feel and touch in their neighbourhoods.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para77"><a name="stpa_77">Denis O&#039;Connor&#039;s report makes it very clear that, as the threat from serious and organised crime, major murders and terrorism becomes greater and the criminals become more sophisticated, level two crime will become a bigger pull away from neighbourhood policing. Unless we have strategic police forces that have the capacity, capability and resilience to deal with that level two challenge, the abstractions from neighbourhood policing will inevitably grow and our forces will be unable to protect and ring-fence the dedicated, visible and accessible neighbourhood policing teams.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para78"><a name="stpa_78">In our manifesto, we made a commitment that every area, rural or urban, will have such teams by 2008. If we do not address the issue now of coping with threats posed by emergencies and critical incidents, our detective capacity will be drawn away from the neighbourhood in order to deal with the complex and serious crimes. Members should be clear about why we are going down this route. It is to ensure that we can cope with the serious threats from more complex and sophisticated crime and also protect the very neighbourhood policing about which all hon. Members have expressed concern.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para79"><a name="stpa_79">My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North raised some serious issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"><a name="51129h01_spnew93"><b> Frank Cook </b> : The Minister has laid out very clearly the difficulties that we face. If they are so difficult, why do we not have more time to consider them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"><a name="51129h01_spnew94"><b> Hazel Blears </b> : I was just about to turn to the issues of time scale, governance and finance. Those are genuine matters and it is right that Members should be concerned. We have said that we want forces and authorities to come forward with their options by 23 December. The central implementation team tried to give people a steer by saying which options were worth looking at and which were not worth investing time and energy in to work up in such detail. That is a pretty honest way forward, but it does not preclude authorities coming forward with other options. I know that that is a short time scale. My concern is that if we are to embark on major change&#151;every organisation, public or private, will agree&#151;we must get on with it or we end up with blight, low morale and people looking for the jobs that are available in other organisations. Once we have decided to embark on major change, we need to proceed as quickly as possible, but commensurate, as my hon. Friend says, with getting the decisions right.

<p>
<a name="51129h01_para80"><a name="stpa_80">I do not intend us to rush headlong into this process at the expense of making proper, considered decisions about the long-term future of our police service. [Hon. Members: &quot;You are!&quot;] We will continue to consult after 23 December. I have no doubt that communities will continue to be engaged in this because they are extremely important issues. If authorities and forces decide to go down the voluntary route of merger, that could proceed relatively quickly. If they reject the voluntary route and it is necessary to make an order there is a statutory four-month consultation period in relation to that process too. Again, further opportunities for fairly extensive consultation are built into the process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para81"><a name="stpa_81">It was said that that the APA said that nobody was willing to volunteer, but it has genuine concerns about governance, finance and basic command unit accountability. I will try to see whether I can give assurances on all those issues and whether it might be possible to make some voluntary progress. I am concerned to ensure that there is a mechanism at BCU level that gives local people the ability to call the police service to account, gives people the local input that all hon. Members have requested, and ensures that the locality, which is the basic command unit, rather than the strategic force is the engine that drives forward the process that we want to see happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h01_para82"><a name="stpa_82">Many Members have raised the issue that some strategic police forces might cover such a large area that that would be difficult. We are exploring the possibility of having a member of the command team with a geographic responsibility for a particular area, which again would give local people a real sense that policing is being delivered for them in their locality and there is no reason why we could not pursue many of those options&#151;

<a name="time_8">
<a name="51129h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_98"><a name="51129h02_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Nadine Dorries  (Mid-Bedfordshire)</b>  (Con): I begin by saying how delighted and privileged I am to have been given this 90-minute debate on such an important subject. Also, my thanks go to those in the Public Gallery; I recognise some Bedfordshire parents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para0"><a name="stpa_83">The special educational needs spectrum is wide; it runs from children who are simply unable to organise themselves&#151;I am slightly unlucky in that respect, because I seem to have three of those&#151;to children who need round-the-clock intensive support and care. We have all heard of Baroness Warnock, the architect of and authority on inclusion. She recants inclusion; she thinks that it has gone too far. During Prime Minister&#039;s questions, the Prime Minister was asked for a review of SEN policy, and Lord Adonis is searching for a third way. The new education White Paper on SEN is, frankly, depressing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para1"><a name="stpa_84">It is not difficult to see why and how Baroness Warnock originally reached her conclusion on the inclusion agenda. At the time, children with physical disabilities&#151;regardless of how intelligent or mentally able they were&#151;were automatically segregated from their peers and sent to a special school, very often a residential school many miles away from parents and family. Such children were denied the opportunity to interact socially with peers and to benefit from the curriculum taught to other children of similar academic abilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para2"><a name="stpa_85">One reason why Baroness Warnock recants the inclusion agenda is that she personally knows children for whom it has not worked. Those children have autistic spectrum disorders&#151;when I mention ASD I will be referring to children whose autism is at the higher end of the continuum&#151;and Asperger&#039;s. They have legal protection under Acts of 1981, 1993 and 1996, and more recently under the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001&#151;SENDA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para3"><a name="stpa_86">Following the introduction of the Education Act 1996, SEN children had a legal right to an education commensurate with their needs. For those with milder learning difficulties, that might be in a mainstream school with additional help. For those with more complex and difficult needs, that might be in a special school. Local education authorities were, for the first time, accountable and legally responsible for providing that education. The statementing process came to result in a legally binding contract between the parent, the LEA and the school. Unfortunately, the 2001 Act produced an unintended by-product&#151;and I do think that it was unintended. The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) here today steered the 2001 Act through Parliament, and I believe that that was done with the best intentions. In fact, I support the 2001 Act, apart from its unfortunate by-product.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para4"><a name="stpa_87">The 2001 Act states that there is a duty to educate children with special needs in the mainstream unless that is against the wish of the parents or incompatible with the education of other children. Unfortunately, that has been interpreted by many LEAs as meaning that it is 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 28WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Government policy to educate all children in mainstream schools. LEAs view it as an extension of inclusion and a manifestation of political ideology.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"><a name="51129h02_spnew1"><b> Bob Spink  (Castle Point)</b>  (Con): I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Does she agree that MLD&#151;moderate learning difficulty&#151;schools play an important part within the range of provision for special educational needs children? They provide parents with a range of choice for their children. Does she agree that there should be a moratorium on the closure of MLD schools, so that those schools are not lost, and so that we do not throw them out, like the baby with the bath water?
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"><a name="51129h02_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Dorries </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I shall cover that exact point in just a few moments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para5"><a name="stpa_88">Whether the Government intended it or not, a by-product of the 2001 Act is that LEAs believe that educating all children in mainstream schools is Government policy. What is the evidence for that? According to lay parent representatives and tribunal barristers, when a parent requests specialist provision, in either an MLD or a special school, it is almost always refused in the first instance. Having spoken to MPs of all parties and to many organisations, I know that they overwhelmingly concur with that conclusion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"><a name="51129h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough)</b>  (Con): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for securing this important debate. I have some personal knowledge of the trauma that can be caused when the parent of a child who goes to a special needs school is told that the school has to close, and that the child has to go to mainstream school. I know that that situation affects a small minority of people, but it still cannot be right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"><a name="51129h02_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Dorries </b> : The minority is not as small as one would think. I shall give some figures on that point later.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para6"><a name="stpa_89">LEAs are resisting requests for statementing, delaying the process. When a parent finally reaches the point of a statement, the LEA will minimise both the needs and the provision in order to justify inclusion in mainstream&#151;a situation led by cost implications as much as by political dogma. If a parent wants or feels that their child needs specialist provision, they have to fight for it via a special educational needs and disability tribunal&#151;SENDIST. Officially, there is no cost to such tribunals, but they involve a complicated legal process and parents need legal representation. The Education and Skills Committee recently took evidence from Simon Oliver, a barrister and chair of the SEN tribunal. He revealed that it costs between &#163;2,000 and &#163;10,000 for a parent to take a case to a tribunal. Because of the cost involved, only affluent middle class parents are able to take on an LEA&#039;s decision. Conversely, the Government consider the low number of tribunals in the UK&#151;3,300&#151;as a measure of policy success. I look on it as a measure of the number of people who can afford to pay. The sad reality is that those from lower socio-economic backgrounds are denied opportunities because the system is out of their reach.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para7"><a name="stpa_90">The SENDIST annual report for 2003&#150;04 states that the vast majority of cases that go to tribunal&#151;88 per cent.&#151;are successful and find in favour of the parents. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 29WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Of the parents who go to tribunal, 39 per cent. go in an attempt just to get a statement. It seems that parental preference works well, and that LEAs respond positively, if the parent wishes their child to go to a mainstream school, but not in any other circumstances. That is owing to the reluctance of LEAs, which believe that they are carrying out the Government&#039;s wishes to place children in mainstream schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para8"><a name="stpa_91">All authorities are under financial pressure. Therefore, it is no surprise that they will act in a contrary way whether it is appropriate or not. Minimisation of the extent of a child&#039;s needs in the statementing process is without doubt driven by financial pressure and political dogma. The closure of 91 special schools since 1997 compounds the problem. Even if some LEAs wanted to send all the children who needed to do so to special schools, many no longer have the places available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para9"><a name="stpa_92">The situation is turning ugly, and parents are beginning to organise themselves into effective lobby groups. I have been told stories by lay parent representatives of LEAs refusing to supply transport for a child to attend a special school but agreeing to transport the child to a mainstream school in order to force parents&#039; decisions. Parents react to that. Many parents of children with Asperger&#039;s or ASD at the higher end of the continuum have SEN problems themselves and simply cannot navigate the system. Even parents who do not have SEN struggle to access it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para10"><a name="stpa_93">There are examples of best practice throughout &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;, &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; and the new education White Paper. I would like to give three examples of my own. First, I would like to tell hon. Members about a little boy called Jack, whose case is an example of worst practice. It adds weight and brings clarity to the statement by Baroness Warnock that inclusion has gone too far.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para11"><a name="stpa_94">I met Jack in my first surgery as a new MP. He destroyed my room. He turned the chairs upside down, banged the door backwards and forwards, took books off cupboards and the desk and put them on the floor, and played with the light switch continuously until it made a fizzing noise. I thought that he would electrocute himself. As well as a hyperactive little boy, I had in my office his concerned, embarrassed and distressed mother, who had accompanied him. It was not a good situation. In order to try to calm Jack down, I made paper planes from some loose notes on my desk. He stopped and watched. He had my one-to-one attention, and that gave his mother five minutes to tell me his story.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para12"><a name="stpa_95">Jack was in a local mainstream school. The teachers told mum that Jack was fine with the few hours&#039; support that he received each week. Jack&#039;s mum showed me his daily report books: &quot;Jack learned the alphabet today&quot;, &quot;Jack communicated well today&quot;, &quot;Jack had a good day.&quot; Personally, I could not understand how that could be possible. One of the first things that one notices about Jack is his inability to communicate using speech. The second thing that one notices is the amount of effort one has to put in to securing his attention, even for a minute.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para13"><a name="stpa_96">Mum told me that Jack was bullied at school. One could understand why: children are not the most patient beings. It was entirely understandable that Jack&#039;s behaviour could drive other normally mild-tempered children to the point of distraction. She told me of an 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 30WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
incident a few months earlier when a child had pulled the chair out from under Jack as he went to sit down, causing him to fall backwards. She had not sent him to school since. Jack was a victim of inclusion. The policy had, in fact, excluded him from school, and a little boy who needed education the most was receiving none at all. That is a UK-wide problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para14"><a name="stpa_97">When things go wrong with a child who has Asperger&#039;s or a child who is higher on the autistic continuum, things go spectacularly wrong. Children with autistic spectrum disorders and Asperger&#039;s find mainstream the most challenging environment imaginable. They struggle with language. Can we imagine that? Can we imagine what it is like to struggle with language and not to understand what people are saying to us?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para15"><a name="stpa_98">Such children are confused by noise and by changing faces. They find it impossible to interact socially, but they understand that the inability to make friends and the creation of problems around them are of their own doing. Their behaviour is often extreme and bizarre, yet according to child psychologists, local education authorities refuse to accept the proven research that because of the nature of the condition, which robs the child of an interest in people and the motivation to interact, children with ASD and Asperger&#039;s do not learn from other children naturally. They find the noise, stimulation and movement of the everyday world so overwhelming and terrifying that they simply shut down. Some 27 per cent. of children with ASD are excluded from mainstream school at any one time. Today, 27 per cent. of autistic children in mainstream are not in attendance. Some 23 per cent. of that 27 per cent. are repeatedly excluded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para16"><a name="stpa_99">Parents of SEN children talk of common themes: the minimising of needs during the statementing process, closing special schools, and turning those that are left into regional residential centres for those with extreme needs. On Friday, I had a conversation with the headmaster of a special school in the north of England. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;Two years ago I had about 30 referrals a year. For the last two years I have had 11. All 11 have been children who are in extreme need and were inappropriate for this school. This year we will reach the point of financial inviability. We will have 50 children in the school. When that happens those children will be thrown to the four winds without a care, probably into the new academy, where they will sink. We have been told that the school will either close, or we will become a regional residential centre for the most severely disabled children. We await the department&#039;s decision.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para17"><a name="stpa_100">The headmaster believes that the lifeblood of his school has been cut off, and that children such as Jack do not reach him now unless the parent has the financial means to go to a tribunal.

Friend will not be aware of this, but Cedar Hall moderate learning difficulties school in my constituency, which also serves the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), has found that its intake level has been reduced almost to zero. The school is being throttled. Is she aware that in my constituency, some children who because of inclusion are in mainstream school are taught behind glass screens?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para18"><a name="stpa_101">What is so special about a special school? A child with ASD may not want to be a member of society. They have a communication disorder, and if they are to embrace society as adults, they have to be formally taught communication skills by highly trained professionals and adult teachers. Such skills cannot be expected of a mainstream-school teacher who is also trying to deliver a national curriculum to non-SEN children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para19"><a name="stpa_102">None of us wants to return to a society in which children are banished to residential schools, but the stark reality is that the policy of inclusion, which is leading to special school closures, is forcing parents to send their children away from home. If that headmaster in the north is right, and his school becomes a regional centre for the worst residential cases, we will be right back to the point at which Baroness Warnock came in 25 years ago.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para20"><a name="stpa_103">Special school closures also mean that we lose the pool from which language and speech therapists come to help and to support the children in mainstream. We are losing the centres of excellence and training. You may not know this, Mrs. Humble, but a teacher spends a maximum of half a day throughout their entire teacher training on special educational needs, and many spend only one hour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para21"><a name="stpa_104">I am pro-inclusion. I am a parent who fought for my child to go to a mainstream school. I believe that children who are able to thrive in the mainstream should be there. There is no reason on this planet why any physically disabled child who is mentally able should not attend a mainstream school. In case the tone of my speech seems to be anti-inclusion, let me stress that I am a pro-inclusionist. What I am arguing is that children on the higher autistic continuum or with Asperger&#039;s syndrome are not suitable for the mainstream.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para22"><a name="stpa_105">Let me return to my point about teacher training. A teacher from Newcastle who spent his entire teaching career in special schools has suddenly found himself in a mainstream comprehensive school, because of the closure of his special school. He said to me:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;I only actually get to deal with the kids in my own form at any one time. It would be common sense to put the most difficult of these kids together in one unit and use the teachers like me who at least are experienced in special needs to help them. The head doesn&#039;t like that, and said it doesn&#039;t fit with the inclusion agenda. What it doesn&#039;t fit in with is the new zero tolerance in class disruption&quot;</p>

<a name="51129h02_para24"><a name="stpa_107">Recent research by the Youth Justice Board found that 80 per cent. of young people in young offender institutions have SEN, and the majority of them were never even statemented.

applaud it, inasmuch as it helps parents in mediation with schools and teachers, which is a service that they never previously had. However, the parent partnership code of practice clearly states that the programme is not allowed to advocate on behalf of the parent. It reports directly to the local education authority&#151;its line manager is the head of the LEA. That must give rise to a conflict of interest in some areas of the country.

They are batted between the education service, the health service and social services departments, and they are constantly frustrated about being sent back and forth from one to another, almost in a permanent loop. Does my hon. Friend agree that we need to reorganise the resources that we have to provide a bespoke service for those parents and children, who are badly let down by the current system?
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"><a name="51129h02_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Dorries </b> : My hon. Friend has opened up a subject which could be an entire debate in itself. It involves primary care trust deficits, the fact that we have a massive shortage of speech and language therapists, and the fact that PCTs cannot afford to do some of the work that the LEAs are asking them to do in order to get reports together and to statement children. That is why special educational needs and disability tribunals cost so much; parents have to pay for a lot of the work themselves. The subject that my hon. Friend raises is of great importance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para27"><a name="stpa_110">To make a real difference, parent partnerships must be independently funded, autonomous of the LEA, and given the teeth to do the job; they must be independent of the LEA and be able to advocate on behalf of parents. I think that the Prime Minister called for a review and Lord Adonis is desperately searching for a third way because they know that SEN in the UK today and the introduction of the education White Paper do not go together. How can they? The Government propose to introduce trust schools, competition and a selection criterion with no statutory obligation via a code of practice. Who will want these children? Who will take them? The answer is no one.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para28"><a name="stpa_111">The Government claim that the White Paper is about driving up standards. How can standards in schools that take in SEN children be driven up? When MLD and special schools are closed down, those children will all be in the mainstream. They will be the school&#039;s barrier to improvement and to driving up standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para29"><a name="stpa_112">The White Paper states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;We are clear that there must be zero tolerance of both serious and low-level discipline and behaviour issues.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para30"><a name="stpa_113">The present policy of inclusion forces many children into an education environment in which they are uncomfortable and become disruptive, thereby undermining the Government&#039;s so-called zero tolerance on behaviour and discipline issues. Their policy in this respect is clearly contradictory. According to the White

Paper, schools will be free to select by interview if they want to do so. How would Jack fare in an interview? What head teacher would accept a child who wrecks an office in five minutes?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para31"><a name="stpa_114">The White Paper mentions SEN children in two dedicated paragraphs, both of which are completely inconclusive and end in a similar way. The first of those paragraphs ends with the phrase:

</ul>
<p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para33"><a name="stpa_116">Every paragraph in the White Paper is entirely conclusive except those referring to children with SEN. It is time for the Government to come clean. What exactly is their policy with regard to SEN and the White Paper, and how do they intend to manage SEN within the remit of the White Paper? Again, I am referring specifically to children on the high end of the autistic continuum and those with Asperger&#039;s.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para34"><a name="stpa_117">I think that when the Prime Minister called for a review of SEN he knew exactly what he was doing. He knows that there is an incompatibility between what is happening on the ground and what he wants to achieve via the introduction of the White Paper. I am going to raise myself to the giddy heights of the Prime Minister, Lord Adonis and Baroness Warnock and ask the Minister to call for a review. I know that she is a Minister of good intent and is much admired by hon. Members on both sides of the House for her ability and compassion. I ask her sincerely to consider seriously a review, particularly for the groups of children that I have just mentioned. A review may even help the Government to calm their own malcontents; it may help with the passage of the White Paper.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para35"><a name="stpa_118">If the Minister chooses to answer my call, I ask her not to speak in the jargon that the Government have used of late when talking about education. I ask her not to mention effective partnerships because, as I have stated, when it comes to SEN there are none. I ask her not to mention cross-agency co-operation, because agencies do not co-operate when it comes to SEN. I ask her just to talk about how we can make better the education and lives of children with SEN, and to call for a review. How can we prevent SEN children from becoming the people with ASBOs of tomorrow? Why use spin when the truth works so well?

individually now. So I have some background and am informed to an extent on these issues. During my eight and a half years in Parliament, I have become more concerned. The issues are still unresolved and there are still deep differences of view on them. They raise passions because we are predisposed one way or the other. However, I think that the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire, my constituency next-door neighbour, has tried to be objective and not to express a biased view.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para37"><a name="stpa_120">Special educational needs cover a range of issues, including physical disabilities such as hearing impairment, that are related to slow learning. Most of them are not difficult to deal with. They are less problematic and we can and do make provision for them. Slower learners are perhaps not difficult to deal with in a mainstream school; we have a setting system. We have special hearing units, sight-impaired units and so on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para38"><a name="stpa_121">The problem, as the hon. Lady said, has to do with behaviour in school and whether we include or exclude pupils with serious behavioural difficulties. There is a spectrum with total inclusion in mainstream schools at one end and special schools and special residential schools at the other. The question is how we deal with those pupils for their benefit and for the benefit of others. The trouble is that the issue is driven by ideology and money. One of the arguments is based on the passionate belief that we should not discriminate between people and that it would be best for them to be involved in the same communities, the same classes and the same schools.
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"><a name="51129h02_spnew10"><b> Mrs. Theresa Villiers  (Chipping Barnet)</b>  (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that treating people equally sometimes involves treating them differently and providing services that are tailored to their needs? It is not discrimination to allow children with special needs the choice of a special school or a mainstream school.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"><a name="51129h02_spnew11"><b> Kelvin Hopkins </b> : That is a strong point. Over the years, I have thought it peculiar that people like me who went to a grammar school had small classes and intensive teaching, while those who attended secondary modern schools had larger classes and less good teaching. It should have been the other way round. Those who are most able should have the least effort put into their education, while those who are least able should have the most effort put into their education. The system should be compensatory.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para39"><a name="stpa_122">The liberationist ideology derives from a philosophy that was common when I was young in the 1960s. It was reinforced by psychologists such as R. D. Laing who thought initially that there was no such thing as mental illness, but just different ways in which to perceive the world, and that we were all the same. He was debunked during his lifetime and, like Baroness Warnock, at the end of his life, R. D. Laing recanted. He said that his whole philosophy was an attempt to rationalise his manic depression. He was not well mentally himself, but he had a great mind. Throughout history, many people who suffered from a similar illness have been great.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para40"><a name="stpa_123">I appreciate that it is politically explosive to say what I am about to say, but we are now starting to understand that some of our differences are determined by our physiological nature. With the unravelling of the

genome, we now see that some of the problems that we thought previously were just people being naughty or having been badly brought up are the result of genetic problems. During the past few weeks, it is thought that a gene has been identified that is responsible for dyslexia. Furthermore, it may be not genes but hormonal imbalances that determine autistic spectrum disorders. We are now learning that there are physiological causes for behavioural problems, not social causes. It is more nature than nurture. We have to use nurture as best we can to help people to come to terms with their difficulties and lead good, productive and happy lives like the rest of us.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para41"><a name="stpa_124">If we ignore the fact that physiological difficulties stem from nature, we will do people a disservice. It was cruel, but in the past matters were simple; children were beaten until they did what we wanted them to do. We do not beat children any more, and that is absolutely right. However, pretending that children do not have a problem that needs special attention and putting them into mainstream schools in the belief that they will get on with it and be socialised into behaving well is not sensible. It is certainly not kind.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para42"><a name="stpa_125">We must challenge our deep feelings about what is right for a child. Dear friends think that I am a wicked person because I suggest that we should have special schools tailored to specific difficulties and that inclusion is not always the right way forward. Inclusion is certainly not the right way forward for teachers and pupils who are trying to deal with children who have serious behavioural problems in class. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is another variant of such problems. It is common in my constituency. Many parents are tearing their hair out about it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para43"><a name="stpa_126">It is unkind to imply that children misbehave because they have been badly brought up. There are so many cases of children with appalling backgrounds who have turned out to be perfectly nice people. Equally, youngsters with caring, nurturing parents who have done everything for them have still turned out to be difficult. We must accept that factors in those children&#039;s make-up are nothing to do with their experiences. When we recognise that, they can be dealt with properly. Some children are so difficult that they need special schools. Many education authorities still have the ideology that blanket inclusion is the way forward, and that anyone who favours special schools is somehow malevolent and discriminatory, and not a nice person.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"><a name="51129h02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his words. Does he share my concern that 25 per cent. of children with special educational needs in the higher bracket are, as my hon.

to their special education needs are absolutely vital if we are not going to see such people finishing up in prison, mental hospitals or wherever&#151;detained in one way or another. If we can get to them early and provide everything possible to maximise the possibility of a good life in adulthood, we are doing them, and society, an enormous service. The lifetime costs to the state will be much less if we get it right first. That may mean providing places in special schools that are geared to dealing with particular needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para44"><a name="stpa_127">We must stand back and review the matter, and take other people&#039;s advice. Sadly, even in the world of psychiatry, an area about which I know something as well, there is still a big debate about whether mental disorders are to do with experience&#151;nasty things that we see in the wood shed when we are young&#151;or physiological problems. Some think that drug therapies are right; others think that psychotherapy is necessary. Perhaps a combination of the two, appropriately tailored, is the way forward. There are even fierce debates about that, and we must shake ourselves out of our prejudices and consider the problems objectively. We must consider what is happening in the real world, and what really works; we must not presume that pushing children into mainstream schools will be to their benefit. I do not think that it is.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para45"><a name="stpa_128">We must also take into account the parents&#039; preferences. Many parents initially want their children to be in mainstream schools. They start by saying that they do not want their children to be regarded as abnormal, and they want them in a mainstream school. However, over time, they realise that their child is suffering and they want more special provision for them. They may say, &quot;It&#039;s not working. I want them to go to a special school.&quot; I have examples of that in my constituency. The parents&#039; preferences must, over time, be taken into account.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para46"><a name="stpa_129">Finally, we come to the question of money. The fact is that local authorities&#039; budgets are pressured. There is a temptation for them to say that it is cheaper to put children into mainstream schools and put a bit of extra provision into such schools, rather than to provide special places. Public provision is being reduced, so private schools, which are extremely expensive, are opening, taking children from upper-middle class backgrounds whose parents can afford to pay, or from those authorities that are still prepared to pay for special places. However, we need funding for special educational needs to be separated from local education authorities&#039; budgets, so that they are not pressured, and so that decisions can be made objectively, taking account of children&#039;s needs. We should redevelop a network of special schools, capable of dealing with various special needs across the country in the state sector, perhaps jointly run by local authorities, with independent referral systems if necessary. It would be a network of state provision where such children could be given the education that they needed to give them the chance of being happy and productive citizens in the longer term.

Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) for his lucid rendition, which was free of dogma, and just the sort of contribution that is vital to this important subject. I found myself nodding in agreement on many occasions; it was a pleasure to listen to his wise words, which we should all take seriously.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para48"><a name="stpa_131">It is no secret that I am a county councillor and the finance portfolio holder in Northamptonshire; nor that I have grave concerns about the revenue support grant that will be announced in a few days&#039; time. I know that that revenue support grant, which, in the words of the Minister, appears to be less generous than in previous years, will have a sizeable impact on provision for special educational needs. Certainly, in my county, that matter gives rise to great concern.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para49"><a name="stpa_132">It might help if I gave the Minister some background on special educational needs in Northamptonshire. My county has a great record in that respect, not least in relation to sufferers of autism. We have a nationally recognised reputation in that area, of which we are very proud. We take special educational needs very seriously&#151;as we should. Some 3.1 per cent. of our pupils have statements&#151;that is 3,500 children with special educational needs. We try to offer a sizeable range of provision, which in some respects relates to the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire and by the hon. Member for Luton, North. We have 1,000 or so children in maintained schools, 350 with designated special provision attached to mainstream schools, 2,020 in mainstream schools without special provision who are part of the normal process, and 130 in independent or non-mainstream special schools, of whom 80 have residential provision. We therefore have a relatively wide menu of provisions for children with special educational needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para50"><a name="stpa_133">We must also recognise that, as has already been said, many children with special educational needs have other sizeable disabilities, which makes their ability to grasp opportunities in later life much more difficult and makes it equally difficult&#151;but equally important&#151;for us to offer provision to enable them to live a life that they would consider to be fulfilling. Indeed, we have 600 families who work not only with the special educational needs services but with the disabled children&#039;s services. Through those services, we provide for and support families in their own homes. Where we can, we provide respite care, which is a very great need for parents who look after and love children with the needs that we are talking about and with those extra disabilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para51"><a name="stpa_134">We have a family link service, which provides a network for parents who have particular difficulties with their children, and provision for the children themselves. We provide specialised, specifically designed play-schemes and residential placement for children with the most complex and challenging needs within that framework. We therefore try hard, not only to offer a wide provision of care and statemented educational need, but especially to recognise the additional disability which often comes with the need about which we are primarily talking.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para52"><a name="stpa_135">Finally, we recognise that some parents want to take care of their children, keep them out of mainstream education and provide that service themselves. We have 28 families who receive direct payment to arrange their own support in that respect. They are very brave and courageous parents who take a difficult decision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para53"><a name="stpa_136">My sister was a teacher, but she resigned from teaching because she had a boy of 15, now 19, who was in a serious road accident. Although that is not an example of special educational needs, there was a special need and she decided that she wanted to look after the boy. She has taken on a lifetime of service in that respect. I am aware of the range of difficulties, and we in Northamptonshire try hard to meet them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para54"><a name="stpa_137">Our number of out-of-county authority placements is also low. We have six out-of-county placements for every 10,000 people, against an average of 8.3 per 10,000 in the country. We believe that that is right. However, we must make as much effort as we can to ensure that we have good provision in our county, because out-of-county placement is so expensive and crippling to a county council budget when it is not controlled. We have a good record on in-county provision, but we want to do more.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para55"><a name="stpa_138">It is worth recognising how much the service costs the council tax payer in Northamptonshire. Our budget is &#163;4.7 million and rising dramatically for SEN specifically. Together with the &#163;1.7 million for disability, that is a sizeable part of our social services budget. I want to impress on the Minister that it is that part of the budget that is rising most dramatically&#151;I am sure that I do not need to do so, but it is important to highlight that area of concern, because not only is my county under serious pressure with regard to financing such services, there is a general malaise and problem throughout the country that we must face if we want to provide disadvantaged children with the best possible lifestyle chances. There is not one person in the House or the wider world who would not agree with that objective. The problem is how do we provide the resource to do so? Costs are rising dramatically.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para56"><a name="stpa_139">Let me tell hon. Members how out-of-county costs for Northamptonshire have risen in the past three years: in 2002&#150;03  they rose by 16 per cent., in 2003&#150;04 they increased by 8 per cent., and in 2004&#150;05 they rose by yet another 11 per cent. That has a massive impact on children&#039;s services, with which the RSG clearly does not keep pace. Indeed, I wonder whether it can in the present funding framework. This is about keeping pace with need in a world that is becoming ever more complicated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para57"><a name="stpa_140">My county has another problem, because although some 5.6 per cent. of all moneys for SEN and disability with SEN needs comes from the health service nationally, in Northamptonshire we have no contribution. That is another problem that we must deal with. Perhaps we should do so locally and be better advocates for those children with our local health providers. I am not laying the charge at the Government&#039;s door; I am simply saying that the problem exists and that we must do something about it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para58"><a name="stpa_141">Cost is a major problem and I shall highlight it briefly because I do not want to bore hon. Members with statistics. A 38-week placement for a deaf pupil costs &#163;30,000 a year; a 38-week placement for a pupil with behavioural difficulties costs &#163;45,000 a year; a &#163;52-week 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 39WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
placement for pupils with profound and multiple learning difficulties costs &#163;84,000; more special cases may cost &#163;160,000 or &#163;170,000 a year. That has a massive impact on local government budgets that are already under pressure and will be under even greater pressure. The cost of placement in our local schools is lower, mainly because of the non-residential element, and varies between &#163;10,000 and &#163;20,000. It makes sense to try to provide the extra help and support that parents need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para59"><a name="stpa_142">I have described a problem, but we are beginning to see it as a crisis. I fear that this year, the prophesised revenue support grant settlement&#151;we have yet to see whether those prophesies are true&#151;will cause even greater pressure. The truth of the matter is that in my county and many other counties, authorities simply do not have enough money to do the job. I know that every Department hears the plea that there is never enough money, but we are losing the race for SEN children, particularly SEN children with disabilities. We are losing the race.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para60"><a name="stpa_143">We do not receive enough money, because the RSG does not keep pace and we have overspent our children&#039;s budget. Every year, we put it up by a sizeable amount, but we cannot keep pace. We have some success, including with people from different counties, particularly in autism, but that success generates a need for further expenditure, which is difficult to keep up with. The Minister knows that money for placement does not flow into the county for about three years. It takes that long for the process to recognise placement. I see the Minister&#039;s officials looking quizzical, but that is what my county officials tell me and I can only relay what they tell me. Northamptonshire has been a growth county for some years, as have others, and that makes the cash lag worse. It will get worse, because we are an important part of the sustainable communities programme, which will add heavily to our problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para61"><a name="stpa_144">I want to move on quickly because I am taking too much time. I shall not talk about medical science saving more children with severe disabilities, about early intervention being a vital part of the process, or about the fact that less out-of-county care means that more respite care is required for parents, but I want to make a plea to the Minister. We are finding more cost-effective ways of dealing with the problem but we are losing the battle for resources. We need help with our higher costs and our growth agenda and with the delay in funding that I have mentioned. I know that it is hard for the Minister when appeals are made to her&#151;we all recognise the serious need in this area&#151;but I appeal to her to use all her skills with her colleagues in the Treasury to recognise that alleviating the problem is important to the wider community and vital if we are to give these children, many of whom have severe disabilities, the opportunity to enjoy at least some of the lifestyle that we take for granted.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para62"><a name="stpa_145">I turn to the statementing process and the assessment of special needs. Most parents assume that once they have secured a statement everything will move forward smoothly and slot into place, and that everything will work out satisfactorily and favourably for parent and child. In some cases, that undoubtedly happens. Some LEAs are very good indeed at implementing statements and ensuring that the child&#039;s needs are examined and fulfilled. However, I am afraid that, all too often, the reverse is the case. Every MP and councillor and many parents know only too well that that is only the start of the process and that, time and again, they will have to take the case to a tribunal.

<a name="51129h02_para63"><a name="stpa_146">Many constituents have come to me with cases that one would have thought should have proceeded simply, but have not, and they have had to go to a tribunal. I had to take our case to a tribunal because the LEA&#151;which was not Norfolk; I shall not say which it was&#151;did not give us what we needed. Therefore, I know only too well how the tribunal system works. It is not straightforward and the costs are significant; the stress is enormous and the uncertainty is extremely undesirable and unpleasant.

<p><a name="st_114"><a name="51129h02_spnew16"><b> Mrs. Dorries </b> : My hon. Friend is a capable and able person who is intelligent and of means. One main issue is that many parents who do not have such ability or means cannot take a case to tribunal. The chair of the tribunal says that cases cost between &#163;2,000 and &#163;10,000, which puts it out of the reach of people who do not have the advantages of my hon. Friend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"><a name="51129h02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Bellingham </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for not only making a flattering remark but anticipating precisely the point that I was coming to. If people such as ourselves have a child who has special needs, we have the motivation and, probably, the financial muscle to take the case to a tribunal, but the vast majority of parents are not in that position. Dozens of parents have come to me in absolute despair because the statement that they have secured from the LEA is not delivering. Their only way out of the quagmire is to plead with officials or go to county councillors or MPs, or to take the case to tribunal. Very often, the latter course of action is completely beyond their financial resources. The Minister should consider funding for parents to take cases to tribunals because, as far as I am aware, no legal aid is available. Perhaps it should be possible in extreme circumstances for legal aid to be granted to parents. That would be for the Department for Constitutional Affairs to examine in some detail. I would like the Minister to comment on that matter when she winds up the debate.

<p>
<a name="51129h02_para64"><a name="stpa_147">It is not even the end of the process when a tribunal award or recommendation is made, because what it recommends must be implemented by the LEA.

judgment, but others put every possible obstacle in the way of implementation. Parents in my constituency have come to me saying, &quot;Well, this is what the tribunal said but the LEA is not acting on it.&quot; Far from acting on it, in some cases the LEA is extremely difficult, and obstructs the parents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para65"><a name="stpa_148">My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South, who drew on his substantial and wide experience as a county councillor, talked about funding, a matter also raised by the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), who made a very fair and balanced contribution to the debate. Funding is at the root of the dilemma, because every LEA will look at its budget and at what a tribunal may recommend and ask how it can afford the extra revision, time and support that the tribunal may insist on. LEAs know that the only way that they can afford that is by taking money from other services in education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para66"><a name="stpa_149">I think that the hon. Member for Luton, North suggested ring-fenced funding for special needs provision, which the Minister should consider carefully, proactively and with imagination. Drawing on my experience of the many constituents who have come to my surgery over the years, I believe that the problem will not go away until there is some ring-fenced funding for the LEA to make a commitment to parents and families that special needs assistance will flow to the child and follow them to give them the help that they require.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para67"><a name="stpa_150">I am very concerned about the closure of special schools. If those schools close, the present situation will get worse and worse. There are two excellent special schools in my constituency: the Alderman Jackson school, which caters for children with very severe physical and mental difficulties, and the Ethel Tipple school, which caters for children with mild and slightly more serious autistic and learning difficulties who may go into mainstream schools or who may have come from them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para68"><a name="stpa_151">If the Minister visits the Ethel Tipple school, she will see for herself that many of the children will have a chance to go into mainstream education, as many of the parents, and the school, hope that they will. However, some will not; there is a pattern that some children start off in mainstream primary schools, find that they cannot cope in a secondary school and then go across to the Ethel Tipple school where they are given a lot of extra help. The school caters for their special needs in a caring, imaginative environment. If those children stayed in mainstream education they would become disruptive, lose concentration and damage the progress of the whole school. That is why special schools are needed so badly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para69"><a name="stpa_152">I hope that the two schools in my constituency will stay open, but throughout the country more and more of those schools are closing. I am in the same position as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire: I am not in any way against mainstream education, but some children cannot cope in mainstream schools. That is the point.

<p>
<a name="51129h02_para70"><a name="stpa_153">The Minister must respond to the criticism levelled at the Government: why does the White Paper not address the problem relating to the future of special schools?

If it is not working in the mainstream, it is not working in special schools. The Government rightly talk about early intervention. That phrase conjures up the right motives from the Government. Early intervention is essential, yet parents still experience delays of months and even years in getting initial assessments.

<p>
<a name="51129h02_para78"><a name="stpa_161">There are increasingly problems with the text of statements. Local education authorities often word statements imprecisely, with the result that statements do not provide the entitlement to provision that parents expect. Campaigners also point to the huge volume of paperwork that is involved in getting statements. All those factors present a parent of a child with special educational needs with huge hurdles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para79"><a name="stpa_162">I want the statementing system to be reformed. In particular, we must counter the adversarial relationship that it creates between parents and local authorities&#151;parents somehow blame local authorities when funding is at stake&#151;between schools and local authorities and between parents and schools. The teachers are left in the middle. They know the direction in which those children should go, but they are denied the support and the means to achieve that. That was very much the evidence of a recent report in <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i>, in which teachers spoke of the need for special schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para80"><a name="stpa_163">Statements provide a right for children. Local authorities all too often become involved in battles with parents in tribunals. The money argument that the hon. Member for Luton, North raised is all too often the governing motivation. Those scenarios are not as extreme as we might think. We are talking about 3 per cent. of the children of this country potentially being involved in such situations. The Government have to make parents clear on all their rights. We need to consider making the process simpler.
</p>




<p><a name="st_117"><a name="51129h02_spnew19"><b> Kelvin Hopkins </b> : I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s reference to 3 per cent. of children, which represents an enormous number. Would he be surprised by the recent suggestion in a survey that one in 10 of our children suffers from a degree of mental disorder? So, we are talking about a third of those.
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"><a name="51129h02_spnew20"><b> Mark Williams </b> : I am grateful for that intervention. The other telling statistic is that 20 per cent. of children in the mainstream will have some requirement for special needs provision. That is very important.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para81"><a name="stpa_164">The Government policy of early intervention is crucial, yet there remains considerable concern that the resources and the capacity still are not in place. That financial point was made effectively by the hon. Member for Northampton, South. My professional experience leaves me in no doubt that in the mainstream a huge number of children are working at school action and action-plus levels of the special needs register when they should be further up the register and should have access statements. Whether or not that is the position on children with moderate learning difficulties, it is, as we heard, certainly the case for those with severe learning difficulties.

Nevertheless, a policy of inclusion without teacher training and dedicated funding will encounter, and has encountered, considerable problems. Teacher training must improve if teachers are to be able to cope with the unique demands of special needs education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para84"><a name="stpa_167">I remember one of my first few days in a particular school. I was summoned to the head teacher&#039;s office and told that in a few minutes&#039; time I would acquire a little boy who was profoundly deaf. I had no background in sign language&#151;I have catalogued the inadequacies of teacher training, particularly post-graduate courses. I had had no training, and nor was it forthcoming. In time, I was blessed with a special needs assistant and incredibly supportive parents who fought hard to ensure that the terms of the statement were adhered to. There were times when we muddled through, but muddling through was not good enough for that little boy. By rights, he should have had more, and the system let him down.

That is perhaps a way of controlling resources. It leads on to what my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) said, which is that a number of people experience the problem that they need to go to a tribunal because of a lack of flexibility in the statement, particularly if they want to keep their children within the inclusiveness of the school, but they need to pull them down a year and the statement does not allow that.

Such a process would also increase the choice available to parents, an issue on which we campaigned at the election. We believe that choice is important for children with special educational needs. It is important that there is a choice of a mainstream school or a special school and that parents can find the right support for their children wherever they live and do not face a postcode lottery in respect of provision.

<a name="51129h02_para100"><a name="stpa_183">We want choice for parents. As the hon. Lady said, some parents want mainstream education. For many parents, it is absolutely possible and right that their children should be educated in the mainstream, and we support that. It is clear, however, that the population of children with special educational needs is changing. There are increasing numbers of children with profound and complex impairments and learning difficulties. She referred specifically to Asperger&#039;s and autistic spectrum disorders. Local provision has to change to meet those changing needs and it is doing so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para101"><a name="stpa_184">Since the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, local authorities&#151;not Ministers&#151;make decisions about school reorganisations and closures. That is right. They have to secure sufficient schools for the children in their area. They must pay particular regard to the need for the provision of special educational needs. They have to listen to parents and consult. If there are proposals to close a special school, they must be published and consulted on widely, as well as discussed with parents. If there were a dispute, the school&#039;s adjudicator, who is independent of the Government and of the local authority, would make a decision. That is the right way in which to deal with such issues; it is not for Whitehall to revert to type pre-1998 and decree which schools should open and which schools should close. Good as they are at many things, my officials are not in the best position to do that. In local areas, such matters should be decided on the basis of national policies, but decided by local people. That is the current position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para102"><a name="stpa_185">It is true that special schools have closed over the years, as the population of children with special educational needs has changed. Some 234 closed between 1986 and 1997; 122 have closed since then. Local arrangements have led to fewer special schools closing. I should also make the point that special schools often close because they are moved to new buildings or premises or because there is new mainstream provision with attached units. Such provision might be better for some children; they would be close to a mainstream

school and have experience of both types of schooling. The issue is not just one of special schools closing, bad; special schools opening, good.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para103"><a name="stpa_186">However, I accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) and others: special school provision is vital. My hon. Friend referred to ideology; I have never heard him do that before. It is clear that there is ideology both ways in the disability movement. However, in the Government we do not allow that to sway us too much.
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"><a name="51129h02_spnew32"><b> Kelvin Hopkins </b> : The way to find out what happens at local level is to compare what happens in different local authorities. Perhaps different chief education officers have different ideologies and approaches. The Minister might see that in the pattern of references.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"><a name="51129h02_spnew33"><b> Maria Eagle </b> : I see that my hon. Friend really does think that ideology and money drive everything, and perhaps there is a grain of truth in what he says. The point that I need to make is that we do not intend to close special schools. That sometimes happens in school reorganisations, but the law is clear that local authorities must have regard to the needs of special needs pupils and make sure that there is sufficient provision to meet those needs. How that is done will change over time and that is why some of these things occur.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h02_para104"><a name="stpa_187">Before I run out of time, I want to respond to one or two of the points made by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire. She suggested that the schools White Paper and the increasing choice agenda in schools would mean that children with special educational needs in particular would be disadvantaged. She also said that disabled children were being excluded on grounds of disruption or whatever. I do not deny that that happens sometimes; in individual cases, it does. However, under the duties in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which were extended to include schools under the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, it is not&#151;

against disabled people by excluding them on the basis of behaviour arising out of their disability. I am not saying that that means it never happens; I am not naive enough to think that a change in the law is never broken. However, if such an exclusion happens, there are routes that families ought to take to get redress. It is not right to discriminate against a child on the basis of their disability; that is illegal.
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"><a name="51129h02_spnew36"><b> Mrs. Dorries </b> : For the purposes of clarity, I should say that when I made those comments, I did not mean physically disabled children. My comments were made in the context of zero-tolerance behaviour management in the classroom. The education White Paper clearly states that schools are to take a new route towards discipline in the classroom. Children with special educational needs, such as autistic children or those with Asperger&#039;s syndrome, find it difficult to behave in such an environment. That is the context in which I made my remarks.
</p>




<p><a name="st_137"><a name="51129h02_spnew37"><b> Maria Eagle </b> : The hon. Lady is making my point for me. No children should be excluded on the basis of behaviour shown as a result of their disability&#151;that would be a breach of the 1995 Act. I know that she is trying to have a dialogue with me. I have told her that I am saying not that such exclusions never happen because the law has changed, but that they are illegal and that redress is available that needs to be taken up by Members of Parliament, parents or whoever until the teaching profession and others in education realise that it is now against the law to exclude in that way, notwithstanding any push on behaviour in classrooms and schools. Such a push would not justify discriminating against children with special educational needs.

<a name="time_15">
<a name="51129h03_time0"><h5>12.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_139"><a name="51129h03_spnew0"><b> Ann McKechin  (Glasgow, North)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about the Midspan studies, which are centred in my constituency at the university of Glasgow&#039;s division of community based sciences, which has just celebrated 30 years of follow-up studies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para0"><a name="stpa_189">Since the creation of the Scottish Parliament, it is a bit unusual for a Scottish MP to speak here about health issues, but not every aspect of health is devolved. There is significant cross-border interest regulation in the medical professions, terms and pay rates for NHS staff and medical research.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para1"><a name="stpa_190">The Midspan studies are as worthy of analysis by politicians in this place as they are in Holyrood, not least in the debates over the next few weeks as the Health Bill passes through its legislative programme. As I will explain today, I have more than a passing constituency interest in those studies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para2"><a name="stpa_191">The Midspan studies based in Renfrew, Paisley and workplaces in the west of Scotland are the largest long-term health studies ever carried out in predominantly working-class areas and they were, importantly, the first such studies to include women. It is amazing to think that major research into cardiac problems and lung cancer routinely did not include women until this study commenced in the 1970s.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para3"><a name="stpa_192">The driving force behind the studies was Dr. Victor Hawthorne, who entered medicine immediately after world war two and still takes an active role in the studies in his present position as emeritus Professor at the University of Ann Arbor in Michigan. He arrived in Glasgow in the 1950s and recalls that parts of the city reminded him of the deprivation he observed when serving as an artillery officer in India. His future career was to be marked by his work in tackling the persistent pockets of tuberculosis that remained in Glasgow in the late 1950s and taking part in the TB campaign from 1957 to 1959, which involved a large number of volunteers, one of whom was my mother.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para4"><a name="stpa_193">By the late 1950s, the service had identified those populations at high risk and its success in effectively tackling the problem encouraged Professor Hawthorne and his colleagues to extend their gaze to a wider range of chronic diseases and examine a whole population. Based on a small study on the island of Tiree in the Western Isles, and in collaboration with the team behind the famous Whitehall study, Professor Hawthorne&#039;s team developed the methodology that would subsequently be used in Midspan, particularly the use of community involvement. Community involvement was key to the success of the studies and the team chose an ideal location in the towns of Paisley and Renfrew, which are a short distance from the university. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan) is here today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para5"><a name="stpa_194">A total of 23,000 local people have been involved over the history of the studies, which is a wonderful example of civic public spirit and community involvement in an age when it is often assumed to be dead and buried. Both those towns and the Midspan team deserve credit for their efforts. Paisley, my home town, is Scotland&#039;s fifth largest centre of population, but it is often said with 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 52WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
justification that it is also Scotland&#039;s largest village. That is one reason why it wasn&#039;t difficult to get everyone in the town talking about this study. As a young child, I remember the launch of the Midspan project as a huge event in the town, where local people from all backgrounds&#151;but particularly from the working-class areas&#151;were keen to volunteer for a study that they believed would hold real benefit for future generations. The council, the local newspaper, community groups, Churches, as well as local doctors, were all engaged in promoting the scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para6"><a name="stpa_195">My parents, who fell within the 45&#150;64 age bracket being examined, were among the 15,400 men and women who participated at that time. They had their height, weight, respiratory function, blood pressure and cholesterol measured, had an ECT, chest x-ray and tuberculin tine test, and answered questions on smoking habits, social background and previous medical history.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"><a name="51129h03_spnew1"><b> Jim Sheridan  (Paisley and Renfrewshire, North)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin) on securing this worthwhile debate. Currently, I am the Member of Parliament for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North, but at the time of the survey I was at primary school.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para7"><a name="stpa_196">On Saturday, I had the pleasure of visiting the Midspan reunion and it was heart-warming to watch the people who took part in the study some 30 years ago meeting again. I pay tribute to the people of Paisley and Renfrewshire, North for doing that, particularly my hon. Friend&#039;s family, who are well respected in Paisley.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para8"><a name="stpa_197">Can I ask a question about how the survey identified the dangers of passive smoking?
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"><a name="51129h03_spnew2"><b> Ann McKechin </b> : I thank my hon. Friend, and I will come to the issue of passive smoking later.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para9"><a name="stpa_198">Of the original participants, more than 8,000 were women, and there were more than 4,000 married couples involved, making the study unique in providing a general UK population sample of women, and long-term follow up. Although coronary heart disease killed a quarter of the women in the study, women tended not to feature when people talked about their understanding of the disease.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para10"><a name="stpa_199">All the participants were invited for a further visit between 1977 and 1979, in which the same round of tests was used. More than 50 per cent. of the original participants took part&#151;again, a significant tribute to the dedication of the local community. Computer linkage was established for data on Scottish hospital discharge and cancer incidence, and follow-up on mortality figures was established with the General Register Office for Scotland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para11"><a name="stpa_200">In recent years, some survivors involved in the original survey have been re-contacted and asked to take part in studies on healthy ageing and cognitive functioning. We have become much more aware, as medical science has developed, of the generational links to health problems. The Midspan studies had the good sense to include women and, in particular, couples, and that allowed the Midspan team to enlarge its work by looking at the health of the children of the original participants. In 1996, the team, now led by Professor Graham Watt, conducted a similar round of tests involving 1,040 sons and 1,298 daughters aged between 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 53WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
30 and 59 from 1,477 families. I can disclose that I was one of those later participants. Although trying to get blood from me is a real struggle, and although&#151;like most&#151;I am not too keen on the idea of testing, I knew that many could benefit from the study.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para12"><a name="stpa_201">I am impressed that, over such a long time, the Midspan team has been able to achieve such a high response rate. That, in turn, means that their findings are reasonably representative of populations living and working in areas characterised by high rates of socio-economic deprivation and early mortality. For many years, our policy makers lived under the delusion that there was no clear link between ill health and poverty; in fact, I remember well that the previous Tory Administration refused point blank to admit the correlation and the consequent need to prioritise health spending accordingly. The study conclusively proves that link, and it continues to assist us in our understanding of how to tackle the most entrenched health problems affecting our society.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para13"><a name="stpa_202">Of the 150-plus research papers&#151;in a wide variety of journals&#151;that directly use the data, the majority have been produced in the last seven years. I shall give just one example of how the Midspan data shows up the failings of standard risk assessment criteria still in use. Research by Dr. Peter Brindle, working with the Wellcome foundation at Bristol university, published just this month in the British Journal of General Practice, shows that people from deprived areas are less likely to receive medical treatment to prevent heart disease. That is because the method used to assess an individual&#039;s risk of getting heart disease underestimates the true level of coronary heart disease risk associated with elevated risk factor levels in some social groups.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para14"><a name="stpa_203">The recommended way of preventing heart disease involves using the Framingham risk score to identify high-risk patients, but the relevance of the score to the British population is uncertain. That is partly because the US data on which it is based are over 20 years old, and partly because the original study did not include areas with high socio-economic deprivation. The original Midspan survey involved 12,304 men and women who were free from cardiovascular disease at the time of testing. During the next 10 years, 696 died from cardiovascular disease; the Framingham score predicted only 406 deaths.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para15"><a name="stpa_204">Although cardiovascular disease mortality was underestimated across the study population as a whole, for people in manual occupations the risk was underestimated by a significant 48 per cent., compared to by 31 per cent. for people in non-manual work. The same effect was observed when people living in affluent areas were compared to those in deprived areas. Crucially, the Midspan data shows that in addition to scoring systems based on cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking, there is another measurement that predicts how long people will live, namely, how hard they can blow&#151;that is, their lung function. That last test was shown by Midspan to be the strongest predictor of long life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para16"><a name="stpa_205">In the light of the report, can my hon. Friend confirm whether her Department will consider adjusting national agreed clinical guidelines to take account of those higher risks? If that is done, what additional 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 54WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
resources will be provided to general practices to treat, monitor and review the additional patients to ensure that they receive the benefit of life-saving treatments?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para17"><a name="stpa_206">My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan) mentioned smoking. The Midspan results show that lung function was decreased by smoking, air pollution and poor childhood circumstances. I am sure that, in the light of current debate, the Minister will be interested to know that Midspan was one of the first studies to demonstrate the harmful effects of passive smoking by examining the health of non-smokers living with a smoker. Passive smoking cast a long shadow, not only in terms of increased coughing, chest pain, lung cancer and heart disease deaths in non-smokers, but also through reduced lung function of the non-smoking offspring of parents who smoked, which is a prediction of reduced lifespan spreading down generations. Perhaps in her response my hon. Friend. can give some indication of how her Department intends to tackle the problem of the home environment in relation to passive smoking, which is likely to be the main indoor location for smokers after changes in legislation, both here and in Scotland. In particular, what efforts can her Department make to highlight the effect on children&#039;s health of passive smoking in the home?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para18"><a name="stpa_207">As for generational changes in health, the good news is that the Midspan offspring had greater social mobility, smoked less and were taller, which is another predictor of longer life. The bad news is they had twice the rate of asthma and obesity, with the horrific statistic that obesity affected one in five adult sons and daughters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para19"><a name="stpa_208">I am delighted to highlight the excellent work of the Midspan study at Glasgow university and thank Professor Watt for his assistance in providing me with information about the research results. However, the history that I have outlined shows the importance of funding long-term research to ensure that our health priorities are made on the basis of reliable, relevant and up-to-date statistics. That data take time to bear fruit; most of the information coming out of this particular study has been of use only in recent years. Sustained investment and engagement with our communities is required.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para20"><a name="stpa_209">I urge the Government to commit themselves to tackle the deep-seated causes of socio-economic deprivation by continuing to fund such work and ensuring that its conclusions are put into action in as we deliver a health service fit for the 21st century.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
particularly when one is asked to come back for monitoring at various periods of one&#039;s life. It must be especially daunting for mums and dads to be asked whether their children will form part of the project. That is a sensitive and difficult area, and the stark reality of the link between poverty and ill-health is hard for families to cope with&#151;knowing that one is in poverty and finding out that that links to the health of oneself and one&#039;s family. I am sure that my hon. Friends and you, Mr. Cummings, agree, that a Labour Government understand this issue more than any other. The driving force of all the pioneers of the 19th century who tackled issues of public health and working conditions led to the formation of the Labour party.
</p>




<p><a name="st_143"><a name="51129h03_spnew3"><b> Jim Sheridan </b> : On the question of working conditions, my hon. Friend will be aware that, in many working-class communities, the participants in Midspan were involved in using products such as asbestos. Even today, they and their families are suffering the consequences. On that basis&#151;and on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, South (Mr. Alexander)&#151;I invite the Minister to meet some of the participants in the Midspan project so that she can see for herself what has been happening.
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"><a name="51129h03_spnew4"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : I am interested in that because there are some lessons to be learned across the United Kingdom from the work that is being carried out. I hope that my hon. Friends, the people who took part in the project and the people running it are reassured that the Government are keen to tackle health inequalities. My constituency, Don Valley, is a former coal-mining constituency. I see all the people who come forward with their coal-mining health claims for vibration white finger and respiratory disease. There is no doubt about   it&#151;the consequences are generational. The consequences of unemployment are also a problem for health. However, we are learning more and more about those links. In addition to the Midspan project, we have what we learned from the Black report in 1981 and the Acheson inquiry in 1998, which we set up to look at the links involved in health inequalities. That has shaped our thinking in England and in Scotland, as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para22"><a name="stpa_211">As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North indicated in her speech, there was a time, not long ago, when we could not even discuss the idea of health inequalities in public. The approved phrase was &quot;variations in health&quot;. I am glad to say that since 1997 we have been able to face up to the realities of health inequalities across the United Kingdom&#151;partly because of the research evidence generated by this and other projects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para23"><a name="stpa_212">As my hon. Friends have said, the Midspan project has had an interest in systematic, long-term studies, including of the health of middle-aged people in deprived areas. Alongside other work, it has highlighted the necessity for policy to be underpinned by sound evidence. I am afraid that that is even more necessary in Scotland than in England. The health consequences of deprivation are stark in terms of the impact on life and lifestyle, and on life expectancy. The latest figures show that average life expectancy at birth is almost three years longer for men in England than in Scotland and almost 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 56WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
two years longer for women in England than in Scotland. Eight out of 10 areas in the UK with the shortest male life expectancy are in Scotland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para24"><a name="stpa_213">We need to share the research and learn about the key issues across the UK and elsewhere that provide important lessons for us when it comes to delivering policy. In identifying the policy, we need to think about what sort of practical delivery should be happening on the ground. A lot of work has been done in Glasgow, for example. Record levels of resources have been put into the Greater Glasgow NHS board. We are talking about more than &#163;1 billion this year. The Glasgow Centre for Population Health has been established. It will help to consider action to improve health and to tackle health inequalities in Glasgow and the rest of Scotland. As in England, the information and the studies are being used to try to provide practical, long-term solutions to improve the situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para25"><a name="stpa_214">We have tried to reflect that work in the health inequalities themes of our EU presidency. All the home countries have worked together to promote the issue, most notably at the presidency summit last month. We hope that we will continue to inform ourselves on good practice and on the work that is being done across the UK and the European Union, and we will share that information so that we can have a discussion that lasts beyond our presidency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para26"><a name="stpa_215">In England, we have been trying to develop a cross-Government approach to improving health and tackling health inequalities. We hope that a national health inequalities target for 2010 on life expectancy and infant mortality has helped us to galvanise action in that area. A national health inequalities strategy, the programme for action, has engaged partners on the health inequalities agenda across Government and elsewhere. Scotland has the prevention 2010 initiative, in which the issues will be considered in a more serious and concerted way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para27"><a name="stpa_216">There are three key lessons to be derived from the work. There is the need to lay bare the evidence. That is the first step in challenging the assumptions that exist in many communities about ill health and chronic disease and about their being the norm for people in early middle age. There is also a need to revise expectations about what constitutes a healthy life. I hope that that will encourage changes in the way in which health and other services are delivered and used. In England in particular, we are considering the link between health services and local government in tackling health inequalities.

<a name="51129h03_para28"><a name="stpa_217">As times change, we have to adjust to the changes in people&#039;s lifestyles and the way in which they work and live. As the Minister with responsibility for public health, I am concerned with the issue of diet. In some respects, our diet in the 1940s was better than the diets today of some in our poorest communities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_147"><a name="51129h03_spnew7"><b> Ann McKechin </b> : I am sure that my hon. Friend will welcome the initiative of Glasgow city council&#151;unfortunately it has the worst health statistics in Scotland&#151;to give free fruit to primary school children and set up breakfast clubs in primary schools in an effort to tackle diet and its links with ill health in children. Poor diet is also a major cause of ill health in later adult life.
</p>




<p><a name="st_148"><a name="51129h03_spnew8"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : I certainly do welcome that initiative. In parallel, there is a scheme in England that supplies fruit and vegetables to children in schools. I am pleased to say that just this week in Devon and Cornwall we have launched a reform of the welfare food scheme, which will for the first time give parents from lower-income families vouchers to exchange not just for milk or infant formula but for fruit and vegetables. Importantly, in order to be part of the scheme many families will have to discuss nutrition and food with their health visitor or midwife. We are taking the earliest opportunity to address the health of pregnant mothers and their children, which leads to the work we are doing in schools with free fruit and vegetables, breakfast clubs, after-school clubs and that important meal in the middle of the day. We have an opportunity to get that right in the next few years, I hope.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para29"><a name="stpa_218">We have recognised that we can target intervention on some of our poorest communities. In England, we have the Spearhead group of 70 local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators. They are leading our work in this sphere by testing out different ways in which we can reach communities. Earlier, the identification by GPs of patients&#039; health problems was referred to. We are looking at better ways of reaching those who are not coming forward to GPs in communities, as well as considering the way in which people are treated when they visit GPs and the sort of things GPs should be looking out for. A point was made about clinical guidelines, and England has separate ones from Scotland, but I shall write to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North on that issue from an English perspective.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para30"><a name="stpa_219">In the spearhead areas, we are focusing on deprived and vulnerable groups and examining the health needs of the over-50s in particular. That group is crucial if we in England&#151;it is probably the same in Scotland&#151;are to meet our 2010 target because of the differences in the health and life expectancy of men and women of this age in spearhead areas and in the rest of the country. I am pleased to say that we have seen some startlingly good work in some spearhead areas that has already had an impact. Services and how they are received have been considered and they are getting better in providing a health service that is fit for purpose.

<p>
<a name="51129h03_para31"><a name="stpa_220">We shall need extra effort in the spearhead areas, such as the new health training scheme announced in the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper, to support local people by improving health and preventing diseases such as cancer and coronary heart disease, and by providing support for the management of people&#039;s health when they have had treatment in one of those areas. That is an important part of the process as well. Identifying the post-treatment support that will enable people to take advantage of diet and exercise, which will make treatment sustainable and allow it to work for longer, is also an element of the process. There is the matter of prevention, but people can change their lives even if they have had a heart attack or cancer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para32"><a name="stpa_221">My hon. Friend referred to clinical guidelines. We try to consider the best available evidence of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. I have heard what she has said, and I shall make some inquiries. In Scotland, clinical advice is provided by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para33"><a name="stpa_222">We have announced extra support for primary care for many of the spearhead areas. In relation to obesity, we are discussing guidance and support for GP practices and health professionals to engage with people about what can be a sensitive issue. We are also getting better data about obesity levels among children in schools. We are working through that, and there will be more information on it in the months ahead. In Scotland as well, schools and weight management in schools are being considered.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"><a name="51129h03_spnew9"><b> Ann McKechin </b> : May I add to that equation the issue of alcohol, which is also included in the Midspan data? The relative cost of alcohol has made it much more available throughout our society, but it has had a detrimental effect on health. I am sure that that is the same in England.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"><a name="51129h03_spnew10"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : Returning to our founding fathers, one of Kier Hardie&#039;s five ambitions was to ban the sale of alcohol. I think that we covered four of his ambitions, but not quite that one. However, my hon. Friend makes an important point. Children learn from parents. Alcohol is one aspect; smoking is another. From some of our evidence, we know that the likelihood of children smoking is greatly increased if their parents smoke. With alcohol, we need to send out messages that explain how it contributes to one&#039;s long-term health.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para34"><a name="stpa_223">I have watched a couple of episodes of a programme called &quot;Honey We&#039;re Killing the Kids&quot;, which gets in a couple of parents and, using computer technology, analyses their children&#039;s health profile to show the parents&#151;not the children&#151;what their children could look like aged 40, if eating, exercise and learning issues are not tackled. The programme is quite thought-provoking for parents. I am pleased to say that it gives some simple steps that any parent can take to improve things. We preach, but too often we set goals that are difficult for families to deal with in one go. They need some simple steps to take.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para35"><a name="stpa_224">We are concerned about smoking throughout the UK. Smoking is the biggest cause of avoidable death, and we have run adverts&#151;the campaign about children has been particularly effective&#151;about smoking in the home and in the car. I am afraid to say that even if 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
people pull down the window in the car, they are not thinking about what is happening to baby in the car seat in the back. We are trying to do some more work on that. In England, we are launching a major quitting education campaign to extend the work of smoking cessation services, particularly in deprived areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para36"><a name="stpa_225">I saw an article describing how some young mothers felt that if they smoked, their baby would have a low birth weight and the birth would be less painful. We must find out how people think about such matters and what they are prepared to do. We can do that only if people are responding to the health service. We must investigate the reasons why some people act on health advice and others do not. That needs some radical thinking.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h03_para37"><a name="stpa_226">I am pleased that we have had the opportunity to discuss the matter. There is more work to be done. I have no doubt that smoking proposals throughout the United Kingdom will have an impact during the next few years. Importantly, within our deprived communities, services must be fit for purpose, meet needs and not only provide information about what constitutes better health; if we are to make real inroads, we must go beyond that. We shall make more advances in the 21st century only if we base our work on the major advances that we made in the 20th century.

<a name="51129h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Civil Service (Northern Ireland)</h3>
<a name="time_17">
<a name="51129h04_time0"><h5>1 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_151"><a name="51129h04_spnew0"><b> Mark Durkan  (Foyle)</b>  (SDLP): Civil service employment and procurement is probably not normally the most riveting of subjects; however, in Northern Ireland when there was devolution, probably the most frequent question that I faced as Minister for Finance and Personnel throughout constituencies, and across parties in the Assembly, was about how the Northern Ireland civil service would make moves to decentralisation. People across all parties recognised that there was a gross over-concentration of civil service employment in the greater Belfast area. In that context the Executive established an accommodation strategy review, which was aimed not just at getting a one-off round of decentralisation offers from Departments, although we asked for that, but at creating a permanent policy framework that would take long-term account of the changing strategic accommodation needs of the civil service and would build in a clear preference and possibility for decentralisation into that policy. That was the shared policy goal of the Executive and the Assembly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para0"><a name="stpa_227">Well over three quarters of civil service jobs in Northern Ireland are concentrated in Greater Belfast. Most of the jobs in other locations are there only because there is a need for local offices in those areas. The only attempt at decentralisation during the periods of direct rule&#151;there were none during the life of the old Stormont regime&#151;was in the early 1990s when a few hundred jobs were transferred or decentralised to Derry. That was sponsored by Richard Needham who was then a Northern Ireland Office Minister. It was meant to be the first wave of an ongoing policy of decentralisation, but basically the civil service shut up shop thereafter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para1"><a name="stpa_228">It is not just in terms of civil service employment that we face a picture of geographic inequality in Northern Ireland. It comes through in practically every sector of employment. Recently the Equality Commission produced &quot;Fair Employment: A Generation On&quot;. Chapter 6 of that report contains several maps which show the distribution of economic inactivity across different districts in Northern Ireland, in terms of sickness, of jobs within a 5 km radius and a 15 km radius and the changes in job numbers. It shows the distribution of new employment as well as the distribution of employment and long-term unemployment. Map after map shows in a very graphic way a picture of inequality and disparity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para2"><a name="stpa_229">If we are to be true to the Government policy of trying to achieve balanced regional development in Northern Ireland and equality in Northern Ireland, those maps set out the depth and strength of the challenge. Anyone who claims that a strategy to deal with inequality and unacceptable disparities in Northern Ireland can be location blind cannot be serious about tackling and reversing the picture of inequality as it stands, where it happens and where it hurts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para3"><a name="stpa_230">It is for that reason that the statutory equality commitment is placed on all Departments under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as a result of the Good Friday Agreement. It is for that reason that we have policies of targeting social need. The Government are meant to be committed to ensuring that in everything they do, in all that they spend and all that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 61WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
they set out to do, they think about equality and achieving equality outcomes. This is about thinking social need, targeting social need and reducing social need where it bears down hardest on people. That is what those policies are meant to add up to. They are not just token declarations. The test of those policies comes when particular decisions are made in relation to public expenditure, public procurement and civil service employment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para4"><a name="stpa_231">I referred to some of my experiences as Minister of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland in the power-sharing Assembly under the Good Friday agreement. As well as setting up the office accommodation strategy review, the Executive also agreed at my behest to set up a public procurement policy review. Among the issues that we tried to test and establish in the review was how far wider public policy factors could be considered in the context of the procurement process, and what latitude there was in standard Government guidelines and EU law to give some weight and consideration to policy commitments such as targeting areas of social need, targeting the long-term unemployed, and in respect of the environment and equality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para5"><a name="stpa_232">The advice that I as a Minister received from the civil service was that such matters could have no part in public procurement consideration. But the independent experts that we appointed to the review established that the civil service advice was nonsense, and that it was consistent with EU legislation to give due weight and consideration to such factors, provided that the outcome was not anti-competitive and that the way in which the issues were addressed did not of itself prevent firms or areas from making offers or being able to compete fairly. We established in that review that intelligent consideration could be given to wider Government policy commitments, and that we needed to be able to do that if Government policy commitments were, in fact, to mean anything.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para6"><a name="stpa_233">However, I have since learned from various direct rule Ministers that they were never briefed on the review. The current Minister with responsibility for finance and personnel did not know what I was talking about when I asked him about it only a couple of weeks ago. He said that such matters are not for Ministers. If a public procurement review established by a power-sharing Executive is not a matter for Ministers, I do not know what is.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para7"><a name="stpa_234">I want to come on to a particular procurement project, but first I note that this team of Ministers recently made announcements about an exercise called Workplace 2010. I know that some other parties, and certainly some other party leaders, have expressed misgivings about selling various Government properties and leasing them back, which is the Government&#039;s intention so far. Those properties accommodate the bulk of the civil service. My point to the Government and the current Minister with responsibility for finance and personnel is that those buildings should not be sold on the basis of leaseback. Instead, the Government should tell the market that they will sell them on the basis of leasing accommodation elsewhere if the people who come in with bids for them can either directly provide accommodation elsewhere or can broker provision through somebody else.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 62WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para8"><a name="stpa_235">Such an initiative would open up potential for decentralisation. Areas in and around Belfast would benefit if buildings that are locked up with civil service occupants were occupied instead by people who could bring other multipliers to the premises, and other areas would be able to compete. The property market across Northern Ireland would be stimulated and challenged to come up with offers to accommodate civil service jobs. Only something like that will open up the real potential of decentralisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para9"><a name="stpa_236">When I discuss decentralisation in that context, clearly I am talking not just about my own constituency but about the whole of the north. Decentralisation does not have to be at Belfast&#039;s expense. The alternative uses that those buildings could be put to would, obviously, bring benefits to Belfast as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para10"><a name="stpa_237">The procurement project that I wanted to touch on is the Government electronic human resources contract for the Northern Ireland civil service. That project has been running for a long time. Indeed, it was meant to be at best and final offer stage in the second half of 2004, but it did not get there until summer this year. There have been various delays in and around the process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para11"><a name="stpa_238">Recent interest in the matter followed publication of a peculiar statement from the Department of Finance and Personnel on 19 October, which indicated not that it had appointed a preferred bidder from the two remaining bidders but that it would talk to one bidder, Fujitsu Services Ltd., on the basis that it hoped to bring it forward as the preferred bidder, leaving aside the other bidder, Accenture. There has been a lot of public interest since then and a lot of misinformation, some private and some public.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para12"><a name="stpa_239">The Fujitsu Services bid included itself, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Capita. The procurement process, which has a history, had a pre-qualification stage back in September 2003. The companies that came through that were Logica with PricewaterhouseCoopers, Accenture with BT and Oracle, and Fujitsu with Capita and Baxter Neumann. Logica withdrew and before that PricewaterhouseCoopers had to withdraw from the Logica bid because Government sources suggested that it was inappropriate for PwC, as Logica&#039;s auditor, to be in the bid with Logica. After pre-qualification&#151;if pre-qualification means anything, surely it means that recognition is given to companies as they are at the time&#151;PwC asked to join Accenture&#039;s bid. Accenture sounded out the Government on whether that would be appropriate and was advised by a Government official that it would be problematic for a number of reasons. PwC is now part of Fujitsu&#039;s bid and Baxter Neumann has left the bid. It creates a strange impression of exactly what pre-qualification was all about if bidders could chop and change, re-jig and hop between beds. Were the new consortiums subject to any re-qualification criteria?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para13"><a name="stpa_240">That is not the only question arising from PwC&#039;s role. I am not hostile to PwC and recognise the quality of its work for many good firms and Departments and the good public money that it receives for that work. However, PwC has been advising a number of Departments on their e-business strategies and that work continued during the procurement process. Its advice to seven Departments has included reference to their e-HR requirements. PwC is an adviser to Departments on e-business requirements and e-HR at the same time that it is bidding for an e-HR contract. We 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 63WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
are told that we can rely on Chinese walls. I have never believed in Chinese walls. It is not enough when dealing with a major public procurement contract&#151;a pathfinder, the like of which has not been done before in Northern Ireland or elsewhere&#151;to rely on the flimsy assurance of Chinese walls. It can be seen in documents that PwC has been involved in helping to anticipate budgets for e-HR for the civil service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para14"><a name="stpa_241">The assurances that we are being given now&#151;that any advice provided by PwC to the Department of Finance and Personnel was provided before the contract came up&#151;do not stand up. We are told that it could be coincidence that PwC won all the contracts with Departments, but many of the civil servants with whom it is dealing on the e-business strategy contracts are also on the project board for the e-HR contract. It is working directly with and has the confidence of the civil servants in those Departments who are sitting on the project board.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para15"><a name="stpa_242">I cannot accept that there are no prima facie issues of conflict of interest. When I was a Minister in Northern Ireland the ministerial code was clear about conflict of interest and that action should be taken not just when there was a conflict of interest but when there might be a perception of a conflict of interest. The civil service has not acted in that way in this regard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para16"><a name="stpa_243">Some people in the recent controversy surrounding these issues have suggested that my interest in the matter is as MP for Foyle, representing the city of Derry, and that Accenture, the company that has not been currently negotiating with an eye to going into preferred bidder status, had indicated that it would locate the jobs in Derry. Fujitsu indicated that it would locate in Belfast. The Government said that the process had to happen in a location-blind way. If so, why do the best and final offer requirements include that people have to say where the jobs are to be located? If it is location-blind, why do firms have to provide security assessments and guarantees in respect of their sites and locations? That was taking place back in June.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para17"><a name="stpa_244">There is a Derry interest in the matter, and not just because Accenture was proposing to take the contract, if it wins it, to Derry. As I indicated earlier, Derry benefited from a small decentralisation effort in the early 1990s, which included the recruitment service of the Department of Finance and Personnel. That service will, in effect, disappear, with the out-sourcing that will result from e-HR, so Derry will lose those jobs. Other out-sourcing initiatives, and other changes&#151;some are being pursued by Government as a result of a review of public administration&#151;will also threaten the other jobs that were decentralised to Derry in the early 1990s. That was recognised, yet the Department of Finance and Personnel claims now that there are no issues about location. In its equality impact assessment document&#151;the consultation document; it never produced a final document&#151;the Department said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;There could be particular consequences for non-mobile staff and the recruitment branch located in Londonderry where there is a high percentage of Roman Catholics, women and young people.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 64WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para18"><a name="stpa_245">It goes on to say what the impacts might be on other groups:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;As a result of the analysis of data and research and assessment of impacts, we have identified a concern about the impact of the policy&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;on employees in the recruitment branch in Londonderry. The issue of additional public sector jobs for Northern Ireland is the focus of work currently being undertaken by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and Invest Northern Ireland following publication of the Lyons review, which recommended the dispersal of public sector jobs from the south-east of England. Londonderry is considered to be the principal location for this type of investment and this would be an extremely beneficial element of any redeployment plan.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para20"><a name="stpa_247">There we have, in that consultation document, the Government telling us, &quot;Be assured, we recognise the potential impact this has on Derry. Be assured, Government, in the context of the potential jobs that could come from England in the Lyons review, are particularly trying to favour Derry.&quot; However, we are being told, in relation to Northern Ireland civil service procurement, that there can be absolutely no indication of a preference or allowances made for any particular locations. As I said, we never got a final analysis of that equality impact assessment. However, what we got recently in a letter to Derry city council from the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance and Personnel, in response to why there has been no outcome to the equality impact assessment, and why the contract is now proceeding apace and is about to be allocated, was:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;We acknowledge that the public has the right to know the outcome of the equality impact assessment and there is a general public interest in the openness and transparency of the operation of Government. However, there is no final EQIA in existence. In carrying out the public interest test, the Department took into account that it intends to publish the EQIA and expects to be able to do within the next three months.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para21"><a name="stpa_248">And this is a contract that is about to be offered, possibly tomorrow. It goes on:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;The draft EQIA remains a working document and to release it now would inhibit the development of the draft and the orderly administration of the process.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para22"><a name="stpa_249">That is an insult in terms of the public confidence issues involved, which involve civil servants taking decisions on the project work and their relationship with some of the companies that are bidding. I am not going to go into the issues that have already been brought to the Department&#039;s attention, such as the fact that people in PwC were able to quote the price difference and all sorts of other figures that they should not be in possession of.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para23"><a name="stpa_250">A senior figure at PwC said that Fujitsu was not committed to putting the jobs in Belfast and that it would talk to me about putting them in Derry. He said that he would get back to me. I have never received such a telephone call. It was clear to me, however, that the idea of Chinese walls inside PWC is not robust, when one of its senior figures was making approaches to me about something in which he was not supposed to be involved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para24"><a name="stpa_251">This major contract has not been subject to an independent peer review. A Gateway review has been conducted at several stages, but I do not regard that as having the status of an independent peer review. A Gateway review is due in December. I have asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to change the

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para25"><a name="stpa_252">None of us, no matter where we are located in Northern Ireland, want major procurement exercises conducted in a shambolic way, with equality impact assessments hidden where people do not accept scrutiny. Yes, it can all be put down to the coincidences of a small society, but since the controversy started on 19 October, another coincidence is that a series of documents that were available on websites have now disappeared. The Department of Education&#039;s e-business strategy has disappeared from the website. Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment documents have been altered. Parts of the Department of Finance and Personnel&#039;s equality impact assessment, from which I quoted, have been removed from its website. The Northern Ireland civil service information system strategy appendices have been dropped. That all may be a coincidence, but such matters only corroborate the many suspicions that people have something to hide. Ministers should challenge such matters and not hide behind the assumption that the civil service can be trusted and relied on for everything that it does.

<a name="51129h04_para28"><a name="stpa_255">The hon. Gentleman referred to the need for fair play. He is right, but to ensure fair play demands regulations. While I have complete understanding of the case that he makes, he must understand that it is also an obligation

on the Government to ensure that fair play meets the regulations that are laid down to ensure that it can take place. As for the specific issue of the particular project of the e-HR procurement process involving Fujitsu and Accenture, I shall deal with one or two of the points he made. However, as I said, he has left me little time to cover them in detail. I hope that he will understand why I shall have to write to him to answer all his questions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para29"><a name="stpa_256">The contract procurement process has some history. It dates not from September 2003, but January 2003 when the requisite notice was first published in the <i>Official Journal </i>of the European Union. Let me remind the hon. Gentleman that such criteria can be lawfully included only if they are linked to the subject matter of the contract, do not confer an unrestricted freedom of choice on the authority, are expressly mentioned in the tender documentation or the tender notice, and comply with all the fundamental principles of community law, in particular the principle of non-discrimination. Location was a matter solely for the bidders in determining the most economically advantageous solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para30"><a name="stpa_257">Best and final offer responses from the two bidders, Accenture (UK) Ltd. and Fujitsu Services Ltd., were evaluated using objective qualitative and quantitative criteria, which were made known to the bidders. On 19 October, it was announced that the evaluation was complete, and as a result the DFP intended to enter into further discussions with Fujitsu Services Ltd. with a view to it being selected as preferred bidder.I should like to emphasise to the hon. Gentleman that the procurement process has been extremely robust and has followed best practice as recommended by the Office of Government Commerce and the DFP, including gateway reviews.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para31"><a name="stpa_258">On the role of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has been mentioned in this debate and elsewhere in the media, I should like to state clearly that PwC has not provided any consultancy or other role in respect of the e-HR programme since its initiation. I am assured that the question of a conflict of interest does not arise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para32"><a name="stpa_259">On the issue of equality, I can confirm that an equality impact assessment has been carried out on the policy of e-HR which relates to the provision of human resource services for the Northern Ireland civil service and the Northern Ireland Office. An equality impact assessment consultation document was circulated for consultation in 2004, and the process of finalising the report continues. The DFP is satisfied that it has fully discharged its legal obligations in relation to the Northern Ireland Act (1998) and its statutory equality scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para33"><a name="stpa_260">Finally, I can confirm that the discussions with Fujitsu Services Ltd. are continuing and at this stage no preferred bidder has been selected and the contract has not yet been awarded. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate, therefore, that any procurement process in Northern Ireland must adhere to, and be consistent with, European law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para34"><a name="stpa_261">Taking all those factors together&#151;I remind the hon. Gentleman that we have considered them carefully&#151;while it may disappoint him, the Department is entirely satisfied that the procurement process for this significant project was robust and adhered to EU requirements.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para35"><a name="stpa_262">On the wider question of the location of civil service jobs that was raised, Ministers are fully committed to considering the dispersal of civil service jobs where opportunities arise and where value for money can be demonstrated. Current dispersal policy is that it should be linked to accommodation planning, but that it should also have regard to other policy imperatives, such as the new targeting of social needs and the regional development strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para36"><a name="stpa_263">I appreciate the concerns that the hon. Gentleman raises about the relocation of jobs. While some 65 per cent. of NICS staff in the 11 Departments&#151;nearly 18,000 civil servants&#151;are located in the Greater Belfast and North Down area, a further nearly 35 per cent., or about 10,500 staff, are located elsewhere in the Province.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para37"><a name="stpa_264">The outcome of the review of public administration, to which the hon. Gentleman referred and which was announced by the Secretary of State last week, will clearly have an impact on the wider distribution of public sector jobs. I would expect significantly more jobs to move out across the Province as a result of the changes, not least within the new health and education authorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h04_para38"><a name="stpa_265">In conclusion, we take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns and demands seriously. We are concerned about any question of whether or not a robust procedure applied throughout this, in particular the specific issue that he raised. I would simply say that the Department is satisfied that we have met our obligations. We take them and the issue of equality extremely seriously and we are determined that, where possible, more jobs will move out from Belfast across the Province, ensuring greater equality and addressing the issues of inequality in employment.

<a name="time_19">
<a name="51129h05_time0"><h5>1.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_153"><a name="51129h05_spnew0"><b> John Robertson  (Glasgow, North-West)</b>  (Lab): May I say what a pleasure it is to have you in the Chair today, Mr. Cummings? I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury is replying to this debate. He was good enough to attend the meeting that I organised on this subject a few weeks ago. I know that he will use a constructive approach, listen to the concerns felt by me and many other hon. Members, and furnish me with the answers that I seek.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para0"><a name="stpa_266">I would like to begin by telling a couple of stories that illustrate why I became involved in this issue. I will then fill in the background on the work done in the fight for free cash machines, and finish by saying what I want to happen, and by putting a series of questions to the Minister.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para1"><a name="stpa_267">A constituent in Yoker in my constituency came to see me, and told me what had happened to him. He received a benefit payment of &#163;41, and later he went to his nearest ATM in Dumbarton road to take out some money. That ATM is just round the corner from his flat, so he did not have to travel far. He put in his card, but although he had &#163;41 in his account he could not withdraw the &#163;40 that he had requested because the machine said that he had insufficient funds. At that point, he took more notice of what the cash machine was saying, and he discovered that there was a charge of &#163;1.75. That meant that he would be 75p short of &#163;40. In the end, he was allowed to withdraw only &#163;30, because it was necessary to withdraw sums in multiples of &#163;10. My constituent was rightly upset at being allowed to take out less than 75 per cent. of his money, but he was more upset that the cash machine that was nearest to where he lived was no longer a free machine; without public notice, it had become a fee-paying machine.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para2"><a name="stpa_268">My second story is about a corner shop in the Knightswood area of my constituency. The shop used to provide a free cash service to its customers, many of whom are elderly as there is a large elderly population in the area. The shop did that as a service to its customers, but it also did well out of that, because when people came in to get some money they bought goods at the shop. Therefore, the shopkeeper was in a win-win situation, until an ATM man visited him and explained that if he installed one of his machines he could charge &#163;1.75 every time that somebody took out money. The shopkeeper installed a machine, and thus the service that he gave to his local customers was no longer free; they now had to pay &#163;1.75 for the honour of buying goods in his shop. Fortunately, another shop has opened nearby, which does not have a charging cash machine, and I have noticed that it has been used a lot more than the other shop. Needless to say, the owner of that shop was persuaded by the ATM company to agree to the deal on the grounds that he would make money, and that the sums received for the use of the machine would be his.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para3"><a name="stpa_269">That was the point at which I decided that I had to do something about this matter. I tabled some early-day motions, and I want to read them out, as they tell part of my story. My first early-day motion was number 451 of 10 January. It was
</p>

<ul>&#163;1.50  per withdrawal; further notes that fee-charging ATMs are disproportionately located in poorer areas where few people can afford to travel to free alternatives; is concerned that this is a particular problem for people whose state benefits are paid into their bank accounts, and who are therefore charged simply for receiving their benefits; is disappointed that the Royal Bank of Scotland has not done more to alleviate this problem since it acquired Hanco, which operates around a quarter of all fee-charging ATMs; concurs with the Citizens Advice Bureau and the National Consumer Council, who have criticised the Royal Bank of Scotland for effectively levying a tax on the poor through their actions.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para4"><a name="stpa_270">It goes on further to attack the Royal Bank of Scotland.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;That this House views with concern the increasing number of fee-charging ATMs in post offices; notes that up to 78 per cent, of ATMs in post offices now levy a surcharge; is concerned that many people on fixed and low incomes rely on ATMs for access to their state pensions or benefits.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;the major suppliers of ATMs to the Post Office are the Alliance and Leicester and Hanco; and calls on the Post Office, the Alliance and Leicester and Hanco to guarantee free withdrawals from ATMs in post office premises.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para7"><a name="stpa_273">The use of fee-charging ATMs is an attack on those who can least afford it. They are also often sited in areas where the elderly draw their pensions and where people draw their benefit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para8"><a name="stpa_274">After the general election, on 5 July, I tabled early-day motion 417, which was

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;That this House expresses its concern that nearly half of all cash machines charge a fee for withdrawal; notes that five years ago almost all cash machines in the UK were free, and believes that this trend represents a real and current threat to the UK&#039;s network of free cash machines.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="51129h05_para10"><a name="stpa_276">With that, I shall move on from my early-day motions. I note that other hon. Members have tabled early-day motions on the same subject.
</p>




<p><a name="st_154"><a name="51129h05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jim McGovern  (Dundee, West)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) on securing this debate and on the fantastic work that he has done in campaigning on this issue. I agree with him entirely about the disproportionate impact on those on low incomes. Does he also agree that there is a double whammy, inasmuch as people on low incomes tend to withdraw smaller sums and therefore the percentage of      the withdrawal that the fee represents is disproportionate?
</p>




<p><a name="st_155"><a name="51129h05_spnew2"><b> John Robertson </b> : My hon. Friend highlights a problem that is well known. If I withdraw &#163;20 and am charged &#163;1.75 for it, that is a much greater proportion than if I withdraw &#163;100 and am charged &#163;1.75. That is unfortunately what occurs with people who have little money, because they withdraw only the money that they need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para11"><a name="stpa_277">Moreover, the siting of fee-charging ATMs attacks the poor. There is no competition because the banks have closed and moved their premises into areas where there are many people, such as town or city centres or areas where there are shopping complexes.

longer go to the former small shopping areas where the shops have now closed, such as Anniesland Cross, which used to be the centre of my constituency and where everything that was anything in the area happened. Anniesland Cross is now a very quiet place, and the banks have closed up and moved. Unfortunately that leaves only fee-charging ATM machines.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para12"><a name="stpa_278">I asked the Deputy Prime Minister, when he was substituting for the Prime Minister, the very same question. I received the usual sympathy that we get at Prime Minister&#039;s questions. Unfortunately, not much has happened since then.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para13"><a name="stpa_279">I also made a submission to the Treasury Committee&#039;s when it was drawing up its Fifth Report of Session 2004&#150;05 on cash machine charges. I gave the Committee a Glasgow view of the problem&#151;the problem that I have laid out to hon. Members today&#151;using the facts and figures that I had at my disposal at that time. I made some recommendations, and I will be interested to see whether the Minister will care to consider those or even take them up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para14"><a name="stpa_280">My first recommendation was for a code of practice that would build on the Link agreement on early warnings. In other words, if someone complained enough, they could go to Link and it would look at the problem. Nationwide has developed that idea; the Minister and I went to a reception that it held to launch its idea of red and green stickers. A green sticker would mean a free machine, and a red sticker a fee-charging machine. The one thing that has been missing that I have been trying to get is up-to-date information from the banks that can be verified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para15"><a name="stpa_281">I shall read out a few recommendations in the report; perhaps the Minister could comment on them. In its conclusions, the report mentions regulation and the banking code. It says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;There is a lack of openness about the way LINK rules are decided and there is no comprehensive enforcement of the LINK rules on transparency . . . cash machines need to be brought within the Banking Code so that the system of voluntary regulation is responsive to the needs of consumers and is effectively enforced.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para16"><a name="stpa_282">The report goes on to talk about the financial exclusion, and says:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;Cash machine charges may have a disproportionate impact on low-income consumers&quot;&#151;</p>

<p>
</p>

<a name="51129h05_para17"><a name="stpa_283">the very comment that my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern) made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para18"><a name="stpa_284">The report goes on to mention post offices, and a pet hate of mine. The Government did a lot to change the way in which pensioners receive their pensions when they did away with pension books, and we have encouraged people to get bank accounts, but now when people want to withdraw money, they get charged for it. The recommendation on the role of post offices said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;75% of cash machines in post offices charge a fee, and consumers are paying over &#163;10 million a year to use these machines. A number of factors may have been involved (including the Direct Payment programme). This runs counter to the Government&#039;s policy goals of tackling financial exclusion and improving the quality and efficiency of public services. There is a need for a fundamental change of strategy: the current arrangements are not in the best interests of sub-postmasters, benefit recipients or the local community.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para19"><a name="stpa_285">During our meeting the other week, some information was given out by Nationwide, and I have also received information from Link. Nationwide says that between September 2004 and September 2005, the number of fee-charging machines increased by 16 per cent. and the number of free machines was reduced by 0.3 per cent. The proportion of charged transactions has increased by nearly 40 per cent. since the Treasury Committee&#039;s report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para20"><a name="stpa_286">According to Nationwide, if the UK has the same trends as the United States, the proportion of charged transactions will go up from 3.6 per cent. to 40 per cent. by 2007. We should remember that the banks are using our money and are charging us to retrieve it. Link has contacted me; it disagrees with some of Nationwide&#039;s figures. It disagrees about the number of free cash machines&#151;there is a difference of 600 between the two bodies&#039; figures&#151;and on percentage numbers, but if the total numbers are considered, the difference between their figures is less than 1 per cent. However, that emphasises the need for the Government to take the lead and ensure that there is an open and accountable review of standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para21"><a name="stpa_287">Can the Minister tell me how the banking industry can be regulated on cash machines? Is there a place for more than a voluntary code of practice and a general Office of Fair Trading eye on banking? There has been a worrying trend of high-street banks selling off their cash machines&#151;which are free&#151;to charging companies. HBOS sold 816 machines to Cardpoint, Abbey sold 50 to Moneybox, and Alliance & Leicester is reported to have appointed Citigroup to explore selling its ATM network. Those sales and possible sales must be looked into, and I ask the Minister to look into those companies, and others like them who are misrepresenting themselves as free cash machine operators while selling them off to charging companies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para22"><a name="stpa_288">I understand why Alliance & Leicester would want to sell its cash machines off, as it already charges at post offices and the publicity is damaging to it. Its 600 charge machines in post offices are a disgrace&#151;an attack on pensioners in particular, and on the less well-off, who use their post office either because it is the only one in town or because it is nearest to home.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para23"><a name="stpa_289">The Royal Bank of Scotland is probably the worst example of double standards, but it is only an example of a growing trend. It makes a big play about its ATM coverage and the fact that its machines are free to customers, but it forgets to tell us about its purchase of Hanco. Surely there is a need for more than a code of practice. If a company can get away with that, what chance is there for the ordinary customer?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para24"><a name="stpa_290">Citizens Advice has been in touch with me and asked for the following suggestions to be considered. It said that ATM charging should be restricted and possibly capped, that machines should display warnings before a card is inserted&#151;although labelling would solve that&#151;and that all current card holders should be able to withdraw cash over the counter at post offices without having to pay.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para25"><a name="stpa_291">What does the Minister believe is the correct role of the Government in regulating cash machines? Does he believe that the state has a responsibility for ensuring 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 72WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that everyone has access to money, irrespective of income or geographical location? What recent assessment has the Minister made on the effectiveness of Link rules on signage? Would he at any point deem self-regulation to be ineffective and further Government intervention to be required? In what circumstances would he consider the direct regulation of the retail prices of the machines? Do the Government have the power to impose that, or would further legislation be required?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para26"><a name="stpa_292">I hope that I have been able to give the Minister an understanding of the problems of a constituency such as mine, which has a large number of elderly people&#151;around 17,000&#151;two social inclusion partnership areas and many first-time buyers. Such people&#039;s needs and aspirations should not be determined by whether they can afford to withdraw their own money from an ATM. People should not be charged to get their own money, particularly by a company that uses it to make even more money but gives its depositors a fraction of what they are entitled to. The Royal Bank of Scotland alone made &#163;3.7 billion in profit in the first six months of this year. It is reckoned that next year, ATMs will charge consumers &#163;250 million, which is a drop in the ocean for the banks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para27"><a name="stpa_293">If we, the investors, had a say, we would not be charged for withdrawing our own money.

Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) on securing this debate and on the work that he has done on these issues nationally, and, as we have heard today, in his constituency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para30"><a name="stpa_296">The Government believe it essential that the ATM industry should be as competitive, transparent and efficient as possible. We therefore see cash machine charges and the ATM market as important areas of public policy. We welcome recent interest during 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>29 Nov 2005 : Column 73WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
debates on these matters and the Treasury Committee&#039;s recent inquiry into cash machine charges. Without any doubt, withdrawing cash from the hole in the wall is the most common method of cash acquisition by consumers. In 2004 alone there were more than 2.5 billion withdrawals, an increase of 155 million withdrawals over 2003. An APACS figure shows that ATMs supplied more than half of all cash to individuals, and that 32.9 million adults were regular ATM users.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para31"><a name="stpa_297">I shall outline some of the principles of the Government&#039;s position. People should be able to access their cash for free, especially those on low incomes, but like the Treasury Committee, we also believe that charging cash machines are a legitimate business model. There are more than 20,000 charging cash machines in the United Kingdom, the majority being new machines in locations where previously there had been no cash machine. Most are in places where there are few transactions and where a free ATM would not be commercially viable. That is shown by the average number of withdrawals per day at different types of ATM. APACS figures show that in 2004 there were on average 204 withdrawals per day at each bank or building society ATM, virtually all of which are free, compared with an average of 19 withdrawals per day at independently operated ATMs, most of which have a surcharge. However, I stress that when charges are applied, we strongly insist that they should be transparent, so that consumers can make an informed choice about whether to use that ATM.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para32"><a name="stpa_298">What are we doing in response to hon. Members&#039; concerns? We are considering two areas of work: first, in our response to the Treasury Committee&#039;s recent report on cash machine charges, we reaffirmed our commitment to monitor the ATM market closely, and we continue to do so. The Treasury maintains close contact with Link and receives regular updates on developments. Secondly, it is hugely important that vulnerable and low-income consumers in all communities can access their cash for free. As hon. Members know, financial inclusion is a very important priority for the Government, which is why, when we monitor the ATM market, we also examine the impact of charges on vulnerable and low-income consumers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para33"><a name="stpa_299">It should be remembered that ATMs are not the only way for people to access their cash for free. All basic bank account holders, and many current account holders, can withdraw money for free over the counter at the post office. For example, in December 2004, approximately &#163;30.5 million was withdrawn for free over post office counters. Many banks, including Barclays, Lloyds TSB, Alliance & Leicester, the Co-operative Bank and recently Nationwide, signed contracts with the Post Office to enable their customers to use post office counters for cash withdrawals.

Overall, more than 93 per cent. of people in the United Kingdom live within one mile of their nearest post office. Cash back is also increasingly available in supermarkets and shops, and benefit recipients can have their benefits paid into accounts at credit unions. However, we would&#151;and should&#151;be concerned if people on low incomes incurred a disproportionate cost in accessing their money. That is why work is focused on discovering the evidence base for that contention.

Among other things, that work will identify the extent to which fee-charging ATMs are disproportionately used by the financially excluded. The results are due next year and, depending on the outcome, we will consider which further steps may be appropriate. I hope that that will reassure my hon. Friend. I expect him to maintain the pressure on the Government when that information becomes publicly available.

<a name="51129h05_para36"><a name="stpa_302">It is important to put the debate in context. There have been improvements in the ATM market over the past five years; we welcome the fact that the industry has been opened up to independent operators. It has brought greater competition to the market and has led to a substantial increase in the number of cash machines in the UK; there are now well over 50,000 ATMs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para37"><a name="stpa_303">At the time of the Cruickshank report on competition in UK banking in 2000, people using the ATM of a bank other than their own were likely to have to pay. Each bank generally had agreements with only some of the other banks to offer free ATM withdrawals to their customers, and if people made a withdrawal at a bank other than their own they risked being charged. The charges were complicated, opaque and discriminatory. Consumers frequently did not know whether they were being charged and found out only when they searched their monthly statements. The charges could be set at between &#163;1 and &#163;1.50. However, the latest Link figures show that there are now more than 32,000 free ATMs in the UK and 96 per cent. of cash withdrawals are free.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para38"><a name="stpa_304">The number of ATMs in non-bank branch locations has also increased by 2 per cent. in the past year. Virtually all banks and building societies now offer free ATM withdrawals to other banks&#039; customers, and the banks have abolished card-issuer charges for Link cash withdrawals. That is all a great improvement in the situation. Consumers now have a far greater choice of ATMs that they can use for free. They do not have to hunt around for an ATM belonging to their own bank.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para39"><a name="stpa_305">Let me be clear that, at this stage, we are not convinced that free cash machines are under threat. However, it is equally important to state clearly that we will remain vigilant. My hon. Friend asked about regulation, codes of practice and so on. Vigilance from a Government point of view means that we stand ready to take appropriate action if there is any evidence that it is required. Public policy has moved forward as a result of pressure from the Government and hon. Members.

Financial inclusion is central to the Government&#039;s commitment to creating a more economically vibrant country and a fairer society. If putting financial inclusion at the heart of that commitment is jeopardised by what we find when the evidence emerges, we will be obliged to consider the most appropriate response. My hon. Friend will be one of the first people with whom I discuss what action would be appropriate.

<a name="51129h05_para40"><a name="stpa_306">It is still vital that we argue for the maximum possible transparency. People must be able to make informed choices about whether they should use a particular ATM. We believe that there have been significant improvements in transparency. Link agreements have banned double charging, which means that a customer cannot be charged by both their card issuer and the ATM operator. New Link rules in place since July are a good step forward for increasing transparency. They have introduced stricter requirements on the location and size of signs&#151;that relates to another point that my hon. Friend made. A clearly visible warning sign must be on the machine itself. It must be at a normal eye-line, of at least font size 14 and must state that the machine will charge for Link cash withdrawals. All surcharging ATMs must also carry a message in the idle sequence specifying the exact amount of the charge, and any other signage directing people to a surcharging ATM must warn that it will charge. The font size, the colour and the background must be such that the message is clearly visible to anyone reading the sign.

Treasury Committee was right to raise the issue of enforcement of Link rules. Sadly, we are aware of examples of charging ATMs that do not display the required signs. I welcome the Link agreement last year to strengthen sanctions for non-compliance. We are pleased to note that a Link-commissioned independent survey to monitor the situation is already under way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51129h05_para42"><a name="stpa_308">In conclusion, let me make this clear: free access to cash is vital, and a transparent, fair and easily understood market is more than desirable&#151;it is the level playing field that our citizens deserve. We also have a responsibility, of course, to be proportionate in how we deal with the matter, but we must be steely in our resolve to ensure those most in need and most at risk of exploitation do not suffer as a consequence of decisions that are made. That is why I said earlier that we are considering specifically the challenges facing people on low incomes, including the disproportionate costs of ATM charges.

<a name="51129h05_para43"><a name="stpa_309">Let me end by saying to my hon. Friend that I welcome his continued campaigning on the issue. The Government will continue to work with him and the Treasury Committee on these matters&#151;
