               <b>Dr Thérèse Coffey (Suffolk Coastal) (Con):</b>
 It is a pleasure to be speaking under your chairmanship, Mr Turner. I thank Mr Speaker for granting this important debate on BBC local radio. I should declare an interest: I used to work for the BBC, although not in the field of broadcasting.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_1"> 
               <a name="110405h0001.htm_para1"> 
               <a name="11040557000012"> I also thank the 66 Members of Parliament who have signed early-day motion 1593 on the topic. I appreciate that not all Members of the House choose to sign early-day motions, and some have a policy of not doing so, but I assure you, Mr Turner, that the support I have had from Members of all parties has been extraordinary in the desire to keep what is special about the BBC—that, firmly, is local radio.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_2"> 
               <a name="110405h0001.htm_para2"> 
               <a name="11040557000013"> The BBC spends about £600 million on radio—just under a fifth of the licence fee income—of which about £137 million is spent on local radio in England. That equates to about 3.2p per user hour, half that for Radio 3 and less than for Radio Scotland, Radio Wales, Radio Ulster and Radio Foyle. I am not complaining about the amount of money spent on Radio 3 or the nations’ radio stations, but I reflect that BBC local radio in England is rather good value, reaching the number of listeners that it does.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_3"> 
               <a name="110405h0001.htm_para3"> 
               <a name="11040557000014"> BBC local radio reaches about 7.4 million listeners across its various stations, including—for the particular attention of Members—2.5 million people who do not listen to any other BBC radio station. It is reaching out to that 40% of listeners who do not listen to Radios 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, and it is important to remember that.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_4"> 
               <a name="110405h0001.htm_para4"> 
               <a name="11040557000015"> The remit of BBC local radio is deliberately focused on two areas. The first is to ensure that the breakfast and drive-time shows are 100% chat and news-driven, which is what they do, and rather well, especially Radio Suffolk. At other times, a minimum of 60% chat is required. That leaves space for commercial radio to have distinctive programming, in particular music-driven, which brings in attractive advertising slots that reach a younger demographic. The 55-plus generation like to listen to music, but perhaps not the type that drives all advertising on local radio. The second important point about the people reached by BBC local radio is that it captures not only the 2.5 million who do not listen to other BBC radio services but a substantial number of the C2, D and E social groups, broadening the BBC’s reach, in contrast perhaps to the national radio stations.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_5"> 
               <a name="110405h0001.htm_para5"> 
               <a name="11040557000016"> One of the six values of the BBC is to celebrate community moments—“national moments” as the BBC calls them. That is where local radio truly excels, such as the Proms at the Albert hall being taken to the local celebration party, or the royal wedding coming up on 29 April. I cannot tell you how many wedding parties there will be in Suffolk, but they will be covered by people  <br/>

               <a name="11040557000017"> At the moment, distinctive radio is broadcast outside the breakfast and drive-time shows. That can vary, such as local sports coverage. How can I put it? Leiston FC probably would not get commentary on Radio 5 Live, even though they are about to win their championship and get promoted into the Ryman league premier division, but somehow I think that only matters to the people of Suffolk who express an interest in sport. Other examples include the local phone-in programmes—we can talk about post office issues relevant to the local area. There are so many examples, which I am sure that many colleagues will offer today.</p>
            <p>

               <a name="11040557000018"> BBC local radio has done some things of which I think it could do more, such as reducing the content of the website. There is space for local media to expand, in particular in Suffolk. I might surprise colleagues when  I tell them that I have three daily papers covering my constituency, which can do that because they are local and focus on local stories. There are also opportunities to expand the training to community radio stations which, again, all Members value in their constituencies, but they are not a substitute for the excellent output we all enjoy from BBC local radio.</p>
            <p>

               <a name="11040557000019"> I am sure Members are not surprised that I will now focus on BBC Radio Suffolk. One of the important things to say is that there is a 22% reach to adults throughout the county. More important, Radio Suffolk is truly fulfilling the 50-plus generation remit, because it now covers one in three adults listening to that radio station.</p>
            <p>

               <a name="11040557000020"> Running through some of the presenters, Mark Murphy in the morning is a must-listen for anyone and everyone. I am sure he will send an ugly mug to anyone who name-checks him today, but, importantly, he has a lead role in campaigning for BBC Suffolk. I have already mentioned in the House, to the Prime Minister, how BBC Suffolk was behind a great campaign in which the people of Suffolk raised more than £3 million to build a children’s hospice, very much helped by the radio station. Other, more pertinent local issues include “Bin a Blade”: in the first three weeks of the BBC’s publicising the campaign and working with the local police, more than 1,000 knives were put into safe bins. That is the reach of the BBC in motivating people and getting that conversation going about some real local issues.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_10"> 
               <a name="110405h0001.htm_para10"> 
               <a name="11040557000021"> James Hazell has, I believe, the second most popular radio show on BBC Suffolk, but he is in the very time slot that the BBC wishes—is considering, I should say—to move to Radio 5. That would be a big mistake, because on the local phone-in, James Hazell—our equivalent of Victoria Derbyshire—really hits the issues that matter for Suffolk.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_11"> 
               <a name="110405h0001.htm_para11"> 
               <a name="11040557000022"> Lesley Dolphin in the afternoon goes the extra mile. She might have been following Chris Moyles, but she also went up Kilimanjaro and raised more than £60,000 for charity. She continues to have that light touch that people enjoy listening to, perhaps while gardening or doing their crossword. Stephen Foster is a non-miss; he does the news round-up in the evening. My friend, Rob Dunger, would kill me if I did not mention him, but his business breakfasts on Saturday mornings really bring to the listener who is up and about important news of the day and that friendly chat.</p>

               <a name="11040557000023"> Many good examples of BBC local radio will be given today, but the reason I wanted the debate was to stand up for the licence fee payer. One of the things that worries me about the BBC’s review process is that the licence fee payers have not been asked for their opinions or thoughts. By contrast, the Arts Council, which has made difficult choices in the past week, set out open and transparent criteria and the process by which it would make choices on which organisations it would fund. I have not seen any of that from the BBC so far, and I should have.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_13"> 
               <a name="110405h0001.htm_para13"> 
               <a name="11040557000024"> I am not one to make cheap political points about choices, and talent on the BBC deserves to be paid well, just as it would be in the commercial market, but the BBC needs to look at some of the more sensitive issues it faces in London with some of its talent, such as flying production teams from Scotland to London to accommodate a presenter, or how it manages its staff and talent. A report in <i>The Guardian</i> talked about how the BBC misses out on £80 million a year because of how it manages staff.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_14">

               <a name="11040557000025"> I went on a training course for human resources. This was no secret, but was said to everyone in the BBC who attended that course: unfortunately, due to poor controls, the BBC paid out more than £6 million to fixed-term contractors who no longer worked at the corporation but who, for some reason, had never had their contract stopped on the payroll. The BBC corrected that—I commend it—and I thought I would never bring the issue up, but that is half the budget of BBC local radio.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_15"> 
               <a name="110405h0001.htm_para15"> 
               <a name="11040557000026"> There are opportunities for the BBC to look at its internal bureaucracy to understand where the money is going. It found one source, and was able to turn off the tap of funds, which was well done, but even on my last day at the BBC, I was arguing with another project manager about a three-week delay, because that team had not got their act together, and they were trying to block our project going ahead. I was challenging them and saying, “You cannot make this decision. We need someone senior to make this decision, because your delay will cost the BBC £12 million.” I know many programme-makers who would give their right arm for £12 million to spend on programmes at the BBC, including many radio stations throughout the country.</p>

               <a name="stpa_16">

               <a name="11040557000027"> It is important that the BBC makes savings—I know that, I get that. I am a member of the party in government and I realise that not every decision will be popular, but one of the BBC’s core values is to reflect what its audiences want. I call on it to look hard, think hard, and speak to licence fee payers. That is why it has audience councils. I am not aware that they have been consulted on some of the ideas, or come forward with their own, but it is important that the BBC continues to listen. It is a wonderful institution and something I cherish. I thoroughly enjoyed my time working for the BBC. It sometimes frustrates me, but it is wonderful and it needs to keep what is special. What is special, especially to the people of Suffolk, is BBC local radio.</p>

It was the country’s second local radio station to go live, and it now broadcasts not only to south Yorkshire, but to the north midlands. The signal can be picked up as far afield as the west of Manchester, the north of Leeds, and as far south as Leicestershire. In November 2010, it was voted station of the year at the prestigious Gillard awards. For us, the station is as south Yorkshire as a Barnsley chop or  the famous Henderson’s relish that goes with it. It is the radio station that people tune into to listen to local news or to talk about local matters.</p>

 I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey) said. I fully endorse all the comments that have been made about the news, programmes and so on, but does my hon.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and I shall refer to the role that Radio Sheffield played during the floods that afflicted south Yorkshire in 2007.</p>

               <a name="11040557000032"> Radio Sheffield’s morning breakfast show is hosted by the archetypal south Yorkshire man and “Phoenix Nights” comedian Toby Foster, who can raise a smile on anyone’s face. He brings together music, sports, local news and national news with a local interest, and does so in a light-hearted, informative and entertaining way that works with his audience. Other presenters, including Rony Robinson, Howard Pressman, Paulette Edwards and Dean Pepall, are much loved and provide a familiar voice in the homes of people in our area. That is important, especially for the elderly and those who live alone. The demographics of Radio Sheffield listeners tend towards the older end of the age profile, and it is important to bear that in mind; we do not all want to listen to hip hop or rap on Radio Hallam.</p>

               <a name="11040557000033"> Regular phone-in programmes, to which the hon. Member for Suffolk Coastal referred, are hosted throughout the week on Radio Sheffield, and allow local people to have their say on national and local events. At the moment, it runs at least two phone-ins a day, but it would not be able to do that if the proposals were given the go-ahead.</p>

               <a name="11040557000034"> Radio Sheffield really comes into its own when something of local importance happens that may not be of interest to the national media or remains important long after the national media have moved on to other things. A good example was the floods of 2007, which badly affected my previous constituency of Sheffield Hillsborough. For a brief period, the national news focused almost entirely on Sheffield, but after a few days the focus, probably rightly, moved elsewhere.</p>

               <a name="11040557000035"> However, for the people of south Yorkshire the nightmare of flooded homes and streets continued, and a year later the people of Cumbria suffered the same problem. Radio Sheffield played a massively important social  <br/>

            <p>role in ensuring that local people knew what was going on—when electricity would be restored to homes, when streets would be cleaned, when traffic lights would be working and where people could go for help when they had lost everything because their homes were full of water and they had nowhere to go. Without that service, it would have been much harder for people to come to terms with the tragedy of those floods.</p>

               <a name="11040557000036"> Another immensely important role for our local radio station is its role in local sport. I was intrigued to hear the comments of the hon. Member for Suffolk Coastal about local football coverage, because the same can be said in south Yorkshire. Unfortunately, for the time being, not one south Yorkshire team is up there with the elite in the premiership. That will happen one day, although it will take time.</p>

               <a name="11040557000037"> Without local coverage, many of the area’s football teams would have no coverage at all. Radio Sheffield’s commentary team will travel, for example, to Exeter to cover a league one game involving Sheffield Wednesday. As a Wednesday fan, I must admit that Radio 5 Live will not cover Exeter versus Sheffield Wednesday on a Tuesday night, which is shameful. It is also certain that the national media will not be interested in reporting a game between Barnsley football club and Doncaster Rovers, but such a game is of massive importance to the people of south Yorkshire, because it is a local derby and they want to hear about it.</p>

               <a name="11040557000038"> During the week, Radio Sheffield provides a daily “Football Heaven” programme hosted by the commentary team, which includes Paul Walker, Seth Bennett and Andy Giddings. All three are now involved in national as well as local commentary, because the quality of their commentary is so good. They learned their trade in BBC local radio. The importance of “Football Heaven” and “Praise and Grumble” on Saturdays is that that is where ordinary fans have a chance to vent their anger, frustration and even, occasionally, their praise for their local football teams, although more often than not they are angry and frustrated. Let us also remember that for many years local radio has been the springboard for much of the country’s broadcasting talent, without which tomorrow’s Nicky Campbell and Simon Mayo will not enjoy the same opportunities to learn their trade. The country would be the poorer for that.</p>

               <a name="11040557000039"> Radio Sheffield is running a trial for merging local radio into regional radio provision in the afternoons. I do not like that, and the people of Sheffield do not like that. I like to hear about my own area in the afternoons, not about dancing dogs in Leeds or York. I want to hear local news, and that is why I tune into the station. The move to replace all local radio stations with national Radio 5 Live for most of the day would be a retrograde step that people throughout the country will resist. Radio Sheffield was set up 44 years ago because local people wanted to hear local news and local stories. To reduce that service at a time when technology has made local reporting even easier and more immediate is wrong and should be resisted.</p>

 I start with a tribute to the BBC, and a thank you. Apart from two years spent floating up and down on the waves as a pirate disc jockey, I learned my broadcasting with Radio London, which gave me the greatest opportunity I have ever had. It took me on as a young, inexperienced, microphone-trained-but-nothing-else broadcaster, and turned me into a radio journalist. I was given the chance to cut my teeth, to make mistakes, to broadcast hour after hour, and to learn the hard way what broadcasting is about. That is where I want to start.</p>

               <a name="11040557000044"> First and foremost, BBC local radio is now effectively the only speech-based local radio service in the country, and it provides a superb training ground for young broadcasters. If that service is taken away, I do not know how people will learn real broadcasting and radio journalism skills without that platform. Local radio is vital to the future of broadcasting, and it should not be underestimated in the way that the craven, metrocentric, television-based management of the BBC currently tries to treat it.</p>

The hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith) expressed the second point that I wanted to make very well. When it comes to local issues and emergencies, to crisis time or to relatively regular and simple things such as schools closing due to snow, people turn to their local BBC radio station for information. For news about floods and other disasters, people turn to BBC local radio because that is the only real source of local information.</p>

               <a name="11040557000046"> I recall the 1987 hurricane when everything went down but people still had battery-powered radios. The whole of Kent was incredibly badly affected by that hurricane, and people tuned into Radio Kent. After a night of violent storm that ripped our county apart, I recall broadcasting at 6 o’clock in the morning through a radio telephone—as it was at the time—to Radio Kent to offer help and blankets to elderly people in my constituency, and to ask people to contact us if they knew of any elderly people who needed heat and light. Members of Parliament from all parties could not have mounted that operation had it not been for that genuinely local outlet. Local radio is a vital service in every county.</p>

 That is a fair point. BBC local radio is still the only truly speech-based radio service. The hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge made a point about local sport in her speech. BBC local radio covers local football and cricket matches, and some of the best cricket commentary in the country is provided by John Warnett from BBC Radio Kent, who comments on Kent’s county matches at the St Lawrence cricket ground. He would be an asset to “Test Match Special”—I have suggested that to him, although it would be a great loss to Radio Kent if he were to move to network radio. Those local broadcasters know their local teams, sports and adversaries, and they cover and present a word picture in a way that national broadcasting simply cannot. We will not get that service anywhere else.</p>

               <a name="11040557000050"> I am huge admirer of Radio Five Live and think it is a great service that was an enormous and brave innovation. The management of the BBC at the time—I doubt whether today’s management would have had the balls to do it—created something very special, and I would not take one iota away from it. However, it is not the local radio service that BBC local radio provides, not only—this is where people get so dismissive—at breakfast time or “drive time”, but throughout the day. Local radio continues through the phone-ins and the local gossip. It is parish pump radio—coffee shop tittle-tattle for the county, and it matters to people.</p>

               <a name="11040557000051"> My final point is that the BBC wastes an enormous amount of money. I have been a BBC producer and director; I have done the job and I know where the money goes. Last August, I was on holiday in France and due to return to the United Kingdom the following day, which was a Saturday. The BBC rang me and asked whether, after sending a taxi for me to Kent, they could fly me from Heathrow to Belfast to spend a night in a hotel, and five minutes on a sofa on Sunday morning to talk about a cat in a dustbin. I worked out that the cost of that exercise would have been over £1,000 for five minutes of broadcasting.</p>

The programme could have been made just as easily in Hong Kong, and probably more cheaply. The BBC has wasted £1 billion creating MediaCityUK, as it is called, in Salford Quays, and I would like to know why. What is the point of transferring the “Blue Peter” garden from White City to a rooftop in Salford?</p>

 I accept that entirely. The BBC has a long and proud tradition of regional broadcasting centres. Manchester is one, Birmingham and Newcastle are others. Bristol has probably the finest natural history service in the world bar none. I do not take anything away from any of the work done regionally by the BBC—that is not the point.

I do not suggest that the director general of the BBC is not a terribly important person because I am sure somebody will convince me that he is, but there is a huge amount of waste. When the Minister responds, I would like him to direct the BBC, perhaps through its new chairman of the trustees—Lord Patten, I hope—to areas other than this candle-end of a cut, which is miniscule in terms of the BBC’s finances. That candle-end shines a real light into the ordinary everyday lives of local people up and down the country, and I want it to continue to burn.</p>

Unfortunately, tragedy has been an all-too-common occurrence in Liverpool in the recent past, and there is sometimes the need for a local voice or slant on something that has been misreported. For example, in 1989 the scurrilous newspaper, <i>The Sun</i>, defamed and disparaged Liverpool supporters, and the city needed someone to stand up for it. Radio City and Radio Merseyside both did that, and Radio Merseyside more than most. With its phone-in and its afternoon presenter, Roger Phillips, the station is not just a local voice but a friend who goes into people’s homes, and who people know will not be judgmental. They were prepared to use the phone-in programme to express not only their anger, but their grief.</p>

Although people can phone national phone-in programmes, they are unlikely to do so from somewhere such as Merseyside, where people have that parochial feeling and sometimes think that the national slant on certain stories about our great city does not reflect the feelings of the people.

I did freelance shifts at BBC Radio Cleveland, which is now called BBC Radio Tees, and I also did some shifts at BBC Radio Leeds. I experienced at first hand the importance and the localness of BBC local radio. I was sent off early in the morning in the BBC local radio car, which was a little Fiesta with a wobbly aerial on top, and I would go to the place where something was happening and try to get people to talk about it.

That is an increase of 700,000 listeners on the previous year.

            <p>children, but I had BBC Radio Leeds on, and Paul “Oggy” Ogden was commentating on Huddersfield at Tranmere. He actually lost his voice as he screamed the commentary on the second goal, scored by Novak, at Tranmere, which was another vital win for Huddersfield Town. Ogden is a local lad—he lives down the road from me—and it is that passion that we get from BBC local radio.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very good point. The “Meet Your MP” slot lasts an hour and is all speech; there is no music. It is a mixture of people going out and about and interviewing people about issues. We do not know what the questions will be, and we get the time to give proper answers rather than just soundbites, so my hon. Friend has hit the nail on the head.</p>

               <a name="11040557000069"> We have heard about the value of BBC local radio in a crisis or at a time when people are worried. On my patch, there were very heavy snowfalls in the last two winters. Although it did not make for compelling radio, parents and guardians were glued to their radios as presenters read out the list of 380 schools that were closed. That was done on a half-hourly cycle, and I know how valuable the service was. The listenership was probably the highest ever. It was just list upon list of schools. The parents or guardians were worrying about whether they would have to take a day off work to look after the children; the children were jumping for joy when they could go sledging and throwing snowballs. That is the kind of localness that we get from BBC local radio.</p>

I was on the lunchtime phone-in show recently, and the presenter kept thinking she was still in Sheffield, even though she was broadcasting across the Yorkshire region. The BBC is examining that already but, as has been shown, it does not necessarily work. BBC local radio needs to be local. We have heard in other recent debates in this place that we must protect the front line. There is nothing more front line than BBC local radio, so I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will pass that message on from all of us here today and that the BBC will listen.</p>

BBC staff are rightly being asked to contribute ideas about how to achieve those savings as part of what the corporation calls “Delivering Quality First” workstreams—“workstreams” is a great BBC term—and recommendations will be made to the trust this summer. I suppose “Delivering Quality First” is an exercise in flying a few balloons, and I genuinely pay tribute to the BBC for flying them, but I doubt whether it wanted the particular balloon we are talking about to fly quite as high and as publicly as it has.</p>

I have spoken to some members of BBC management, and I understand their frustration at the fact that “Delivering Quality First” is seemingly such a leaky progress. My advice would be that that is not all bad; there are many benefits to the fact that these issues are being discussed publicly. We should have more of that at the BBC.</p>

I may be critical of the nearly £100 million overspend on the redevelopment of Broadcasting house and I may wonder whether that money could have been used better—we have already heard examples of where savings could have been found—but when I say that I accept that there is a challenge, I also accept that there must be some changes. I accept that there must be changes to BBC local radio as somebody who has worked in it and seen it from the inside. Those changes might be not only necessary, but desirable. If it is done correctly, “Delivering Quality First” could be a big opportunity for BBC local radio.</p>

One example from my part of the world is the future of Southampton airport, which is expanding rapidly. That is a regional story, which would be owned by BBC Radio Solent, but it would clearly be of interest more widely to listeners in Sussex, Surrey, Wiltshire and possibly elsewhere. It is right to look at some shared programming nationally and across regions. A story may demand a wider audience, and the BBC can use its network of local radio stations to further its public service role.</p>

There is no reason for saying that certain time slots in BBC local radio’s daytime schedule—not the whole thing—cannot be earmarked for regional and/or national documentary content. It would be best if that was pre-produced documentary content. In my experience, there is not enough good radio documentary content these days, and it falls to the BBC, through the amazingly unique way in which it is funded, to correct that. If the corporation is really smart, it will use the huge talent pool in BBC local radio, which other Members have mentioned, to bring such things to air and give them a chance. I see no reason why the BBC should not use its substantial knowledge of specific BBC local TV and radio audiences to do that in the way that has the least impact.</p>

 I absolutely agree, and I will explain why in more detail later. What I am saying, however, is that there is no reason, if it is used intelligently, why good documentary content in predetermined slots—just an hour here or there—should not be fed through the BBC local radio network. Many of the national stories that we hear on network radio will go to a reporter in Scunthorpe or in Winchester, which I represent. Those reporters will be from BBC local radio, and the BBC will use their experience. It will use its local reach to bring issues to network radio, and it does that very well, but if we take that arrangement away, the network will go.</p>

To give one example, we used to open the programme every day with a feature called “Just the Job”, which brought somebody on the air for 10 minutes to tell listeners about their interesting or unusual occupation. The man who tasted dog food to see whether it was ready for the market lingers in my memory and in other ways—he genuinely still exists. <i>[</i>

All those people will be responsible for huge sums of taxpayers’ money—our constituents’ money—and BBC local radio will be needed to play an even greater role than ever in holding local decision makers to account and in shining the light of transparency on behalf of our constituents.</p>

               <a name="11040557000095"> BBC local radio stations are increasingly involved in holding people to account, which is the essential accompaniment to localism, and it would be not just a shame, but dangerous to see that work go backwards. In my area, BBC Radio Solent, which began broadcasting from its antenna on the Isle of Wight many years ago with the voice of Lord Mountbatten, has recently appointed two local political specialists who have begun a series that gives listeners a direct line to decision makers and service providers. I have been called to account myself many times, including at some ungodly hour this morning to talk about this debate. The facts speak for themselves, as many Members have said. People are listening in increasing numbers to BBC local radio. We have touched on crisis coverage and the BBC stamp of authenticity, so, most importantly, we can all know when not only kids but big kids—Members of Parliament—can go sledging.</p>

               <a name="11040557000096"> I know that young audiences are also drawn to BBC local radio. Sometimes this debate can be polarised and the service be seen as rather old-fashioned, but young people in my part of the world listen to BBC Radio Solent through the partnership it has with Radio 1 and its “BBC Introducing” programmes, which give new music and unsigned bands a chance via the BBC network and web pages. We should do much more of that. The BBC has a big responsibility to help young people and give them a chance.</p>

In my limited experience of broadcasting, and especially radio broadcasting, it is as much in the heart as in the head. To create content that is interesting and engaging, it is necessary to create a sense of community that means the listeners will tune in to be a part of the team as much as to hear what is said. Terry Wogan on Radio 2 with his TOGs—Terry’s old geezers or gals—is a brilliant example of that, but there are hundreds of examples in BBC local radio across the country, including on BBC Radio Solent.</p>

Without BBC local radio, the whole world would never have known the sheer pleasure of “Up With The Partridge” on Radio Norwich.

Therefore, one of the obsessions with which we will inevitably engage to ensure that we get one is ensuring that we have a functioning media—a means by which people have communication that informs them in terms of their engagement with the political decision-making process. If all that the broadcast media can do is provide generalised national reporting or press releases read out on the hour quickly, interspersed with the extensive playing of records, it will not significantly contribute to the kind of functioning democracy that we, across all parties, desire. For that reason, we rightly want to support and protect what we have now—in fact, if anything, we need to enhance what BBC local radio is achieving.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. We are blessed in Cornwall. I might challenge the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram) on whether his local radio station is statistically more popular and has greater reach, penetration, listenership and loyalty than Cornwall’s. BBC Radio Cornwall is an incredibly popular local radio station, in spite of operating in a very competitive environment with the independent stations, Pirate FM and Atlantic FM—both well listened to local, independent radio stations. On the Isles of Scilly, we have Radio Scilly as well, which provides a remarkable and engaging community service although it broadcasts to a population of only 2,000. The only reason those independent radio stations are able to succeed is that the BBC sets the standard that they have to attempt to reach.</p>

               <a name="11040557000104"> I go back to my fundamental point about a functioning democracy. I fear that the BBC at national level is moving towards fly-on-the-wall, get-me-out-of-here types of reporting, rather than the in-depth inquiring documentaries in which it engaged in the past. Similarly, on local radio, I have noticed a trend towards just reading out press releases rather than cross-questioning the information put out by the establishment. BBC local radio has done that effectively, it has the resources to be able to do it and it is fundamentally important that it should carry on doing it.</p>

We have “An Nowodhow”—the news in Cornish—which is fantastic to be able to hear regularly, even with my rather rough and informal knowledge of the language. Other Members have mentioned dialect stories from other parts of the country. We can only get that with a framework in which such reporting can be based. I fear, though, as Matthew Arnold put it, that this is about the desire of a centralised state to render its dominion homogenous. The BBC may be engaged in that same drift of simply treating the UK as if it reflects the metropolitan elite, and it is not necessarily reflecting idiosyncrasies around the country as a whole. I hope the BBC is listening today.</p>

There is no doubt that the BBC, like other public bodies, must cut its cloth to fit the times, but it has a great deal of cloth from which to cut, including large headquarters buildings and several smart television studios around the country, and budgets for entertainment, publicity and promotion, the salaries that it pays to big name broadcasters and the budgets of expensive television productions.

However, the director-general has suggested that £150 million could be saved by scrapping overnight television programming between 10.30 pm and 6 am, showing repeats instead. That is more than the total cost of BBC local radio throughout the UK, which costs £137 million.</p>

In Worcestershire in the summer of 2007, we faced cataclysmic flooding, a one-in-100-years flood that caused weeks of disruption, and images of our county were shown on the national news for all the wrong reasons. In such circumstances, local radio comes into its own. People who were stranded were able to get help, drivers were able to avoid the closed roads, and SOS messages from farmers needing their cows to be milked and from the elderly in need of food were responded to, thanks to local radio.</p>

For more than a week, the power was out and the heating was off, and the local radio on battery-powered radios was our lifeline to the outside world, bringing news and comfort. Much more recently, in last year’s hard winter, when snow drifts struck and thousands were stranded, it was to local radio that many people turned. I remember sliding along in my car listening to an SOS from a local wedding because the DJ had failed to arrive. It was not a matter of life or death, but as I plan to get married this Saturday, I can say that it must have felt so. Only local radio could have delivered on such a mission—and it did.</p>

It has the unique ability to allow several local radio stations to broadcast to their communities on specific local issues. I can understand the BBC thinking that Radio 5 Live has become a popular radio station and that it might say, “Let’s move it on to those FM frequencies, which we can free up by getting rid of local radio.” However, that does a disservice to Radio 5 Live listeners.</p>

The BBC says that it could use digital stations, but many people do not have access to a digital set. More importantly, in some of the more remote areas it is difficult to pick up a digital signal.</p>

If the BBC is looking to save money, why do we need BBC 3 television? BBC 3 does exactly what BBC 1 and BBC 2 used to do—and what Radio 4 used to do, as many of the comedies that are now trialled on BBC 3 used to be trialled on Radio 4.</p>

I am sure that many will have read that BBC Radio 7 was rebranded to form Radio 4 Extra, with new editions of “The Archers” and so on. It is a better listening feast. New comedies should be trialled on Radio 4 Extra, which is a digital channel. BBC 3 is a digital channel, and getting rid of it would free lots of money. BBC 4 is a great channel, with some highbrow broadcasting, but its content used to be shown on BBC 2. Why are we spreading the money around? BBC 3 and BBC 4 could be scrapped, and that money could be used for local radio. In my opinion, that would cause no loss of content or quality for BBC viewers and listeners.</p>

Radio 3 has been mentioned. It has a small audience, and it offers a unique service of limited appeal and may not be commercial viable, but it plays complete pieces of music, unlike Classic FM. Despite being commercially successful, Classic FM does not play the intellectual pieces that can be heard on Radio 3.</p>

The structure of the BBC, like that of the NHS, says a huge amount about how we see ourselves as a nation—it is something to which we all contribute and from which we all benefit. It occupies a crucial role in our national life. More than any other broadcaster or media outlet in Britain or elsewhere, the BBC is trusted for its impartiality.</p>

               <a name="11040557000131"> The BBC’s 40 local stations, not least Radio Suffolk, play a hugely important role across Britain. They have 7.5 million listeners a week—an increase of 500,000 on last year and more than 700,000 on the year before. A third of listeners, some 2.5 million, listen to no other BBC station and almost a fifth listen to no other station at all. Some 1.5 million British people get pretty much all of their news from their local BBC radio station.</p>

               <a name="11040557000132"> BBC local radio reaches 31% of less affluent over 55-year-olds, which is well ahead of Radio 2 at 24% and Radio 4 at 16%. At 35%, local radio’s reach for less affluent pensioners is even higher. In fact, the figure is higher than for any other station. Given the proportion of people listening in the morning, BBC local radio is one of the main sources from which those people get pretty much all their news and current affairs. Such figures are really important, because they show how local radio helps the BBC deliver effectively to all licence fee payers. They show how significant numbers of licence fee payers, particularly older and less affluent ones, would not be served properly if substantial parts of the local radio service were removed.</p>

How confident is the Minister that the duties set out in the royal charter will not be jeopardised by the savings that have to be made? How does he think that the savings should be shared between national, regional and local services? What criteria should be applied to where the cuts will fall? How does he think that those criteria might affect programme quality? What guarantees has he sought about the impact on the diversity and quality of regional and local services? Based on his discussions with BBC management, can he tell us how many jobs might be jeopardised by the process?

In particular, there is Malcolm Boyden’s excellent breakfast show and there is Bill Heine’s show.

Members became involved in the debate about that station, and the decision to close it was reversed by the BBC Trust. Therefore, if these apparent proposals by the BBC are firmed up, hon. Members will have a chance to lobby the BBC Trust and perhaps persuade its members that there are better ways to go forward.</p>

               <a name="11040557000156"> Radio remains a very important medium in this country. Every week, more than 90% of the population consume more than a billion hours of radio in total. The radio landscape in the UK is more diverse than ever, with listeners having access to more than 20 national radio stations, 400 local radio stations and 200 community radio stations. The creation of a community radio landscape is something that the last Government can genuinely take credit for. In addition, internet radio makes it possible to listen to a diverse range of radio stations from across the globe.</p>

               <a name="11040557000157"> We have debated the importance of localness in radio a number of times in this House and it was certainly a feature of the recent debate on changes in media ownership rules. Ensuring localness in radio is a key part of the regulatory regime for commercial radio and Ofcom is required to ensure that commercial radio produces an appropriate amount of local material. For many commercial stations, their local nature is their key differentiator. The location of their studios in the local high street, and the fact that their presenters travel the same roads to work as their listeners, allow those stations to speak more directly to their listeners than some other stations. That is true of both commercial and BBC services.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_103"> 
               <a name="110405h0001.htm_para103"> 
               <a name="11040557000158"> However, those local media businesses are competing in an increasingly global media market, and commercial radio in the UK has seen its total revenues fall in the past 10 years. So the needs of commercial businesses and the public policies of localness do not always sit easily together. Having said that, I am a supporter, for example, of some of the technology that some commercial radio companies are introducing to help them to reduce the fixed costs of local studios and avoid the duplication of resources. But I know that that is not always popular, as the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) made very clear in a debate that we had on the localness rules.</p>

               <a name="11040557000159"> I also want to mention briefly the success of community radio, which was introduced by the last Government in 2004. Community radio has quickly grown into an important and thriving third tier of radio. Community services are the embodiment of local radio, with stations staffed and programmes presented by local volunteers. I am pleased that, last week, Ofcom announced a further round of licensing for community radio, so that even more communities can benefit from such stations. If hon. Members do not have a community radio station in or near their constituency, I urge them to look into community radio.</p>

               <a name="11040557000160"> I promised to turn to the specific issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal raised, which is the speculation around the networking of the BBC’s local and regional services. As I said, the suggestion that the BBC will scale down its nations and regions services and its network programming with BBC Radio Five Live is, at the moment, just speculation. The BBC is considering a number of proposals and absolutely no decision has been made at this time.</p>

However, it is worth looking at this issue of resources in the round. It was only a couple of years ago that the BBC was considering going into local video, in addition to  <br/>

            <p>local radio. That proposal was fiercely opposed by many in this House because they wanted to preserve space for the commercial radio sector. The BBC had the resources then to make a significant expansion and therefore it does not need to consider making a significant contraction now. I will not pick up on the specific points that my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet made, but he said that there are numerous ways in which the BBC could save money. Finally, I suspect that changes to local radio programming are driven more by editorial decisions than by the need to save money.</p>

               <a name="11040557000162"> The hon. Member for Dudley North asked me a number of questions and I suggest that I should write to him in some detail about them. For example, to ask me as a Minister to opine on how BBC savings should be divided between national, regional and local services is to invite me to go beyond my brief in trying to decide how the BBC should use its money. But I am certainly happy to approach the director-general of the BBC to ask him what criteria he intends to apply and to ask for guarantees about programme quality and diversity. There is no doubt that some jobs may be lost in the BBC, but again that will be a matter for the BBC itself to consider.</p>

               <a name="11040557000163"> The BBC now has a seven-year licence fee settlement. It has certainty of funding for the next seven years, which is something that no other media company in this country enjoys. It is quite right that the BBC should be examining the scope for efficiency savings while looking to deliver the best quality service possible with the funds available to it.</p>

               <a name="11040557000164"> The BBC has launched its internal consultation, “Delivering Quality First”, and the proposed changes to BBC local radio is just one topic of discussion. As I said, however, there is a bright future for local news and local content, not only with commercial radio, community radio and the move towards digital radio, but with a subject that I am surprised not a single hon. Member has mentioned in the debate—the advent of local television. Local television will bring a huge rebirth of local content across communities in this country, and we should see the first fruits of that initiative early next year.</p>

               <a name="11040557000166"> Most people never need to seek advice, and I hope that that remains the case, but some people, often through no fault of their own, find themselves in difficulty, with creditors knocking on the door or, in the most extreme circumstances, their homes being taken away. Such people are often going through a terrible time. They might have lost a partner or a job, or they might find that they cannot work anymore, and it is at such times that the advice centre comes into its own. It can offer practical help by guiding people to a safe haven and helping them to rebuild their lives.</p>

               <a name="stpa_111">

               <a name="11040557000167"> My constituency is typical of many in this country, with parts in which deprivation levels are high and increasing worklessness and unemployment, which is not helped, it has to be said, by the cutting of public sector jobs. The constituency covers the north of Sheffield and the west of Barnsley, and it has three advice centres for an electorate of about 70,000. On the Sheffield side, the two advice centres, Chapel Green and Stocksbridge, are independent of Citizens Advice, and on the Barnsley side a citizens advice bureau covers most of the area. The centres’ services are provided on very tight budgets, and the centres draw heavily on the contribution made by an army of well-trained and well-motivated volunteers—the original big society, even before it became a PR slogan.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_112">

               <a name="11040557000168"> Even when the economy was in good health and employment levels were at record highs, advice centres played an important role in supporting individuals who found themselves struggling with the business of everyday survival, and demand for such support is now rising because of the present economic climate. Unemployment is rising, and inflation is running at 5.5% on the RPI measure, with the cost of everyday items, particularly food and petrol, increasing significantly. People are feeling the pinch, and those who have lost their jobs are likely to need significant levels of support if they are to succeed in protecting their families and getting back on their feet. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that as the Government spending cuts bite, personal indebtedness will increase by a massive £303 billion by 2015, meaning that average household debt will rise to £77,309—the previous projection was £66,291. To put it another way, household debt will rise to 170% of household income according to independent forecasts by a body set up by the Government themselves.</p>

               <a name="11040557000169"> One of the advice centres in my constituency has informed me that it has recently seen a 13% increase in the number of people seeking advice. In Barnsley, the citizens advice bureau has seen a massive 25% increase in the level of debt that it is being asked to advise on—the debt totalled almost £18 million last year. The Barnsley centre now receives 50 new debt-related inquiries a day, and debt accounts for 60% of its work. That is a frightening figure by anyone’s standards, and even more so in Barnsley, which will suffer particularly badly because of the cuts. All three advice centres agree that the situation will get worse as the Government’s austerity drive gathers pace in the coming months and years.</p>

               <a name="11040557000170"> This is not a time, therefore, to cut funding to advice centres, but that is exactly what is happening, never mind that the financial inclusion fund has been reprieved. I acknowledge the fact that the Government have done that for the time being, but anyone familiar with the funding regimes that apply to advice centres knows that the centres typically sustain themselves from a number of sources.</p>

               <a name="11040557000171"> Stocksbridge advice centre is isolated in a steel-producing community seven miles from the next nearest advice centre, and it has seen its £84,000 budget reduced to £29,000 for the financial year that is just starting, thanks to a number of decisions made by the Government. That is a massive cut by anyone’s standards. The centre’s biggest loss is the £42,000 it used to get from Yorkshire Forward, the regional development agency for Yorkshire and the Humber that the coalition Government have abolished. The centre has also been told by the Lib-Dem Sheffield city council that it will receive funding for only six months of the coming year, because the council is required to save £80 million in one year thanks to reductions in its Government grant, with further amounts to be cut from its budget in future years, of course. There is, therefore, only six months’ guaranteed income from the council, after which the centre will have to bid for further funding for the rest of the year and beyond. The centre serves not only the steel town from which it takes its name, but a large rural area that extends well into the Peak District and to the wonderful market town of Penistone in Barnsley. The consequences of the reductions are that the number of paid staff will reduce from 2.6 to 0.9 full-time equivalents and the service provided will be put at risk, despite the eight doughty volunteers who give their time for free, week in and week out.</p>

               <a name="11040557000172"> The centre’s statistics clearly demonstrate its worth. Client gains in welfare benefits were in excess of £586,000 for the past year, which roughly equates to a £6 gain for every £1 spent by the centre. That does not include the amount of debt dealt with, which by October 2010 was well in excess of £500,000. In the past year, the centre also undertook 134 home visits; every MP knows that home visits are an essential part of any advice service, and we occasionally have to do them ourselves, visiting disabled people, for example, or the parents of children with special needs. The advice centre also represented 34 clients at social security tribunals. It is worth pointing out that the centre covers a huge geographical area to the north of Sheffield, including parts of western Barnsley and, as I have said, the next nearest advice centre is more than seven miles away, in Hillsborough, in the urban part of Sheffield. The Hillsborough centre is already working at full capacity, and could not take on the extra workload if Stocksbridge ceased to exist—it would be physically and financially impossible. A huge area would, therefore, be left without advice cover and, given that a large part of it is rural and rather isolated—we are talking about the Peak District national park in its north-eastern reaches—such a possibility is rather worrying, to say the least. The very idea that such a large area could be left without the provision is of huge concern to my constituents.</p>

               <a name="11040557000173"> In the eastern part of my constituency, the local independent advice centre, Chapel Green, relies entirely on a grant from Sheffield city council for its survival.  <br/>

            <p>Not only has that grant been cut by 11%, but the funding received is for only six months, which is the Lib-Dem council’s policy, and the centre has been told that it will then have to compete for a share of any possible further funding. The centre covers not only the north-east of the city, but also part of the massive Parson Cross estate, the levels of deprivation of which are well known. The centre already runs on the work of volunteers and can only pay for a part-time manager, who is a very effective and dedicated individual. I run my surgeries from the Chapel Green advice centre on the fourth Saturday of every month, and the manager turns out every single time to welcome my constituents and to ensure that they are looked after while they wait to see me. That is the level of dedication that he shows in his work. He has been running the centre on a shoestring for years, but the financial situation is now deteriorating very rapidly, and if the centre is unsuccessful in gaining further funding, it will no doubt face closure.</p>

               <a name="11040557000174"> Adequate debt advice will become unavailable to much of the population in north Sheffield, which involves about 40,000 people. The bit of Parson Cross covered by the advice centre has serious levels of deprivation. It was once part of Sheffield, Brightside, one of the most deprived constituencies in the north of England. The centre there secured £691,373.29 in unclaimed benefits for its clients during the financial year just closed. That is nearly £750,000 pumped into the local economy, with all the benefits accruing from that. This point must be read into this debate: advice centres secure moneys due to local people, which has a knock-on effect on the local economy and its shops and businesses at a time when those businesses need to be stimulated for their long-term survival.</p>

               <a name="11040557000175"> The same centre reports that queries relating to debt increased by 21% over the past year, with telephone queries up by 6%. In Barnsley, the local Labour council has been able to maintain the CAB’s funding of £195,000 for another year. I applaud Councillor Stephen Houghton for making the brave decision not to cut that funding in the face of a £26 million reduction in the moneys available to spend on services. He has recognised that the financial plight of many people living in his borough must be a top priority in terms of local services delivered. However, although the retention of the financial inclusion fund is also helpful, the future of Barnsley CAB is still uncertain, and although the grant level is being maintained, it is still being cut in real terms when inflation is taken into consideration.</p>

               <a name="11040557000176"> The centre covers not only a large part of the west of my constituency but the rest of the borough of Barnsley, which features in any index of deprivation. If there is any borough in England that needs support even now, it is Barnsley. It has some of the highest levels of people on incapacity benefit in England, a lot of whom have long-term illness resulting from their work in the mining industry. People in Barnsley need support. In these difficult times, the Government must thoroughly reconsider the cumulative impact of their policies on advice centres. The future of those centres is at risk not only from the cuts that almost all of them face from local authorities but from their loss of funding from various other sources.</p>

When people are in trouble, they need the personalised and sensitive approach that they get from face-to-face service. As MPs, we know that most of our constituents are happy for us to deal with their problems after a quick e-mail or phone call, but some constituents have problems that are so complex and entrenched that they must meet us face to face at our surgeries in order to explain them so that we can work out what needs to be done.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith) on securing this debate. I regard the citizens advice bureaux in my constituency as incredibly important, as I know she does. If other Members were here to listen to this debate, they would be praising the valuable work done by CABs.</p>

I do not think that I could do my job as a constituency MP properly without that partnership with my local citizens advice bureaux. They refer people to me sometimes, but I generally refer people to them. I agree completely with her and pay tribute to the many volunteers and staff who work in CABs. They do an amazing job.</p>

The hon. Lady spoke particularly about debt. She is absolutely right that citizens advice bureaux play a critical role in debt management. We are currently consulting on consumer credit and personal insolvency, and after the recess, we will be responding to the evidence that we have received on the issue. The overall way in which we treat debt management and advice must be thought through more carefully than it has been. We can do a lot more for a lot more people with the money that we have.</p>

However, what she did not say—I am sorry to pull her up on this point, as I have a lot of sympathy for what she said—is that the Government are dealing with a huge Budget deficit, the largest in our peacetime. We have had to take tough decisions. I had to see the previous chief executive of Citizens Advice to tell that organisation in-year that it had to make serious budget cuts. That was probably my most difficult meeting and the most difficult decision to take.</p>

 The hon. Lady is right to make the point that it is not just about Citizens Advice. I take that on board. In considering debt advice, we want to ensure that we look across the whole piece both locally and nationally, as numerous organisations have a national locus in that area. She is also right to say that citizens advice bureaux rely on many sources of money. That is why I recently met the Minister with responsibility for civil society, the hon. Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd), and Ministers from other Departments with an interest in the area, such as the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Justice, to ensure that we take a cross-Government view of funding for the advice sector. It is critical.</p>

               <a name="11040557000187"> The hon. Lady is right to mention the cumulative impact. From the perspective of my Department, in funding Citizens Advice—and, as she was kind enough to say, in securing the financial inclusion fund for face-to-face debt advice—we believe that we are playing our part. Working with colleagues across Government, we want to consider not just the current year but the next few years to ensure that there are no unintended consequences resulting from a failure to join up the different parts of Government.</p>

               <a name="11040557000188"> Focusing on the issues raised by the hon. Lady, she spent a little time, as I have mentioned, on debt advice. She said that the Office for Budget Responsibility would see an increase in indebtedness, which is absolutely true. It is already incredibly high. We have already seen, over the past few years, a massive increase in indebtedness, which is why more money has been spent by both the previous Government and this Government in this area. That is also why we have to think carefully about how we manage the issue. Whether it is through the phone, the internet, or face to face, we need to make sure that we provide the services that people actually need. We need to go deeply into this, because there are other issues in relation to debt advice about which we need to think carefully.</p>

We need to think carefully about how we encourage people to come forward early enough to get support and advice. We need to make sure that the voluntary and charitable sectors are well known enough among people who suffer from debt, so that people who have problems do not just go to people in the private sector who provide very expensive debt  <br/>

It has to make some tough decisions and no one pretends otherwise. We cannot get out of the massive deficit that we are in, in any sensible way, without taking some difficult decisions. I will not second-guess the decisions that Sheffield city council are taking. The hon. Lady has pointed out a number of times that Chapel Green and Stocksbridge advice centres have been given funding for only the first six months of this financial year, but my understanding is that Sheffield city council—the same is true of a number of local authorities throughout the country—is doing a review of the provision of advice within the city and looking to move to a new commissioning process later this year. Of course, that entails a degree of uncertainty in the short term, but the objective, as I understand it, is to make sure that advice services can get support over the forthcoming years, and get it in the most effective way possible. Nationally, we are reviewing the way in which advice is provided, and I do not think it unreasonable that local authorities are reviewing that, too. I certainly hope that, when they have made those reviews, they will be in a position whereby they can stably fund their local advice centres.</p>

I do not think, certainly from the evidence that our Department is receiving, that those sorts of services will be taken away from people. I assure the hon.

The evidence that we are getting is that budgets are tight and there is absolutely no dispute about that, but what we are not seeing—I pay tribute to the local authorities that are playing a key role in this—is a whole set of bureaux closing.

We want to see whether we can get better value for money for consumers and citizens from the confusing plethora of fragmented aspects of the sector. The organisation that we have asked to lead that is the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. That involves not just the national organisation, where a lot of the national work will be done, but its relationship with local bureaux, which are, in many ways, the front line for consumers and citizens to make sure that they have the information they need and that they can register their concerns and complaints and get advice or redress in relation to their benefit claims.</p>

 May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under such esteemed chairmanship, Mr Gale? You will bring an enlightened and seasoned touch to the proceedings.

When I told my local paper that I had a very important debate on the groceries code adjudicator, there was a blank silence on the other end of the phone.

I do not come to this debate as a farmer or with any great farming heritage. I confess that I spent a week helping out a friend on a dairy farm, which involved cows standing on me, sitting on me and doing something else on me. However, I will not go into those details because I do not hold that against either the dairy industry or cows. This is an important debate because we need to get to the bottom of making sure that the grocery market works fairly, impartially and in the best possible way.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very valid point. However, the adjudicator has to look across the whole market. We cannot look at farmers in isolation because they are part of a process and a route to market. Farmers are at the very start of the process. The product does not go straight from the farm gate to the supermarket; in many cases it goes through a distribution chain. For an adjudicator to be effective, it has to look at the whole process. My hon. Friend makes the valid point that many of these businesses are substantial, major businesses that are present in our constituencies up and down the country. Whether someone is selling pigs or pizzas, the competitive market and the supermarkets have a major impact on that business.</p>

When I was travelling along the highways and byways of South Staffordshire, I remember saying to many of those people that, in our manifesto, we were going to do something about the issue and that we would have a supermarket ombudsman—a groceries code adjudicator.

 My hon. Friend makes a powerful case and I congratulate him on securing the debate. Just to inform him, the Liberal Democrat manifesto was also committed to what we called not a groceries code adjudicator but a supermarket regulator. Whatever the title, the critical point is not just about the powers, but whether it is a proactive body. The difficulty with the supermarket ombudsman, the ombudsman that we know and love, is that it is a reactive body. We do not want to be in a situation where dairy farmers—I meet many—are in  a position where they fear, right or wrongly, that if they refer their case to the ombudsman they may then be a target for the supermarket. Surely the new body, whatever we call it, has to have proactive powers of its own to go out looking for trouble, to ensure that we have fair trade at home as well as abroad.</p>

Before I entered this House I was a potter. I appreciate that being a potter is somewhat different to being a pig farmer, and I did not sell to the grocery multiples, but I did sell to many high street multiples. I always remember going into the factory one day and opening up a letter from a major high street store group. I will spare its blushes; I will not mention its name. We had reached an agreement that I would be paid within 30 days, at an agreed price that seemed to be fair, and it had given me a commitment to purchase from me at that price. The letter said quite clearly that, instead of paying me within 30 days, it would pay me within 120 days. If I wanted to be paid within 60 days, it would pay me within 60 days, but would take a 6% discount—take it or leave it. That is a difficult situation.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. One of the greatest attributes of the British people is their fair-mindedness. People would like to see fair trade, not just abroad but in this country too. Many hon. Members will say that the Government are not there to fix prices. I could not agree more, but sometimes there are distortions in a market. When producers are so small and insignificant that they cannot argue on the issue of price, sometimes they are simple victims of that market, just like the farmer I mentioned earlier who wrote to me on this issue.</p>

I appreciate that everything in government has the potential to slip, but I seek reassurance from the Minister that he will put all his effort into ensuring that there is no further slippage and that a Bill is brought before the House. We must ensure that the Bill will bring help and support right across the process, and bring the balance and fairness that not only we, as politicians, want to see, but the British people want to see.</p>

There has been much talk about the adjudicator being able to name and shame, and being able to issue a press release in order to embarrass those who act wrongly. I am afraid to say that I do not believe that a press release will be quite enough to make sure that we have an adjudicator that works well and works properly. As I say, this debate is not just about farmers, but about producers and supermarkets—all the way through the process. I would expect any adjudicator to have firm powers to fine. I would also expect, however, any adjudicator to use fines with prudence, rarely and only when it is required, because an adjudicator will, in many ways, have failed if it cannot sort out a situation through negotiation, discussion and bringing people together. We only have to look at other ombudsmen or regulators that have been set up in the past. Those organisations have been successful if they have some ability to enforce what they have found to be right and just.

 My only concern with my hon. Friend’s comments is that this appears to be a solution looking for a problem. We already have a supermarket code of practice that stops such things as retrospective changes to deals between supermarkets and suppliers. That is already overseen by the Office of Fair Trading. If anybody wishes to make a complaint, they can already do so to the OFT. The OFT did research, and it could not find any material breaches of the supermarket code. I am, therefore, not entirely sure what the problem is to which my hon. Friend is advocating a solution.</p>

 May I refer my hon. Friend to the Competition Commission report in 2008, which identified the unexpected costs and excessive risks as a problem in the supply chain? The commission used its power to establish a statutory code, rather than the voluntary code previously in place, but the situation is rather like a game of rugby which has the rules of rugby but no referee. That is why we need an adjudicator, because no one is keeping an eye on that code at the moment.</p>

 The great difficulty is that an adjudicator or a supermarket ombudsman who is too weak and a code that is not enforced act as a badge of respectability for supermarkets, which can pretend that they are being regulated and that producers are being protected when they are not.

 It comes down to a matter of pride and respect. I have always been of the belief that we should legislate as little as possible, because it does not always bring goodness and greatness to everything, but when we do legislate, we must ensure that it is right and will lead to positive change and a positive influence for the good. Therefore, if we are to have an adjudicator, that adjudicator must have the ability to fine. I hope that the Minister can take that on board. I appreciate that there will be many siren voices whispering into his ear about how such a step would be retrograde, but I point to how rarely most ombudsman organisations use the ability to fine or to level penalties. It is incredibly rare because people never want to go down that route except as a last resort.</p>

Friend the Member for Shipley pointed out that there is a grocery code and asked why more and more people were not coming forward. However, there is a real fear about doing so. Often, if people do come forward, it is so easy to identify who they are. As I mentioned earlier, I am sure that 99% of our best and greatest supermarkets would never dream of taking recompense from a supplier, but there is a fear that that might well happen. Therefore it is vital that, as part of the Bill, if and hopefully when it is published, trade bodies, organisations and associations will have the ability to put forward concerns, and the adjudicator will be able to initiate an investigation.</p>

I do not want to see that, and nor would many other Members. However, that ability to have an investigation has to be available. We will not always have a producer who is brave enough to go to the adjudicator and say, “This is the problem.” Sometimes, quite rightly, producers might want to hide behind—that is probably the wrong phraseology—or be protected by the trade association or organisation, which would be making representations to the adjudicator, with the adjudicator instigating an investigation.</p>

When the coalition Government were formed, they made their commitment clear at the start, and they followed through on the consultation.

 My hon. Friend will know that the supermarket industry is worth about £130 billion a year. If the outcome of having an ombudsman is that a bigger slice of the cake goes to producers, and they receive perhaps only 1% more income, that will add £1.3 billion to food bills. Given that people are already struggling to pay their bills at this difficult time, why does my hon. Friend want to add another £1.3 billion to people’s food bills, including those of his constituents?</p>

 Quite the opposite. I do not want to add another £1.3 billion to consumers’ bills, but to make sure that the supermarkets are not taking £1.3 billion extra in profit from the overall trade when they are not entitled to it. They have used their muscle in the marketplace to drive down the price that they pay producers. To be perfectly honest, I have no sympathy with my hon. Friend’s position. Tesco has 32% of the retail trade, and if that is not a huge monopoly position, I will eat my hat.</p>

 Absolutely. I welcome the hon. Gentleman’s comment. Again, to take a wonderful, if perhaps slightly overused, word, this is all about fairness. The supermarkets have huge investments, and they are entitled to a fair profit, but if they use their situation to drive prices down for the producer and keep prices up for the consumer, they are taking too much out of the market.</p>

               <a name="11040557000263"> Those of us who represent rural constituencies very much want agriculture and the growers to get a fair deal from the marketplace. I spent 10 years in the European Parliament; we can talk about the common agricultural policy and about whether we should be subsidised. In the end, however, it would be far better if farmers did not have to be supported through a subsidy. What they actually want is a fair deal from the marketplace.</p>

               <a name="11040557000264"> Historically, the previous Government held an inquiry in their early days into Milk Marque, a large co-operative that bought 37% of the milk in this country. Subsequently, the Office of Fair Trading split the organisation up because it was considered a monopoly. We now have a supermarket with 32% of the trade in this country, but it is not considered a monopoly. I am not going to push the Government to go to war with Tesco, and nor do I want to go to war with Tesco, but I want to put clearly on the record that we must stop being so mealy-mouthed about these things, because, in the end, these guys have huge power.</p>

               <a name="11040557000265"> My hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire put it very well when he talked about his pottery business. He said he had a large buyer, who had come along and said, “I’m not going to accept the deal that we’ve done. I want to pay you less. I want to pay you late. That is the deal. Take it or leave it.” That is what the adjudicator needs to sort out as far as food production is concerned. They have to make sure that buying power and scale do not drive prices down.</p>

               <a name="11040557000266"> When the supermarkets decide to have a price war, all consumers are grateful. I would be the last to say that such things should not happen, because that is competition. However, when the supermarkets go into that price war, they must not turn around and tell producers, “Okay, we’re having a war with our neighbouring supermarkets, so we will drive down the price we pay you.” They then drive prices down to below the cost of production. Milk prices are now 3p or 4p below the cost of production. Pig prices are £20 per pig below the cost of production. Cereal prices are probably the highest we have seen for many years, if not the highest we have ever seen. That is adding to industry’s costs, but it is not reflected in the price that the supermarkets and big buyers pay producers. That is why we are so keen to have an adjudicator.</p>

I do not think that there will be a huge bureaucracy and a huge problem, provided that the adjudicator has the right muscle and teeth. If they do, they will not need to be used in most cases, because the producer, processor or whoever will be able simply to threaten to go to the adjudicator. That is when the system will really work—not when people have to go through the whole process. People need to be able to go to somebody who can check what is happening.</p>

They could act not so politely and have a terrible effect on the passage of people, but even when they are acting politely, they can have an effect, and supermarkets can have an effect.

The profitability of supermarkets is determined by two things: one is the margin of the product and the other is the turnover. If they are multiplied, we get the gross profit of the supermarket. Out of that, it has to fund its overheads, labour and financial costs and all the other costs attributed to businesses.</p>

However, its turnover depends on how competitive it is with other supermarkets. That is when price pressure comes in. People tell me that quality is required and must be delivered, so often the only competitive advantage that people can have is on price. The sheer size of some of the organisations—the 32% share that we heard about—affects the marketplace. They can go in and abuse their dominant position in the marketplace.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. I was going to come on to that point later, but I will mention it now since he has raised it. A supermarket’s success cannot work on the basis of the supermarket versus the supplier. For a supermarket to be successful, it needs products on the shelves just as much as the supplier needs the supermarket to sell its products. A supermarket without Heinz baked beans and Kellogg’s cornflakes would not be much of a supermarket. The idea that the whip hand is always the supermarket’s is not one that I recognise.  <br/>

 My hon. Friend has referred to household names, which, of course, have a great deal of marketing power when dealing with supermarkets. However, a lot of the smaller producers, especially of goods such as vegetables, which are seasonal and have to be sold at a certain time, do not have the same power to trade with a supermarket and the supermarket can then push down the prices.</p>

 The ombudsman, as envisaged, would apply to all suppliers, so even those that are more powerful than the supermarkets would benefit. It would be a boon to big multinational businesses at the expense of the consumer and the supermarkets. In reality, it would do very little to help small suppliers.</p>

               <a name="11040557000290"> I come back to the point that this is a solution looking for a problem. We already have a supermarket code of practice that prohibits any retrospective changes to agreements, which is one of the big beefs that people had. It imposes a prohibition on charging suppliers for shrinkage, which is another cost that supermarkets have to factor into their prices. It has an overarching fair-dealing provision, which the Competition Commission believes balances the need to curtail unreasonable behaviour and to allow some commercial flexibility. I must stress that the code already makes it clear that a retailer may only delist a supplier for genuine commercial reasons, and expressly not for exercising its rights under the code. If any supplier at the moment wants to make a complaint to the OFT, which oversees the supermarket code of practice, it can do so without any penalty. It does not need to have anonymity, and I object to the principle of anonymity.</p>

I think it would be expensive, and that will lead only to higher prices. If we pass on higher returns to the supplier, the only possible consequence in a market that is already incredibly popular—margins for supermarkets are already low—will be an effect on the consumer. In an industry worth £130 billion a year, 1% of that is £1.3 billion, 2% is £2.6 billion and so on. I have no idea how much extra people expect suppliers to get, but even if it is only in that region, it is a massive cost to pass on to consumers at a time when people cannot afford to pay their bills. Constituents who are struggling will not thank hon. Members when they find out that huge increases in cost have been passed on.</p>

 I cannot give way, because we have not got time. The idea that everyone agrees on this matter is not correct. The economist, Professor Lyons, who is one of the two Competition Commission panel members working on supplier issues, concluded that the ombudsman would be counter-productive and opposed its being set up. The commission’s report stated that he</p>
            <a name="110405h0002.htm_brev0"> 
            <a name="11040557000440"> 
            <p class="tabletext">“believed that the Ombudsman would be counterproductive...He was concerned that the Ombudsman may find a role ‘proactively’ representing the interests of suppliers, including global manufacturers and large intermediaries, which he considered would reduce the benefits of competition.”</p>

               <a name="11040557000297"> There are a large number of myths about the relationship between supermarkets and suppliers. The idea that all buy one, get one free promotions are insisted on by supermarkets and paid for by suppliers is completely wrong. When I was at Asda, we tried to stop suppliers from offering such deals and have an everyday lower price. Buy one, get one free deals are promoted to supermarkets by suppliers, many of which have huge marketing budgets. They use such deals as a way to market their products and get people to buy them in the future. Most of the big supermarket suppliers, such as Mars and Proctor and Gamble, have marketing budgets that supermarkets could only dream about. That is the reality of the situation. The ombudsman will do nothing to help the consumer or the small supplier. If anything, it will benefit only the bureaucracy that is set up, which will be self-serving, and big, multinational corporations, which can fend for themselves.</p>

There may be bad deals, but I hope the Government will not interfere in every commercial discussion between two companies and try to fathom out who has got the best arrangement. That should be left for the free market to decide, because the people who benefit most from supermarkets are those who work in them and the consumers.</p>

Ultimately, I hope that the adjudicator will be used as a badge of pride for supermarkets if they get a clean bill of health on an annual basis. I hope it will provide a service to the retail trade in awarding a badge, a tick, to a supermarket because it was found to have done nothing wrong during the year.</p>

One reason for publishing the draft Bill as soon as possible is that if parliamentary time allows, we may be able to make it a first-Session Bill, but that is not within my control. I should also make it clear that the timetable even for publishing the Bill is subject to the necessary Cabinet clearances and the outcome of pre-legislative scrutiny. I hope that hon. Members will understand that, but I can assure them that we are working hard to get the draft Bill published.</p>

               <a name="11040557000335"> It is worth putting our debate into context. A persuasive case for an adjudicator has been made by all parties. As others have done, I remind the House of its genesis. The groceries supply code of practice was recommended by the Competition Commission following its market inquiry into the supply of groceries. Its final report was delivered in April 2008. The commission concluded that, although the exercise of buying power by grocery retailers was in general a good thing for consumers, it could raise concerns in certain limited circumstances. For instance, if retailers transfer excessive risks or unexpected costs to their suppliers in the hope of gaining competitive advantage, it is likely to blunt suppliers’ incentives to invest in new capacity, products and production processes. That is bad for consumers, and the code of practice is intended to remedy the problem.</p>

               <a name="stpa_228"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para57"> 
               <a name="11040557000336"> Like my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley, I believe in the free market and in competition; and like him and others, I believe that our supermarkets do a fantastic job. The Competition Commission has inquired into the matter and made its recommendations, and we are not going outside those in establishing a groceries code adjudicator. Bearing that in mind, it is clear that it is not some sort of dramatic interventionist policy; I believe that it goes with the flow of ensuring fair dealings in that market.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_229"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para58"> 
               <a name="11040557000337"> The groceries supply code will apply to all companies active in the sector with an annual retail groceries turnover of £1 billion or more. Its provisions are now included in all retailers’ contracts with their grocery suppliers. It gives suppliers greater security, which should encourage them to invest in their operations. The code sets out a clear and overarching requirement for fair dealing, and bans retailers from imposing retrospective changes to terms and conditions agreed with suppliers. It also limits the extent to which suppliers are required to foot the bill for listings, promotions, inaccurate forecasts by retailers, or customer complaints. In short, the code is about introducing clear standards and greater certainty. As a result, those parts of supply agreements that may subsequently change are discussed up front, and both parties are agreed on how costs and payments will be allocated in such situations.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_230"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para59"> 
               <a name="11040557000338"> The Competition Commission concluded that the code would be far more effective if it was enforced by an adjudicator. That should dispel the climate of fear among suppliers, who felt that they risked being de-listed by their buyers if they invoked the previous code of practice. The commission does not have the power to establish new bodies. After failing to win universal agreement from retailers to establish such a body on a voluntary basis, it asked the then Government to act. The present Government agree that the code of practice needs to be independently monitored and enforced if it is to succeed.</p>

The adjudicator will have the power to accept complaints about retailers’ treatment of primary suppliers from anyone in the supply chain, at home or overseas. That will include indirect suppliers who, like many farmers, may not supply the large supermarkets directly. The adjudicator will have the power to require information from retailers in the course of an investigation so that conclusions are based on reliable evidence. He will also take account of other evidence in the public domain, but will not be obliged to investigate every complaint.</p>

That is an important provision; suppliers can be confident that retailers will not be able to retaliate by discriminating against them, as their identities will be protected. The adjudicator will have a duty to protect suppliers’ identities, and will need to consider whether any of its actions could jeopardise matters before proceeding.</p>

            <p>The initial sanctions include the naming and shaming of individual retailers, and I believe that the ensuing negative publicity will be an effective deterrent. In a highly competitive market, retailers will not want to risk customers going elsewhere in protest at their shoddy behaviour towards suppliers.

 May I return to the timetable? Will the Minister explain why we needed a draft Bill if we are not going beyond the premises of the Competition Commission report of 2008? What is the blockage?

 As I said, we are close to publishing a draft Bill. The hon. Gentleman asks whether it was necessary to publish it in draft form. In the battle for legislative space it was a good tactic to produce a draft Bill, because that ensured that it was in the Queen’s Speech. We are ready if a slot appears; if parliamentary time opens up towards the end of the Session, we have a Bill ready to go. Rather than dragging our feet, I hope that the Department and I have been boxing rather intelligently, thus putting ourselves in a position to do what Members wish.

               <b>Mr Dominic Raab (Esher and Walton) (Con):</b>
 It is a privilege to secure my first Adjournment debate and to hold it under your chairmanship, Mr Gale. I wish to raise the increasingly important topic of protection of competition in the online marketplace and the neutrality of search engines. Free markets require the rule of law and space for robust competition, but they offer no place for monopolistic or cartel abuse, which is as true for the online market as it is for any other. The EU Competition Commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, has stated:</p>
            <a name="110405h0002.htm_brev10"> 
            <a name="11040557000450"> 
            <p class="tabletext">“I believe that the principles of competition must be maintained in the digital economy with the same intensity that they are imposed in the brick and mortar world.”</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_236"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para65"> 
               <a name="11040557000351"> At both national and European levels, rules exist to prevent dominant undertakings resorting to anti-competitive practices to reinforce their position. Those rules do not prohibit or deter success in the global online marketplace. Businesses can hold, secure or maintain a dominant position, but not abuse it, and there is growing evidence that that is exactly what Google is doing.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_237"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para66"> 
               <a name="11040557000352"> Search engines are the gateways to the internet. With a 95% share of the search market in Europe, Google is in a uniquely powerful position. It is the most visited website in 25 of the 27 EU member states.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_238"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para67"> 
               <a name="11040557000353"> Foundem, a UK-based price comparison website, has complained to the European Commission that it, among others, has fallen foul of anti-competitive abuses by Google. The complaint is threefold. First, it was unfairly penalised by the mechanism Google uses to rank search results, especially the exclusionary automated penalty that has been applied to it and other competitors. The effect was to suppress Foundem on Google’s search results. Until December 2009, when it was corrected, Foundem’s rankings on a typical product such as a motor bike helmet were: first by Yahoo, seventh by Bing and 144th by Google. As the top five recommendations on the first page of results account for 88% of hits, Foundem effectively disappeared from the Google landscape. The day after the penalty was lifted, Foundem immediately rose to sixth place on Google’s rankings, so the impact is clear.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_239"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para68"> 
               <a name="11040557000354"> Secondly, Foundem’s complaints concern the review procedure at Google. It took Foundem more than three years to secure the lifting of the arbitrary penalty against it. For a small business in a fast-moving environment and marketplace, that could prove fatal. It did not in this case, but it certainly could for other small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_240"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para69"> 
               <a name="11040557000355"> Thirdly, Foundem says Google distorts search results by imposing its own services in prominent positions. In the two years after Google started promoting its own price comparison website, Google Product Search, UK visitors to that site increased by 125%. Over the same period, visitors to the UK’s leading price-comparison websites fell by an average of 41%, so the discrepancy is stark. The fact that the European Commission has decided formally to investigate Google shows that these complaints are serious and that they require an answer.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_241"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para70"> 
               <a name="11040557000356"> Let us be clear about an important distinction that underpins competition law. It is one thing to sell space, ranking or priority online, but it is another thing altogether deliberately to stack the deck against potential rivals  <br/>

               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para71"> 
               <a name="11040557000357"> I understand that the Minister may feel tempted to defer to the European Commission inquiry, but Britain must also ask whether enough is being done to prevent such abuse and why we have to wait for the cumbersome, clumping, clumsy conclusions of the European Commission to preserve our own free market at home. I would welcome the Minister’s views on this vital area of policy.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_243"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para72"> 
               <a name="11040557000358"> As a matter of domestic policy, there might be a prescriptive solution. I am not one to call for extra regulation or legislation, but one of the points that Foundem makes is that it champions the principle of search neutrality. That states that search engines should be transparent about the rationale and mechanism behind their online results rankings and that affected sites should have access to a timely appeals process.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_244"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para73"> 
               <a name="11040557000359"> The second principle advanced by Foundem is that search engines should not be allowed to discriminate in favour of their own services while maintaining the guise of neutrality. If their own products are inserted into search results, they could be identified in the same way as sponsored links. There is no reason for Google not to advertise its own wares, but it is something of a fraud to dress it up for the consumer under the ostensible impartiality of ordinary search engine results.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_245"> 
               <a name="110405h0002.htm_para74"> 
               <a name="11040557000360"> The proposals could be considered on a voluntary or industry-wide code basis or under legislation. I am fairly open-minded about that. An alternative solution is to focus on the more rigorous enforcement of the existing powers that domestic authorities have to preserve competition. After all, the Office of Fair Trading and Ofcom have the necessary authority under the Competition Act 1998 and EU law to issue directions and hand out fines.</p>

               <a name="11040557000361"> I recognise that purists will say that we should resist any intervention in the online search market. Some will argue that the internet is a fast-moving and changing world and that we must be wary of trying to prejudge or predetermine its future development. Unless competition is safeguarded, a flourishing river of competition could become a stagnant pond. Does the Minister agree that far from being incompatible with a robust and rambunctious marketplace, this principle of search neutrality could bolster competition and consumer choice?</p>

               <a name="11040557000362"> Our regulators can already take action, but they have so far proved unwilling to take a proper look at Google. The chief executive of Ofcom talks about the need to avoid suppressing reward for innovation and risk—we can all agree on that along with motherhood and apple pie. With more than a hint of complacency, the chief executive of the OFT has said that most complaints come from</p>

               <a name="11040557000363"> Mr Fingleton says that the OFT would like to see complaints coming from customers themselves. That is all very well, but customers may be oblivious to what Google is surreptitiously doing.</p>

He called for Britain to become a “home of innovation”. He is absolutely right. I hope that the Minister will recognise that there is a risk of that vision being jeopardised by anti-competitive abuse online and that the market must remain an enabling environment for businesses of all kinds, small and large, and not one that is condensed and conditioned to preserve the status quo.</p>

The primary reason why I am speaking in it is that Foundem is based in my constituency of Bracknell. I am very proud of this highly innovative UK technology business, and I am also proud that it is at the forefront of challenging Google in this way. By doing so, it is going into bat for future UK start-ups, particularly in the IT sector.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_253">

               <a name="11040557000369"> I noted that the Government’s new “Start-up Britain” website actually has Google on it, giving away AdWords. I must say that my eyebrows were raised by that and I suspect that, when that website was launched, those of Foundem’s owners were raised too, because when Foundem was launched in 2006 Google’s AdWords were 5p a hit. Overnight, that went to £5 a hit and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton has pointed out, Foundem slipped down the Google search rankings from fourth to 120th. Foundem was never given a reason for that, and it took the company more than three years to have that situation turned around. In that period, Google Product Search went up dramatically, a dramatic amount of money was made and a significant part of the search business was taken by Google.</p>

               <a name="11040557000370"> It is time that we all got real about this. Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading have the necessary legislation—the Competition Act 1998—and EU law to support them. They need to get on with protecting British start-ups, so that those businesses can thrive and there is a fair environment in which they can exist.</p>

In the same year, there was an op-ed piece in <i>The New York Times</i>by one of the founders of Foundem, which basically outlined what had happened to the company in the preceding three years. Anybody who has heard Foundem’s case and seen its PowerPoint presentation would feel  <br/>

            <p>the same way. I encourage the Minister to meet with Foundem’s representatives. I know that they have already requested a meeting with the Minister and I encourage him to see Foundem’s presentation, because it is quite compelling and totally contradicts the view of the OFT’s CEO in 2009.</p>

               <a name="11040557000372"> Finally, I want to open this debate up by saying that it is not only about commerce. Commerce is obviously very important, and Foundem’s case is based on commerce, but the principle here is about where we access services, knowledge and information. Google provides 95% of searches in Europe. If someone goes to Google to search for a dishwasher or a new television, they also go there to search for news and knowledge. We now have Google providing search products, Google News, Google Health and a Google bank. Next we might have a Google dictionary and later on a Google religion. I may be overplaying things, but the reality is that this company has suppressed the growth of a business in my constituency—that is the reality. I do not think that that is in the best interests of this country, and I do not think that one company having that amount of power is in the best interests of this country, either.</p>

               <a name="11040557000373"> Google is part of the infrastructure of the internet. That is the reality. If we stopped people on the street and asked them, “What is the internet?”, most of them would view it as starting with a search engine. And for search engines, 90% of Britons use Google. Google is to be congratulated on achieving such a powerful position in the world economy, but because it has that position, it needs to be subject to regulation so that companies such as Foundem and many others in the future can get a fair hearing in the world economy.</p>

However, they certainly seem to have held on to that advantage for a significant amount of time. It is perfectly appropriate for the competition authorities, when appropriate and when a matter is referred to them, to look into those organisations.</p>

If someone wants to set up a retailer providing a service, they do not have to go and buy land or rent property—or take on, say, the established supermarkets in trying to provide better products. The regulations are much lower for the internet and people can set up a website at very low cost.</p>

 I just want to expand on my hon. Friend the Minister’s analogy of the internet being like going to the shops. There is a sense with Google that there is one big motorway that we all travel along to go to a set of shops, some of which Google itself owns. The problem is that there are not enough roads to lots of different shops, because there is a perception that people go to Google to go shopping.</p>

 Absolutely. In effect, I was going to agree with my hon. Friend’s point before he made it, in the sense that the internet is seen as being different because it is possible to set up a new company and to compete relatively cost-effectively on it. One only has to look at, for example, the rise of Groupon, which is another one of these phenomenal companies. It effectively started from zero and now, within about 18 months, it is worth an estimated $20 billion. One also sees it in the market of political journalism, which I could say is a market close to our hearts. Nevertheless, there should be concerns when there appear to be dominant providers on the internet.</p>

Friend the Member for Esher and Walton is aware, there is an EU anti-trust probe into alleged abuses by Google, concerning allegations about the manipulation of its search results, the consequent unfavourable treatment of its unpaid and sponsored results and the preferential placement of Google’s own services. Although my hon. Friend said that the process of the EU’s anti-trust probe was going to be clunky and time-consuming, I remind him that the EU challenged Microsoft a few years ago and fined it substantially. This process regarding Google will be effective, as it continues, in establishing whether any of the allegations that have been made against it are true and need to be remedied.</p>

It might well be that we have not anticipated Facebook’s next threat, but that it will manifest itself in two or three years’ time. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that Microsoft has asked to be joined in this action against Google and Microsoft makes some interesting points. The position that Google would take—perfectly justifiably—is that alternative search methods are just “one click away”. Indeed, I understand that we have something like 177 UK search engines serving the UK market at the moment.</p>

For example, its introduction of predictive text when searching for a piece of music in effect meant that the phrase was filled in with BitTorrent, almost directing someone to pirate sites to download music. That has now been remedied by Google, and it is now also very good at addressing concerns about its AdSense product. That product allows adverts to appear on appropriate sites with appropriate content, but they were often appearing on sites that promoted pirated music. Google is now happy to remove those ads, if notified by the rights holders. I also know that the company is keen to work with rights holders on notice and take-down issues, and will take down search results that direct users to private sites, provided that it is notified and given adequate evidence.</p>

Search rankings are one reason why Google is so popular. They are the holy grail, and the algorithm is the secret formula that provides swift and accurate search findings.</p>

               <b>Mr John Leech (Manchester, Withington) (LD):</b>
 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr Gale. I am delighted to have secured this short debate. Most of my remarks will relate to Barlow Moor library on the Merseybank estate. This debate was sparked by the decision of the Labour-run Manchester city council to close the library as part of its cost-cutting programme. Before I give the House a brief history of Barlow Moor library and the council’s policy on the provision of library services, I pay tribute to the staff who work in library services in Manchester. I suppose that I ought to declare an interest, as I hold Friday surgeries in three of the libraries in my constituency: Chorlton, Withington and Didsbury. I appreciate the work that the staff do to accommodate my surgeries and, more important, to make libraries a welcoming place and encourage more people to use our local library services.</p>

               <a name="11040557000399"> Manchester has certainly had a tough Budget settlement —it has been particularly hard due to the front-loading of spending reductions—but the Labour council has responded by using the settlement as an excuse for cuts that it has wanted to carry out for many years but never thought that it could get away with politically. It is making politically motivated cuts with the intention of discrediting the coalition and the coalition’s attempts to tackle the Budget deficit.</p>

               <a name="11040557000400"> When the Labour council announced its budget, it included the axing of numerous front-line services, including libraries and leisure centres. Labour said that there was no alternative, blaming the Budget settlement and coalition cuts. Interestingly, the Liberal Democrat opposition on the council proposed an alternative budget that would have kept all the leisure centres and libraries open, but it was voted down by Labour.</p>

               <a name="11040557000401"> However, it was not the alternative budget that nailed the lie that there was no alternative to cutting front-line services such as Barlow Moor library and leisure centres; it was the huge community campaign in the constituency next door against the closure of Levenshulme baths. The council’s position was that it had no alternative but to close the baths, but it has done a U-turn, and Levenshulme baths will now remain open. The council failed to con people into believing that there was no alternative and got cold feet once a community campaign was up and running with enormous local support.</p>

               <a name="11040557000402"> Why does the council want to close Barlow Moor library? The simple fact is that it has wanted to run down the library service on the Merseybank estate for years. It has made no real commitment to maintaining the local library, concentrating resources instead on the main libraries, including a multi-million-pound investment in the city centre. The council has shown a serious lack of commitment to Barlow Moor library over the years. Even before I was elected as a local councillor, one of the first campaigns in which I was ever involved opposed plans by the Labour council to reduce Barlow Moor library’s hours to save money. At the time, we warned that reducing the library’s hours would ultimately threaten its future, which is proving true.</p>

After the library was burned down, it was agreed that the council should delay rebuilding while discussions continued about revamping the shops and the opportunity for a joint service centre on Merseybank avenue, which would have secured the future of Barlow Moor library for years to come.</p>

               <a name="11040557000404"> However, it is unfortunately now clear that the council never had any intention of pressing ahead with that much-needed investment. Although the plans were supported by council officers, local Liberal Democrat councillors and local people on the estate, they were dropped by Labour councillors. The council’s Labour leader, Richard Leese, stated in a council meeting that Merseybank was not a priority for the council—a shameful remark—despite the fact that Merseybank falls within the top 5% of deprivation in the country.</p>

               <a name="11040557000405"> Why was the library not simply rebuilt with the insurance money? That would seem fairly sensible, and insurance was paid out, but unfortunately it appears that the payout was not enough to rebuild the library. The council spent half of it securing the site and removing the remains of the building. That is a scandal, and we still do not know what happened to the rest of the money. Instead, the temporary library on the other side of the road has remained, but it has been open for only 15 hours a week. Given that it is open for so few hours, is it any wonder that library usage at Barlow Moor is lower than at any other permanent library in Manchester? There is a lot of uncertainty about when the library is open. Residents often tell me that they are never sure when the Barlow Moor library will be open, so they choose to use other libraries that are open longer.</p>

The library service in Manchester says that there is evidence that a significant number of mobile library users also visit permanent libraries.

Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr Leech) on securing this important debate. He spoke with passion and eloquence on the library in his constituency that he seeks to keep open.

As the Minister with responsibility for libraries, my first point is that library provision is still very much a local service, albeit with a statutory underpinning to which I shall return in a moment. One of the things that I was keen to stress when I became a Minister was that libraries are a local service, which means a number of things. It is important that they are a local service, because one would expect the local council to understand the local community and to know its varied needs, which are different in different parts of the community. The idea that that provision could be second-guessed from Whitehall is absolute nonsense.</p>

               <a name="11040557000417"> It is also important that local councils engage with their local communities in the running of their local library services. One of the things that I have found disappointing over the past few months, as library closures have reared their heads and campaigns have started, is that some councils—I would not dream of naming any of them—did not engage more with their library services many years ago to see what opportunities were available. Some truly innovative councils have realised that libraries are an extraordinary resource to support the local community. Yes, they are about books and literature, but, in the 21st century, they are also about access to the internet, education, adult education and learning, and about access to health, council and community services. Those councils that have seen and seized that opportunity have provided go-ahead library services.</p>

               <a name="11040557000418"> It is also important to stress—I say this as a matter of principle, with no reference to the specific case raised by my hon. Friend—that, sometimes, closing a library does not necessarily mean that the service is being run down. I always think about the service in Tower Hamlets, where a number of libraries were closed to create a much more vibrant library service. It provided access for a much wider part of the community, particularly young people, simply by investing in core libraries and looking at the different services that different parts of the community wanted. I also look, at a time of cuts, at library services that not only sustain their existing service, but go ahead and open new libraries. For example, the royal borough of Windsor and Maidenhead plans to open more libraries and is putting police points in its library service, because it understands that it is a community service. Hillingdon has also refurbished its library estate.</p>

 Again, I hesitate to comment on the specific example. Suffice to say that one reason why we support libraries as local services is that the council should be free to reorganise its library service in the way that it sees best. It should also, however, consult local people, and there will clearly be disagreements about the strategy. For example, I remember a vigorous discussion in Swindon, which is, perhaps, a parallel case. Swindon opened a brand new central library and was going to close the old town library, and there was a campaign to keep it open. Bizarrely, the solution, which was to close the old town library but move it into the arts centre around the corner, has transformed that library. When people visit the arts centre or attend an evening performance, they end up looking at the library as well, and visits to it have increased significantly. There are, therefore, solutions, some of which can be imaginative.</p>

               <a name="11040557000421"> My hon. Friend mentioned a volunteer network to sustain libraries, which is an important point. I have been pilloried in the past for suggesting that volunteers should play a key role in sustaining library services. I do not want to sound like I am crying over spilled milk, but I have been misrepresented by being seen to suggest that volunteers should replace professional staff, which is not my view at all. I certainly know, however, that volunteers work in libraries throughout the country and, as my hon. Friend has indicated, if they can be brought into the fold, they can keep an existing library open for longer at the times when the community wants to use it. As my hon. Friend has indicated, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: if the local council keeps the library shut for the majority of the week, fewer people will use it and the local council will then say, “Very few people use this library, so there is no justification for keeping it open.”</p>

               <a name="11040557000422"> Although this sounds extraordinarily perverse, I think that, when a library is under threat, there is a massive opportunity to embrace volunteers. For example, in my own constituency, where Grove library is threatened with closure by the county council, I have engaged with the local community and have actively suggested that it seek to staff the library with volunteers. I have also gone further—this is in my role as a constituency MP—and suggested that, even if the council reprieves Grove library, it should still hold on to the volunteer spirit that has emerged through the desire to keep it open. Too often, we sit back passively and allow libraries to be run in a passive-receive mode by a local council, but if we engage with them, we can have them open when we want, and they can start to provide the additional services wanted and suggested by people, which is a much more open process. I hope that Grove library is reprieved—although that will be a decision for the county council—and that a volunteer network will continue to support that library in the future.</p>

It is important that such best practice is shared between local authorities. One of the frustrations that I felt was that some local councils were perhaps trying to reinvent the wheel or to start from scratch when examining their library service, instead of learning from their peers about how they could engage local communities in their libraries, provide additional services and, indeed, save costs. Another frustration is that there are 151 library authorities and 151 sets of overheads. I hope that there will be progress in shared services across council boundaries. That might apply to Manchester, where a Greater Manchester library service could be put in place.</p>

Some people think it happened twice, because they include Derbyshire but, in fact, it has happened only once with the Wirral in, I think, 2009. I campaigned for the then Secretary of State to call in the Wirral, and I am one of the few people who opine on the subject who bothered to go to the Wirral.

Since becoming the Minister with responsibility for libraries, I have written at least twice to the leaders and chief executives of library authorities to remind them not only of their statutory duty, but of the steps that they should take to ensure that they are providing a comprehensive library service.</p>

It has opened six new libraries in the past seven years, including three in 2010. I am told that the council is planning to open two more next year and that several of its libraries operate in shared buildings. Co-location is a very good example of best practice, because one increases the footfall and new members coming through. What saddens me is that the leaders of Manchester council should be trying to convince local people in making the case for its strategy. It seems that it has put itself in a position of conflict with the local community, particularly in terms of Barlow Moor. In fact, it should be engaging and looking at a solution that delivers not only the required savings, but a service that is much desired by my hon. Friend’s constituents.</p>
