Ian Gibson (Norwich, North) (Lab):</b> Thank you,
Mr. Olner. That was observant at this time of the
morning.</p><p><a name="06102452000012">I present
the debate with heartfelt sympathy for the Minister, who has been
dragged away from his weekly five-a-side football match, in which he
excels. Today, he has been given the opportunity to excel in examining
a serious problem. I am sure that he takes it in that spirit.
</p><p><a name="06102452000013">May I say to the
Minister and many others who play five-a-side football that this is a
serious issue, in terms not just of single events, but of a whole
service that is being provided in this country? There is growing
antipathy in certain quarters to what is happening to the services that
customers and clients get from different companies, such as banks and
insurance companies. I shall explain that
later.</p><p><a name="06102452000014">From the 1970s
onwards, it was clear that call centres were here to stay, because of
the internet, modern technology and so on, in the sense that it is
possible to access information across the globe by pressing a button or
two. In the farming industry, technology put people on the dole for
ever more and meant that we did not need agricultural workers.
Technology moves things forward, but it has its
repercussions.</p><p><a name="06102452000015">I got
involved in the subject because of events at Norwich Union a few months
ago. I must hold my hand up and say that I have a deep passion for its
workers. Along with Clive Jenkins and Lady Muriel Turner, I helped to
organised them into the Association of Scientific, Technical and
Managerial Staffs in the heady days of the 1970s, when white-collar
trade unionism was on the up and people suddenly realised that working
with a pen did not mean that they should not have proper terms and
conditions. We know that white-collar trade unionism became very
important. After about 55 mergers, the ASTMS has now become Amicus, and
things are not finished yet; merger mania is upon us in the trade union
movement as well.</p><p><a name="06102452000016">My
constituency party has a constituency agreement with Amicus. The union
there is vibrant and continues to campaign for the terms and conditions
of many people, not only in Norwich, but across the country where the
Norwich Union is organised. The Norwich Union is not the Norwich Union
any more, because it is part of a bigger company, Aviva, which I
believe is the fifth largest insurance company in the country.

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 350WH</b><br>Some 4,000 job losses were mentioned a few months ago; Norwich will take
about 1,000 of those&#151;I believe the figure is 850&#151;and a
large percentage of the 4,000 will be offshored.</p><p><a name="06102452000017">That causes great consternation
and makes one wonder about the future of a company that at one time
took every school leaver in Norwich. People intermarried within the
company. When I first went to Norwich it was, in a sense, a one-horse
town: people played their sport in the wonderful facilities that they
had there; they lived, worked and died there, and so on. Their loyalty
and service to that organisation was second to
none.</p><p><a name="06102452000018">I found it
disturbing that the union was informed of what was going to happen only
a few minutes before the redundancies were announced. I was informed by
the chief executive the night before, at a medical writers awards
ceremony in the Tate gallery. Some effort was made to talk to people,
but it did not meet the requirement set out by the Department of Trade
and Industry, which
states:</p><a name="61024h0001.htmbrev_53"><a name="06102452000399"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Companies
should consider all the implications before taking offshoring
decisions. Stakeholders including their customers, employees and trade
unions, should be consulted before decisions are made. UK call centres
should not compete with offshore contact centres on the basis of low
costs, but they can by improving quality, demonstrating a viable
alternative to the inherent risks of offshoring. Evidence suggests that
there are a large number of hidden and poorly understood costs
associated with offshoring, such as the cost of relocating senior
management, travel costs, and customer discontent.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000019">I guess that I accuse the firm
of flouting that solid advice and of not engaging in good management
employee practice. This has happened at a time when the company is not
failing&#151;the chief executive gets about &#163;1.3 million a
year, which, although peanuts compared with the pay of some chief
executives in FTSE companies in the City of London, is still a large
sum. Someone makes a lot of money, as usual, but other people lose
their jobs and livelihoods, and others wonder what might happen to
them.</p><p><a name="06102452000020">Offshoring is a
phenomenon that has been taking place not just in Norwich Union, but
across the country. Banks and insurance companies have different
experiences of how it might be carried out, the relative successes and
so on. Regulation of employees in the UK is fairly reasonable and well
handled. There is not much concern about that, but there is concern
about the same company operating in another country and how regulation
does or does not&#151;as is the case most of the
time&#151;happen.</p><p><a name="06102452000021">There
are many worries besides the generality of regulation. For example,
this weekend&#151;I am sure as punishment for raising the
debate&#151;I received six phone calls from New Delhi telling me that
the weather was good in Norwich, that we had just beaten Cardiff City,
that Delia was happy and had gone to mass again, and everything in the
garden was lovely. I received three silent calls as well. I have a lot
of tolerance&#151;I will even forgive the Minister for missing open
goals when playing for the parliamentary football team&#151;but it is
stretched a bit when I receive silent calls or when I get people
telling me what the weather is like outside my window.</p><p><a name="06102452000022">One wonders what it is all
about, why it happens and so on, but one gets used to it and lives with
it. People

can do about it.&#148; Indeed, there was an amazing discovery in a
leaked document highlighted by <i>The Observer</i>, which found that
there is a great apathy in the British population about what people can
do about the problem. However, that does not mean that they are happy
about it.</p><p><a name="06102452000023">One thing
about such a debate is that we get peppered by papers from all sorts of
sources. Norwich Union is a good friend of mine, on and off, and it has
told me its position. It is keen on the global economy and its
representatives went to the Chancellor&#146;s meeting at Downing
street last week, so it has some significance and importance in terms
of moving things forward on the global front. It thinks that there are
benefits of offshoring</p><a name="61024h0001.htmbrev_54"><a name="06102452000400"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in terms of increased capability,
greater flexibility and reduced
cost.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000024">I think that
Amicus disagrees with that, and there is a lot of argument going on
about who is right and who is wrong. However, Norwich Union admits
that</p><a name="61024h0001.htmbrev_55"><a name="06102452000401"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we do not pretend
that all aspects of our offshore customer service are yet 100 per cent.
as we would like
them&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000025">Although it thinks
that there is an improvement in customer services, it acknowledges that
there are several problems, of which I have illustrated just a few.
</p><p><a name="06102452000026">There are devastating
effects of moving people out of positions and jobs in the local
community at a time of high employment. I suppose we can get away with
it, but some of my constituents come to see me or sit at football
matches in Norwich&#151;or, rather, they mostly stand, and that is
getting quite ridiculous, incidentally&#151;and say, &#147;We are
about to be made redundant at Norwich Union.&#148; So people are
worried about what they will have to do. That does not mean that they
cannot find the bus fare to go to watch Norwich City.</p><p><a name="06102452000027">Offshoring is a problem not
just in Norwich or other parts of this country; it also happens in the
United States. Hon. Members will know about its car industry, and that
became part of a major debate in the 2004 US presidential election.
Businesses there were criticised for offshoring jobs and using them not
just as offshore jobs but as tax havens. Taking call centres overseas
provides not just the generalities to which Norwich Union referred, but
access to a low-wage economy. It also affects VAT and customer
satisfaction, which may or may not be
present.</p><p><a name="06102452000028">My answer to
the problem of low wages in countries such as India is simple. I would
let a union such as Amicus&#151;it negotiates with people in
Norwich&#151;loose in India so that the people there had the pay
rates to ensure that call centres worked efficiently. There has been a
reaction in India, and it is not just strikes, but there was a strike
there not long after the Norwich events. The work came back to Norwich,
where people had to field it because the Indian workers had gone on
strike.</p><p><a name="06102452000029">Other
companies are finding that with increasing demand for better living
conditions, wages and so on, they can shift work in the global
economy&#151;would that Chomsky was believed&#151;to many other
places, but the fact that work can be moved from England to India is 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 352WH</b><br>only part of the matter. It can also be moved from India to the
Philippines, as some companies have done, or to China, although the
Chinese economy is developing. Companies can play the global market,
but at the end of the day people who work for them are
disbenefited.</p><p><a name="06102452000030">Client
satisfaction is important and lack of it, as well as political events,
may mean that call centres do not have the future that they were
thought to have. I am not a protectionist and I do not maintain that
jobs must be British. A global company such as Norwich Union must
provide customers with the best service, but there are question marks
about that, and not just with companies that have brought services back
to Britain because they could be provided better here. I shall briefly
explain some of the problems, which I am sure other hon. Members will
take up.</p><p><a name="06102452000031">Evidence has
been produced in several newspapers&#151;no one has argued against
it&#151;that electronic databases can be sold for a fee. I hear
sometimes that that is cheap and sometimes that it is expensive. In
this country, we have data protection legislation and we are protected,
so we do not have those silly phone calls on Sundays, but databases can
be sold and that has happened with
offshoring.</p><p><a name="06102452000032">I said
that people go on strike and work forces do not stay around for long,
but work forces in India are well educated and many people are
graduates. They stay for about two years and then move on. However,
they do not have local knowledge, although we have problems enough with
that in this country. I know of a case in Norwich when a 999 call was
shunted through Cambridge. The ambulance went to someone who had had a
heart attack, but it went to the wrong end of the street, where
bollards were blocking it, so it had to go all the way round again and
the poor chap died. That was an extreme case, but local knowledge is
important. It is also important when trying to get train times. There
are limitations on what can be put out to offshore companies. It is not
impossible, but it is difficult to find a work force with the knowledge
that successful call centres in this country have had for some
time.</p><p><a name="06102452000033">Consumers are
becoming dissatisfied and there is talk about regional accents and not
understanding what people are saying. I am not too bothered about that
because people usually understand when they want to. They may moan a
little, but that is not a major feature, although lack of local
knowledge is. There is increasing dissatisfaction&#151;I referred to
the secret document leaked to <i>The Observer</i>&#151;over customer
service and the information provided. I shall not quote figures because
the survey was not particularly great, but, as Norwich Union
acknowledged, it showed that many people are dissatisfied with what is
happening. I know that there is dissatisfaction because I know people
who have left Norwich Union and have not renewed their house insurance
and so on. It is not a major boycott at this stage, but that could
happen if dissatisfaction increased. It is important to introduce
regulations so that people know that they are receiving the best
service.</p><p><a name="06102452000034">Customers
often feel that they are kept waiting deliberately while the meter is
running. Call centres based in the UK feature in advertising as the
best, and companies such as Direct Line and NatWest say that 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 353WH</b><br>their call centres are based in the UK. More and more companies are
bringing call centres back to the UK and providing a better service,
and I suggest that that will increase. If we want to prevent such
practices, we must stop the non-regulation of selling databases and
improve the customer service received by clients, which is not always
satisfactory, as Norwich Union admits. Our customers deserve the best
service and that can happen with call centres. I am not arguing against
call centres in principle, but they must operate professionally and
give people the best and most accurate
information.</p><p><a name="06102452000035">Enforcement
of regulations is also important. People may be apathetic at times, but
they perceive call centres as tax havens. That rankles when they see
companies taking jobs away from places such as Norwich and putting them
elsewhere for monetary reasons. Companies argue that that saves money,
but they are subtle. They may say that they are taking 1,000 jobs away
but creating them in another area. Norwich Union bought up the RAC and
provided call centre jobs there. That may look good for work in
Norwich, but I believe that offshoring call centres may increase and
that more and more jobs will disappear. That has happened two or three
times in Norwich and it is slow attrition. No longer can every school
leaver expect a job.</p><p><a name="06102452000036">I
do not think that the world should stay still, but I am not sure that
Norwich Union&#146;s policy on where it is going and how it will keep
its high profile in the community in Norwich is clear to the public. It
may build football stands and so on and contribute to
charities&#151;that is very welcome&#151;but there are questions
about its provision of jobs and
training.</p><p><a name="06102452000037">I referred
to data protection legislation, and there is a lot of evidence that
data including names and telephone numbers are being transmitted, as
well as credit card details. There is also evidence of financial
swindles, money being misappropriated from accounts and so on. That
happens everywhere in the world, and I am not saying that it happens in
one place and not another, but companies should not consider offshoring
without considering how to block such problems. There will always be a
few Nick Leesons, and I am happy with that as long as we catch them,
but I do not want 100 Nick Leesons. The media have picked up on the
subject, and they are starting to push it forward. Many people get
their information from the media, and fraud and credit card swindles
have been documented on programmes such as
&#147;Dispatches&#148;.</p><p><a name="06102452000038">If the same company employs
people in India, why cannot data protection law be applied to that
country? Do we just allow events to happen without negotiation? Norwich
Union&#146;s position is that it provides a better service, and that
there are few such episodes, but we are opening a Pandora&#146;s box
of more swindle as less regulation is put on the system.</p><p><a name="06102452000039">The cost of labour is an issue
in developing countries. With the Government&#146;s position of
helping countries in the developing world, it does not do us any good
to make poverty history and then to make poverty by creating in other
countries the situations that I described. The regulations and
legislation must be analysed, and union interaction with the company

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 354WH</b><br>should be at its best. The Department for Trade and Industry&#146;s
best position was put forward in 2003, and it seems to be slipping
away.</p><p><a name="06102452000040">I am cynical
and old enough to know that companies do not really care; they will do
what they can. In the House later today, we will discuss Enron and the
absolute swindles that take place. There are also minor swindles. The
more we stamp them out, the better the world will be. It means dealing
not only with the problem in our country, but with our relationships
with other countries. I welcome those relationships and the interchange
of professionals, but a company cannot behave one way in one country
and a different way in another.</p><p><a name="06102452000041">We do not have regulation, but
self-regulation, and it does not work. The problem will grow because of
the lack of regulation. As long as there is money and transactions, the
Nick Leeson society will be with us, and it takes a lot of time and
energy to prevent it. Many companies that go down the road of
offshoring come back again, because they find that it does not have the
advantage of saving costs. If we are not to go down that same road, we
must address the problem now.</p><p><a name="06102452000042">There have been many debates in
the Chamber about the problem, and things have been done about
telephone numbers and so on. I am not saying that the Government have
failed to recognise the problems, but we need a serious inquiry and
examination into what is happening. We want to ensure that employees do
not learn on local radio that they are going to be made redundant, as
happened in Norwich, and that proper consultation takes place. It may
be that we can effect an arrangement that makes people want to work in
another country, because the terms and conditions, including pensions,
are not maligned by pursuing that path.</p><p><a name="06102452000043">We are on the edge of the
precipice, and I ask the Minister to set up an inquiry to prevent any
further disillusionment among the public about the services that they
receive, be they from a bank or from an insurance
company.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61024h0001.htmordayhd_27"><a name="06102452000420">9.54

Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) has made, and I congratulate him
on bringing this important debate to Parliament today.</p><p><a name="06102452000045">The debate is particularly
important given that Norwich Union, which is close to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s heart, has shed 4,000 jobs. While I was doing some
research for this debate, I was intrigued to discover that on 24
September <i>The Observer</i> considered whether overseas sourcing of
call centres resulted in a cheaper product for the customer&#151;the
justification that many organisations such as Norwich Union, or Aviva
as it is now known, produce. Interestingly, <i>The Observer</i>
discovered that on car insurance, Norwich Union was three times more
expensive than the cheapest company, Direct Line, which has all its
call centres in the United Kingdom. It is questionable whether cost
savings translate into better customer service.</p><p><a name="06102452000046">The hon. Gentleman touched on
the effect on the economy. I am concerned about the effects on women,
because call centres can offer flexible and part-time

counterparts, who tend to predominate in backroom business processing.
I was also interested to discover that the Department for Trade and
Industry has estimated that 200,000 extra jobs will be created in call
centres in the next three years, which is somewhat contradictory to the
doom and gloom that we have heard about. I shall be interested to hear
from the Minister how that will translate in the United
Kingdom&#146;s economy.</p><p><a name="06102452000047"><b><a name="61024h0001.htm_spnew408"><a name="06102452000440">Mark
Williams (Ceredigion) (LD):</b> My hon. Friend knows about the
importance of the sector to us in Wales, with 30,000 jobs based in the
south-east corner of the country. Does my hon. Friend agree that with
the inevitable growth of offshoring, a far more robust regulatory
regime is needed? The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)
agrees, and so do I. My hon. Friend has read the same reports as I have
about illegal buying and selling of personal information in India. Does
she agree that the fundamental point for consumers is local knowledge
and information? When one represents a constituency such as mine, which
includes towns with colourful names such as Pontrhydfendigaid and
Aberystwyth, and which adjoins constituencies with towns such as
Machynlleth, local knowledge that responds to customer need is
important.</p><p><a name="06102452000048"><b><a name="61024h0001.htm_spnew409"><a name="06102452000441">Mr.

Burt:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for
Ceredigion (Mark Williams) for his informed intervention. The points
that he makes are right.</p><p><a name="06102452000050">Customer satisfaction and local
knowledge are important. Returning to the Norwich Union example, the
research that the company undertook before outsourcing its jobs
discovered that 51 per cent. of respondents were appalled at the
prospect of outsourcing call centres abroad. However, it does not seem
to have had any effect on the company&#146;s final
decision.</p><p><a name="06102452000051">I am
particularly concerned about disadvantaged individuals such as people
from poorer backgrounds and those, like myself, who suffer from blood
pressure problems. I am sorry to say that with call centres in the
United Kingdom, including, I am sorry to say sometimes Government call
centres, blood pressure can be a real problem. One must be emotionally
calm and well psyched up before calling, so that one does not end
up&#151;in my case&#151;cross, tearful or both by the end of the
call, as a result of frustration at being unable to obtain the
information that one needs, or even to get through to the individual
whom one needs to speak to, in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p><a name="06102452000052">The quality of the information
that is given has also been called into question. Call centres are not
regulated for their quality of financial advice, as banks are. In
<i>The Guardian</i> on 18 October, there was an article about
misleading advice given by a call centre on individual voluntary
arrangements. The individuals who gave the

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 356WH</b><br>advice stood to benefit from giving that advice. Obviously, the quality
of the advice given must be monitored
scrupulously.</p><p><a name="06102452000053">Telemarketing
is a &#163;4 billion industry in the United Kingdom. There is a big
challenge for telemarketing companies, because 13 million people are
registered with the telephone preference service. If the hon. Gentleman
wishes to see me afterwards I shall give him the details of how he can
register, but I suspect that he is interested to find out what
unsolicited calls he will get. Will the Minister comment on the idea
that seems to be gaining ground in the field of telemarketing that,
rather than people having to opt out of receiving cold calls, the
Government should consider introducing legislation whereby people have
to opt in? That would be beneficial for the telemarketing companies,
which are fishing in a smaller and smaller pool. If they were fishing
in a pool that wanted to be fished, that might benefit both the blood
pressure of residents who do not want to receive cold calls and the
marketing companies, who would be fishing more
productively.</p><p><a name="06102452000054">It would
not be right for me to finish without mentioning silent calls, which
were the subject of a Westminster Hall debate in March. The Government
target of 3 per cent. for abandoned calls is welcome, as are the
requirements that before a call is ended there must be a recorded
message and that the number must be accessible on 1471. The fine has
been increased from &#163;5,000 to &#163;50,000 but&#151;it is a
very big &#147;but&#148;&#151;regulation will not work unless it
is enforced. I am sorry to say that, following the criticisms levelled
at Ofcom about the enforcement of rules on silent calls and other such
matters, there is little evidence that the situation has improved. I
hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me by giving examples
of cases in which Ofcom has prosecuted somebody for the iniquitous
practices that cause so much distress to local
people.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61024h0001.htmordayhd_28"><a name="06102452000421">10.3

Hendry (Wealden) (Con):</b> I start by congratulating the hon.
Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on securing this debate and on
introducing it in his customary style, which is always a delight to
listen to. I doubt that any other Member of the House could bring
Amicus, Norwich City football club and Chomsky into a debate on call
centres. He always enlivens, entertains and educates us, and I pay
tribute to him for raising issues on which every hon. Member and their
constituents would agree. None of us have had letters from constituents
saying how well call centres work and what a wonderful service they get
from them. We get a considerable amount of correspondence, including
emails, about their failings and the need for them to
improve.</p><p><a name="06102452000056">As the hon.
Gentleman explained, the background to this debate is the decision of
Norwich Union to outsource a significant amount of its call centre
activity, reducing its work force in that field by some 11 per cent. I
understand that it is not happening only in Norwich, although 850 of
the 4,000 jobs will be lost there. There will also be reductions in
York, Glasgow, Sheffield, Cambridge, Perth, Newcastle, Eastleigh,
Stevenage, Bristol, Worthing, Belfast and Birmingham. The list sounds
rather like a cross-country train journey with Virgin Trains. A massive
number of centres will be affected.</p><br>

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 357WH</b><br><p><a name="06102452000057">We understand why Norwich Union
felt it necessary to make such changes. I shall come on to issues of
good practice shortly, but we recognise the competitiveness of the
world in which Norwich Union operates and understand why such decisions
have to be made. They are not easy, but for the future viability and
vitality of a company, the decision to move offshore must sometimes be
made. Norwich Union&#146;s follows similar decisions taken by
companies such as Royal &amp; SunAlliance, which announced in June that
it would cut 1,500 jobs in its call centres by 2008.</p><p><a name="06102452000058">We should consider such
announcements against the background of the call centre industry in
this country, which has been a significant success story. It
contributed &#163;17 billion to the UK economy last year, so it is an
extremely large and important contributor to our national wealth.
Astonishingly, it is predicted that by 2007, more than 1 million
people&#151;4 per cent. of the UK working population&#151;will be
employed in call centres. It is important for the industry to realise
that we recognise the important contribution that it can make. The
Secretary of State for Health, when she was Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry, said that we had a &#147;vibrant call centre
industry&#148; and that the Government were keen to encourage
it.</p><p><a name="06102452000059">Much of the debate
on outsourcing focuses on India, but we should not lose sight of the
fact that it is a global industry. Call centre expertise is being
developed in the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, South Africa and
elsewhere. When considering India, we often tend to think that people
outsource activity there only because they believe it will be cheaper.
If one speaks to the Indian companies involved, one finds out that they
do not see that as being their remit at all. They want to be involved
in a high-value industry that attracts graduates and highly qualified
people, often in working conditions that are much better than can be
found in other parts of India. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the
Opposition, when he was in India recently, spoke to someone who heads
up a major call centre about his global plans. He was told,
&#147;Yes, we are investing globally. Our next planned location is in
Northern Ireland.&#148; Indian call centre companies are therefore
investing back into the United Kingdom. We must not let the debate
centre around the idea that outsourcing is just a matter of cheap
labour. Companies would lose their customers if they were not able to
provide a good-quality
service.</p><p><a name="06102452000060">There are
undoubted problems with the way in which the industry operates in the
United Kingdom. It is estimated that call centres in the private sector
are working at between 10 per cent. and 35 per cent. below optimum
efficiency. Some 55 per cent. of companies operating call centres have
reported difficulty in recruiting the right staff, which leads to a
high level of staff turnover. It is estimated that 85 per cent. of
direct corporate customer communication is via the phone. Most people
employed in call centres are between the ages of 18 and 25 and we all
recognise, perhaps from our own children, that those are not the people
best able to communicate with adults on the telephone. My children will
take me to task on that, but a wider range of ages needs to be
represented.</p><p><a name="06102452000061">The
problems are worse in public sector call centres, which are estimated
to be under-performing by 50 per cent. In 2005, the Department for Work
and Pensions

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 358WH</b><br>announced that there had been 13 million abandoned calls in its call
centres. The industry association, the Customer Contact Association,
carried out an assignment for the General Social Care Council in 2005
and was able to increase productivity by a staggering 1,500 per
cent.&#151;that is fifteenfold&#151;in just 30 days. An assessment
of the Royal Mail Group&#146;s contact centres in 2004 indicated an
opportunity to save &#163;27 million, out of a total spend of
&#163;88 million. As Members of Parliament, we consistently come
across Government call centres, be they for tax credits or the Child
Support Agency, that are simply not working as well as they should. It
is easy to see that there has been under-investment in employees and
employee relations, and that the service delivered is not as good as it
should be.</p><p><a name="06102452000062">There are
also other concerns. Too often people find that the location of the
call centre is concealed. I received a phone call a few weekends ago. I
asked the person where they were calling from and they said,
&#147;We&#146;re calling out of Watford.&#148; I said,
&#147;That sounds rather strange. Where do you mean? Are you in
Watford or just outside it?&#148; He replied, &#147;No,
we&#146;re in India&#148;, which I thought took the description
&#145;out of Watford&#146; a little further than one would have
wished. Perhaps there is a Watford near Delhi, although I have not come
across it yet.</p><p><a name="06102452000063">When I
tried to follow the call up and find out how the company had got my
details, I was put through to a number that was unobtainable. I dialled
1471, got through to a recorded message and left a message two or three
times, but I have never received a call back about where the company
got my details. What people find unacceptable is that
deception&#151;that is a fair enough word to use&#151;and people
pretending that they are calling from somewhere relatively nearby when
they are half way round the globe.</p><p><a name="06102452000064">More has to be done to address
working conditions. Call centres are sometimes described as the coal
mines of the 21st century. If they are to be part of a truly vital
industry, we must ensure that working conditions are the best that they
can be. Staff turnover across the industry is approximately 30 per
cent., which leads to huge training costs and problems keeping people
motivated. Paying more attention to the working and employment
conditions might help to address those issues. We also hear concerns
about staff being required to meet impossible targets, with little time
for comfort breaks or any break away from the telephone. There are also
health and safety concerns. The time spent working on calls and at
computers should be limited to 60 per cent. of a day, although 90 per
cent. targets are not uncommon in the
sector.</p><p><a name="06102452000065">The hon.
Members for Norwich, North and for Solihull (Lorely Burt) both raised
the issue of silent calls, which we must without doubt do more to
address. The hon. Lady referred to a debate from earlier this year.
Indeed, a statutory instrument was introduced towards the end last year
that addressed some of the issues relating to silent calls. It is
extremely disappointing that, despite the issues that were raised then,
the commitments that were given by the then Minister, the right hon.
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael), have simply not
been implemented. He said that any abandoned calls must

understanding is that Ofcom is no longer rigorous in requiring
that.</p><p><a name="06102452000066">We all asked in
that debate what the purpose was of increasing the threshold of the
fines by so much if no one had ever been fined at the lower level. We
were told that the higher fine was needed to make the legal actions and
the work involved worth while. It is now many months since that higher
fine was implemented, but as far as I am aware Ofcom has still taken no
action against a single person making silent calls.</p><p><a name="06102452000067">People feel extremely uneasy
when they receive a silent call, particularly older people and women.
Silent calls make them anxious, and it is little wonder that, as the
hon. Member for Solihull said, some 12 million to 13 million people
have registered their numbers with the telephone preference service, to
ensure that they do not receive unwanted phone calls. However, there
are powers available, and we would like to hear from the Minister how
the Government can ensure that they use them
effectively.</p><p><a name="06102452000068">Call
centres are a substantial industry, with the potential to become even
greater. Call centres are evolving into contact centres, which also
provide a range of back-office services, so that more information and
support can be given in the course of a call. It is quite possible that
the number of call centres in this country will increase by about a
half over the next few years. However, if that is to happen, there must
be more investment in staff, so that they are better qualified, and
working conditions must be improved. Measures must be put in place to
reduce the high staff turnover. We must also recognise that without
that investment we will not see the high quality of service that we
want.</p><p><a name="06102452000069">There are two
aspects to the issue, one of which is good practice. The hon. Member
for Norwich, North referred to the fact that the trade union was not
advised of the redundancies until the day they were announced, which is
an example of bad practice. There is good practice, which can be
implemented through the industry itself, but there are also aspects
that need to be addressed through regulation. I have already mentioned
silent calls and integrity, whereby people are honest about where they
are calling from, but callers should also be clear about where
people&#146;s details have been obtained. Invariably, if one asks,
&#147;Well where did you get this number from?&#148;, the caller
will say, &#147;It&#146;s publicly available&#148;, even if one
knows jolly well that it is not a listed telephone number and so is not
publicly available. Callers will never say where they get
people&#146;s details from. It would be quite appropriate for
regulation to be put in place, so that the person receiving the call
has an absolute right to know where their information has been passed
on from, which would be entirely in keeping with data protection
legislation.</p><p><a name="06102452000070">Regulation may also be required
on the cost of calls. Many of us have no idea whether we are being
charged when making a call to a call centre or what the charge rate
should be. Call centres should be up front about charges the moment
callers are connected, perhaps

minute,&#148; so that people are in no doubt how much they are
paying.</p><p><a name="06102452000071">Finally, I
hope that the Minister will be able to deal with some of the
international scams. He may have caught a report on the
&#147;Today&#148; programme this morning about a call centre
operating in Holland that rang people up and encouraged them to buy
dubious stocks that were a bad investment or stocks that did not exist.
A number of people, particularly older people, have fallen for the
operation, but because it operated from Holland it has been extremely
difficult for action to be taken against it. We want to know that the
Government are taking action on an international scale, as the industry
is international.</p><p><a name="06102452000072">Above all, however, some of the
issues can be addressed by the industry itself. At the end of the day,
call centres must recognise what their customers want. Customers will
go along with call centres abroad, as long as the calls are handled in
a way that is polite and courteous, meets their needs and does not
harass them. The industry has huge potential, but it needs to improve
its act if it is to achieve that
potential.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61024h0001.htmordayhd_29"><a name="06102452000422">10.17

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Jim
Fitzpatrick):</b> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair,
Mr. Olner, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the
Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on securing this
opportunity to debate the important matter of call centres. I would
normally also thank him for the opportunity to address the Chamber, but
he has delayed my return to five-a-side football by at least another
week after my recent operation, as he said, so I am not very
appreciative this morning. However, the issue is important and I am
grateful to be here. I am also grateful for the contributions by the
hon. Members for Solihull (Lorely Burt) and for Wealden (Charles
Hendry).</p><p><a name="06102452000074">In the past
decade, call centres have become part of daily life, whether we want to
pay a bill, make a service appointment or contact the bank. We come
across them in a variety of different roles, from direct selling to
customer relationship management, and they are used by nearly all
commercial and industrial sectors, and by the public sector, to reach
their customers.</p><p><a name="06102452000075">There
are more than 5,000 call centres in the UK, employing nearly 800,000
people. Many of those jobs have been created in areas of high
unemployment. According to a recent Office for National Statistics
study, in the three years between 2001 and 2004, employment in IT and
call centres grew twice as rapidly as overall UK employment. This
country&#146;s open and competitive markets, our flexible labour
laws, our relatively low costs, our advanced telecommunications
infrastructure, and our business and management expertise have
encouraged that success. In fact, the UK is the leading location for
call centres in
Europe.</p><p><a name="06102452000076">I appreciate
that from time to time callers to a centre experience poor customer
service. People who experience a lack of service are quite rightly
vocal&#151;I dare say much more so than those who are satisfied with
the service&#151;when they make criticisms, but that is human nature,
given the point that the hon. Member for Wealden
made.</p><br>

call centres could and should improve their reputation and
acceptability, and that one way of doing so would be for the Government
and the industry to encourage more people to sign up to the telephone
preference service? That would cut down the number of unsolicited sales
calls, which are particularly annoying, thereby boosting customer
confidence in such an important sector of our
economy.</p><p><a name="06102452000078"><b><a name="61024h0001.htm_spnew414"><a name="06102452000446">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a similar point to
that made by the hon. Member for Solihull, who suggested that the
polarity should be reversed and that people should volunteer to be
called, rather than excluding themselves. I shall come to that later,
but there is a method through which people can exclude themselves from
being called. The hon. Lady&#146;s analogy of people volunteering to
be fished from a pool sounded a bit like turkeys voting for Christmas;
I am not sure that anybody is likely to go down that road.
Nevertheless, she made a valid point to which I shall return
shortly.</p><p><a name="06102452000079">Responsible
companies recognise the valuable part that their call centres play in
growing business and delivering customer satisfaction. Organisations
such as the Customer Contact Association are playing their part; it has
set its membership ever-higher standards of skills training and quality
customer care. The association is piloting for the industry a voluntary
kite mark that will assist in raising
standards.</p><p><a name="06102452000080">As has been
mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North and other
contributors, call centres have been criticised for the proliferation
of unsolicited direct marketing telephone calls. I can certainly
appreciate the nuisance and inconvenience that such calls cause. They
are usually made through a computerised calling device that dials the
telephone number and automatically connects to a sales agent or
provides a recorded message when the call is answered. Although the
machines allegedly give efficiency savings to the company, they can be
very irritating to those who receive calls&#151;especially when there
is no message, as my hon. Friend
said.</p><p><a name="06102452000081">The Government
listened to complaints and took action accordingly. Under the Privacy
and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, no one is allowed to
make an unsolicited direct marketing call to a subscriber who has
previously notified them that they do not wish to receive such calls or
to someone who has been registered with the telephone preference
service for at least 28 days. The telephone preference service is an
industry-run opt-out scheme, operated by the Direct Marketing
Association.</p><p><a name="06102452000082">Responsibility for the
enforcement of the regulations rests with the Information
Commissioner&#146;s office and is drawn from the Data Protection Act
1998. Breaching an enforcement notice is a criminal offence subject
to a substantial fine&#151;recently raised from
&#163;5,000 to &#163;50,000&#151;in a magistrates court. I have
heard the criticism, made by the hon. Member for Wealden, of silent
calls. I shall look into his point about Ofcom&#146;s role in
monitoring and enforcing the
regulations.</p><p><a name="06102452000083">Protection
of personal data is another vital issue, and it has been raised by all
speakers in the debate. Many people are rightly cautious about
revealing their

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 362WH</b><br>details to organisations, not least because of the newspaper articles
and television programmes that have exposed instances of alleged
malpractice by call centre staff in this country and abroad.</p><p><a name="06102452000084">However, wherever their
operations are based, companies remain bound by the requirements of the
1998 Act, in particular that for data to be kept secure. Companies
remain responsible for how data are processed overseas on their behalf,
and that includes the transfer and overseas processing of the data.
Companies have taken many steps to protect the security of data and
many examples of good practice are followed. To monitor standards, it
is also important that strong links be maintained between the UK and
call centres located
abroad.</p><p><a name="06102452000085">In March 2006,
the British regulator, the Banking Code Standards Board, visited eight
Indian call centres. More than 1 million inbound calls from the UK,
together with other processing work, are handled each month by those
centres. The review identified good standards of compliance with the
banking code.</p><p><a name="06102452000086">Increasing integration of the
international economy presents challenges and opportunities for all
sectors of the UK economy. The potential impact of globalisation on the
UK&#146;s prosperity will depend critically on business response, in
terms of choices businesses make about location and successfully
meeting the needs of customers. That has led to the offshoring of some
jobs and services, and calls for protectionism and economic patriotism,
although I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North was
not making that challenge in introducing the debate. Those are part of
the competitive challenges facing business and the Government
alike.</p><p><a name="06102452000087">We need to put
the issue of offshoring into perspective. We want to keep jobs in the
UK, but we operate today in a fiercely competitive global market, and
no sector is more competitive than IT. Changing technology is a fact of
life. Some call centre and other service functions have moved to India
and other third countries. It is for companies to choose their
investment locations; the Government cannot protect jobs by suggesting
that industry operate in a certain way, and we cannot stem the tide of
overseas or technological competition.</p><p><a name="06102452000088">However, we can aim to provide
the most favourable conditions for businesses, whether they are already
located here or want to locate here. In addition, we can encourage all
call centres to move up the value chain.</p><p><a name="06102452000089"><b><a name="61024h0001.htm_spnew415"><a name="06102452000447">Dr.
Gibson:</b> Will the Minister elaborate on why he thinks that
offshoring call centre services has worked as well as those services in
Britain? How will he protect the data out there? As I said, there is no
legislation to stop the flow of information. A server in the United
Kingdom may be operating the computer, but the information is still
available to staff who work abroad, giving opportunities to the Nick
Leesons of this world. How will the Minister prevent

Friend.</p><p><a name="06102452000093">As I was
saying, there is an additional responsibility to encourage all call
centres to move up the value chain. We should remember that outsourcing
is a two-way process. The UK is the world&#146;s second largest
recipient of inward investment. Inward stock was worth &#163;472
billion at the end of 2005 and call centre firms contribute to UK
exports, which in turn contribute to our prosperity.</p><p><a name="06102452000094">HCL Technologies, an Indian
company, has bought two call centres in Northern Ireland. It now
employs about 2,000 people, who among them speak eight different
languages. The centres service clients such as BT, the AA and Deutsche
Bank, and are the largest outsourcing operation in the whole of
Ireland. Companies need to think carefully about relocation and to
consider the difficulties of managing staff, maintaining standards and
offering appropriate customer care when staff are relocated thousands
of miles away. We would do well not to forget that customers have a
choice about whom they do business with. They have power, and can take
their custom elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06102452000095">Service quality is one of the
many important considerations companies have about relocating. Quality
of customer contact is crucial for many companies. Offshore call centre
services may be the obvious short-term economic option, but some
companies are now sounding a note of caution as a result of strong
customer feedback. Customers are demanding successful delivery of goods
and services; to achieve that, call centre workers need detailed
social, cultural and geographical knowledge of their customers&#146;
requirements.</p><p><a name="06102452000096">As a

Fitzpatrick:</b> My hon. Friend makes a strong point. However,
the Government signed up last year to European Union standards in the
information and consultation directive, as recommended by the DTI, so
we are up with our European partners. Obviously, we always advise best
practice, and companies that look after their staff inevitably find
that those staff are better motivated to improve the profit margins, as
they know that they are
valued.</p><p><a name="06102452000101">Some companies
have taken account of considerations such as customer preference or the
difficulty of managing staff at a distance and have decided to bring
back operations from abroad. Where jobs are unfortunately lost, we
continue to do everything possible to help people to find new jobs and,
if necessary, new skills. Jobcentre Plus and the rapid response service
provide that help. We encourage companies to consult their employees
and unions over relocation decisions, and, as I just mentioned, the
information and consultation directive was signed last year by the
Government. Co-operation is mutually
beneficial.</p><p><a name="06102452000102"><b><a name="61024h0001.htm_spnew423"><a name="06102452000455">Dr.

hand, but I believe that we are all familiar with anecdotes that
reflect the sentiments that I mentioned earlier. Companies are much
more sensitive. Call centres abroad have been getting a pounding for a
variety of reasons&#151;some are probably not so valid, but others
are. I think of the question about Watford raised by the hon. Member
for Wealden, people&#146;s dissatisfaction levels and customers who
may feel let down or that they are not being offered the best possible
service, even though many overseas call centres offer an excellent
service. Those aspects make companies think twice about outsourcing and
make them think about bringing call centres back. Those are business
considerations, and such decisions are taken every
day.</p><p><a name="06102452000104"><b><a name="61024h0001.htm_spnew425"><a name="06102452000457">Dr.

Stephen Crabb (Preseli Pembrokeshire) (Con):</b> Today,
Burma's democracy leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, will mark a
total of 11 years under house arrest. It is therefore highly
appropriate that the House should consider once again the current
situation in Burma, the gross violations of human rights being
perpetrated by its military regime, and the actions that Her
Majesty&#146;s Government can and should take to address the growing
crisis there.</p><p><a name="06102452000116">There
are other factors that make this a particularly timely moment for hon.
Members to have this discussion. Last month, the UN Security Council
formally discussed Burma for the first time and just last week the UN
Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Burma, Paulo Pinheiro, presented
his report to the UN General Assembly. This debate has attracted
interest from various non-governmental organisations working in the
field and I am grateful to Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Human Rights
Watch, Amnesty International and The Burma Campaign UK, which, among
others, have asked me to consider various research notes and pieces of
evidence in preparation for the
debate.</p><p><a name="06102452000117">It is good to
see the Minister for Europe here. I know that he will not be offended
if I say that we were looking forward to the Minister for Trade, who
also has responsibility for human rights, responding. Nevertheless, we
look forward to what this Minister has to
say.</p><p><a name="06102452000118">I am sure that I
am not alone in thinking that more than 90 per cent. of everything said
from the platform in the party conference season is instantly
forgettable, and I am sure that that applies equally to all parties.
However, in Bournemouth at the beginning of the month I listened to one
of the most confident, passionate and meaningful speeches I have ever
heard in any political forum. The speaker was a 25-year-old Burmese
woman called Zoya Phan, who used an appearance at our conference to
make a heart-cry for her people and her country. Zoya spoke of how, at
the age of 14, she witnessed a savage assault on her village by troops
of the Burmese regime. She spoke of mortar bombs exploding, soldiers
opening fire and of her family running, carrying what they could and
leaving their home behind. She also spoke of her memories of those
killed on that day and the smell of black smoke as her village was
destroyed behind them. She brought questions to our conference and
asked: why has it taken 16 years for the UN Security Council even to
discuss Burma; why are there no targeted economic sanctions to cut the
lifeline that keeps the Burmese regime afloat; and why is there not
even a UN arms embargo against her country? It was Zoya&#146;s
testimony, more than anything, that made me ask for the debate. I would
like to use my contribution to bring these questions and others to the
Minister.</p><p><a name="06102452000119">Aung San
Suu Kyi has spent the past 11 years of her life in detention. Despite
an overly optimistic assessment of the situation by UN
Under-Secretary-General, Ibrahim Gambari, who was permitted a brief
audience with her in May this year, her detention was extended by a
further year just days later. In addition

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 368WH</b><br>to the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, there are more than 1,100 other
political prisoners in jail in Burma today facing widespread and
horrific forms of torture. Since December last year, the International
Committee of the Red Cross has been forced to suspend all its prison
visits due to the restrictions imposed by the State Peace and
Development Council. Last December the Assistance Association for
Political Prisoners (Burma) published a report &#147;The Darkness We
See&#148;, which details the different forms of torture used. Many
political prisoners do not survive the harsh conditions and torture
they face in Burma&#146;s prisons. Another report, &#147;Eight
Seconds of Silence&#148;, details the deaths of at least nine
political prisoners since last year, and last week it emerged that
another prisoner, Ko Thet Win Aung, aged 34, died in Mandalay prison.
Will the Minister and his colleagues demand an independent
investigation into the cause of death of that young man and make those
findings public?</p><p><a name="06102452000120">The
date of 27 September this year marked the 18th anniversary of the
establishment of the National League for Democracy in Burma. Yet, even
at the same time as messages of support were sent to the NLD from
politicians of all parties around the world, several leading dissidents
in Burma, who had already spent many years of their lives behind bars,
were re-arrested, including Min Ko Naing, Ko Gyi and Htay Kwe. What
action is the Minister taking to raise those arrests with the SPDC and
to secure the release of the
prisoners?</p><p><a name="06102452000121">Burma still
has the highest number of forcibly conscripted child soldiers in the
world according to Human Rights Watch, and more than 70,000 children
have been forced to join the Burma army. According to the human rights
group, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, which has interviewed former
child soldiers who have managed to escape, those children&#151;some
as young as 10 or 11&#151;are taken from bus stops, train stations or
off the street while on their way home from school. I know that from
previous answers given by the Minister for Trade that he feels
passionately about the issue of child soldiers. Will the Minister
update us on the Government&#146;s most recent actions to challenge
the regime on its use of child
soldiers?</p><p><a name="06102452000122">As if the
suppression of democracy, the widespread use of torture, the
imprisonment of people for their political beliefs, and the forcible
conscription of child soldiers were not enough, the human rights
violations perpetrated by the SPDC against ethnic nationalities,
particularly the Karen, Karenni and Shan, amount, according to many
analysts, to crimes against humanity and, arguably, genocide. Since
1996, more than 2,800 villages in eastern Burma have been destroyed.
That has been reported by human rights organisations for several years.
Last week, in his report to the UN General Assembly, the UN Special
Rapporteur for Human Rights in Burma acknowledged that figure for the
first time.</p><p><a name="06102452000123">It is
estimated that more than 1 million people are internally displaced in
the jungles of Burma. They are on the run,</p><a name="61024h0002.htmbrev_56"><a name="06102452000402"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;hunted and shelled like

and the Karen Human Rights Group reveal horrifying atrocities,
including beheadings, severe mutilations and the shooting of civilians
at point-blank range. A nine-year-old girl was shot after seeing her
father and grandmother killed.</p><p><a name="06102452000125">It is essential that we see
that campaign for what it is. The European Union and others in the
international community have been, in my view, far too timid in the
language they have been willing to use. They have described this
year&#146;s events as an offensive against the Karen National Union,
which is the Karens&#146; resistance organisation. In reality, it was
nothing less than a genocidal assault on the Karen people themselves.
The vast majority of the victims were innocent, unarmed civilians who
had nothing to do with the resistance.</p><p><a name="06102452000126">Evidence of the widespread and
systematic use of rape continues to mount and is documented in reports
such as &#147;Licence to Rape&#148;<i></i>by the Shan
Women&#146;s Action Network, and others by the Karen Women&#146;s
Organisation and the Women&#146;s League of Chinland. The pattern is
clearly that wherever SPDC troops are stationed, women are extremely
vulnerable. A Kachin woman told Christian Solidarity Worldwide that
rape is &#147;very common&#148; and that</p><a name="61024h0002.htmbrev_57"><a name="06102452000127"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;rape happens in every area where
there is an SPDC army camp.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000128">The Kachin have a ceasefire with the
SPDC, so rape cannot simply be dismissed as a consequence of
&#147;counter-insurgency&#148; operations. Similarly in Mon state,
where there is also a ceasefire, women are taken as sexual slaves for
the army, as described in the devastating report &#147;Catwalk to the
Barracks&#148;.</p><p><a name="06102452000129">In
his report of last week, the UN special rapporteur says:</p><a name="61024h0002.htmbrev_58"><a name="06102452000403"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Serious incidents of
sexual violence against women continue to be reported throughout
Myanmar. Women and girls in ethnic minority areas remain particularly
susceptible to rape and harassment by State actors.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000130">In light of UN Security Council
resolution 1674 passed this year, which calls for the protection of
civilians in armed conflict, and resolution 1325 on women, peace and
security, what action will the Government take at an international
level to bring the regime to justice for those crimes? Will the
Minister assure hon. Members that in the debate at the Security Council
in New York in two days&#146; time on resolution 1325 the UK will
raise the situation in Burma and encourage others to do so? Will the UK
call on the SPDC to bring an end to the system of impunity for grave
violations committed by state actors, including rape and sexual
violence?</p><p><a name="06102452000131">On the
deteriorating humanitarian situation in Burma, in September the Back
Pack Health Worker Team&#151;a group of extremely courageous medics
who work in the conflict zones of eastern Burma, at huge risk to their
lives, to deliver medical assistance&#151;published a report called
&#147;Chronic Emergency: Health and Human Rights in Eastern
Burma&#148;. Its findings are an indictment of the regime and of the
international community&#146;s failure to respond. According to that
report and a similar one published earlier in the year by Johns Hopkins
university, Burma faces a dire public health crisis caused by the
regime&#146;s lack of investment in health care and its violation of
human rights. Eastern Burma, in particular, is one of the
world&#146;s worst health disaster zones.</p><br>

Emergency&#148; claims that the situation is as bad as that in the
poorest countries in Africa, yet Burma receives only a fraction of the
aid and attention given to Africa. Malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS
have reached epidemic proportions. Infant mortality rates and deaths
from treatable diseases are among the worst in the world, yet
Burma&#146;s regime, which spends more than 40 per cent. of its
budget on the military, invests less than $1 per person per year in
health and education combined. The World Health Organisation&#146;s
assessment of health care ranks Burma 190th out of 191 states. Only
Sierra Leone has a worse record of caring for its
citizens.</p><p><a name="06102452000133">I appreciate
that the debate continues about the most effective way to deliver aid
to the people of Burma and undoubtedly we want to avoid channelling
money through the SPDC. I do not intend to try to address here all the
complexities of that discussion, but I shall raise one simple point. I
am aware that the Department for International Development is in the
final stages of carrying out a review of its policy on Burma. I welcome
the fact that it has had that review and I look forward to hearing the
outcome, but I hope very much that DFID will find a way to provide
substantial and much-needed assistance to the more than 1 million
internally displaced people who as yet have not been reached by DFID
funds. Outstanding organisations, such as the Back Pack Health Worker
Team, are carrying out life-saving work and deserve our support. There
is a precedent, as I understand that four other Governments do fund
such humanitarian groups. I hope that DFID will be able to join
them.</p><p><a name="06102452000134">I want to focus
on current political developments, first within Burma and then
internationally. Just two weeks ago, the SPDC began the final session
of its national convention to draw up a new constitution for the
country. I hope that the Minister will assure hon. Members that Her
Majesty&#146;s Government do not give the SPDC&#146;s national
convention one iota of credibility and that the Minister will recognise
it for what it is&#151;a sham and a desperate bid by a brutal
military regime to rubber-stamp its own agenda and give itself a
civilian face. The delegates at the national convention are hand-picked
and threatened with severe penalties if they criticise the process. The
NLD and the major representatives of most of the ethnic nationalities
are excluded from the
convention.</p><p><a name="06102452000135">I
understand that the SPDC plans to put the new constitution to a
referendum. No one has any confidence that that will be a free and fair
referendum. What plans does the Minister have to put pressure on the
SPDC to invite international and truly independent monitors, not just
on the day of the referendum but in the run-up to it? What hope does he
have that there will be a proper period of public awareness raising,
information, education and consultation, including freedom for groups
to campaign for a no
vote?</p><p><a name="06102452000136">The SPDC plans
to hold new elections following a referendum, only it does not want a
rerun of its defeat in 1990, so it has ensured that the proposed
constitution assures it of victory. One third of the seats in the
legislature will be reserved for the military. The president must be
someone with at least 15 years&#146; experience in the military, and
the regime&#146;s civilian militia&#151;the Union Solidarity and
Development Association&#151;is expected to be used by the SPDC to

should be remembered, are the thugs who attacked Aung San Suu Kyi in
Depayin three years ago. During that attack, more than 100 of her
supporters were beaten to death. Is this to be the new face of
Burma?</p><p><a name="06102452000137">Does the
Minister agree with the UN special rapporteur, who described the
national convention as &#147;meaningless and undemocratic&#148; and
added:</p><a name="61024h0002.htmbrev_59"><a name="06102452000404"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It will

forward for real change and national reconciliation in Burma is
tripartite dialogue involving the SPDC, the NLD and the ethnic
nationalities? The NLD and the ethnic nationalities have repeatedly
stressed their willingness to talk. What action is he taking to push
for meaningful tripartite
dialogue?</p><p><a name="06102452000139">Just over a
year ago, the former Czech President, Vaclav Havel, and the former
Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, commissioned an international
law firm to assess the case for bringing Burma to the UN Security
Council agenda. Their report concluded that there was an overwhelmingly
strong case for doing that because Burma met all the major criteria for
Security Council action. It recommended a Security Council discussion
and a binding resolution that would require the SPDC to release all
political prisoners, to open the country to international human rights
monitors and humanitarian aid organisations without restriction or
interference, and to engage in meaningful tripartite dialogue and a
transition to true
democracy.</p><p><a name="06102452000140">Last month,
a year after the report was published, the UN Security Council formally
discussed Burma for the first time. That followed two informal UN
Security Council discussions on Burma in the past 12 months or so. I am
aware that the United Kingdom, along with the United States and others,
worked very hard to bring Burma to the formal agenda, and I wish to
express my appreciation for the Government&#146;s efforts and to
welcome the successes that have been achieved so far. However, I also
want to urge on the Minister the fact that the need for a binding
resolution on Burma has never been greater. The recent discussion at
the Security Council is a very significant step, but talk is not
enough.</p><p><a name="06102452000141">The UN special

are being targeted and where humanitarian assistance to civilians is

the United Nations and associated personnel, as well as personnel of
humanitarian organisations and guarantee their safety, security and
freedom of

action is the United Kingdom taking to bring about a binding resolution
and to ensure the support of other Security Council
members?</p><p><a name="06102452000143">I shall

the Minister with responsibility for human rights, who has spent a
great deal of time this year encouraging the new UN Human Rights
Council to further its work. Does my hon. Friend agree that that
council should perhaps take Burma as one of the first tests of its
veracity and effectiveness in pushing the UN to develop the binding
resolution that he talked
about?</p><p><a name="06102452000146"><b><a name="61024h0002.htm_spnew431"><a name="06102452000463">Mr.
Crabb:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point and I agree
with him
wholeheartedly.</p><p><a name="06102452000147">Secondly,
the UK is the second-largest source of approved investment in Burma.
Although most major British companies that previously invested in Burma
have withdrawn, companies all over the world use Britain to invest in
Burma via British dependent territories, such as the British Virgin
Islands and Bermuda. The Government could introduce legislation to ban
investment in Burma from Britain or British dependent
territories.</p><p><a name="06102452000148">Thirdly,
the Minister should consider ways to strengthen the EU common position
when it is reviewed this year. Will he tell the House why, despite the
common position to freeze assets held in Europe by listed regime
officials, less than &#163;4,000 has been frozen across all 25 EU
member states so far? What action are the Government taking to address
that in the EU?</p><p><a name="06102452000149">The
strongest feature of the EU common position is a limited investment
ban, introduced in 2004. European companies are banned from investing
in a number of named state-owned enterprises. However, on that list of
named state-owned enterprises are a pineapple juice factory and a
tailor&#146;s shop, but no enterprises in the key sectors of oil,
gas, mining and timber. The military regime in Burma is propped up by
oil, gas, timber and gems, but surely not by pineapple
juice.</p><p><a name="06102452000150">Fourthly, DFID
provides no financial support for Burmese pro-democracy and human
rights groups that are operating in exile but which carry out vital
work in documenting and disseminating information&#151;groups such as
the Shan Women&#146;s Action Network and the Karen Women&#146;s
Organisation, which have helped to bring the issue of rape to the
attention of the world; media organisations such as the Democratic
Voice of Burma radio and television stations, which broadcast news to
Burma and provide an essential source of information; and democracy
organisations such as the Government in exile, the National Council of
the Union of Burma or the trade union movement. If

DFID not fund such work for
Burma?</p><p><a name="06102452000151">Finally, it is
becoming increasingly obvious that what is occurring in eastern Burma,
particularly to the Karen, Karenni and Shan, amounts to more than just
the counter-insurgency that the SPDC claims. The crimes of widespread
rape, forced labour, mass displacement, torture, the use of human
minesweepers, and the destruction of villages, livelihoods and lives
surely amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. There is a
strong case of genocide or attempted genocide to be considered. I note
that one definition of genocide provided by the convention on the
prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, in article 2(c),
is:</p><a name="61024h0002.htmbrev_61"><a name="06102452000406"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Deliberately
inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about
its physical destruction in whole or in
part&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000152">Genocide does not
have to involve the destruction of a whole race; nor need it even
entail mass
killing.</p><p><a name="06102452000153">Earlier this
month, when the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan) asked the
Minister responsible for human rights, by way of a written
parliamentary question, about whether genocide was being committed
inside Burma, the answer expressed no view. At the end of June, the
reply to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John
Bercow), was that</p><a name="61024h0002.htmbrev_62"><a name="06102452000407"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there
is currently insufficient evidence to establish that the intent to
commit genocide exists.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 26 June
2006; Vol. 448, c. 173W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000154">I
should like to ask again whether, in the view of Her Majesty&#146;s
Government, the Burmese regime is committing genocide. Does the
Minister agree that there is a need thoroughly to investigate
allegations of crimes against humanity and genocide or attempted
genocide? If so, what action are he and his colleagues
taking?</p><p><a name="06102452000155">In describing
the situation in Burma I have barely begun to scratch the surface of
the regime&#146;s legacy of fear and suffering. I have not, for
example, described the use of forced labour. Nor have I detailed the
lack of religious freedoms that blight the lives of Christians and
Muslims alike in Burma. However, it is clear that across the full range
of basic human rights the Burmese dictatorship systematically
restricts, denies and undermines the freedoms that should be enjoyed by
all peoples in Burma. In his book &#147;The Case for
Democracy&#148;, Natan Sharansky describes the differences between
freedom societies and the societies that he calls &#147;fear
societies&#148;, which are ruled by regimes that deny freedoms to
their peoples and suppress human rights. A community of free nations
throughout the world will not, he says, emerge on its
own:</p><a name="61024h0002.htmbrev_63"><a name="06102452000408"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It will
require both the clarity of the democratic world to see the profound
moral difference between the world of freedom and the world of fear,
and the courage to confront fear societies
everywhere.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000156">We have a
duty to confront, in the ways that I have described, the fear society
that has been imposed on the people of Burma by the regime there. I
close with the words of Zoya Phang, who spoke at the Conservative
conference three weeks ago. She
said:</p><a name="61024h0002.htmbrev_64"><a name="06102452000409"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Promoting
human rights and democracy is not imperialist. It is not a cultural
issue. It is everyone&#146;s business.&#148;</p></ul><br>

Bercow (Buckingham) (Con):</b> I am grateful, Mr.
Olner, for the opportunity to participate in the debate, and I pay
heartfelt tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli
Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb), who offered the House the most
passionate, insightful and spine chilling expos&#233; of the reality
of life for millions of people in that beautiful but benighted country
called Burma. It is right that the House should have the opportunity,
11 years into the continued incarceration of Aung San Suu Kyi, to
debate these matters with a view to the formulation and promotion of a
still more active Government policy to try to improve the conditions of
life in
Burma.</p><p><a name="06102452000159">Extra-judicial
killings, rape as a weapon of war, brutal water torture, compulsory
relocation, forced labour, the use of human mine clearers, the use of
child soldiers on a scale proportionately greater than in any other
country in the world, and the daily, systematic razing and destruction
of villages in their thousands, throughout eastern Burma, all point to
the institutionalised bestiality of one of the most appalling
Governments on the
planet.</p><p><a name="06102452000160">I believe that
all the people of Burma are dehumanised and continue to suffer on the
most breathtaking scale as a consequence of the wholly illegitimate
Government who tyrannise each and every one of them. I am mindful,
however, of the very particular circumstances and plight of the ethnic
nationals to whom my hon. Friend so movingly referred. I speak of
course of the Karen, the Karenni, the Kachin, the Chin, the Mon, the
Arakan and the Rohingya peoples, to name just a few of the groups that
daily experience the most egregious abuse of their human
rights.</p><p><a name="06102452000161">In that
context, I express my personal gratitude and that, I suspect, of a
number of right hon. and hon. Members, to two organisations that make a
distinctive contribution in reminding the world of the plight of the
people of Burma. I refer, of course, to the Burma Campaign, with which
I am well familiar and with which I have closely co-operated in recent
years as chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on Burma. I know
that the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan) is well aware of
that organisation, too. The Burma Campaign is fantastic. Whenever I
think of it, I call to mind the three musketeers, united in vigorous
and committed campaigning for a better future for that country. I
refer, of course, to Yvette Mahon, Anna Roberts and Mark Farmaner. They
are superb campaigners and deserve tribute to be paid to them in the
House.</p><p><a name="06102452000162">The other
organisation that is very much to the fore in highlighting the abuse of
human rights in Burma is Christian Solidarity Worldwide. I want to
acknowledge the sterling contribution made by Ben Rogers, the advocacy
officer for Burma and south-east Asia, who has made about a dozen
visits in recent years to the Thai-Burmese border to meet, and to hear
the harrowing personal testimonies of, those who have suffered under
the wilful abuse of a destructive regime.

people who are suffering grievously on a daily basis, with scant
protection and precious little active help&#151;something that cannot
be right, and must
change.</p><p><a name="06102452000163">It is a
pleasure to see the Minister for Europe here today. I recognise that he
has, in former capacities, regularly had to listen to me speak on this
subject. When he was Leader of the House, I often called for such
debates. It may be a relatively trying experience for Ministers to
endure the phenomenon of any Member regularly pontificating on a
subject, but I make no apology for doing so, because I believe that the
State Peace and Development Council is one of the worst and most
tyrannical regimes in the world, and that, although now and again it
receives adverse coverage, that happens on far too limited and sporadic
a basis. We need a focus of critical attention and determination to
secure change, if there is to be any prospect of delivering that in the
foreseeable future.</p><p><a name="06102452000164">I
have three proposals&#151;none of which is original, and to all of
which my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire referred, but
each of which is vital to the prospects of trying to get a better deal
for the abused citizens of Burma. The first is to secure UN Security
Council intervention in Burma. I point out to the Minister the fact
that that cause commands substantial cross-party support. I tabled
early-day motion 902 on the subject last year, with the support of the
right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies
Campbell) and the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera
Baird)&#151;not to mention my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring
(Dr. Fox). I think that subsequently we were joined by my hon. Friend
the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink). When last I looked, less than
24 hours ago, that early-day motion had commanded the support of 320
Members of the House. From all the major and some of the minor parties,
support has been
forthcoming.</p><p><a name="06102452000165">Given
that Ministers are not in a position to sign early-day motions, and
that the same prohibition applies to members of the Government Whips
Office and the whole payroll vote, including Parliamentary Private
Secretaries, that puts in context the scale of support that we enjoy.
There are probably only 500 right hon. and hon. Members at most who are
in a position to sign early-day motions, and we all know that some
colleagues prefer not to sign any such motions for fear of being asked
to sign more than they would like. It is therefore telling testimony to
the strength of opinion and deep sense of frustration that we feel, and
our earnest conviction that something better can and should be done,
that the support of 321 colleagues has been
secured.</p><p><a name="06102452000166">The adoption
of Burma as an agenda item by the UN Security Council on 15 September
was a welcome advance, and the subsequent discussion on this important
subject on 29 September was a still more welcome advance. The Minister
should know me well enough by now to know that I am not grudging in
offering praise, so I am more than happy to put on record in explicit
terms similar sentiments to those expressed by my hon. Friend the
Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire: I have been struck by the sheer
passion

for human rights in Burma since he took over his new
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06102452000167">This, however, is not just a
matter for Britain. We need wider support, so there is relationship
building to be done. A coalition has to be established and other people
have to be brought on board, but we have to run fast to stand still. We
simply cannot afford to rest for a moment; we have to keep going and
seeking the support of other countries at every turn. We should not be
remotely afraid of the possibility that some of them might resist our
approaches. Let us name and shame those people within the United
Nations who represent their national interests or perverted priorities
and somehow think that the behaviour of the Government of Burma is
unexceptionable and does not warrant the attention of the Security
Council.</p><p><a name="06102452000168">The report
commissioned by Desmond Tutu and Vaclav Havel, which was provided by
the American law firm to which my hon. Friend referred, demonstrates
beyond peradventure that the regime substantially meets all the
relevant criteria for consideration for UN Security Council
intervention. I would far prefer a binding Security Council resolution,
but I confess that if we have to put up with a non-binding resolution
in the short term, that is better than nothing, although we need to
send an explicit, unmistakeable signal to the regime that it is,
frankly, a leper at the
moment.</p><p><a name="06102452000169">Burma is a
pariah state within the international community and its behaviour is
unconscionable. If it entertains even the remotest future ambition,
which it entertained unsuccessfully in the past, of being allowed the
chairmanship or presidency of the Association of South East Asian
Nations, it will have to bring about a massive step change in its
behaviour. There can be no automaticity in its promotion to a position
of jumped-up political importance that its conduct manifestly does not
warrant. So, we need to keep going. I would like there to be an arms
embargo and substantial UN sanctions against the regime. I do not say
that that will be quick in coming, but we should press for
it.</p><p><a name="06102452000170">My hon. Friend was
right to highlight the alarming phenomenon of the substantial
investment in Burma through what I would describe as a circuitous and
underhand route. Those resources&#151;to the tune of approximately
$1.4 billion since 1988, so far as British territories are
concerned&#151;are without question serving to prop up the sadistic,
brutal, fascistic, military dictatorship. On 2 October, the Channel 4
&#147;Dispatches&#148; programme highlighted that important
phenomenon using disturbing evidence to support its
thesis.</p><p><a name="06102452000171">I appeal to
the Minister in the most strenuous terms to consider the Government
imposition of a ban on the use of such territories for the provision of
investment to the regime. Such investment is not helping the people of
Burma and it is not assisting the ethnic nationals who are belaboured
by the regime. It is simply putting a pot of gold into the vaults of
the banks that are controlled by the Government of Burma, who have no
legitimacy and should not be there in the first
place.</p><p><a name="06102452000172">As my hon.
Friend persuasively argued, the Government of Burma are using 40 per
cent. of their national budget to finance the military while subjecting

appalling indignities, while expenditure on health and education
combined is less than $1 per person per
year.</p><p><a name="06102452000173">The notion that
our territories, however inadvertently and with no malice aforethought,
should be used to channel resources to a regime that behaves in that
way is unimaginable. Although I understand why widespread attention is
given to other important issues of public policy in the international
sphere, I make a heartfelt plea for the shifting of Burma from the back
of Ministers&#146; minds to the front. Let us put it on the agenda
and keep it there. I reserve considerable contempt for the behaviour of
Total and Unocal in propping up the
regime.</p><p><a name="06102452000174">I endorse my
hon. Friend&#146;s powerful plea for cross-border aid for the people
of Burma. It saddens and angers me greatly that British annual funding
to Burma in the form of humanitarian aid amounts to only &#163;8
million a year. I understand, although I am ready for correction if the
Minister wants to offer it, that that budget is to be frozen next year,
even though the egregious abuses in Burma are piling up on virtually a
daily basis. The plight is not diminishing; if anything, it is being
exacerbated. The conditions of life in Burma are not radically
dissimilar to those of large numbers of people in sub-Saharan Africa. A
greater priority should be attached to
funding.</p><p><a name="06102452000175"><b><a name="61024h0002.htm_spnew433"><a name="06102452000465">Bob
Spink (Castle Point) (Con):</b> My hon. Friend will be aware
that the position of Thailand is important in the cross-border aid
equation. It has tolerated camps for internally displaced people and
refugees on its border, and it employs some of the people who are
displaced from Burma, so there are many things for which we can praise
and thank Thailand, but does my hon. Friend agree that it must address
two issues? First, it must be more free in enabling aid to cross the
border. Secondly, it must look carefully at certain Thai individuals
who are senior in the Thai community both politically and economically,
who are becoming involved in the acquisition of lands in Burma that
belong to the ethnic races of Burma, not people in
Thailand.</p><p><a name="06102452000176"><b><a name="61024h0002.htm_spnew434"><a name="06102452000466">John

counts.</p><p><a name="06102452000177">I want to draw
to the Minister&#146;s attention what I suspect must be an
inadvertently misleading statement, not to the House, for that would
not be in order, Mr. Olner, but in the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office 2006 annual report on human rights, because it is
relevant to the debate. At page 42&#151;a page with which I am sure
you are closely familiar&#151;it
states:</p><a name="61024h0002.htmbrev_65"><a name="06102452000410"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Bilaterally

support to Burmese refugees in Thailand and to internally displaced
people in
Burma.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000179">However, my
distinct understanding is that the British contribution to that
consortium is provided explicitly on the understanding that it will not
be used to provide cross-border humanitarian aid. That
statement&#146;s wording is therefore manifestly misleading in
offering a contrary impression. I hope that cross-border

despite lots of talk, there has still been no real action by the
international community since then. I hope that this debate, and the
Government action that should follow from it, will act as a catalyst to
bring about the international action that is so necessary. The
international community must take stronger action to stop the abuse of
innocents and children.</p><p><a name="06102452000185">I am sorry that the Minister
with responsibility for human rights is not here, but I entirely
understand that he is engaged elsewhere and that that was inescapable.
Given that he is not here, however, we could hardly have a better
Minister with us than the Minister for Europe. He is a good man, he
listens carefully and he will take the message of this debate back to
his Department. Indeed, he needs no message from us, because he is
already aware of the terrible abuses committed by the evil regime in
Burma. He is an excellent man and I am sure that he will do a good job
today.</p><p><a name="06102452000186">The continued
detention and brutal treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political
prisoners is an offence against any concept of civilisation, and as my

Nations Security Council must take action to bring about change.
Indeed, as our Front-Bench spokesman, my hon. Friend the Member for

a first test for those involved.</p><br>

jungle and met the people there. I have seen the horrendous, brutal and
inhumane treatment that they have suffered and I honestly believe that
they are suffering what is probably a successful attempt at genocide. I
have sat with children in the jungle villages and seen girls sent out
in the mornings to walk miles to carry back fresh water in old jerry
cans and plastic containers. I have seen children with no access to
education, health care or any of the normal things that we expect to be
available, particularly to young girls passing through puberty. I have
a photograph with me of myself sitting with children in the jungle in
Burma and I was deeply moved to meet such people and to see their
plight. What really offends me, however, is that after all this time,
there has been no real action, even though lots of words have been
said, and people are still pouring out their souls. Nobody is prepared
to step in and take action to stop the abuse of innocents and
children.</p><p><a name="06102452000188">I have one

they stop talking about their good intentions and take action? Actions
speak louder than words. For instance, there is still a

investment that supports this nasty regime is being channelled through
British dependent territories such as Bermuda. The UK Government have
the legal power and ability to act, but they have not yet done so. They
claim that no new investment is in the pipeline and that action is
therefore unnecessary, but I hope that we all agree that that position
is insupportable. First, there is such a lack of transparency that the
Government cannot know whether there is new investment. Secondly, even
if there were no new investment, strong action by the Government now
would send a clear message to the regime, to the world and to
companies. Perhaps we should have a policy of naming and shaming

of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s experiences, and he does the House great
credit by giving us the opportunity to debate the issue.</p><p><a name="06102452000193">I also pay tribute to the hon.
Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and the hon. Member for Buckingham
(John Bercow), who is a masterful performer in the House. He was
extremely eloquent and laid out in great detail the challenge facing
the British Government and other Governments right around the
world.</p><p><a name="06102452000194">It is often
observed that the House is not at its best when it is consensual
because hon. Members rush to be part of the crowd, to go along with the
herd and to ensure that they do not stand out for particular attention.
In those circumstances, errors are sometimes made, and hon. Members
need to speak out against the consensus and put the contrary point of
view. That is often the case when legislation is being formed in the
House. However, there are times when it is useful for us to speak with
one voice right across the political parties, and the main occasion
when that is of benefit is when we talk about our values.</p><p><a name="06102452000195">If we leave aside for one
moment the political parties&#146; differences over their policies,
manifestos and platforms for the general election and boil the issue
down to what brings us all here in the first place, we see that it is a
shared belief in the virtues of liberty, freedom, democracy and
tolerance. We want not only to see those values prosper and flower in
the United Kingdom but to see what we in the House of Commons and the
Government can do to ensure that they are spread more widely around the
world and that the many people who do not enjoy the systems that we
take for granted can benefit from them in the future.</p><p><a name="06102452000196">I shall not go over ground that
has already been covered at length, but Burma&#146;s record is
particularly shameful and grotesque. Statistics show that there are
well over 1,000 political prisoners in the country, most, if not all,
of whom routinely suffer torture. The hon. Member for Buckingham paid
tribute to two organisations, the Burma Campaign and Christian
Solidarity Worldwide. I would also mention Amnesty International, of
which I am a member. At school, we were encouraged to support it once a
week with a letter-writing campaign; it was voluntary, but lots of the
pupils participated. We were given a prisoner of conscience on whom the
school was focusing, and we all wrote handwritten letters to the
Government of the country concerned. It taught me at quite an early age
about values. We ought to believe that individual citizens, let alone
parliamentarians, can do something and have some responsibility for the
plight of people in countries far from the UK. Amnesty is an
organisation that I continue to admire immensely.</p><p><a name="06102452000197">Let us consider the rest of the
Burmese record, which has been touched upon&#151;systematic rape, 1
million people forced from their homes, and child soldiers. The human
rights record is grotesque, but it is worth adding that the regime
fails on any other criterion. The Government might say, &#147;Well,
our human rights record is not something we are proud of, but look at
the quality of life and the material wealth that our citizens
enjoy.&#148; I would not accept that as an answer, but I could see
that some might wish to make that case. However, the statistics for
Burma show that it

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 381WH</b><br>fails on every count. One in 10 children die before their fifth
birthday, which is an extraordinarily high rate of infant mortality. As
has been touched on, Burma is second to last&#151;191st out of
192&#151;in the world league table as ranked by the World Health
Organisation. We have heard that less than $1 a year is spent on
health. The figure that I have seen is that Burma spends less than 0.2
per cent of gross domestic product annually on health. The figures are
shocking in terms of both the material, physical and other well-being
of the people, and the human rights that remain absent from their
lives.</p><p><a name="06102452000198">What can we do
about it? It is widely accepted that the situation requires attention.
I want to give some credit to the Government. As I began by saying, I
do not think that this is a point of conflict or that the Government
seek to frustrate the ambitions of hon. Members in all parts of the
House. We may wish that the Government had greater ambition, but we are
in no way seeking to disagree with their general intentions or other
ambitions. They have made some progress, and I echo the calls that
others have made for the United Nations to play a large part in
bringing it home to the Burmese regime that its standards do not accord
with those of the international community as a whole.</p><p><a name="06102452000199">Specifically, the Government
have a duty to examine investment that goes from the United Kingdom or
through United Kingdom organisations into Burma, because no regime can
survive in the medium to long-term without some sort of financial
input. I join others in condemning the actions of Total and others who
have invested with an absence of ethical consideration. If the
Government are able to put pressure on France and other Governments who
may be able to exert influence on such companies, they will have
performed a useful
role.</p><p><a name="06102452000200">Although I, too,
lament the absence of the Minister with specific responsibility for
human rights, there is one upside of having the Minister for Europe in
his place. If the European Union serves any purpose, it is surely that
we can speak as one with 25, soon to be 27, voices and say that we have
a shared set of values&#151;liberty, democracy, freedom and
tolerance, which I touched on earlier. That voice is heard all the more
clearly for being echoed right across the continent and being not just
a British voice. It is appropriate that the United Kingdom, given its
history in Burma, is able to lead the European Union and other powerful
nations on our continent, including France, in bringing pressure to
bear on the Burmese and ensuring that they realise that it is not
possible to split the civilised nations of the world into those that
have more or less antipathy towards them. We share a common and deep
hostility to everything that they are
doing.</p><p><a name="06102452000201"><b><a name="61024h0002.htm_spnew441"><a name="06102452000473">John

Browne:</b> I will indeed, Mr. Olner. I was about
to bring my comments to a conclusion, but I echo the comments that the
hon. Member for Buckingham just made. Shame is a great feature of
foreign policy in respect of human rights. I understand, as do all hon.
Members, that there are limits to the practical impact that the British
Government can have. I sometimes sympathise with Foreign Office
Ministers, who are urged by Members to make good the wrongs of the
world in every single nation. However, shaming the Burmese Government,
the French Government and those associated with propping up the Burmese
regime could be an important instrument for change.</p><p><a name="06102452000204">I shall conclude with a brief
observation. One of the strands of foreign policy on which the British
Government can make a big difference is the pursuit of human rights.
When the Government came to power nine and a half years ago, they
talked about having an &#147;ethical foreign policy&#148;. Most
people would accept that, in practice, foreign policy must balance a
number of considerations&#151;a fact touched on by the hon. Member
for Buckingham. On occasions, it may not be practical to have an
entirely unsullied ethical foreign policy, even if it is desirable. The
ethical dimension to foreign policy in relation to countries such as
Burma and North Korea, whose values so clearly violate those that we
hold dear, is an extremely important strand of British foreign policy
and one that would find great favour among all our citizens. I urge the
Minister to pursue it with
vigour.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61024h0002.htmordayhd_35"><a name="06102452000428">11.57

allowing me to catch your eye, Mr. Olner. Following your
strictures, I shall of course curtail my remarks. My hon. Friend the
Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) has brought a
moving subject for debate before the Chamber and he introduced it in a
statesmanlike manner, which is a great tribute to him. I had not heard
him speak at any length before, but he is a new Member of the House who
will clearly go a long way, and I congratulate him on his
speech.</p><p><a name="06102452000206">My hon. Friend
the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) made his customary
speech&#151;well crafted, statesmanlike, moving and extremely
knowledgeable. I expected as much, given that he introduced such a
debate in this Chamber on 15 June 2005. My hon. Friend the Member for
Castle Point (Bob Spink) had to keep his remarks brief, but he is very
knowledgeable on this subject. He has been to the area, as have I and
other Members. I have been right up to the Thai-Burmese border, and
have met and talked to people who crossed the border, seeing their
desperate plight, so I was interested to hear of his personal
experiences. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne),
speaking on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, also made his customary
well-informed contribution.</p><p><a name="06102452000207">On 19 June, the Nobel peace
prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, celebrated her birthday. She has spent
far more than half of her past 17 birthdays in the prison of home
detention for the unpardonable sin of winning a landslide victory in an
election against Burma&#146;s military junta in 1990. For five
decades, the regime has sustained itself through brutalisation and
human rights abuses, resulting in one of the most brutal regimes in

action, this must surely be it.</p><p><a name="06102452000208">The State Peace and Development
Council&#151;I believe that the renaming was done on the advice of an
American public relations company&#151;is clearly exactly the
opposite of what it purports to be. Abuses have taken place in respect
of opposition politicians, and I was particularly sad to hear of the
recent death in prison of Thet Win Aung, the pro-democracy activist. I
was also sad to hear of the death of Aung Hlaing Win, who was also a
pro-democracy activist. The coroner&#146;s autopsy report showed that
he suffered 24 injuries, but when his family filed for a wrongful death
case, the judge barred admission of the coroner&#146;s autopsy report
and instead upheld the police report on the cause of death. That is the
sort of thing that happens in that vile
regime.</p><p><a name="06102452000209">As my hon.
Friends said, the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Burma is spreading to
neighbouring countries, especially along the drug-trafficking routes.
Burma is one of the world&#146;s largest producers of opium and, more
recently, amphetamine-type
stimulants.</p><p><a name="06102452000210">I read
some of the horrific reports on human rights abuses, and heard about
the experience of some of the people I met in Burma. My hon. Friends
mentioned many of those, but one of the most shocking is the rounding
up of children to become child soldiers. We should pay specific
attention to that.</p><p><a name="06102452000211">My
hon. Friends also mentioned some horrendous abuses against ethnic
minority groups. During 2005, many senior Shan leaders were arrested
and last November eight were given prison sentences, some of which
exceeded 100 years. In other words, they will never be let out of
prison. Many of them were imprisoned merely for where they lived, not
for having committed any
offence.</p><p><a name="06102452000212">Since last
year, the regime has pursued what can justifiably be classified as
ethnic cleansing against the people of northern Karen state. A Foreign
and Commonwealth Office report describes the widespread destruction of
villages, instances of killing, torture of civilians and the
displacement of up to 16,000 villagers, with more than 2,000 refugees
arriving at camps on the Thai border since January
2006.</p><p><a name="06102452000213">The United
States Department of State estimates that there are more than 500,000
internally displaced people in the country and more than 500,000
refugees living in India, China, and Thailand. The number of
undocumented Burmese refugees living in Thailand alone is estimated to
be in the millions, and growing. More than 100,000 additional refugees
have crossed into Thailand since April or May because of the Burmese
army&#146;s offensive against the Karen and other minority
people.</p><p><a name="06102452000214">What can be
done? Like my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire, I pay
tribute to the Government where tribute is due. They have pushed hard
in the European Union for stronger measures against the regime.
However, Burma does not receive the priority it deserves, given the
scale of abuse. If the Minister feels strongly about those
abuses&#151;he will tell us that he does&#151;why have the
Government not imposed unilateral investment sanctions against the

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 384WH</b><br>regime? I shall come to investment in the regime, but it seems to me
that propping up the regime through trade is a key area where it has
benefited and one that we can do something
about.</p><p><a name="06102452000215">Following the
1990 election, the regime was vulnerable because the economy was in
ruins. It was opened to foreign trade at that time and the resulting
influx boosted revenue for the regime&#146;s military spending, which
now makes up almost half of Government spending. It was only in the
mid-1990s that Burma&#146;s democracy movement started calling for
economic sanctions after witnessing how trade and investment were
helping the regime rather than the people and helping to entrench
military rule. There is no legal barrier preventing European or Asian
companies from investing in or trading with the Burmese dictatorship.
The regime survives through foreign investment, and the National League
for Democracy has asked the world to cut lifelines that keep that
regime alive.</p><p><a name="06102452000216">My hon.
Friend referred to the Burma Campaign&#146;s dirty list, which is a
list on its website of companies that do business, or have subsidiaries
that do business, with the Burmese regime. I looked at the list in
detail yesterday, and there are some big and surprising household names
on it. I do not want to name and shame them in this debate, but it is
possible to contact every one of those 79 companies&#151;I challenge
the Government to do so&#151;and explain to them what they are doing
in propping up the regime. If they had a little explanation, many of
those companies would stop trading with that vile
regime.</p><p><a name="06102452000217">Some companies
are big offenders. Total Oil is probably the biggest and probably
contributes about $400 million to the regime. It is possible to
persuade big companies not to trade with the regime; the Government
persuaded British American Tobacco to do just that. It probably trades
in more countries than any other international company, yet it was
persuaded not to trade with Burma because of its
regime.</p><p><a name="06102452000218">How can
Britain help, unilaterally and with its partners in the EU? EU
sanctions are slow in coming because European Governments have not yet
reached agreement. EU members are committed to a common foreign policy
on Burma, but if one country&#151;for example, France&#151;opposes
such action, no progress can be made. The FCO report on human rights
proudly boasts about the actions that the EU has taken to counter the
Burmese regime, but those actions are in no way as strong as those
taken by the American regime.
Why?</p><p><a name="06102452000219">President Bush
signed into law the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act 2003, which
restricts the financial resources of Burma&#146;s ruling military
junta and bans the importation to the US of any products that
originated in Burma. More importantly, the American Government backed
those actions with tough penalties. Anyone who violates the orders
risks a fine of up to $50,000 or up to 10 years&#146; imprisonment,
and companies risk a $500,000 fine. Why have the British Government not
persuaded or tried to persuade the European Union to take such tough
action?</p><p><a name="06102452000220">As I said
during an intervention on my hon. Friend, the new United Nations Human
Rights Council must surely look at Burma as one of its first actions.
There cannot be many regimes as vile in terms of human

few: perhaps the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Sri Lanka and
Zimbabwe. There are not many other regimes with a Government as abusive
of human rights as Burma&#146;s. If there were a test for the new
Human Rights Council to show that it is working properly, it should
start by calling for a proper UN resolution, whether binding or
not.</p><p><a name="06102452000221">It is often
argued that the Chinese would not support a UN resolution against
Burma, but observers in Thailand say that the People&#146;s Republic
of China was dismayed by the arrest of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt and is
now looking for ways to restrain the State Peace and Development
Council. China is deeply affected by the flow of refugees, disease and
drugs. Furthermore, Burma&#146;s uncontrolled logging is damaging
China&#146;s reputation in the World Trade Organisation, which it is
doing so much to enhance and
protect.</p><p><a name="06102452000222">In May, China
closed the China-Burma border to all timber trade. It is extraordinary
that when China can do that, the 79 companies on the dirty list include
many British companies, which are importing Burmese teak to this
country completely unfettered and unhindered. Members of the Burmese
army are reportedly responding by attacking Chinese migrant
workers&#151;hardly behaviour likely to endear the Burmese regime to
Beijing.</p><p><a name="06102452000223">A Security
Council resolution is the most achievable diplomatic tool to build a
policy consensus among countries interested in resolving the Burmese
problem. Among other things, the resolution should call for the
immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, a programme for national
reconciliation that includes the National League for Democracy,
immediate and unhindered access to all parts of Burma for UN relief
agencies and other international humanitarian organisations, a timeline
for compliance, and punitive sanctions if the SPDC fails to
comply.</p><p><a name="06102452000224">The UK should
be in the vanguard in pushing for those efforts and trying to build a
consensus in the Security Council. After all, it was the Prime Minister
who said that</p><a name="61024h0002.htmbrev_67"><a name="06102452000412"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we do not

for the Burmese people. They have suffered for far too long.</p><p><a name="06102452000228">I shall set out in detail the
Government&#146;s views on the situation in Burma and respond to as
many points as I can. Hon. Members will have read the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office &#147;Human Rights Report 2006&#148; that
my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs presented on 12 October. Burma is one of the 20
countries of major concern highlighted in the report, and one of only
two addressed by my right hon. Friend in her foreword. Many of the
issues raised today are considered in greater detail than I can cover,
but hon. Members have described vividly and accurately the continuing
abuses of human rights committed against the Karen people and the
National League for Democracy. This year there has been yet greater
pressure on those groups and further arrests of student leaders. The
situation is made even more difficult by the denial of access to all
Burmese prisons for independent monitoring organisations for almost a
year.</p><p><a name="06102452000229">It has been
argued that the targeted abuse of ethnic groups could amount to
genocide. It is clear that large-scale human rights abuses are taking
place, so my right hon. Friend the Minister for Trade, who has
responsibility for investment and foreign affairs, discussed the human
rights situation in Burma with Juan M&#233;ndez, the special adviser
to the UN Secretary General on the prevention of genocide, on 27 June.
We remain in regular contact with Juan M&#233;ndez, and we have
offered him whatever political or practical assistance he needs to
complete his work. My right hon. Friend has invited him to return to
London in November to discuss those issues with interested Members of
Parliament. Knowing the consistency of many Members, I am sure that
they will take up the opportunity.</p><p><a name="06102452000230">Many hon. Members asked what
the United Kingdom was doing. We must recognise that the influence that
any single country like the United Kingdom has is necessarily limited,
making it even more important to work in partnership with others. There
is nevertheless valuable work that we can do and are doing in Burma. We
are one of only four European Union member states to have an embassy in
Rangoon. Our embassy plays a vital role in communicating information to
us. It also gets our messages across to the Burmese Government
directly. Mark Canning, our ambassador in Rangoon, conveyed to the
Burmese Home Minister only yesterday our concerns about recent abuses,
as he has done with a range of senior interlocutors since his
arrival.</p><p><a name="06102452000232">The embassy
is in regular contact with the National League for Democracy and other
opposition groups inside Burma, including the ethnic groups, and it has
come in for some sharp criticism from the regime for its activities.
The embassy provides funding for grass-roots development and
capacity-building projects throughout Burma, in addition to the
Department for International Development larger programmes.</p><p><a name="06102452000233">We do what we can to strengthen
civil society within Burma, while recognising that those people and
organisations who choose to associate with us are taking considerable
risks. It is therefore a long-term and low-profile effort, and we try
not to politicise what

hon. Members will understand.</p><p><a name="06102452000234">In addition, the British
Council is respected in Burma for its pivotal educational role. It is
improving the skills of Burmese teachers of English. It offers access
to a library of 30,000 uncensored books, newspapers and journals, the
BBC World Service radio and the internet. It all helps to increase the
knowledge and skills that will one day help democracy take
root.</p><p><a name="06102452000235">We have taken a
lead in helping to relieve the suffering of the Burmese people. On 10
October, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International
Development announced that the United Kingdom would contribute
&#163;20 million to the newly formed three diseases fund to help
fight TB, malaria and HIV/AIDS in Burma. The UK was instrumental in
setting up the fund together with five other donors.</p><p><a name="06102452000236">Hon. Members have referred to
internally displaced people in Burma. DFID provides assistance to
conflict-affected people in that country through the International
Committee of the Red Cross, providing some &#163;500,000 a year. Our
health, education and rural livelihood programmes include within their
geographical remit conflict-affected regions to which internally

companies that inquire about trade with Burma are informed of the grave

that the figures that have been bandied around are largely those

to include all investment over a period of more than 10 years, and
investment by UK companies is included even if they pulled out of
operations in Burma long ago. Hon. Members referred to British American
Tobacco, whose investment appears still to be included in the figures
being supplied by the Burmese regime. The real figures are much lower.
In 2003 the Department of Trade and Industry recorded the UK foreign
investment flow into Burma as less than &#163;500,000. As far as we

its various organs and agencies, the EU and the Asian region.</p><p><a name="06102452000258">The United Nations rightly
plays a vital role in Burma and we welcome the efforts of the
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to promote political progress and secure
the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. We look to the current and future UN
Secretaries-General to keep up the pressure for change in Burma. There
are indications that the Burmese regime still recognises the authority
of the United Nations, and we therefore encourage the UN to deliver
clear messages on the need to cease attacks on ethnic groups, release
prisoners and implement a genuine process of national reconciliation.
We agree that the UN Security Council has a key role to play in keeping
up the pressure for change and, with UK support, the US succeeded in
having Burma added to the Security Council agenda on 15 September. The
first formal debate took place on 29 September, and the US has
indicated that it wishes to table a resolution on Burma. It can
certainly count on our continued full support. The forthcoming visit to
Rangoon of UN Under-Secretary Gambari will be important in shaping the
views of Council members. Burma is slated to be one of the first
countries considered by the newly established Human Rights Council. We
and other EU partners fully support early action on Burma by the
council.</p><p><a name="06102452000259">The special
rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, Paulo Sergio
Pinheiro, has worked hard since his appointment in 2000 to catalogue
the regime&#146;s dire record. Despite not having been permitted to
enter the country since November 2003, he has provided the
international community with a comprehensive and objective report on
the situation inside Burma. His last report to the Human Rights Council
on 27 September makes sobering reading. We encourage him and any
successor to continue that important work and we hope that the newly
formed Human Rights Council will take early action in response. The
Government support strongly the special rapporteur&#146;s reports and
recommendations, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Trade, who
has responsibility for human rights, called in his letter of 5 July to
the Burmese Foreign Minister for processes to be made genuinely
inclusive and democratic. A copy of that letter is in the House of
Commons
Library.</p><p><a name="06102452000260">Within the
European Union we have taken the lead in promoting a strong line. All
member states acknowledge Burma&#146;s dire human rights record, but
I recognise that there is a range of views on whether increased
pressure or engagement is the right policy to pursue. Nevertheless, we
have supported the adoption and gradual strengthening of the common
position, which now includes a range of targeted sanctions aimed at
those who implement or benefit from the regime&#146;s policies, while
avoiding increasing the suffering of the Burmese people. The common
position and the sanctions that it contains may not go as far as some
want, but it is an effective compromise that unites the 25 member
states around a policy that is broadly right, rather than allowing each
member state to pursue its own approach. A divided EU without a common
position would be good news for the regime and bad news for our
objectives.</p><br>

but we hope that we can persuade them that their long-term interests
will be better served by fostering peaceful change than by perpetuating
the present unsustainable position. My right hon. Friend the Minister
for Trade has raised the matter of Burma&#146;s human rights failings
with representatives of the Chinese, Indian, South Korean and Japanese
Governments. It will be difficult to convince all our partners in the

stance is evidence that attitudes are slowly
shifting.</p><p><a name="06102452000265">There are

international human rights instruments, to working closely with the UN

continuing to work for improvement in the human rights situation in
Burma and to help the Burmese people. I congratulate all hon. Members

Mark Todd (South Derbyshire) (Lab):</b> I make no apologies
for returning to flood defences and environment-related issues in South
Derbyshire, which is a subject on which I have had two previous
Adjournment debates. That reflects the character of my constituency.
Its geography is that it is a low-lying area around the path of three
rivers&#151;the Trent, the Dove and the Derwent&#151;with numerous
smaller water courses that also cause risk of flooding at certain
times.</p><p><a name="06102452000267">Faced with the
significant flooding of 2000, which was initially thought to be close
to a one-in-100-year event, many communities received a sharp wake-up
call. Flooding occurred in a number of villages, as a response to which
fluvial studies were commissioned on each of the three rivers both to
establish the level of risk that might be experienced by communities
that lie adjacent to them and to define what remedial measures could be
taken to protect those communities in the future. Every congratulation
needs to be given to the work of the Environment Agency in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06102452000268">The studies
have varied somewhat in character over time. The Trent study was the
first to be carried out and was completed with a full range of options
of flood defence, including some that were alarming, involving the
sacrifice of at least one village in my constituency to protect others.
Fortunately those options were not proceeded with, but the study
nevertheless comprehensively assessed both the risks that the affected
villages faced and some of the options that could be taken to address
them.</p><p><a name="06102452000269">The Dove study
has been delayed to some extent by spending cuts. I also understand
that the full options analysis to test the various defence measures
that could be taken will not be carried out to the same level of depth
as those considered in the Trent study. However, a large portion of the
work relating to the part that lies within my constituency has been
completed, and I shall return to some of the issues that that has
raised. The Derwent study is still to be completed, and affects a small
part of my
constituency.</p><p><a name="06102452000270">The
work, particularly on the Dove, has involved highly complex and
advanced predictive modelling, married with local data collection,
involving the assembling of photographic material and memories from
villages that have been affected. The contractors Halcrow and the
Environment Agency deserve every congratulation on the thoroughness
with which they have addressed the problem and on the importance of the
study that they have
produced.</p><p><a name="06102452000271">The places
affected on the Derwent include the small community of Ambaston, which
has some flood defences already, and the environs and smaller
communities around the village of Shardlow. The Trent affects Shardlow
too, which lies close to the point at which the Trent and the Derwent
join, as well as Swarkestone, Barrow upon Trent and Willington, while
the Dove affects Hatton, which is a large village, the smaller
communities of Scropton and Egginton, and the edge of the large village
of Hilton.</p><p><a name="06102452000272">As a
result of the experience of 2000, in which all those villages either
were cut off from the outside world for a period or experienced
large-scale flooding, which 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 393WH</b><br>was particularly true in Hatton, there is a high level of interest in
the subject in those villages, and understandably so. The memories are
still clear and the consequences of failing to take appropriate
measures to defend against floods are obvious to people in those
communities. Many of them have established active flood defence
committees.</p><p><a name="06102452000273">The
district council has taken a strong leadership role, bringing together
affected villages to discuss flood defence issues collectively with the
various agencies involved, for which it deserves congratulations. The
council has also demonstrated a strong commitment to capital
expenditure in the area and has been an active partner of a major
project in Hatton.</p><p><a name="06102452000274">The
Trent study demonstrated significant risks to all the four villages
that I listed and indicated that projects at Swarkestone and Shardlow,
where the defences needed to be revised, were potentially viable. A
cost-benefit analysis for the defences that were suggested was applied
to all the communities. Swarkestone and Shardlow passed that process
and went into a list of projects that the Environment Agency was
prepared to consider funding.</p><p><a name="06102452000275">Since then one small defence
has been erected around a part of Willington, although only after
persistent lobbying by me and some villagers. Further study has,
controversially, reduced the area of risk supposed to affect the
community. That raises the issue of the interaction between the
Environment Agency and those seeking large-scale planning consents in
my constituency. I have raised those concerns with the agency, as it is
worrying that a large-scale development, backed up with the resources
that can be brought to bear, has managed to change the Environment
Agency&#146;s mind about the level of risk that a community faces. I
shall return to that
briefly.</p><p><a name="06102452000276">The Derwent
study is still anxiously awaited in Ambaston, which narrowly missed
being flooded in 2000. There is a flood bank around the community, but
those who live there are pretty sure that it is inadequate. I should
like the Minister to say whether the spending cuts that have been made
in the Environment Agency this year have slowed down the progress of
the Derwent study.</p><p><a name="06102452000277">On
the Dove study, since 2000 Hatton has received around &#163;1.5
million of defence expenditure for a range of projects. A major flood
bank has been erected in one part of the village and substantial work
has been done on the brook that runs round the edge of the village.
Severn Trent Water has also been persuaded to spend quite a lot of
money improving the sewage system in the village, because people in the
community there faced the double horror not only of having their houses
flooded, but of a large amount of sewage flowing back into their homes.
More minor works have been carried out in Scropton, which were thrown
up as a result of detailed study of how the flood had behaved in
2000.</p><p><a name="06102452000278">The 2000 event
was seen as perhaps close to a one-in-100-year event at the time.
However, since then studies have demonstrated that it was not nearly as
infrequent an event as that. There is a complex system of brooks and
rivers in my constituency, which means that the answer is not quite the
same everywhere. However, it seems likely that, generally speaking, the
frequency would be around one in 45 or 50 years&#151;in other words,
a frequency that insurers would find

a level of one in 75 years, and preferably one in 100
years.</p><p><a name="06102452000279">Even after the
new defences at Hatton, a significant proportion of the village would
be vulnerable to a one-in-100-year flood event, while Scropton would be
extensively flooded. Outlying properties in Hilton would flood, as they
did in 2000, and the entirety of the small village of Egginton would
flood, with its current old defences being wholly
inadequate.</p><p><a name="06102452000280">I want to
raise some generic issues with the Minister, which he discussed with me
once before. To what extent do the admirable studies that the
Environment Agency commissions feed into bids for capital expenditure
in the future? The point applies particularly vividly in my
constituency, but the studies do not apply uniquely to South
Derbyshire; I expect that they have demonstrated everywhere else
substantially greater need than had been anticipated. That should put
down markers for the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural
Affair&#146;s bid for the Environment Agency&#146;s resources for
capital works projects into the future. I should like to know about the
methodology: are people feeding the data from the studies into future
capital expenditure
predictions?</p><p><a name="06102452000281">The Dove
study shows continuing extremely high risk. It is fortunate that my
constituency is not a major urban one, in which some of the likely
solutions could not apply. In some cases, such solutions would involve
improving existing defences and increasing the ability of water
upstream to displace into surrounding fields. The area that I am
discussing is primarily rural, and it should be possible to examine how
to displace water in that way and improve the drainage systems in
communities further upstream. The water flows down to my constituents
from such communities and it should be possible to find ways of
improving the performance of drainage systems to reduce that
flow.</p><p><a name="06102452000282">Significant
revenue expenditure will be required to assess the risk around the Dove
and work out which communities should be protected. In my view, all the
ones that I have listed should be. Significant expenditure will also be
required for the design of appropriate solutions, but such requirements
come against a background of Environment Agency cuts and a bidding
process for the next public spending round. My anxiety is that such
projects, in revenue terms&#151;DEFRA has rightly protected the
Environment Agency&#146;s capital budget&#151;may be threatened or
slowed down by the cuts that have already taken place. I understand
from the Environment Agency that budget cuts already appear to have had
some small delaying effect on the Dove study. Clearly, that will
produce anxiety in the communities
affected.</p><p><a name="06102452000283">Let me
summarise what I want addressed. Have the spending cuts that have been
made had any impact on the progress of the Derwent study? I notice that
my constituency neighbour, the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire
(Mr. McLoughlin), is in the Chamber; he may have some
interest in aspects of my speech. What impact have the cuts had on the
Derwent study and its analysis of flood risk and defence needs,
particularly in respect of the section of the Derwent that lies in my
constituency? What progress has been made on projects&#151;especially
those related to the

Environment Agency in the Trent study?</p><p><a name="06102452000284">What methodology does the
agency use in dealing with planning applicants who have a clear
interest in suggesting that flood risk is rather lower than has been
predicted heretofore? There has been considerable anxiety in Willington
that a major developer interested in developing the former power
station has persuaded the agency that its development will have a
lesser impact than the agency itself predicted. The developer appears
to have succeeded, and that has produced a certain cynicism about how
the agency operates in respect of those seeking planning
consent.</p><p><a name="06102452000285">Given the
Environment Agency&#146;s financial position, how will the assessment
and project design of schemes in the Dove study be proceeded with?
Finally, how will an Environment Agency that is clearly under pressure
of budget reductions into the future bring all the tasks together?
Given how they have been imposed, the cuts are likely to produce a
short-term focus on expenditure, particularly this year, and
potentially into future

Minister for Climate Change and the Environment (Ian
Pearson):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) on securing this debate. He
takes a close interest in flood risk management issues, about which we
have spoken on previous occasions. I know that what we are debating is
important for his constituency and many places elsewhere. I thank my
hon. Friend for his positive comments about the Environment
Agency&#146;s work to ensure the effective management of flood risk
in South Derbyshire and the surrounding areas. I shall respond to all
his points.</p><p><a name="06102452000287">Flooding
is a traumatic experience. It is costly in material terms, in its
disruption to people&#146;s lives, and&#151;because of the stress
and worry that it causes&#151;psychologically. In recent years, we
have made a great deal of progress in improving our management of flood
risk and in understanding and taking account of the possible future
impacts of climate change. We estimate that between 4 million and 5
million people live in areas at risk of flooding, and that they have
assets totalling some &#163;250 billion. The probability of flooding
is likely to increase as a result of climate change and the rise in sea
levels, and the cost of the damage that it will cause will increase
along with national wealth and further development in the areas at
risk. That represents a huge challenge for the Government, operating
authorities such as the Environment Agency and those at risk.</p><p><a name="06102452000288">It might be helpful if I
explain some of the overall mechanisms that are in place and the
division of responsibilities between the various agencies and
organisations. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
has overall policy responsibility for flood risk in England, and we
work in partnership with the Environment Agency, which is the principal
operating authority for managing those risks. The agency&#146;s flood
risk management activities are largely funded by DEFRA and operate
within the framework of policy guidance that we provide to all
operating

rests with the operating authorities.</p><p><a name="06102452000289">The measures to manage the risk
include the building and maintenance of defences to reduce the
probability of flooding, but go beyond that to embrace a range of
approaches for reducing the consequences of flooding. They include
flood awareness campaigns, flood warnings and emergency planning, and
seeking to avoid increasing risk through inappropriate new
development.</p><p><a name="06102452000290">We
cannot prohibit all development in areas at risk of flooding, but where
new development is necessary we must ensure that it is appropriate and
safe and does not increase the flood risk elsewhere. My hon. Friend
made a number of comments about that. He might be aware that my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
intends shortly to publish strengthened planning policy guidance for
planning authorities on development planning and flood risk.</p><p><a name="06102452000291">Among other things, the
Environment Agency has been made a statutory consultee for planning
applications in flood risk areas. A new direction is to be issued. It
will allow proposals for development that planning authorities intend
to approve, against Environment Agency advice given on flood risk
grounds, to be called in for consideration by my right hon.
Friend.</p><p><a name="06102452000292"><b><a name="61024h0003.htm_spnew462"><a name="06102452000494">Mr.
Todd:</b> That is extremely welcome, and follows advice that I
gave the Deputy Prime Minister when he directed this area of policy
some four or five years ago. Will the Minister apply that also to the
workings of the inspectorate that determines applications refused by
local authorities, very often on exactly those grounds? Slightly
alarmingly, it does not always stick to that sort of
guidance.</p><p><a name="06102452000293"><b><a name="61024h0003.htm_spnew463"><a name="06102452000495">Ian

Friend&#146;s comments. I welcome his acknowledgement that we have
made a step forward, and I agree with him.</p><p><a name="06102452000294">My hon. Friend will be aware of
the Government&#146;s strategy as a result of their consultation
&#147;Making Space for Water&#148;, and how we are taking it
forward. Among other things, we are currently consulting on extending
the Environment Agency&#146;s role in the strategic overview of
coastal flood and erosion risk. It is not a subject for debate today,
but it is an important
area.</p><p><a name="06102452000295">We have set up
an innovation fund to encourage the development of novel solutions for
managing flood risk, and it offers great opportunities. In addition, we
have identified 15 sites for possible pilot projects to help develop
improvements in integrated urban drainage. We also aim to encourage
better resilience and resistance of buildings and emergency
infrastructure, and are exploring whether it might be practicable to
provide some form of financial assistance to make homes more flood
resilient or resistant in areas where community defences cannot be
justified. We are considering a range of options for helping
communities adapt to the threat of increased erosion or flood risk,
particularly in coastal areas but in other areas as well, where
traditional forms of defence may not be cost-effective or
sustainable.</p><br>

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 397WH</b><br><p><a name="06102452000296">My hon. Friend asked several
questions about budgets and prioritisation. I shall deal with them
before addressing the specific concerns that he had about some villages
in his constituency. The first point is that total Government
expenditure on the management of flood and coastal erosion risk this
year will be some &#163;580 million, up from &#163;310 million in
1996-97. That is a 35 per cent. increase in real terms. Of course there
are increasing demands, and the floods of 2000 raised awareness of
flooding. Much work has been done by the Environment Agency on
producing fluvial strategies and on developing shoreline management
planning processes along the coast. That work has increased the demand
for expenditure on flood defences, but it is important to recognise
the 35 per cent. real-terms increase in budgets. The large
programme that we are funding through the agency and other operating
authorities continues to maintain and improve standards of protection
for communities across the
country.</p><p><a name="06102452000297">My hon.
Friend discussed the reduction this year of the Environment
Agency&#146;s flood defence budget. I can confirm that the budget
reduction does not affect capital works. We were faced with a need to
reprioritise our budgets as a result of unavoidable pressures. Like any
Government Department, we must remain within our overall budget. The
budget for flood risk has been reduced from &#163;428 million to
&#163;413 million, but, as I said, capital works have not been
affected. I regret that the reduction has led to some small delays in
the Derwent study, but I assure my hon. Friend that work on it is
continuing.</p><p><a name="06102452000298">My hon.
Friend asked about prioritisation of investment. He will be aware that
the Environment Agency has a priority scoring system. There is always a
need to prioritise when proposals are considered. The programme of
improvement projects is driven by the operating authorities, and the
projects that come from the strategies are built into an overall
programme and then prioritised through an objective prioritisation
system. If my hon. Friend would like some details of the methodology, I
will ensure that the Environment Agency provides him with it, but I do
not have time to go into it
today.</p><p><a name="06102452000299">For many years,
we have encouraged operating authorities to adopt a strategic approach
to flood risk and to ensure that solutions are co-ordinated. I am glad
that my hon. Friend welcomes the fluvial studies that have taken place
to date. We are taking them one step further by developing plans to
assess flood risk at catchment level by funding a programme of
catchment flood management plans that are being developed by the
Environment Agency.</p><p><a name="06102452000300">I
turn now to some of the specific points that my hon. Friend raised in
respect of his constituency and, more broadly, south Derbyshire. The
Environment Agency has evaluated flood risk from the three major rivers
in the area&#151;the Trent, Derwent and Dove&#151;in order to
establish priorities. As my hon. Friend said, substantial modelling
work was required in several instances, and some of those things take a
considerable amount of
time.</p><p><a name="06102452000301">Following
completion of the fluvial Trent strategy last year, construction work
is under way at West Bridgford in Nottingham and at Burton-on-Trent. A

Nottingham is expected to begin in the next three years. I understand
that the agency is completing floodbank repairs and other improvements
around Shardlow, and that further works are planned for later this year
at Great Wilne.</p><p><a name="06102452000302">My
hon. Friend raised concerns about other villages in his constituency. I
understand that the Environment Agency is doing further work to
identify options for reducing flood risk in Hatton, Scropton and
Egginton. Further investment will depend on the outcome of that work;
if viable options are identified, they will then have to be prioritised
against investment needs elsewhere. As he knows, there are many
competing demands for investment of Government resources in flood and
coastal risk management, and there must be some objective system of
priorities.</p><p><a name="06102452000303"><b><a name="61024h0003.htm_spnew464"><a name="06102452000496">Mr.
Todd:</b> Will my hon. Friend ensure that the tasks that are
defined in the Dove study for funding by the Revenue&#151;he rightly
explained the prioritisation process&#151;will be completed and will
not be delayed by the cuts imposed on the
agency?</p><p><a name="06102452000304"><b><a name="61024h0003.htm_spnew465"><a name="06102452000497">Ian
Pearson:</b> I have no doubt that work will continue on the
Dove study and will in the future lead to the completion of projects,
but the priority that is accorded to them will depend on how they score
when compared with other
projects.</p><p><a name="06102452000305">I also
understand the point that my hon. Friend made about insurance and the
fact that, as a result of some of the studies, it is thought that some
areas are not protected to the level that they were before the work was
done. That may be an important issue for some constituents. We cannot
uninvent knowledge, but we must try to find ways of dealing with the
situation if genuine problems have
resulted.</p><p><a name="06102452000306">I am aware
that there is an issue around raising expectations. If we produce
strategies, there is a natural assumption that they will be
implemented. As I said, we must be careful not to raise expectations,
given the overall budget situation. The budget is growing, and we hope
that the importance of flood risk management will be recognised in the
comprehensive spending review, but we simply cannot fund all the
projects throughout the country. We will have to continue to make some
tough decisions, and that is why it is important that we have an
objective way of doing
so.</p><p><a name="06102452000307">The Environment
Agency is trying to improve the management of public engagement. The
engagement of the public in developing measures to reduce the risks
that affect them is of key importance. People need to be aware of and
understand the risk, how decisions might affect them, how the risk can
best be managed with finite resources and how they might be able to
prepare for and respond to flood risk and flood events. There are some
important issues around public engagement. Through its building trust
with communities and making space for water programmes, the Environment
Agency will consider ways of increasing participation by the public in
the overall decision-making
process.</p><p><a name="06102452000308">I thank my
hon. Friend again for raising these important issues. As I said, the
Government have finite resources, but I am well aware of the issues in
his constituency and would like to assure him that we will continue to
give them serious
attention.</p><br>

Patrick McLoughlin (West Derbyshire) (Con):</b> This is the
second debate on the subject in which I have spoken. I was going to say
it is the second in which I have had the honour of speaking, but I
would much prefer not to have to speak on the subject again. The last
time such a debate was held in the House was 3 December 1997,
nearly nine years ago. In some respects, however, the issue was
different then because it involved a quarry company, RMC, that wanted
to engage in a huge extraction. RMC subsequently withdrew its
application for the site, but the overall story is still much the
same.</p><p><a name="06102452000310">The 1997 debate
was answered by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), who was then Under-Secretary of
State at the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions. One
frustrating thing is the way that the debate has moved from Department
to Department over the nine years. We started off with the DETR, then
it moved to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The matter now
seems to be split between two Departments, with the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs taking responsibility for national
parks and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
taking responsibility for the Planning Inspectorate. That might give
the Minister more freedom, as the Planning Inspectorate is reporting
not directly to him, but to the Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government.</p><p><a name="06102452000311">When I asked the Library for a
paper on the subject not so long ago, it came back with a lovely line,
which
read:</p><a name="61024h0003.htmbrev_69"><a name="06102452000414"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is
a highly complex and contentious
subject&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000312">It is. Today, I
want to deal not with the history of the project, because that would
take a long time, but with what worries me, my constituents and the
wider front of those who are involved in the national park&#151;that
is, what is happening on the Longstone Edge site. I want to come on to
that in some detail.</p><p><a name="06102452000313">I mentioned that the 1997
debate was answered by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich. I received a letter from the Department just prior to that
debate, which said:</p><a name="61024h0003.htmbrev_70"><a name="06102452000415"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As my letter indicated,
the main responsibility for this type of development rests in the first
instance with the Peak District National Park Authority, as the mineral
planning authority. The Secretary of State is generally very reluctant
to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities and
will normally only intervene if the matters concerned are of more than
local importance. While it is clear that the issues in this case are of
considerable importance to local residents, they seem nevertheless to
be essentially of local significance and the Secretary of
State&#146;s intervention in this instance would therefore seem to be
unwarranted.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000314">That was an
inappropriate response then, and it is even more inappropriate now. We
are nine years on and the issue is still not resolved. It is still
complicated and there is no end in
sight.</p><p><a name="06102452000315">Two public
inquiries were planned for the past year. One was cancelled when the
Planning Inspectorate, which had originally allowed three days for it,
turned up and decided that it would take a lot longer to

intervention of the Deputy Prime Minister. I accept that he was acting
solely on legal grounds and best advice, but that has meant that there
is still a great question mark over what is happening on the
site.</p><p><a name="06102452000316">The Peak
District national park has more than 22 million visitors a
year. A thought to bear in mind, perhaps, is that the dome was visited
by 7.5 million people in one year, and we spent a lot of money on it.
Those 22 million visitors enjoy the countryside and the facilities of
the national park, which has been referred to as the lungs of Britain.
It is within an hour&#146;s drive of the populations of Manchester,
Sheffield and the west midlands. That is why, more than most other
national parks&#151;it is the second most visited, after the Lake
District&#151;it gets a huge number of
visitors.</p><p><a name="06102452000317">Not only
those in the local villages, but all those who have enjoyed the
national park, are concerned about the massive scar that is appearing
on the landscape. That is why I do not believe that the Government
should say any longer that the matter is one merely of local importance
and that the Secretary of State does not therefore have a role to
play.</p><p><a name="06102452000318">If the matter
had been resolved, perhaps the explanation nine years ago would have
been sufficient, but nine years on it has not been resolved. As things
stand, I see no end in sight. That should be disturbing to the
Minister, and it is most definitely disturbing to me, my constituents
and, I would imagine, all the people who enjoy the beauty and
tranquillity of the national park. I want to push the Minister on the
question whether he still regards the matter as one of local
significance.</p><p><a name="06102452000319">There
are nearly 70 mineral sites in the national park, of which 12 are
active limestone quarries, 10 are active gritstone sites and eight are
vein mineral sites. Fifteen are no longer active and 24 are in
restoration or aftercare. The majority of the sites that operate in the
national park are compliant with their planning permissions. Many of
the quarries started before the national park came into existence and
the quarries along Longstone Edge were given permission in the early
&#146;50s under a Minister&#146;s consent. The early national park
governing body was not instrumental in that. In fact, that was a far
different era with far fewer restrictions on planning
permissions.</p><p><a name="06102452000320">The Town
and Country Planning Act 1990 allowed the revocation of old planning
permissions, but stated that compensation would have to be paid. That
was beyond the financial scope of most national park authorities. It is
worth thinking how much the national park has spent over the past nine
years, both in correspondence with various Departments and on legal
bills. If we were to add all that money up, I assume that we would come
to a tidy figure.</p><p><a name="06102452000321">A
review of the old planning permissions began following the passing of
the Environment Act 1995, but active sites could continue to work while
modern working conditions were determined. The problem is that there is
a loophole in the legislation that came about as a result of
case law, as modern working conditions cannot be determined
without environmental information from the quarrying companies and the
authority has no power to compel the operators to provide that
information.</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="24 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 401WH</b><br><p><a name="06102452000322">Most quarry operators have
complied with the authority&#146;s request for the information, but
some have not, and they can carry on with their old conditions. Are the
Government considering new legislation to compel those with old
permissions to provide the necessary environmental information? I would
be interested in the Minister&#146;s answer to that.</p><p><a name="06102452000323">The problem started off at
Backdale quarry, and we have now moved on to Wagers Flat, where
extraction is being moved on. There is no doubt that fluorspar is being
used as an excuse to quarry out lots of limestone. The figures are
there. Between 2003 and December 2005, some 11,500 tonnes of fluorspar
were removed with a market value of approximately &#163;5 a tonne,
which means a total of some &#163;57,000, while 573,963 tonnes of
limestone were removed, with an approximate market value of some
&#163;4.5 million. The fluorspar, which is what the permission was
granted for, is worth &#163;57,000 and the waste product&#151;the
side product of the need to get down to the vein minerals&#151;is
worth some &#163;4.5
million.</p><p><a name="06102452000324">I have even
seen reports that the fluorspar mined has never been moved off the site
but is still stored there. If ever there was a question as to what is
being taken away from the national parks, I have no doubt whatever that
the answer is limestone. That should alert the Minister and the
Government to the serious problems on those
sites.</p><p><a name="06102452000325">Wagers Flat is
being operated with an intensity that is incredibly worrying; we can
now see it on the skyline as we leave Bakewell. It is not a big hole at
the moment, but the way the extraction is going it will become a huge
scar on the Longstone Edge landscape. Part of the trouble is that
although there are other vein extractions on Longstone Edge&#151;it
is a huge site&#151;they are covered by restoration provisions, so
they are being restored in a proper manner and under proper
conditions.</p><p><a name="06102452000326">Wagers
Flat and Backdale are not covered by the restoration programme, and if
the company can continue extracting without having to pick up any of
the restoration costs it will have a far bigger advantage over its
competitors. Again, I say that this is not a local problem. I strongly
suggest that it is of such importance that it needs to be considered
more widely.</p><p><a name="06102452000327">Another
problem has been brought to my attention, which involves the aggregates
tax. Many people have been trying to find information on it, and it has
not been easy. One could argue about the rights and wrongs of such a
tax, but if it exists it should be paid by everyone. I understand that
no aggregates tax has been paid for Wagers Flat. It is ridiculous that
the company not only does not have to meet the costs of restoration,
but that it is not paying the aggregates tax. That is not fair. Put
plain and simply, it is not right or proper. Action needs to be
taken.</p><p><a name="06102452000328">At the moment,
an inquiry is scheduled for next February. I am a little worried about
that, because of what happened with the previous two inquiries, but
even if that inquiry goes ahead&#151;the Planning Inspectorate has
set aside 10 days, which seems right&#151;how long will it take to
report? During that time, extraction will still be taking place at
Wagers Flat, which will result in a huge blot on the landscape of the
national park.</p><br>

Baslow&#151;as are the people of Longstone. Indeed, the village of
Longstone has a distinguished resident&#151;a former deputy leader of
the Labour party, Lord Hattersley, who would like to have a national
parks Bill to stop quarrying in the national parks. I do not know
whether there is much chance of that, and we are coming up to the
Queen&#146;s Speech, but I press the Minister on the fact that
loopholes in existing legislation ought to be addressed. That is needed
soon, and I hope he can say what will
happen.</p><p><a name="06102452000330">This is a huge
problem, but I have only limited time and I want to allow the Minister
enough time to give us the Department&#146;s thinking. His
predecessor, now the Minister for Schools, visited the Peak district,
and the people whom he met were greatly impressed with what he had to
say. He went a long way to helping the national park get finance for
the first stop order, but he was in the job for only 18 months before
being promoted to Minister of State. This Minister should take on his
officials&#151;look where he might
land!</p><p><a name="06102452000331">Not so long ago,
at a public meeting at Cliff college, a former regional director of

we may be at a disadvantage in being a National Park. If we
weren&#146;t, local MPs and councillors would be far more actively
engaged in giving guidance to their planners. It isn&#146;t just a
financial issue, it is a political issue. It&#146;s the
responsibility of NPA Members to be putting a lot more political clout
behind this. I feel that the officials, as officials always are, are
being too cautious and they need a bit of steel in their backbones put
there by the politicians, even though they don&#146;t have to ask for
our votes.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000332">That former

subject.</p><p><a name="06102452000333">I have not
been able to go into all the complications; this is not the right kind
of subject for that, although we could write a book on it. The matter
is urgent, and we cannot afford to wait. For various reasons, the
national park authority feels that its hands are tied. I urge the
Minister to visit the area as soon as possible and to see the landscape
for himself. He must decide whether such things are acceptable in a
national park. I do not think they
are.</p><p><a name="06102452000334">I urge the
Minister to think about the questions that I have asked, although I
accept that he may not be able to give full answers today. Will there
be another Adjournment debate on the subject in nine years? If so, we
can talk about the 18 years during which no action has been taken. Is
it right that those operators can spoil and scar the countryside
without making any restoration when the other companies in the area
are, in the main, fulfilling their planning conditions and restoring
those vein minerals that they are now taking
out?</p><p><a name="06102452000335">The Minister
knows that things are not right. He may not be able to say so today,
but action is needed. We need action to stop this remaining a local
issue; it is of national significance. We need to consider whether the
aggregates tax should be paid&#151;and if not, why not? If the
Minister cannot help, we need to know whether any legislative changes
in the near future might give more clout to the Peak District national
park. It has legitimate worries, but feels that its hands are
tied.</p><br>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Barry Gardiner):</b> We have been doubly treated
today. It is rare for members of the Whips Office in either party to
speak; but today a senior Opposition Whip has been able to speak not
only with great authority but with great passion on an extremely
important subject, one that pertains not only to his
constituents&#151;in that sense, it is local&#151;but, as he made
extremely clear, one that has wider ramifications, especially given the
care that we need to take of all our national parks. I hope that that
goes some way to answering the clear questions that he posed about
local importance. Yes, of course, it is of local importance; the appeal
on Backdale is about the extent of quarrying, and it is a local matter.
However, the implications go much wider and that is what the
right hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin)
articulately brought before hon. Members today. I congratulate the
right hon. Gentleman on doing so and on the manner in which he has
presented a powerful case.</p><p><a name="06102452000338">National parks with areas of
outstanding natural beauty represent our finest landscapes. We all have
a duty to ensure their conservation, although we must also take heed of
the social and economic needs of surrounding communities and the wider
community. I wish to make it clear that I understand that mineral
extraction is an important industry in the UK. We need the material
that it produces if our economy is to continue to prosper. However, as
a result, there will sometimes be tension between the economy&#146;s
need for minerals and society's clear desire to conserve some of our
finest landscapes. That tension is well understood in the national
parks, and mineral working imposes significant environmental
challenges. Our mineral planning policy for parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty is very restrictive. New major mineral
development is allowed in those areas only in exceptional circumstances
and where it has been demonstrated to be in the public interest. All
such proposals are subject to a most rigorous examination, which takes
into account the need for the quarry, including national considerations
of mineral supply and the impact on the local
economy.</p><p><a name="06102452000339">There should
also be an assessment of the costs and scope for making an alternative
supply available from outside the designated area or meeting the need
in some other way. Any detrimental effect on the environment or
landscape or on recreational opportunities also has to be considered,
as does the extent to which any impact can be moderated. As a result,
new mineral permissions in our national parks and AONBs are strictly
controlled. However, many of the concerns that people have, including
those raised today, relate to old mineral permissions in our

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 404WH</b><br>designated areas. Many mineral permissions were granted soon after the
second world war, when the priority was to maximise mineral working for
national reconstruction. Environmental awareness and knowledge was
scant and as a result permissions were granted subject to very few
conditions.</p><p><a name="06102452000340">The right
hon. Gentleman compared the value of fluorspar and limestone and said
the permission was there to get fluorspar&#151;an important point
that I do understand. The problem is that some of the permissions,
including this one, are not specific about what they are for. That has
led to the case being such a contracted and protracted one.</p><p><a name="06102452000341">What was accepted in the 1940s
and 1950s as the unavoidable consequences of quarrying would not be
accepted today, and rightly so. In the 1990s, legislation was
introduced to review all old mineral permissions and to continue to
review all mineral permissions at 15-year intervals. The aim is to
ensure that mineral extraction meets, and continues to meet, the
up-to-date environmental standards that we have rightly come to expect.
A permission granted in 1949 with typically three or four conditions,
after review, would perhaps be subject to 50 conditions today and would
aim to mitigate the impact of extraction. It would cover matters such
as noise, dust, traffic and restoration&#151;the points covered by
the right hon.
Gentleman.</p><p><a name="06102452000342">There is a
legacy of old mineral permissions in the national parks and the Peak
District national park has the greatest number of old permissions of
all the English national parks. Backdale is one of those. The vast
majority of initial reviews of old permissions are now complete and
up-to-date working practices are in operation. However, a relatively
small number of initial reviews of old permissions, including those
relating to Backdale and several other sites in the Peak district, have
currently stalled, for a variety of reasons.</p><p><a name="06102452000343">Applications for review in the
stalled cases in England were made before regulations came into effect
in the year 2000. They required that, where mineral working caused a
significant environmental impact, environmental statements should be
provided to inform the review. Those regulations include a sanction for
the suspension of operations where information is not provided. Some of
the stalled initial reviews are still awaiting environmental
information to inform the determination of new operating conditions.
The mineral planning authorities cannot decide the applications without
the information. Advice was issued that, under current legislation,
mineral planning authorities cannot require the submission of that
information either. Meanwhile, the operators of those sites can
continue quarrying. That is the Catch-22 we are
in.</p><p><a name="06102452000344">The situation is
clearly unsatisfactory, but the Department for Communities and Local
Government, which is responsible for minerals legislation, fully
appreciates that. It is preparing to consult on new regulations which,
among other things, would provide a sanction&#151;exactly what the
right hon. Gentleman inquired about&#151;to ensure that outstanding
environmental information is provided and new conditions can finally be
determined.</p><p><a name="06102452000345"><b><a name="61024h0003.htm_spnew468"><a name="06102452000500">Mr.

Communities and Local Government are trying to put a system in place by
introducing regulations. I cannot speak for the outcome of those
investigations, but that is what they are attempting to
do.</p><p><a name="06102452000347">We have heard
today about other planning problems relating to Backdale quarry. The
Peak District national park authority considers that the quarrying of
the limestone taking place at Backdale is in excess of that allowed
under the terms of the mineral planning permission. The matter is
subject to action by the authority, which has served an enforcement
notice in respect of the mineral operations. The owner and operator of
the site have appealed against the notice and a public inquiry into
those appeals has been arranged for February 2007, as the right hon.
Gentleman said. I cannot comment on the merits of that issue, as to do
so could prejudice the outcome of those appeals. I hope that the right
hon. Gentleman will not take that as an indication that I am resiling
in any way from some of his comments.</p><p><a name="06102452000348">While the inquiry is pending,
the authority wished to serve a stop notice on the operator until the
appeal was decided. However, it could not afford to do so in case the
appeals were successful and the authority was faced with claims for
compensation by the owner and operator. The authority approached my
Department to see whether the Government would agree to refund any
compensation it might face if the appeals were successful. We agreed,
but stressed that it was a one-off and on an exceptional basis. We also
stressed that the offer was solely to enable the authority to carry out
the actions it thought necessary. It implied no view on the merits of
the authority's case against the operator, as that would have been
improper.</p><p><a name="06102452000349">I recognise
that some would consider that the continued mineral extraction at
Backdale and indeed others at Longstone Edge, should be stopped.
Mineral planning authorities have a wide range of powers to revoke or
modify mineral planning permissions. The decision on whether to revoke
or modify any existing mineral permissions on Longstone Edge rests with
the national park authority. It must consider whether such action would
be justified on a case-by-case basis, bearing in mind the resources
that they have available.

annual grant to the national park authority, bearing in mind the
constraints and competing priorities within DEFRA and the needs of the
authorities themselves. It is then for each authority to determine
where its priorities lie and to make decisions about how to spend its
budget accordingly.</p><p><a name="06102452000350">I
hope that the right hon. Gentleman will recognise that the underwriting
of the national park authority&#146;s actions by my Department under
my predecessor, now the Minister for Schools, the hon. Member for South
Dorset (Jim Knight), symbolised and strongly signified that it was a
matter that the Government recognised as having much wider
ramifications than for Backdale.</p><p><a name="06102452000351">The right hon. Gentleman raised
the point that the aggregates levy sustainability fund should be used
to support the national park authorities. The fund has enabled about
&#163;30 million of work through Natural England and predecessor
bodies, to address impacts on landscape and biodiversity additional to
any requirements under minerals planning legislation. That has not been
restricted to protected areas or to the effects of old mineral
permissions. My officials have been working with Treasury officials to
determine whether the fund should continue after the current commitment
until 2007, and if so, what form it should take. No decision on that
has yet been made.</p><p><a name="06102452000352">In
addition, there may be a case for a differential rate for the levy and
we are looking into that. The Chancellor, of course, keeps all taxes
under regular review, with announcements made through the pre-Budget
report and the Budget process.</p><p><a name="06102452000353">There is also a question
whether the exemptions under the aggregates levy should be reviewed. My
colleagues in Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs are aware of the
reported issues of aggregates extracted for commercial purposes under
exemptions such as for vein minerals, and they are looking into that. I
think that that addresses the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific
question about the aggregates levy and the different valuation rates
for limestone and vein minerals. In the meantime, we are taking action

the opportunity to raise once again the situation of the Saharawi
people and Western Sahara. I shall keep my remarks especially brief
because I want my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy
Corbyn) to say a few words if he catches your eye, Mr.
Caton.</p><p><a name="06102452000356">The debate
comes at an important moment in the sad history of Western Sahara. The
United Nations Security Council will meet in the next few days to
discuss the way forward on the peace process after 15 years of
Moroccan obstruction. My hon. Friend the Minister will need no
reminding that, as a permanent member of the Security Council, the
United Kingdom has a vital role to play in resolving the dispute, which
has gone on far too long. It has a legal responsibility under the UN
charter as a permanent member of the Security Council to protect the
people of Western Sahara from continuing Moroccan oppression. Sadly, it
is failing in its
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06102452000357">The
history of Britain&#146;s approach has largely been one of
indifference and inaction. I am talking not just about the current
Government; the problem dates back a considerable time. While offering
the bromide that it supports the UN process or UN efforts, the UK has
built up its own relationships and trade with Morocco, and has done
very little to compel Morocco to end the illegal occupation and to
allow a referendum on the right of self-determination, or to exert
pressure on Morocco to end the human rights abuses committed against
the Saharawi
people.</p><p><a name="06102452000358">By recently
signing up to an EU agreement with Morocco whereby the EU will pay
Morocco to fish Western Sahara&#146;s waters, the UK is rewarding
Morocco for its occupation. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington,
North had a lot to say on that in a debate with the Under-Secretary of
State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the
Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), but it remains a running
sore.</p><p><a name="06102452000359">I hope that the
Minister&#146;s comments will give us some hope for the future,
because we have had enough bromides. I suspect that he will say that
the UK will continue to support the UN Secretary-General&#146;s
personal envoy, but all the messages coming back are that the UN is
losing respect in the territories, and the Polisario feels that time
has run out. Sadly, the UN has achieved precisely nothing in the 15
years since the ceasefire. The reason why it is unable to do anything
seems to be that countries such as the UK will not engage in the proper
process of bringing self-determination to the territories. If that
continues, we will end up with the current shameful situation, which is
unacceptable.</p><p><a name="06102452000360">Britain&#146;s
membership of the UN Security Council is premised on our responsibility
to pursue and enforce the fair and lawful resolution of disputes before
the council. The Government claim that they take that very seriously.
In a pamphlet published last month, my right hon. Friend the Prime
Minister
wrote:</p><a name="61024h0004.htmbrev_72"><a name="06102452000417"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Wherever

in fear under Moroccan oppression, and unless the UK and other powers
do something, they have no prospect of advancing. It is tempting to say
that the British Government have done absolutely nothing to show that
they are on their side, but even that would be wrong, as the Government
are doing something worse than nothing&#151;they can be seen to be
complicit in the continuing
occupation.</p><p><a name="06102452000362">When the
fisheries deal, which is about plundering the fish in Western
Sahara&#146;s waters, was signed, objections were made, but that made
little difference. Britain agreed with that deal, and for some hon.
Members that was a very sad day. Was the Minister aware that the EU
justified the deal by distorting a 2002 opinion from the UN legal
adviser, Hans Corell, and that Mr. Corell himself said that
the agreement was a violation of international law? Action could have
been taken to forestall the deal. I am aware of the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office legal opinion that the agreement does not
&#147;prejudice&#148; any eventual settlement of the dispute, but
can the Minister explain how paying Morocco to allow the EU to fish the
waters of the occupied territory pressures Morocco into agreeing to any
settlement involving self-determination in the
territories?</p><p><a name="06102452000363">The
occupation in which Britain is, sadly, complicit remains an ugly thing.
The Saharawi people are denied their political and human rights; they
are oppressed. How do we know that? After organisations such as Human
Rights Watch and Amnesty International raised the profile of
allegations of torture against prisoners of conscience in Western
Sahara, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights sent a
fact-finding team to the territory in May this year. Is the Minister
aware of the existence and contents of that report and, if so, how does
he intend to act on some of the shocking findings? In case he has not
seen the report&#151;it has not been published; behind that lies a
tale that I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North may be
able to speak about&#151;we are happy to furnish him with a copy of
it, because it contains a number of serious allegations that need to be

support the position that he puts before the Chamber. Therefore, there
is undoubtedly a dispute over which side speaks for the people. I am
sure that he would wish to comment on the fact that only two of the 32
tribes support the Polisario position and that therefore the position
of Her Majesty&#146;s Government and preceding Governments seems to
be the fairest if one looks at the issue from an unbiased point of

debate. I feel a sense of depression, disappointment and anger that in
2006 we are debating whether the position of the Polisario in
representing the people of Western Sahara and in demanding a referendum
is the correct one. The reason I feel anger and depression is that I
first raised this matter in the House more than 20 years ago
at 4 o&#146;clock in the morning during one of the many
all-night Adjournment debates that we used to have in those days. The
debate concerned the situation in Western Sahara. The then Foreign
Office Minister told me, as subsequent Ministers have told me,
&#147;We accept the UN position. Of course there&#146;ll be a
referendum.&#148; We have had those answers year after year after
year. The former Member of Parliament for Gloucester, Tess Kingham,
raised the issue many times, as have other hon. Members. I hope that

fortune to visit the refugee camps in Algeria and to travel into the
small bit of liberated zone of the Western Sahara itself to attend the
Polisario congress two years ago. Those camps have been there for 31
years. They are home to 150,000 people, who rely on the UN and aid
agencies for food, medicine, education, housing and life itself. Is it
right that after all these years&#151;31 years&#151;the rest of the
world should simply look away, throw a bit of money at the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, and say,
&#147;It&#146;s going to be okay. They&#146;ll survive there
somehow&#148;? It is wrong. It is an injustice that has to be dealt
with.</p><p><a name="06102452000369">The report
referred by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on
the mission to the Western Sahara refugee camps in Tindouf is very
interesting and I am astonished that it has not been published. We need
to know why, and I look to the Government of the UK to demand, as a
loyal and active member of the United Nations, the answer to that. The
report outlines the systematic abuse of human rights, unfair trials,
illegal imprisonment, and all the horrors that go with that, of the
people, who have suffered because of the continued occupation of
Western Sahara.</p><p><a name="06102452000370">When
the referendum was first mooted by MINURSO there were many arguments

of things have happened since then. One was that when the UN
representative, Baker, was asked to go there and investigate on behalf
of the Secretary-General, he undertook many negotiations and came up
with what was known as the Baker plan. In essence it said that the
Western Sahara people should accept the de facto administration of the
territories and that at a later stage there should be a referendum on
the future of the territory. That would probably include votes for the
settlers who were moved there by Morocco in the first place.</p><p><a name="06102452000371">I attended the Polisario
congress that debated that report and the proposal. It was painful to
see how the Polisario had been forced into that corner by the
international community with the promise of a degree of peace and a
right of return, but with no promise of the immediate independence for
Western Sahara that it has long demanded and for which it has long
campaigned. It was not even given a promise of its possibility in the
near future. Having taken a historic, difficult and painful decision,
it was then stabbed in the back by Morocco and the United Nations when
progress on the process was simply not made. That is the tragedy and
sadness of the
situation.</p><p><a name="06102452000372"><b><a name="61024h0004.htm_spnew475"><a name="06102452000507">Derek

was at the congress. I am well aware of the Polisario position and the
difficulty it faced. I understand that the hon. Gentleman has close
contacts with the Moroccan Administration, and he must know their
position: they want to continue occupying Western Sahara illegally and
to deny the Sahrawi people the right to vote independently on their
future. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud pointed out,
unfortunately Morocco can be said to have been rewarded by the
agreement of the fisheries policy that was approved by the
EU.</p><p><a name="06102452000374">My plea to the
Minister is to understand the injustice that has happened to the
Sahrawi people; to understand the geopolitics of it&#151;the wealth,
in the form of fish in the sea and minerals under the ground; and to
understand the plight of the people living in refugee camps for all
those years. At the moment there is no fighting. There is the sand
wall. There are landmines. There are tanks and tens of thousands, if
not hundreds of thousands, of Moroccan troops available to go into the
area should fighting break out. There is also tension, I believe, among
the Sahrawi people. Young people cannot understand why they should
spend their lives in a refugee camp when their home is a few miles
away, and they want to return in dignity and peace.</p><p><a name="06102452000375">Surely this time it is up to
us, as a member of the UN, the Security Council and the Human Rights

Minister for the Middle East (Dr. Kim Howells):</b> It is a
pleasure to serve for the first time under your chairmanship,
Mr. Caton. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud
(Mr. Drew) for raising the subject. I know that he, my hon.
Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) and the hon.
Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Derek Conway) have been committed to
this issue for many years. Indeed, I remember discussing it at length
with both my hon. Friends shortly after becoming a Minister at the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p><p><a name="06102452000377">I have discussed Western Sahara
on several recent occasions with Ministers from Morocco and
Algeria&#151;for example, during my visit to both countries in June.
Last week, I had a detailed discussion about Western Sahara with the
Moroccan Deputy Foreign Minister, His Excellency Taib Fassi Fihri. I
know, and we have just heard, that there are strong views on this
subject. Members of Parliament regularly write to me about it, albeit
that they include my two hon. Friends, and members of the public write
too. The non-governmental organisation War on Want recently sent the
Foreign Office more than two thousand postcards about Western Sahara,
expressing support for a referendum on independence. The subject stirs
strong views and emotions. Firmly held principles are at stake.
</p><p><a name="06102452000378">I want to emphasise
that the UK Government remain keen for the issue to be resolved. The
status of Western Sahara has been undetermined for more than 30 years.
Resolving that would have a positive benefit for the region and its
people.</p><p><a name="06102452000379">The United
Kingdom supports the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the
United Nations to assist the different parties to overcome the deadlock
and to make progress towards achieving a lasting negotiated settlement
to this frozen conflict. The United Kingdom is in close contact with
the Kingdom of Morocco, which has committed itself officially to
formulate a credible autonomy proposal before the end of March 2007. To
finalise the autonomy proposal, as a compromise, large democratic
consultations, at both grass-roots and national level, are under
way.</p><p><a name="06102452000380"><b><a name="61024h0004.htm_spnew478"><a name="06102452000510">Richard
Younger-Ross (Teignbridge) (LD):</b> The Minister referred to
the status of Western Sahara as undetermined. Can he then explain why
the Government have supported an EU deal on fisheries with one side of
the disputed
land?</p><p><a name="06102452000381"><b><a name="61024h0004.htm_spnew479"><a name="06102452000511">Dr.

into that in great depth. The EU-Morocco fisheries agreement is an EU
bilateral partnership agreement and should have no effect on the
question of the status of Western Sahara which is being dealt with

answer from us, and that is why we supported the deal.</p><p><a name="06102452000382">To that end, the UK continues
to support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and his
personal envoy to Western Sahara, Peter Van Walsum, to assist the
parties in achieving a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political
solution that will provide for the self-determination of the people of
Western Sahara.</p><p><a name="06102452000383">Hon.
Members will know that the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara&#151;MINURSO&#151;plays an important stabilising
role in the region. It has monitored the ceasefire between Morocco and
the Polisario front for the past 15 years, but has not been able to
organise a referendum on the territory&#146;s status. Currently there
are no plans for a UN referendum. The Government supported UN Security
Council resolution 1675, which was adopted unanimously on 28 April
2006, and which renewed MINURSO&#146;s mandate for a further six
months. The Security Council will discuss MINURSO tomorrow, and we will
play an active role in those discussions. We support the extension of
MINURSO&#146;s mandate for a further six
months.</p><p><a name="06102452000384"><b><a name="61024h0004.htm_spnew480"><a name="06102452000512">Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> Will the Minister assure us that in the Security
Council&#146;s discussions tomorrow the UK will call for a permanent
human rights monitor for the whole area, so that we can at least be
aware of the danger of human rights abuses there? What position will
the UK Government take if the matter is raised at the UN Human Rights
Council?</p><p><a name="06102452000385"><b><a name="61024h0004.htm_spnew481"><a name="06102452000513">Dr.
Howells:</b> I will come to human rights in a moment; it is an
important part of what I want to
say.</p><p><a name="06102452000386">The Government
are in close contact with the Kingdom of Morocco about Western Sahara.
As I said, I discussed that subject with the Moroccan Deputy Foreign
Minister last week, and I have listened carefully to his
Government&#146;s concerns. The most important message that I have
received, from which I draw a great deal of hope, is that the Kingdom
of Morocco has undertaken to formulate a credible autonomy proposal
before the end of March 2007. As I said, wide-ranging consultations at
both grass-roots and national level are under way to finalise the
autonomy proposal. The Government strongly encourage Morocco to publish
its autonomy proposal and satisfy the deadline, which we will consider
carefully. At the moment, there are widely held hopes that it has the
potential to move matters forward in Western Sahara constructively and
peacefully, but, of course, everything depends on the nature of the
proposal.</p><p><a name="06102452000387"><b><a name="61024h0004.htm_spnew482"><a name="06102452000514">Derek
Conway:</b> Will the Minister clarify whether the Government
have changed their position? His briefing may well have made him aware
that on the basis of this little Adjournment debate, which, according
to the press notice from the Algerian Government, was supposed to be
answered by the Foreign Secretary in the main Chamber, they are saying
that the British Government have changed their position. I understand
that that is not the case, and unless I have misheard the Minister, it
most definitely is not the case. This is a

Majesty&#146;s Government have not altered their position on this
matter one
iota.</p><p><a name="06102452000388"><b><a name="61024h0004.htm_spnew483"><a name="06102452000515">Dr.
Howells:</b> The UK voted for the recent UN General Assembly
fourth commission resolution on Western Sahara, which restated past UN
resolutions, including support for the Baker plan. The text of the
resolution for which we voted was essentially the same as the
resolution adopted by consensus in 2005. The UK therefore voted in
favour. I emphasise that that vote does not represent a change in the
UK&#146;s position on the status of Western Sahara. The UK supported
resolution 1495, which described the Baker plan as</p><a name="61024h0004.htmbrev_73"><a name="06102452000418"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an optimum political solution on
the basis of agreement between the two
parties&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102452000389">Therein lies
the rub: we have to get that agreement between the two parties. That
has to be our overall aim. Successive UN resolutions have called for a
mutually acceptable political solution, and the Baker plan has not been
accepted by all parties to the
dispute.</p><p><a name="06102452000390">My hon.
Friend the Member for Islington, North asked about the human rights
situation. Morocco is party to all core UN human rights conventions and
continues to make progress in improving its human rights record. I can
assure him that that is the case. I have been involved in negotiating
closely with the Moroccans on human rights issues, and we have here
some people whom we would very much like to go back to Morocco. The
Moroccans want them back and we do not particularly want them in this
country, for various reasons, but we cannot send anyone back at the
moment. The courts would never allow us to send anyone back unless
there were guarantees that big improvements had been made to the human
rights situation. I believe that large steps have been taken in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06102452000391">I have not
seen the leaked document that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud
mentioned, although I could probably get my hands on it if I tried.
Since I have been in government, I have an aversion to leaked
documents. I used to love them when I was in opposition, but I do not
like them so much now. I shall certainly take advantage of my his offer
and take it away with
me.</p><p><a name="06102452000392">The resolution of
humanitarian questions in Western Sahara should not await the
conclusion of a political settlement. The UK, along with EU partners,
regularly calls on Morocco and the Polisario to deal with outstanding
human rights and humanitarian issues and implement confidence-building
measures all round. We welcome the recent decision by the parties to
resume the programme of family visits between the territory and the
Tindouf camps as a positive step forward. I would like to see many
other positive steps, as we have seen such steps act as building blocks
towards the conclusion of frozen conflicts elsewhere in the world, and
I very much hope that that will happen in this case. We have also
encouraged all the parties to

1991.</p><p><a name="06102452000393">The European
Commission humanitarian aid department, ECHO, is the largest single
donor of aid to the refugee camps near Tindouf. It recently provided
&#8364;10 million, or &#163;6.7 million, to which the UK contributed
18 per cent. That is &#163;1.2 million at current exchange
rates.</p><p><a name="06102452000394">The Office of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights visited Western
Sahara and the camps near Tindouf in May and June 2006. My hon. Friend
the Member for Islington, North asked whether I am aware of the date on
which the report will be published. I am not aware of any such date,
and I do not know why that report is not being published. If we can get
answer for him, we certainly will.</p><p><a name="06102452000395">In his most recent report on
Western Sahara, the UN Secretary-General did not comment on
Morocco&#146;s human rights record. In his April report, he expressed
concern at reports of heavy-handed Moroccan responses to demonstrations
in the territory in 2005, including the arrest and detention of several
individuals. The Foreign Office referred to that in our recent human
rights report, but I emphasise that Kofi Annan did not comment on
allegations about Morocco in his most recent
report.</p><p><a name="06102452000396">The Government
have not carried out their own assessment of the number of individuals
who disappeared as a result of the conflict in Western Sahara, but that
is extremely important. Their position is to encourage the parties to
co-operate fully with the International Committee of the Red Cross to
account for the people who are missing, and we continue to encourage
them to take concrete measures within their areas of responsibility to
resolve the outstanding humanitarian issues.</p><p><a name="06102452000397">I want to reassure my hon.
Friends that the Government are concerned that the status of Western
Sahara should not remain unresolved. Of course it should be resolved,
and the consequent problems for the people of the region should also be
addressed. More than 30 years have passed since Spain left. My hon.
Friend the Member for Islington, North is right to say that the
situation needs immediate resolution. We will work towards that, but I
ask my hon. Friends to remember that there have been many attempts to
resolve the conflict. The fisheries agreement to which the hon. Member
for Old Bexley and Sidcup referred was agreed unanimously by the EU. A
great many countries and people want to find a solution to the
situation, and we are certainly one of them. I take my hon.
Friends&#146; points about us being members of the Security Council
and that we have to take an active role in trying to find that
solution, and I assure them that we will press as hard as we can to do
just that.</p><p><a name="06102452000398"><i>It being
