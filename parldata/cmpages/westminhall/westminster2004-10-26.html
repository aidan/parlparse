<a name="41026h01_head1"><h3 align=center>Council Tax Revaluation</h3>


<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Phil Hope.]</i>
</p>



<a name="41026h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>


<p><a name="41026h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Steve Webb  (Northavon)</b>  (LD): Normally, when I stand up in the House I talk about pensions and pensioners. Although the subject today is council tax revaluation, it will be of particular interest to pensioners across the land who are suffering from a tax that has little or no relation to their ability to pay and has become increasingly onerous in recent years. While the subject of my debate is not the reform and replacement of the council tax, it is important to set the context. Although I will focus on the impact of council tax revaluation, my preferred solution is that we do not go through the whole palaver of spending &#163;200 million revaluing houses, but move directly to a fair tax. That is obviously what I hope will happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para0">In the unlikely event that that does not happen, it is worth reflecting on the possible alternative, which is the revaluation of council taxes. In many ways, the planned revaluation shows why the council tax is unfair. Under government policies, that will happen every 10 years, indefinitely. We will have a taste of it in a few years time. Then it will keep happening. Many of the problems that I describe in this short debate will be recurrent features of the system. My central point is that the impact of council tax revaluation will be capricious and arbitrary. It will create gainers and losers. Many of the losers will not be well placed to pay what in some cases will be substantially increased bills. I am not trying to run a scare story or saying that everyone will pay more. Revaluation will create gainers and losers.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Philip Hammond  (Runnymede and Weybridge)</b>  (Con): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : On the subject of scare stories, I willingly give way.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hammond </b> : On the subject of gainers and losers, will he confirm that a local income tax would also produce gainers and losers?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : It certainly would. I understand that 70   per cent of people would either be unaffected or would gain from a local income tax. The vast majority of pensioners, to return to my initial comments, would gain substantially from the change.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew5"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): There will be gainers and losers on revaluation, but does the hon. Gentleman accept that some of the gainers will be those who lost last time and some of the losers 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 354WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
will be those who gained last time and so it is at least conceivable that the revised valuation framework will be fairer than the current system?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : In a sense, my central point is that the pattern of gains and losses will be quite arbitrary. I started my research for this debate with certain assumptions about clear-cut patterns of gains and losses. The more I have looked at it, the more I have realised that in one street there will be a gain and in another there will be a loss. There will be well-off people gaining and there will be poor people losing; it will be all over the place. In my judgment, only moving to a system based on ability to pay will ensure that the gainers are those who can least afford to pay council tax and the losers are those who can most afford to do so.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Edward Davey  (Kingston and Surbiton)</b>  (LD): Does my hon. Friend accept that because the Government have been so dilatory in giving even a sense of direction on where they are going on council tax reform, we cannot begin to guess who the losers and gainers will be? All that we know is that there will be a lot of losers.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : I certainly will not let that stop me trying. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. People do not know what sort of local tax system they will get. At the general election, both the Labour party and the Conservative party will stand on a policy of, &quot;We do not know yet what sort of local tax system we want&quot;. Only one party will say what it does want to see happen. But, Mr. Sayeed, you would not want me to be diverted down that track. Let us focus on the revaluation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para1">The council tax was introduced in 1993 by the Conservatives after a previous failed local tax system. They were trying to get out of a local taxation mess. The system was based on 1991 property values. There was no initial provision for a revaluation when the council tax was introduced, but the Local Government Act 2003 provided for a rolling 10-year cycle of revaluation. The revaluation is now being prepared and is expected to be implemented in 2007. That is my understanding. What will the effect be? As they say, we do not need a crystal ball when we can read the book, and we can see what has happened in Wales&#151;just a few miles away over the Severn bridge&#151;where revaluation has already taken place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para2">The Welsh experience raises several interesting points, which might be informative for our discussion. First, when Welsh properties were revalued, the value of bands was increased too&#151;not only did people move up bands because of general inflation but the value of bands increased. However, that increase was not uniform, and I shall return to that, because I had assumed&#151;as I said, I came to the issue relatively fresh&#151;that every band threshold would go up by the average increase in Welsh house prices. That is not what happened, however, and it is interesting to reflect on why it did not happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para3">The Welsh have introduced a band I&#151;or a band Dai, as I think they call it in Wales&#151;at the top. Although it affects only a very small number of properties, it obviously makes the tax system slightly more progressive. The Welsh Assembly also considered changing the relative fraction of the band D council tax 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 355WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
 charge in each of the bands, but on reflection decided not to do so. So, the band structure remains essentially the same, although there is one extra band at the top, which affects a very small number of properties, and there are the same relativities between the bands. However, there is a differential increment in the band thresholds, which is quite a good thing, for reasons that I shall explain.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para4">As is well known, the overall effect of the revaluation is that approximately a third of Welsh households will be placed in a higher council tax band&#151;just 8 per cent. will be in a lower band. Of the 33 per cent. of Welsh households that will be placed in a higher band, 28 per cent.&#151;or 28 33rds, as it were&#151;will go up one band, 4 per cent. will go up two bands and approaching 1 per cent. will go up three or more bands, which is an incredible change in underlying liability. I shall come to some of the transitional measures in a moment, but those are the underlying changes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para5">Obviously, a lot depends on what happens to the band D rate. It is not obvious in itself that someone would pay more just because they moved up a band, although the chances are that they would pay substantially more. Someone who moved from band D to band E would pay an extra 22 per cent. of any given level of band D tax. Someone who moved from band D to band F, or an equivalent number of bands, as 4 per cent. of people would do, would pay 44 per cent. more council tax. That might be slightly offset by a reduced band D level, although we do not know that for sure yet. However, anyone who moved up two bands would be substantially hit, and that, of course, is before any increase in the council tax that a local authority might want to levy.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew9"><b> Valerie Davey  (Bristol, West)</b>  (Lab): The hon. Gentleman said that he would not put out a scare story and that he would soon come to the transitional arrangements. Surely, those arrangements are crucial to the Welsh system and the system proposed by the Government, because nobody will be jumping three bands in the way that he suggests.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : What is rather interesting about the transitional arrangements proposed by the Welsh Assembly is that someone could go up a whole band in a single year, which, if they moved from band D to band E, would mean a council tax increase of 22 per cent. Even if the band D rate fell by a few per cent. to offset the general drift upwards in bands, people could still face massive council tax rises in a single year. The 28 33rds, or slightly more than four fifths, of people who went into a higher band would therefore receive no benefit from transitional protection because they could go up a whole band in a single year. In other words, the vast majority of people who went up bands would have no benefit from transitional protection. Those who went up two bands would have only one year of transitional protection, because they could go up two bands in two years under the Welsh Assembly&#039;s transitional arrangements. That leaves only 0.7 per cent. of Welsh households benefiting for more than two years under the transitional arrangements. Someone whose council tax rose by 44 per cent. in two years would not take much comfort from the hon. Lady&#039;s intervention.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 356WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para6">The impact on different sorts of household would be capricious and rather arbitrary. Those who were just inside a band after revaluation would probably gain. If an across-the-board valuation of bands was slightly more than the general increase in prices, the band D rate might go down. So, those who stayed in a band might pay less, while those who went &#163;1 over a band might pay 20 per cent. more. A house price increase of &#163;1 or &#163;2 either way could result in a difference in council tax of as much as 20 per cent. Where is the logic in that? Where is the fairness? Cliff edges of that sort will become more acute as a result of revaluation. That would not happen with local income tax, which is a continuous method of taxation; marginal changes would have a marginal impact. There would be no cliff edges as there are with council tax.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para7">The second capricious and arbitrary feature of the revaluation would be that people in the bottom band could not move down. Unless the Government subdivide the bottom band, and even if there was an across-the-board indexation, only by reducing the band D rate would those in the bottom band see any benefit from the process. People already in the top band could not go any higher&#151;unless the Government introduced yet more bands at the top. Rather perversely, the reform would result in gains in some rather odd places&#151;for instance, among those whose houses had stayed within a band even if the band thresholds had moved significantly&#151;whereas some of the poorest households would gain very little. Looking at the Welsh example, the distribution impact of the changes is far from obvious.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para8">I return to the point on damping raised by the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Valerie Davey). As I said, even under the transitional arrangements, some people will see their council tax increase by two bands in two years. That is a huge hike in liability, but with no change in people&#039;s ability to pay. In fact it could be worse than that. Someone who bought a house in 1991 while in employment, who was still living there after retirement in 2005, and therefore after the revaluation, could find that his ability to pay was substantially less, but that his council tax liability had increased dramatically. Again, the impact of the revaluation will have precious little to do with people&#039;s ability to pay.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para9">If one looks beyond the aggregates, one can see huge variations in the impact of the tax among local authorities in Wales. In Cardiff, 64 per cent. of residents have seen their properties rise by one or more band; and 14 per cent. of that 64 per cent. have gone up two bands or more. One Cardiff householder in seven will have gone up by two bands or more over the next two years. They will see a rise of perhaps 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. in council tax for no improvement in services&#151;and, critically, no change in their ability to pay. In Blaenau Gwent, however, only 7 per cent. of households have gone up, and 18 per cent. have gone down. The changes have different implications in different parts of Wales, with some people seeing a huge change in liability over a short period. What sort of tax is it that can swing massively from one year to another, but has no relation to the ability to pay?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew11"><b> David Taylor </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman accept the basic assumption that the aggregate income from council tax will not necessarily rise, and therefore that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 357WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
those who move up one band&#151;as he said, as many as a quarter of people will do so&#151;will not necessarily be paying more council tax as a result of the revaluation? The charge per band could decline; it could go in the reverse direction.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : I have already said that if the general tendency is to move into higher bands, there would be an offset if the band D rate were to come down. However, the beneficiaries will primarily be those who stay in the same band. If people who stay in the same band&#151;the majority&#151;are better off, somebody else will be worse off. The only people left are those whose council tax has gone up. It must be so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para10">I did not claim that those who moved from band D to band E would go up the full 22 per cent. I was explicit; I said that there might be some offset from the lower band D rate, but that it would not be a total offset. It cannot be a total offset, or those who stay within bands could not benefit; but they will benefit if the band D rate goes down. We do not know. For example, those who move up two bands&#151;as have one in seven Cardiff households&#151;could suffer an underlying 44 per cent. increase. I cannot believe that the band D reduction is going to be a fraction of that, and such people could still be 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. worse off over two years. That is capricious and unfair.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hammond </b> : Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : Perhaps I could make some progress. I will give way later if the hon. Gentleman still wants to intervene.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para11">We have huge variations between areas; some people are facing very large losses. What does the Welsh experience tell us about what might happen in England? The Government obviously have not told us. They have not yet decided whether to have more bands, or whether the relativities&#151;the ninths&#151;or the thresholds are likely to change. One of the purposes of today&#039;s debate is to highlight what might happen, and to ask the Minister to give us some assurances about the Government&#039;s thinking on the issue. How does he plan to counteract some of the capricious and arbitrary effects of revaluation? I hope that he will respond in the right spirit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para12">In England, in principle, the same sort of phenomenon could take place. However, if there were to be a national revaluation of English house prices, there would be huge regional variations. For example, going by the Nationwide building society&#039;s house price index, house prices in greater London have trebled since 1991&#151;there has been an increase of 205 per cent. The next fastest rising prices have been in the south-west, where they have risen by 193 per cent. Those regions are at the top of the table. As a south-west MP, I would point out that, of all regions outside greater London, the south-west is likely to be the one most affected by the changes. By contrast, in that period, prices rose by 141 per cent. in the north and 150 per cent. in the north-west.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para13">If we were to continue with the present England-wide standard set of council tax bands, there would be a huge redistribution from the south to the north. If the Government were to say&#151;perhaps the Minister will tell 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 358WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
us that they will not&#151;to southern authorities, &quot;You have lots more people in bands E and F, so you can raise a lot more money. Therefore we, the Government, do not need to give you so much grant and, because the northern authorities have many more houses in bands A and B, the Government need to give them more money,&quot; there could be redistribution. The New Policy Institute is quoted on the Department&#039;s website as having estimated that there could be a &#163;400 million deviation of resources from the south to the north of England if there were to be a straight revaluation. I am interested to note that it says,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In our view, these simple points about the detailed pattern of winner and losers mean that basic revaluation&#151;&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para14">which is what I have just described&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;is impossible to defend.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para15">I hope that the Minister will reassure us that if he must go ahead and waste &#163;200 million on the exercise, it will not be just a straightforward national revaluation.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew15"><b> Valerie Davey </b> : Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : Again, I should like to make some progress. I have already given way to the hon. Lady.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para16">It is worth reflecting a little on the New Policy Institute&#039;s detailed analysis&#151; published on the Department&#039;s website&#151;of how revaluation might be approached. It asks three questions: first, whether it would be right to have across-the-board revaluation; secondly, whether there should be new bands or different ratios between the bands; and thirdly, whether there should be regional variation. One of its reasons for thinking that across-the-board, England-wide standard revaluation would not be appropriate is that, on that basis, 75 per cent. of houses in the north-west but only 6 per cent. of houses in London would be in band A or B post-revaluation. That would create an extraordinarily skewed system. The paradox, it observes, is that under such a regime, band A houses in the north would not share in the gain and band G and H houses in the south would not share in the pain. It is not simply the case that, under revaluation, rich people in big houses pay lots more; there are all sorts of perverse, unexpected and undesirable outcomes. That is another reason why the revaluation is likely to be fraught with problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para17">As my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) has pointed out, the New Policy Institute says that under national uprating the council tax on a typical band C property in London would rise by 15 per cent. Why should one category be singled out for double-digit increases? The implications are perverse.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para18">I said at the start that I intended to reflect on the issue of band A properties. If there are to be gains from the change, one would want them to be for people who live in small houses on relatively modest incomes. However, there is a danger that that will not happen. If the Government simply uprate all thresholds in line with the average increase in house prices, the average band D rate, broadly speaking, will not need to change. However, if the band D rate does not change, people at the bottom of the pile in band A will not benefit. Even if the value of their houses has risen much more slowly than anybody else&#039;s and they have fallen further behind other people, the tax that is supposedly to do with house 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 359WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
values will not benefit them. They will benefit only if the bottom band is indexed by less than the increase in house prices. That is what has happened in Wales, and it would be a desirable change. Many of the properties in band A will be quite modest, so one would think that this group had quite a strong case for gaining.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para19">The New Policy Institute also observes that the revaluation, which includes reconsidering bands, relativities and thresholds, provides an opportunity for radical council tax reform. Without it, any prospect of the so-called new localism or of local authorities seriously being able to raise more of their own money is simply unlikely, because the council tax would be such an unfair tax that the additional burden would not be acceptable to local people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para20">I have talked generally about the impact of the changes on England as a whole, but there will also be big differences between regions, as I mentioned. The New Policy Institute points out that the south-west is already particularly hard hit by the council tax. On page 11 of its document, it says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;At present, the ratio of council tax to income in the South West is about 10 per cent. higher than the national average across almost all bands.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para21">The south-west is therefore suffering from high house prices relative to a fairly low-wage economy, so there is a disproportionate ratio between the two. It is already being hard hit by the council tax, and revaluation would hit it still further, because outside Greater London it has seen the fastest rise in house prices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para22">Something that struck me while I was doing research for this debate is that generalities are quite difficult to make, because the impact of the revaluation will be very localised. I shall give a couple of examples. The west of England&#151;Avon no longer exists as a unitary authority, but we still need a name for the group of four local authorities&#151;has produced a document on its housing situation, the &quot;West of England Sub-regional Housing Study&quot;, which says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The most evident feature of the housing market in the West of England has been the phenomenal rise in house prices over the last 8 years&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para23">Again, the people whom I represent could suffer particularly badly because of that rapid rise in house prices. Focusing even more narrowly on my local authority, South Gloucestershire council&#039;s own strategy document says that the market really took off between 1999 and 2003, with prices rising 87 per cent. in only four years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para24">Certain parts of the country, particularly sub-regions and local authority areas, have real housing hotspots that could lose out very badly from this revaluation if it is not done properly. There is no silver bullet or complete fix for these problems; they are inherent in the unfair tax.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para25">I fear that the impact will be even more localised than I have already described. It is very hard to work out from land registry data and websites for house prices what has been happening to house prices in a very localised postcode sector, because only a handful of properties of a particular type might be bought or sold there, and it is very hard to get reliable estimates. I rang my local estate agent and asked him what had happened 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 360WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to particular properties in Thornbury, a market town in my constituency. He considered what had happened to the price of three sorts of properties&#151;former council properties, three-bedroom semi-detached properties, and larger four-bedroom properties&#151;which has been the relevant consideration for council tax purposes in the past decade. His business did not exist in 1991, but he considered prices from 1993.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para26">The estate agent found a huge variation. The price of ex-council properties had risen by 221 per cent., the price of three-bedroom semi-detached properties had risen by 186 per cent., and the price of four-bedroom properties had risen by 155 per cent. Even in sub-regional bands, the impact of the revaluation on different houses in the same street will be very different. Indeed, it will be arbitrary and capricious.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para27">The estate agent pointed out an even more peculiar feature. Four-bedroom properties are now priced at about &#163;250,000. Members will know that &#163;250,000 marks one of those ludicrous stamp duty jumps. No one buys a house for &#163;251,000, &#163;252,000 or &#163;253,000, because the stamp duty is suddenly hiked up, but the council tax revaluation for that property will be less severe because of the arbitrary impact of another dodgy, structured Government tax, which means that the impact of council tax reform on the owner of that property is different from the impact on the owner of another property. Once again, we have an extraordinary situation in which different people, who might be next-door neighbours living in different sorts of houses but who use the same local services and have the same ability to pay, will face substantially different increases in council tax.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para28">The Government might say that they will ease the pain by putting in place transitional arrangements, to which the hon. Member for Bristol, West, who is no longer in her seat, referred. However, any further transitional arrangements, such as damping, will make what is already a complicated system even more complex.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para29">What about council tax benefit? For those entitled to it, it could dampen down the impact of any increase in council tax, but a great deal would depend on take-up, and we know that barely 50 per cent. of owner-occupiers take up their council tax benefit entitlement. The Government have floated stories in the press about making council tax benefit entitlement automatic. Well, whoopee! If that were possible, wonderful, but why has it not been automatic for the past seven years or, indeed, for the past 15 years since it was introduced with council tax? We would all welcome greater take-up of the benefit, but we have yet to see any concrete proposals for how it might be done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para30">One way for it to be done is to say that the amount of council tax benefit to which someone is entitled is broadly independent of where they live and their council tax. Council tax benefit is the difference between someone&#039;s income and their needs as assessed by family composition. Council tax does not enter the calculation. Somebody on a particular income with a particular household composition might be required to pay only &#163;5 towards their council tax, whether it is &#163;10 or &#163;20. There is the potential for a national assessment of council tax benefit entitlement&#151;if we are to continue with the system&#151;which would not need to be local authority or property specific, but would work out how much people 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 361WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
were expected to pay towards their council tax. That would not solve the take-up problem, but it might enable the benefit to be dealt with more effectively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para31">The New Policy Institute suggests relaxing the capital limits. That would not deal with the take-up problem, but it would mean that more people with modest savings could be cushioned from the impact. That would be a relatively cheap way of trying to deal with the problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para32">In 1991 we had what was euphemistically known as second-gear valuation, in which the valuers never got out of their cars, but just drove down a road slowly and decided the valuations. This time, however, details of people&#039;s home extensions will be used&#151; for example whether they have added an extra bedroom. Therefore, the revaluation will be a home improvement tax. <i>[Interruption.] </i>The Minister says, if I can lip-read correctly, that that is absolute rubbish. If he wants to intervene and correct what I have said, I am happy to give way. If people have extended their home and thereby increased its value, they will potentially be pushed up into a new council tax band. We want people to make better use of the land that they have&#151;as long as it is acceptable to the local planning authority&#151;rather than use up more land in greenfield sites, so taxing people for improving their homes seems odd. I have given the Minister the opportunity to correct that if it is factually wrong, but he has declined to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para33">We have a fundamentally flawed system, the failures, inequities and arbitrary nature of which will be highlighted over the next few years by the revaluation process. There will be gainers and losers. Some of them will be unexpected people in unexpected places&#151;it will not be correlated with ability to pay. Some people in small houses will not benefit at all, whereas some people in large houses will do well out of the change, provided that they stay within the same band. There will be all sorts of odd effects. Until we have a local tax system that reflects people&#039;s ability to pay, any revaluation will be unfair, arbitrary and capricious. This revaluation will cost &#163;200 million to be arbitrary, unfair and capricious. I can think of better ways of spending that money.

<p><a name="41026h01_spnew17"><b> Jane Griffiths  (Reading, East)</b>  (Lab): I am pleased to have a chance to take part in this important debate, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) on securing it. In 2007, there will be a revaluation for council tax purposes based on the values of properties in 2005. Having spoken to the local valuation office in my constituency, I know that it is already preparing for that. However, I shall not speak about whether there should be more bands for council tax, or about how bands should be changed to reflect the change in property prices. I want to mention experiences from my constituency of the last valuation, and the problems that I hope can be prevented in the up-coming revaluation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para34">The poll tax was one of the most important pieces of legislation of the last 20 years in terms of its impact on the political scene. It arguably brought about the demise of the then Prime Minister and even led to rioting in Maidenhead. It still haunts us in the form of its hastily introduced successor&#151;the council tax. I was a councillor when council tax was introduced and I remember the stories of estate agents sitting in their cars 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 362WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
dictating the value of houses from the outside. Those stories became the stuff of legend, although naturally my local valuation office says that valuations were not done in that way. A number of my council colleagues at the time ran campaigns to inform people that they had an opportunity to appeal against the valuations of their houses. As a result, many successful appeals took place and people had the valuation of their homes reduced. That pleased them, as their bills were also reduced. The council did not lose out, because the council tax base was reduced, which meant that the council received a higher revenue support grant. Once the valuation of a large majority of houses in an area with similar properties had been reduced, the same councillors campaigned to have the whole area revalued, pleasing even more people. They were happy constituents&#151;something that we politicians like.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para35">It can be difficult to identify what value a property should have, especially when there are a number of similar properties in an area and they are close to the boundary between tax valuation bands. That is what allowed my former colleagues to have such success in their campaigns for rebanding. The problem is still with us. The valuation office tells me that there is an area in my constituency where the houses are on the border between bands C and D. They are on an estate built in the 1960s and 1970s from only eight designs. When those homes were valued, most were put in band D, but over time people have appealed and have mainly been successful. Of course, there are rumours around the estate about who has had a revaluation. There are also tales of people who have contacted the council but have not got anywhere. One story was of someone who lived in a house in band D and found out that their sister-in-law, who lived in a house of the same design elsewhere on the estate, was in band C.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para36">After his election in June, Councillor Mark Ralph, who lived locally and had heard about this matter, started asking questions. As a result, the valuation office has started looking again at the valuations across the estate. It is estimated that between 300 and 450 houses on the estate will be reviewed and are likely to be revalued from band D to band C. For the householders, that is a good outcome: they will each receive approximately &#163;1,100. There will be more happy constituents, but the situation is not so good for the council, as it will receive a bill for between &#163;330,000 and &#163;495,000&#151;a bill that it had not expected or budgeted for. If the council has to pay the bill out of council tax, it will cost each band D council tax payer between &#163;6 and &#163;9. At the same time, the council tax base is not as high as had been thought, and the council has not been receiving the revenue support grant that it should have had. That is a double whammy for Reading borough council: it has to make a payment that it has not budgeted for, and it has not received the support that it should have done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para37">I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to look into the matter and see whether there is some way in which Reading borough council can be reimbursed, just as the householders have been and are being. Despite having received up to &#163;1,100, however, the householders have not had the use of that money for up to 11 years, and they have asked for interest. With non-domestic rates, interest is payable either way. If people withhold payment, they have to pay interest. If the council has 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 363WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
money that it should not have&#151;if, for example, someone has paid more than they should&#151;the council has to pay the person interest. However, the situation is not the same for council tax; the council has no duty to pay interest. The householders applied to the council for interest payments, but it did not pay them, as it had no duty to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para38">The valuation office has now agreed that as it made the mistake, it will pay interest, but it will do so only on application. When the office makes a revaluation, it automatically informs the council and people automatically receive a rebate, but there is no system the other way. When the council has made a payment to someone, it should inform the householder that they have the right to request the payment of interest from the valuation office, or the council could inform the valuation office that it has made a payment, so that the valuation office can pay the interest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para39">In concluding, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister for three things. First, in the information given to valuation offices, can more thought be given to properties on the boundaries of valuation bands, to try to prevent the situation that I have described from happening again. Secondly, will he look favourably on Reading borough council when determining its grant levels in the coming months, so that the people of Reading, East do not have to pay for the mistakes of the valuation office? Will there be some recognition in allowances of the large numbers of payments that the council has had to make for the changes in valuations, and will there be recognition of the revenue support grant forgone in past years? Thirdly, will my hon. Friend consider requesting that councils and valuation offices set up some form of system automatically to pay interest outstanding, so that people do not miss out on it?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para40">I am pleased to take part in this fascinating debate and to raise the experience of the previous revaluation. I hope that we are able to learn from it, and that no other councils experience what Reading experienced last time.

<a name="41026h01_para42">I am concerned about the council tax band valuation on park homes. People who live in park homes tend to be on low and fixed incomes, and any increases in their costs, whether they are in energy bills or council tax payments, are hard on them. The Caerwnon park residents association, which I met over the weekend, told me that a survey of its residents showed that 90 per cent. of them were either old-age pensioners or disabled people living on fixed and often low incomes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para43">The association, due to good leadership, has been successful in appealing against the valuations under the old system, and it has been able to push all the properties into band A. That was done using the valuation of both the pitch and the park home. Since then, the association has noticed a written answer to a question from the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), which asked
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the Deputy Prime Minister if he will review the way in which the Valuation Office Agency assesses mobile homes for council tax purposes.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para44">The answer from the Minister for Local and Regional Government was:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Mobile homes are not in themselves subject to council tax, but liability may arise in respect of the land on which the mobile home stands. Most mobile homes pitches which are subject to council tax are rated at band A.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 20 May 2004; Vol. 421, c. 114W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para45">I am not sure whether that is fully understood in England, but it is certainly not in Wales. I am still in the process of finding out whether, when the relevant powers were transferred to Wales, the Assembly took the opportunity of changing the regulations. If it did, it did no favours for people living in park home estates, who as I have said are often on limited incomes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para46">I am in the process of establishing whether the regulations in Wales are the same as those in England. Although I am a passionate believer in devolution, I do not believe that having different regulations for such a situation is of any benefit. It is essential that, in the English revaluations, the valuation officers have some clarity of purpose. In Wales, for instance, a number of the park homes have moved up from band A to band C, and I doubt whether that is on the basis of an increase in the valuation of the pitch. It is important that, when the English revaluation takes place, there is clarity and the valuation officers use the valuation of just the pitch rather than both the pitch and park home that sits on it. Apparently, the same regulation applies to boats and moorings. Clarity about the matter would go a long way towards helping the process in England, and I would like to hear the Minister&#039;s response.

If it has been well thought through, the Government have not shared their ideas with the House. My hon.

plenty of time to answer, because the big problem is that so far the Government have not come clean on anything to do with the issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para47">Ministers will say that they set up the balance of funding review. They did indeed. It sat for nearly 18 months and was published last summer. The Government&#039;s decision was to put it at arm&#039;s length, and to say that it was an interesting review and they were going to ask someone to review the review and report in December 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para48">It is interesting to read the chapter on council tax reform in the balance of funding review. It is a detailed chapter, drawing on some interesting research, which I will refer to later. The last section of the chapter says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In short, much further detailed work is required on how council tax might be reformed, based on a clear vision of the direction of travel. It must now be for the Government to decide that direction of travel.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para49">We have been waiting for that direction of travel, and have received no indications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para50">It is clear what the options are if the Government are going to be unwise enough to stick with council tax. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon said, they could add one or more extra bands at the bottom and top&#151;or more than one band at the top, as some have speculated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para51">They could change the banding system to some regional approach, to try to deal with the different rises in property prices in different parts of the country, although that could be potentially arbitrary and capricious as it would involve picking one particular date, and we all know that house prices and differentials are changing all the time. The Government could go down that road, but they know the disadvantages.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para52">They could deal with the different multipliers and the ratios between the different bands, setting the band limits in different ways. At the moment, council tax bands have a one to three relationship, while an estimate of the difference between property prices across the country gives a one to 20 relationship, on average. That shows that the bands and the multipliers that relate them to each other are a potential source for change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para53">There are three areas of change within the council tax system, and the Government have not told us which they favour. They have not told us which they are working on, although it is an open secret in Whitehall that the Treasury and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have been doing huge amounts of work on the matter. However, we have received no answer and no definitive statement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para54">My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon said that we could consider what was happening in Wales, and he was right to do so. He showed how more than a third of households in Wales would be going up one or more bands, with 5 per cent. of households going up two or more bands, which could be problematic for a number of people. Unfortunately, the Government say that we cannot look at Wales. The Minister for Local and Regional Government told us:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;What happened in Wales is not a precedent or an indication of what will happen in England&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para55">There we have it: we cannot consider Wales, as it is completely different. How it is different, he did not say. Neither did he say what the Government were going to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 366WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
do differently. No comment on what the Welsh have done and how badly they have handled it has been forthcoming from the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para56">Once again, we do not know the direction in which the Government will take us. That shows dishonesty on the part of the Govt. We almost certainly face a general election in the next six or seven months, and the Government still have not told us what they are going to do, despite having done all this research, had a review for 18 months, seen what is happening in Wales, had the ODPM and the Treasury considering the matter in great detail and being faced with only three basic options. What are voters expected to make of that indecision and dissembling?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para57">The Government are behaving outrageously. They cannot simply say, &quot;Well, the Tories haven&#039;t told us their proposals.&quot; We know that the Tories are pretty bad&#151;they messed up the system twice in one political generation, which takes some doing for any political party&#151;but the Government cannot get away with blaming them. The Government are in power, and they should give some indication of their plans. At the moment, we have the bizarre spectacle of their preparing for the general election with no policy proposals, and saying to the electorate, &quot;Well, we don&#039;t know. It&#039;s going to change, because we&#039;ve legislated for it to change. Under the Local Government Act 2003, it must change on 1 April 2007, but we don&#039;t know how. We can&#039;t give you any indication.&quot; So, we have two &quot;don&#039;t know&quot; parties; two dithering parties that will not come clean with the electorate. That is outrageous, particularly when, if the Welsh experience is anything to go by, a third of taxpayers will lose out. That is one of the approaches that undermine people&#039;s faith in politics. It is very serious.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para58">What evidence or studies have been forthcoming to show the potential effects? My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon talked about the work of the New Policy Institute, which is on the ODPM website. It is interesting that some of the comments put forward by the institute show that it was not sure what the Government were on about either. The second paper that the NPI put forward to the balance of funding review starts off by saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In formulating our response, we have become aware that we are not clear how far the BoF&quot;&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para60">I do not think that the Government know either; we are none the wiser.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para61">The institute made a fair attempt at analysing the different options. It considered reforms such as adding bands at the bottom and top, changing the multipliers, and regionalisation. What is particularly interesting to me, as the Member of Parliament for a London constituency, is the likely impact of some of those potential changes&#151;not changes that have been made but those identified in the scenarios in the appendix of the NPI study, which was commissioned by the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para62">In scenario 1A&#151;the basic revaluation, from which my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon quoted&#151;the average bill for those in inner London now on band C would go up by 15 per cent. In scenario 1B&#151;the basic revaluation with lower band limits&#151;the average bill for 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 367WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
those in inner London on band C would go up by 19 per cent., whereas for those in band H it would go down by 4 per cent. There is a progressive change, with low and middle-income Londoners bearing the brunt.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para63">In scenario 2A, in which there are 10-plus bands and different income proportional multipliers, lower and middle-income Londoners face a big rise, as do people in band H, but one wonders whether the Prime Minister would veto that, as he has just bought a property for &#163;3.5 million, which is in band H. He would have to pay a massive &#163;1,210, but he may not like to see his tax bill go up. He does not seem to be into progressivity when it comes to local government taxation. However, that is a slight diversion. My point is that in scenario 2A, low and middle-income Londoners face a massive tax rise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para64">In scenario 2B, there are 10-plus bands, but the multiplier is based on property prices. That scenario is still bad news for Londoners in band C, as their tax bills would go up by 18 per cent. Once again, low and middle-income Londoners would face a huge tax rise. So in all scenarios other than that with regional banding, which would be the most radical reform, low and middle-income Londoners experience double-digit rises. Even with regional banding there will be an increase. That is the evidence before us. No other studies have been done to my knowledge. Perhaps the Minister will be able to quote some, but I somehow doubt it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para65">Given that, what does the Minister expect us to say to people in the general election? We know the figures and he will probably say, &quot;Well, the Liberal Democrats are scaremongering,&quot; but let us not scaremonger&#151;let us have the facts. The Government must tell us what their policy is. They should say what they are going to do and give some figures and examples of what the changes will be. If they do not, it will not be surprising if people get scared, particularly in constituencies such as mine and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para66">The issue is serious. The Minister will no doubt want to use this debate to attack the Liberal Democrats. I am sure that he will stand up, not answer any of the questions that we have put, and instead have a go at local income tax. Of course he is entitled to do that, although when he does, I hope that he will point out that the same local government tax system is used in America, Japan, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and many other countries. I am sure that he will give the idea a fair hearing. I hope that he will admit that the system is related to ability to pay and that it is predictable and clear.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para67">I hope, too, that the Minister will admit that we have been honest in recognising that there will be losers as well as gainers, and clear about how the system would work, rather than hiding; that we have put forward our proposals for democratic debate, and that we are prepared to defend them on the doorstep. That is the difference in this debate. We have been honest in putting forward our proposals, but the Minister is hiding; and if he is hiding, we suspect that he has something to hide.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
to focus on revaluation. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) said, the Government&#039;s response to the balance of funding review was to set up yet another review, which will not report until after the next general election, so the only certainty on council tax is that there will be a revaluation in 2005, which will kick in by 2007. Whatever else comes out of the balance of funding review, that is a fixed certainty with which we will have to deal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para68">I, too, am disappointed by the Government&#039;s response to the balance of funding review. One tries not to become too cynical in this place, but it seems extraordinarily convenient that such a difficult issue should need a further review that will just happen to take us to the other side of the general election. That will mean that the council tax, which, polling tells us, has the greatest salience of any tax with electors, will not be substantively addressed in what the Labour party presents to the electorate in its manifesto for the next general election.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para69">We should identify the problems that will arise from the revaluation. I hope that we are doing that this morning. The hon. Member for Northavon clearly set out some of those problems and I am sure that we all accept that. Indeed, even the Government have to accept that the revaluation, in its crudest presentation, would give rise to those problems. However, I do not believe that the solution is the wholesale scrapping of council tax, which is the only property-based tax in the country, and its replacement by a local income tax.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Edward Davey </b> : What about stamp duty?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew24"><b> Mr. Hammond </b> : Well, stamp duty is a property transaction tax, whereas council tax is the only property value tax. The hon. Gentleman and his party are keen on looking at what happens in Europe and elsewhere, so they will know that almost all advanced countries have a property-based element in their overall mix of taxation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para70">The problem with council tax is that it is being used for a purpose for which it was not designed. It is meant to contribute to the cost of local services, but since 1997, the average band D council tax has increased by 70 per cent. and now stands at more than &#163;1,100. Council tax has become part of Labour&#039;s overall stealth tax initiative, with part of the burden of taxation being transferred from identifiable, nationally collected taxes to local taxes, behind which the Chancellor of the Exchequer can shelter, at one remove from accountability. That, and the stealth redistribution of the burden of taxation, is what causes the public anxiety about the council tax. Changes to the local government grant formula have redistributed grant generally from the south to the north&#151;it is not a clear and simple pattern&#151;with a corresponding increase in the amount of council tax that people pay from the north to the south.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para71">The Government were explicit when they introduced the change to the formula; the Minister of State said clearly that he wanted council tax payers to contribute a greater share of the burden of funding local services in areas where, in his definition, they could afford to do so. In other words, he was explicit that he wanted to shift the burden of taxation towards local taxpayers in certain areas.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 369WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para72">So changes to the grant distribution system have shifted the burden geographically, creating winners and losers, as the hon. Member for Northavon said. The revaluation will further reinforce that if the problem is not tackled with an additional mechanism because of the way in which the resources equalisation mechanism works. As an area acquires a higher tax base through shifting properties into higher bands, so the amount of grant that it receives from central Government will reduce and the council tax payable by local people will correspondingly increase.
</p>

<a name="41026h01_para73">That will lead to the unacceptable spectre of relatively less well-off people in areas where property values are high&#151;people whose only crime is to have lived for a long time, perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years, in a house that they could not even dream of buying today&#151;cross-subsidising people who are much better off in areas that happen to have experienced much lower house price inflation, or suffered or benefited from it, depending on one&#039;s point of view.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para74">We agree with the Government that a reformed council tax is likely to be the best way forward, but the emphasis is on the word &quot;reformed&quot;. The Liberal Democrats have latched on to what I have conceded elsewhere is a very good slogan&#151;&quot;Axe the tax&quot;&#151;but that is far as their policy goes. A party that wants to campaign under such a slogan is effectively excluded from the grown-up debate on reforming the tax. However, for all the advantages of a property-based tax, the drawback is that property value may be poorly correlated with income and therefore with ability to pay. That is the issue that faces us at the margin and the challenge is to devise a reformed council tax system that recognises the worst problems that it throws up, while retaining its benefits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para75">When the hon. Member for Northavon was talking about the lack of correlation between the value of property occupied and income in some cases, it struck me that we have lots of taxes that are not well correlated with the ability to pay. For example, the Liberal Democrats are not proposing that duties on cigarettes should be varied according to people&#039;s ability to pay. We have a range of taxes, some of which relate to income, and some of which do not. Most advanced countries have a mixed taxation system, and the issue is about striking the right balance. I recognise that if council tax, which takes up a large proportion of the disposable incomes of people on very low and fixed incomes, is to be acceptable, we must address how we deal with that issue in reforming the council tax.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : The hon. Gentleman wants a mature debate on local government tax reform. Can he now tell us, in one sentence, what are the Conservative party&#039;s proposals for council tax reform?

<p><a name="41026h01_spnew26"><b> Mr. Hammond </b> : In one sentence, no I cannot. However, if the hon. Gentleman bears with me for a moment, he will hear what I have to say about how our evolving policy will address a couple of specific areas that are directly related to the question of revaluation. I can assure him that when he goes into the next general election, he will not have to debate with Conservative candidates who do not have a policy on reform of the council tax. We will announce our policies on reform of

<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 370WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the council tax, unlike the Labour party, which has made it clear that it will go into the next general election without a fully fledged policy for such reform.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para76">If the present system, which is based on 1991 values, produces poor income to value correlations, it is obvious that the 2005 revaluations, after a decade of radically differentiated house price rises, will create a more difficult situation. Even average house price to income ratios differ widely. The hon. Member for Northavon spoke about the situation in the south-west&#151;the well-known phenomenon by which high demand for houses caused by incoming residents, most of whom are retired, distorts the ratio between house price values and incomes in a fairly low income economy. Throughout the country, discrepancies can be even wider on an individual taxpayer basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para77">It is clear that reform is needed ahead of the 2007 start date for the use of the revaluation values that will be gathered in 2005. I hope that even the Government will recognise that imposing revaluation on a single, nationwide basis without any other adjustments would cause such a dramatic shift in the tax base between areas that it would lead to an unacceptable outcome. In fairness, I think that the Government have recognised that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para78">There are two obvious things that the Government&#151;any Government&#151;could do to moderate the unfairness of revaluation, and two things that would make it worse. A fair system of local or sub-regional banding, which has as its objective equitable distribution of the burden of council tax within a billing authority, while leaving undisturbed the distribution between billing authorities, would draw much of the sting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para79">The hon. Member for Northavon speaks as a Liberal Democrat, and referred to regional banding. We know that the Liberal Democrats have a pathological attachment to regionalisation, but I am not sure that the Government will have the same attachment to it after next Thursday&#151;we will have to see. However, there would be problems even with regional banding, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, if he considers his own region, will recognise that the differentials within regions are, in many cases, greater than the differentials between them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para80">We therefore need to consider a banding level that is lower than the region. That would still create winners and losers, but not whole towns and cities that were winners and losers. It would also ensure that whole communities were not penalised en masse because they happened to live in areas of high property value growth. Equally, it would ensure that windfall gains did not go to people who used the same levels of services, and who had the same or higher level of income growth, but who lived in an area that happened to have slower property value growth. The council tax is not intended to be a wealth tax by stealth; it is intended to fund local authority services that are used by all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para81">Such a system of local banding would be sensible, but a fudged local banding system, paying lip service to addressing the problem, using subjective criteria and shifting the burden of the tax in an opaque fashion between districts, would be a disaster for the credibility of a reformed council tax. I ask the Minister to take that point on board.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 371WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para82">The other thing that a Government can do is to re-establish fairness and transparency in the discredited grant distribution system, using clear criteria that recognise both local needs and local cost factors. That could be achieved by changes to the resource equalisation arrangements, which would deliver many of the same benefits as local or sub-regional banding, by ensuring that the penal effect of the redistribution of grant through resource equalisation did not occur in an area that suffered an upward shift of bands across the board.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para83">A Conservative Government will commit to introducing a fair and transparent system. In relation to the revaluation, that would require a combination of fair and objective grant distribution mechanisms and/or an objective local banding system, so that when the 2007 revaluation system is introduced, the changes in banding would be used to redistribute the burden of taxation within a billing district. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) suggested, it would ensure that people living in the lowest value properties were recognised as such and that the distribution of tax within a community was fair. We start to run into problems when the revaluation and shifting of bands through the resource equalisation mechanism is also used as a covert mechanism to shift the burden between billing authorities as well as between citizens within billing authorities.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew27"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : Is the hon. Gentleman therefore confirming that the Conservatives are in favour of a revaluation exercise of some sort?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew28"><b> Mr. Hammond </b> : We accept that the revaluation will go ahead in 2005. Frankly, with or without a revaluation in 2007, we need a fairer and more transparent mechanism for distributing grant. If the revaluation goes ahead, there is a need to examine the distribution mechanism alongside the banding mechanism, because the two are flip sides of the same coin.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para84">My concern is that a third-term Labour Government would fudge the local or regional banding question, allowing it to become a smokescreen for a redistribution of tax burden to those whose houses had risen in value even though their incomes might not have risen any faster than people in areas with a less dynamic property market. Worse still, a third-term Labour Government would add bands to the top of the current eight-band system and would probably fiddle with the ratios between bands, making the council tax more explicitly a wealth tax by stealth. Extra bands would further redistribute the burden to areas that have enjoyed&#151;or suffered, depending on how one looks at it&#151;exceptional house price rises, while in some areas, very few houses would fall into the new top bands.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para85">There is a case for relief for those who live in the lowest-value properties and may be on low incomes. However, that should not be at the expense of people living in higher-value properties who may not be high-income earners. We do not have to speculate about what a Labour Government would do in office; we can look at Wales, as the hon. Member for Northavon has done,

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para86">The Government are being deliberately opaque by kicking the balance of funding review report to the Lyons review and leaving it until after the general election to tell the public what they intend to do. The Minister will no doubt accuse me and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton of scaremongering and setting hares running, so let us give him the opportunity to set the record straight.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para87">Will the Minister commit the Government to introducing a transparent and independently verified system of grant distribution alongside the 2007 revaluation? Will he commit to an objectively fair local or sub-regional banding system, to be brought in at the same time as the revaluation? Will he pledge that the Government will not introduce new bands at the top of the system or alter the ratio of the top rate to band D?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para88">The Government have accused us of scaremongering; there is a chance here for the Minister to put to bed the fears that council tax bills could double or triple for people who happened to occupy property in the highest new band in a 10-band system. I hope that he will take the opportunity of doing so. The public are looking to him to rule out the use of additional top bands or changed ratios to increase massively the burden of council tax on those who live in higher value properties in areas where property values have increased. If he will not give those assurances, and if he continues to hide behind the Lyons report, the electorate will have to draw their own conclusions.

<p><a name="41026h01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) on securing this morning&#039;s debate. It is always good to debate local government finance, as we have done on many occasions both here and in the main Chamber.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para89">I have listened with great interest to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s views and those of other hon. Members. The debate is on the impact of council tax revaluation, but although we have covered council tax revaluation briefly, we have also covered council tax itself, local income tax, the grant distribution system, the system in Wales, the balance of funding review and the Lyons review. We have travelled far and wide this morning, and in the brief time available to me I will endeavour to address most if not all the issues that hon. Members have raised. I will disappoint the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) by saying that I shall not pre-empt the outcome of the Lyons review; otherwise, there would be no point in having it in the first place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para90">It is a pity that hon. Members have thrown around words such as &quot;perverse&quot;, &quot;undesirable&quot;, &quot;capricious&quot; and &quot;arbitrary&quot;&#151;mainly the hon. Members for

<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 373WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Northavon and for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), I suspect because they want to deflect attention from what is a wholly indefensible system of replacing council tax with local income tax. If I have time, I may come back to that point, but I should try to address the subject of the debate, which is the council tax revaluation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para91">Let me put on record some important points about revaluation to clear up some misunderstandings. In our 2001 local government White Paper, we recognised the importance of keeping property values up to date, and that it was no longer reasonable or fair that council tax was based on 1991 property values. The legislation for the revaluation is now in place, and both the ODPM and the Valuation Office Agency are working towards delivering that revaluation for 2007.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para92">For the record, I am pleased that the decision to revalue was supported by both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats during the passage of the Local Government Bill. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We recognise the need periodically to revalue properties for the purpose of council tax.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7 January 2003; Vol. 397, c. 64.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para93">There is no need to be coy about the Conservatives&#039; supporting revaluation: they supported it wholeheartedly in Committee. The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) supported a Conservative amendment that called for more frequent revaluation, so I assume that the Liberals also support the revaluation process. Despite all the accusations that the hon. Member for Northavon made about whether it is right or wrong and how it is going to work, the fact is that it is right to have a council tax revaluation, as voted for by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in the Bill&#039;s passage through Parliament.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para94">So how do we go about the revaluation? In September this year, the Valuation Office Agency announced its intention to use an automated valuation model to assist it in the revaluation. It is currently testing the AVM using a system that has been supplied by a company called Cole Layer Trumble, a company with more than 60 years&#039; experience in mass appraisal valuation. When I visited the VOA&#039;s Wimbledon office in September to see a demonstration of the system, I was impressed by not only the technical capability of the AVM system but the commitment, focus and enthusiasm of the VOA staff in making the revaluation happen. Current testing of the model is exceeding expectations, and it is clear that it will be a valuable tool. When the groundwork for the VOA&#039;s valuation work is completed, it will be ready to start the detailed work and place properties into bands.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para95">Let me turn to a common misunderstanding about revaluation, which has also affected this morning&#039;s debate. Revaluation is not about raising more money overall. Indeed, in our 2001 White Paper we made a commitment not to change the overall council tax yield as a result of revaluation. I hope that that puts to bed the scaremongering that we have heard before and that we heard again during the debate today about revaluation being some form of stealth tax. There is no intention to raise the council tax yield as a result of revaluation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew32"><b> Phil Hope </b> : I will just say a few more words about what we intend, because I want to clarify how it will come about.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para96">For the vast majority of people, whose properties will increase in value broadly in line with the average, there is unlikely to be any change in banding. Only where the change in a property&#039;s value is significantly above or below the average is the property likely to change bands. So, as we have made clear, revaluation is not about raising more money overall, and anyone whose home has risen in value in line with averages is unlikely to pay more tax. Revaluation is simply about updating the system, which is based on 1991 values&#151;hon. Members should remember that we are now in 2004&#151;and is increasingly out of date. Members of all parties voted for the system, and I hope that they will see that it is now out of date and can no longer be fair or rational. That is why we are undertaking the revaluation.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew33"><b> Mr. Hammond </b> : What the Minister says is obviously right, and the rebanding exercise will deal only with anomalies within individual billing authorities&#151;properties that have risen or fallen out of line with the average. Does he accept, however, that the resource equalisation regime raises the important issue of the distribution between billing authorities, which is somewhat opaque, but which will none the less be the most important consequence of the revaluation?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew34"><b> Phil Hope </b> : There is an issue about resource equalisation, the balance of funding between central and local government and the extent to which localisation and equalisation can go together. Indeed, that occupied much of the debate during the balance of funding review, on which leading Conservative and Liberal Democrat local government representatives served. The review reached several important conclusions&#151;they were not recommendations, and the review was not designed to make any. One conclusion, about which I shall say a bit more in a moment, was that we should retain and reform the council tax. So, the review looked into issues of resource equalisation and localisation.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew35"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : The Minister explained the process of revaluation. Will he now clarify his response to my comments about home improvements? Is it not the case that if I improve my home and add to its value by building, say, an extension, I may push myself into a higher council tax band on revaluation and face a higher council tax?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew36"><b> Phil Hope </b> : There have been press articles saying that we will tax home improvements, and the hon. Gentleman has repeated the point this morning. However, such remarks are wholly misleading. They refer to the consultation that we recently launched on a proposal to include information about additional property attributes in revised council tax lists. The additional information that we might publish could include the number of rooms, including bathrooms, and the age of the property. Making such information public for the first time would make it easier for all council tax payers to understand the basis on which their valuation was made. So, the consultation is not about the basis of revaluation but about improving clarity by making more information available.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 375WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew37"><b> Mr. Hammond </b> : Let us just be clear on that point. Although the consultation is not about the basis of the revaluation, the Minister is confirming the hon. Gentleman&#039;s fear that the basis of the revaluation is the value of the property as improved.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew38"><b> Phil Hope </b> : I cannot repeat the point without being repetitive. The questionnaire is about publishing better information. Instead of simply saying, &quot;Here is the number and address of the house,&quot; we can publish its attributes so that people can see whether the valuation of their property is right. The council tax payer will have greater clarity and information about the basis on which their property and their neighbours&#039; properties have been valued. That will reduce inaccuracies and, I hope, appeals.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew39"><b> Mr. Edward Davey </b> : I am tempted to ask whether we shall count the number of windows and return to the old window tax, which did not work, but I want to ask the Minister about an important point that he made. He correctly said that council tax revaluation would not necessarily increase the yield from council tax. There is no dispute about that. Our proposal for a local income tax would not increase the overall tax burden. However, will he accept that council tax revaluation will cause some people to lose?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h01_spnew40"><b> Phil Hope </b> : The purpose of the revaluation is to provide updated property values, because currently the council tax is based on 1991 property values. The revaluation will provide an updated and therefore fairer and clearer basis on which to levy council tax. That seems an entirely sensible idea. The hon. Gentleman supported it in Committee when the Bill was going through Parliament; indeed, the Conservatives supported that position. Whether there are winners or losers will depend on the outcome of the revaluation and the council tax banding. That is the subject of the Lyons review, which I shall come to in a moment. To say that there will be winners and losers is to say that the sun may or may not rise in the morning. Of course there will be changes, but we do not know what they will be until the revaluation takes place, the council tax banding decisions are taken, and we put the two together. Unfortunately, the scaremongering by the hon. Members for Northavon and for Kingston and Surbiton and, to an extent, by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge&#151;although his comments were rather more judicious than those of the Liberal Democrat Members&#151;is unhelpful, because it raises fears that are wholly unnecessary and unjustified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para97">I shall now deal with some of the other questions that hon. Members have raised. I want to explain the revaluation in Wales, because that was the subject of the remarks of the hon. Members for Northavon and for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams). The revaluation in Wales will take effect from 1 April 2005, based on values as at 1 April 2003. I emphasise that council tax bands in Wales are the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government. Revaluation in Wales should not be seen as a precedent for revaluation in England.

<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 376WH</b>

<p>
<a name="41026h01_para98">I thought that Liberal Democrat Members supported devolution. Indeed, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said that he did&#151;except on this occasion. He cannot have it both ways. This is an opportunity for the Welsh Assembly Government to make their choices, but I emphasise that their choices are not a precedent for revaluation here. The Welsh Assembly Government have decided to add a new band at the top but not at the bottom. That is purely a decision for the devolved Administration in Wales. We might learn from the Welsh experience, but it is not a precedent or an indication of what is likely to take place in England. No decisions have been taken on how council tax might be reformed in England. I shall say more about the independent inquiry by Sir Michael Lyons in that regard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para99">The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire made a point about park homes. The reply that he received from my right hon.

I cannot say anything more about what the Welsh Assembly Government have decided to do in Wales&#151;this is a devolved matter&#151;but I have noted the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns and will take them into account. Indeed, this entire debate will feed into the Lyons review process when we consider the issues relating to park homes and other properties of that type.

<p>
<a name="41026h01_para100">My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) gave the example of difficulties in Reading. She was right to focus on issues relating to properties on the boundaries; that is where all the arguments take place. They are taking place now and they will take place in the future, once the revaluation takes place and the new banding system, whatever it turns out to be, is proposed. The Valuation Office Agency will put great efforts into valuing properties on band margins, because that is where the problems lie. We want to ensure that we get the revaluation right. People in the middle of a band will not be so bothered by this. It is people on the margins who will be most concerned, and the agency has made getting the revaluation right first time a major priority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para101">I regret that I cannot promise to give Reading borough council special treatment in respect of the rate support grant, but I will certainly write to my hon. Friend about interest payments. She made a good point on that issue. In relation to the residents in her constituency to whom she referred, I understand that the proposal is that the VOA accepts responsibility for reimbursing, with an appropriate amount of interest, those council tax payers who have overpaid. Perhaps I can write to my hon. Friend with further detail on that, but I am grateful that she raised it in this debate, as it is important that we represent our constituencies in that way.

<a name="41026h01_para102">With little time available, I want to emphasise the importance of what we are doing on reform of local government finance. There have been two major reports on the local government finance system.

<p>
<a name="41026h01_para103">It is highly significant that both reports concluded that council tax should be retained but reformed. The Liberal Democrats have decided to take the path of replacing council tax with local income tax, but that has been shown by both the Select Committee and the balancing of funding review to be a mistaken path. For example, Professor Glen Bramley told the Select Committee that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;it would be a great mistake to abandon council tax&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para104">As the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, it is appropriate to assign taxation on fixed properties to local government. The Select Committee and the balance of funding review, on which Liberal Democrats served, both came forward with the view that we should retain but reform council tax, but still the Liberal Democrats will go into the next general election with the foolhardy policy of replacing council tax with local income tax. The party will suffer the consequences of that policy when the electorate tell it what they think of it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para105">Let me pick up a couple of points that were made about the nature of the council tax reform. The Government&#039;s position going into the next election is clear. We wish to retain but reform council tax. The Lyons review will look at other issues associated with the balance of funding between central and local government. To remind hon. Members, the balance of funding review concluded:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There is a clear case for reviewing council tax bands and the ratios between them at the time of revaluation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para106">However, the review warned that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;particular care is needed to ensure that council taxpayers on low incomes living in high value properties are not unfairly affected.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para107">That is something that all hon. Members have mentioned this morning. To take another example, the review concluded that the detailed case for and against a sub-national approach to revaluation should be considered, in order to take account of differential

movements in house prices in different parts of the country. However, the report also advised that further work was needed to determine the best solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para108">Liberal Democrat Members have quoted the NPI report&#151;a good report&#151;that was submitted to the balance of funding review. It is because of the complexities that that report highlighted the importance of the Lyons review. In regard to that, it was noted that the case for the sub-national approach might be weaker if the current national divergence in property prices continued to close. People on fixed low incomes, particularly pensioners, can also be vulnerable to small changes. The review noted that a fair and effective council tax benefit would be a vital component of a reformed council tax package.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para109">Unfortunately, I do not have time to give our analysis of the Liberal Democrats&#039; local income tax proposals, although we have done that on the Floor of the House on many occasions. However, whatever the Liberal Democrats decide to go into, we would welcome their submission to the Lyons review. I understand that Sir Michael Lyons has invited the leader of the Liberal Democrats to submit evidence, and I suggest that he take advantage of that opportunity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h01_para110">One thing that has been demonstrated this morning is that local government funding is a complex issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East referred to the poll tax, and the lessons of history suggest that before we make decisions on reform we must look at the implications for all the different groups affected and get those decisions right. Such reform is far too important to be rushed for political reasons, despite the Liberal Democrats&#039; wishing us to do so. I hope that we have a spirit of constructive dialogue, that the scaremongering stops, that the analysis begins and that, as we face the many challenges and changes in central and local government over the next few years, the funding regime that we introduce supports change for the long-term and the sustainable future of local government in this country.

<a name="41026h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Local Government Finance (Lincolnshire)</h3>

<a name="41026h02_time0"><h5>10.59 am</h5>


<p><a name="41026h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Simmonds  (Boston and Skegness)</b>  (Con): May I say how pleased I am to see you in the Chair, Mr. Sayeed? I am delighted to have secured this important debate in order to voice my concerns, as well as those of many of my colleagues, councillors of all political parties, my constituents and the people of Lincolnshire, about the inadequate and unfair share of Government funding that is given to Lincolnshire local authorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para0">I have for some time been drawing attention to the transfer of resources away from Lincolnshire and setting out my arguments about it. Recently, my view and that of my colleagues has been supported by clear evidence in statistical analysis compiled by Lincolnshire local authorities. That demonstrates that authorities in Lincolnshire receive significantly less Government grant support than other local authorities in England. That is grossly unjust.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para1">I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to the facts and arguments and deal with the inequitable circumstances affecting the people of Lincolnshire. The Government need to look carefully at the way in which funding is allocated between local authorities, so that the needs of Lincolnshire&#151;a mainly rural, but fast-growing county&#151;can be met.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para2">In Lincolnshire, we receive 19 per cent. less grant, per head of population, than the English average. That means that our local authorities have &#163;104 less to spend on each person, compared with the average English local authority. The provision of public services has already been put at risk as a result of that underfunding, and I shall elaborate further on specific examples of that.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Douglas Hogg  (Sleaford and North Hykeham)</b>  (Con): Does my hon. Friend agree that that effect is reinforced by the fact that the proportion of spending funded by the council tax has steadily risen from 25.35 per cent. in 1997&#150;98 to 31.46 per cent. in 2004&#150;05? That is aggravating the situation that he is so ably describing.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Simmonds </b> : I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for making that point. I shall repeat that set of statistics later; it is clear that the provision of public services has been put at risk because resources have been transferred away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para3">The detailed analysis by the Lincolnshire local authorities has revealed some very stark statistics. Funding at the national average for Lincolnshire would allow a 37 per cent. or &#163;15 million increase in spending on the police, a 66 per cent. or &#163;18 million increase in spending on roads, a 4 per cent. or &#163;15 million increase in spending on education, a 25 per cent. or &#163;33 million increase in spending on social care and a 6 per cent. or &#163;9 million increase in spending on waste collection and disposal, recycling, street cleaning, leisure facilities and other local services. Alternatively, council tax could be massively reduced by 28 per cent.&#151;the equivalent of a &#163;315 reduction in council tax for the average band D property.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para4">The Government have assessed Lincolnshire&#039;s needs as well below the national average for all services, but the exponential growth of Lincolnshire&#039;s population has put great strain on the public services provided by local 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 380WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
authorities. From 1991 to 2001, Lincolnshire&#039;s population increased by 10 per cent. compared with the national average of 2.7 per cent. That figure includes not only people moving to Lincolnshire from the midlands, as they have done traditionally, but those going to Lincolnshire from the south of England to take advantage of the disparities in house prices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para5">Lincolnshire is predominantly a rural county and the costs of sparsity and access to services in rural areas have not been adequately recognised by the Government. In addition, the Government targets distort priorities, because of inadequate understanding of rural communities. Local authorities, including county, district and borough councils and the police authority, have been left with no option but to increase their share of the council tax to meet the rising costs of public services. The council tax, as my right hon. and learned Friend has pointed out, covers a constantly increasing share of local authority spending in Lincolnshire as the proportion funded by Government grant declines.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para6">The figures that my right hon. and learned Friend gave are correct. In 1997&#150;98, council tax was 25 per cent. of Lincolnshire&#039;s funding. By 2004&#150;05, the figure had risen to 31 per cent. That is exacerbated by the fact that there are significant pockets of socio-economic deprivation in Lincolnshire. In comparison with many areas of the country, incomes in Lincolnshire are relatively low. That means that local people pay a higher than average share of their earnings in council tax. Nationally, council tax as a percentage of annual salary is 4.3 per cent. In Greater London, it is 2.9 per cent., but in Lincolnshire it is 5.2 per cent. That is exacerbated by the fact that the average annual salary in Lincolnshire is &#163;5,000 less than the national average salary of &#163;25,000, and &#163;16,000 less than the average annual salary in Greater London of &#163;36,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para7">Specific examples could, I am sure, be mentioned from all over Lincolnshire, but I want to draw on one in my constituency. Boston borough council has been forced to increase its council tax by 9.8 per cent. this year. The council was unfortunately perilously close to selection for capping by the Government. However, that was not the fault of Boston borough council, but rather of central Government who changed complicated funding formulae without considering the implications. The reasons for that are too complicated to explain this morning, but they involve transfers of revenue support grant and of housing stock. None the less, that is a significant issue, as Boston borough council estimates that it is &#163;496,000 worse off for the next two years as a result, and that it will continue to lose out on a significant scale in the coming years. There is a direct correlation between council tax increases and the transfer of resources away from Boston and other parts of Lincolnshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para8">I have written to the Minister on several occasions, highlighting the difficulties facing Boston borough council. On each occasion, he and his colleagues have failed to address the predicament faced by the council. I have the Minister&#039;s last response in front of me this morning and I am sorry to say that it is nothing short of a disgrace. I have written to him again asking for a more detailed reply to my initial letter, and the people of Boston and I await his latest answer with great interest.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 381WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para9">I now turn to Lincolnshire police authority, which was singled out for special pernicious treatment as the only police authority in England and Wales to receive a reduction in grant per head. Lincolnshire police received &#163;103.72 in funding per head of population for 2002&#150;03, but only &#163;102.31 for 2003&#150;04. As a result of that inadequate funding from central Government, Lincolnshire police have become increasingly reliant, as have local authorities, on funding raised through council tax. The authority now relies on council tax for 25 per cent. of its funding. In this financial year, the authority said that it needed a 5.3 per cent. increase in Government grant to maintain the same level of service, and yet it received nothing like that figure. Given that Lincolnshire is the fourth largest county by area, and has the second fastest growing population, that is totally unacceptable.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hogg </b> : Will my hon. Friend also make the point that in the forthcoming year the police authority will face an exceptional charge on pensions of &#163;1.9 million owing to the fact that an exceptionally large number of officers is retiring?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Simmonds </b> : My right hon. and learned Friend makes a good point. As I understand police authority funding, the only way in which it could fund those additional pension costs is by a reduction in front-line services. One criticism regularly made at my surgery is the severe invisibility of the police in my rural constituency. The point to which my right hon. and learned Friend referred will have a direct negative and detrimental impact on that provision of service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para10">The police authority is extremely disappointed by the lack of support from central Government, which will bring further difficulties in policing remote and rural areas. I agree with the chairman of a Lincolnshire police authority committee, Councillor Martin Hill, who summed up the situation as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;While Lincolnshire has continued to suffer a raw deal in terms of financial support, we have succeeded in delivering effective and efficient policing.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para11">Were the Government to provide Lincolnshire police authority with funding at the national average, there could be a &#163;15 million increase in spending on the police force. That could be spent in a variety of areas, including on putting more officers on the beat and on greater visibility and presence, which is what my constituents want. A recent survey conducted in my constituency confirmed that tackling crime was the No. 1 priority for the residents of Boston and Skegness. That underlines the importance of adequate and proper police funding in Lincolnshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para12">One of the main differences between Lincolnshire and most of the rest of England is that it is predominately rural and communities are often far apart, which means that we rely heavily on the road infrastructure. That adds to the cost of providing services in the rural areas. However, the road infrastructure in much of Lincolnshire, particularly in my constituency around Boston, is ailing and hopelessly inadequate. There is a real need for a bypass around Boston.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para13">Statistical evidence supports the view that Lincolnshire receives below average funding for transport infrastructure, maintenance and development. If Lincolnshire received 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 382WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
funding at the national average, there could, according to the Lincolnshire local plan, be a realistic &#163;18 million increase in spending on roads and on improving cycleways and public transport. That could be spent on improving the roads, and could make a major contribution to facilitating a bypass for Boston. Sadly, the problems on Lincolnshire roads, particularly in my constituency, look set to continue while the Government remain in power.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para14">Let me comment briefly on education funding, which comes from the local authority, particularly the county council. I accept that problems in school funding have been a factor in many parts of the country, not only in Lincolnshire. Last year, there was a severe schools funding crisis throughout the country, as many schools&#039; budgetary costs increased as a result of higher employer national insurance and pension contributions. However, the problem in Lincolnshire seems to have continued this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para15">The Lincolnshire Secondary Heads Association recently said that Lincolnshire schools received less this year than those in most other parts of the country. One college principal in Lincolnshire, whom I will not name, remarked:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Why are they&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para16">school children&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;not entitled to at least the level of funding that other young people are in similar counties around us? It means that schools can&#039;t employ the teaching and the non-teaching staff and buy the equipment they need for a modern educational system.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para17">I entirely agree, and I do not see why the young people of Lincolnshire should be penalised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para18">Lincolnshire is fortunate enough to have retained grammar schools, which have provided generations of young people, some of whom are from very poor backgrounds, with an excellent education. In the Government&#039;s new five-year education plan, however, Lincolnshire grammar schools are under threat. I wrote to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills demanding equal and fair treatment for all schools, including grammar schools, but unfortunately he failed to give a commitment to the fair treatment of selective schools in Lincolnshire, which will be controlled by the manipulation of funding streams. Local authorities have calculated that if Lincolnshire received Government funding at the national average level, an extra &#163;15 million could be spent on education&#151;most of it, I hope, on front-line services in schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para19">What can be done? In the short term, the Government could ensure that the grant settlement for next year is based on data available from the 2001 census. Currently, some 1991 census data are being used, to the detriment of authorities such as those in Lincolnshire whose needs are rapidly changing and whose populations are increasing significantly. The grant settlement should also be based on the latest population estimates. The current practice of using data that are at least two years old disadvantages authorities such as Lincolnshire that have rapidly expanding populations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para20">The ceiling on grants must be reviewed, as local authorities with rapidly increasing needs cannot be fully compensated through the grant system given the current ceiling. Government grant funding arrangements should be simplified and made more flexible. The ring-fencing of grants to specific areas is unhelpful and engulfs an enormous amount of management time. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 383WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I   strongly recommend that the Government make funding arrangements more flexible so that local authorities can meet increased needs and demands.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para21">Sadly, such a manoeuvring of resources away from Lincolnshire is not limited to local authorities. To some extent, it is also true of the health service, particularly dentists and the Lincolnshire ambulance service. Despite the hard work of the professionals and those who try to make the public services work, all these Lincolnshire services are suffering from being ignored by the Government. I hope that I have shown that the county of Lincolnshire has consistently lost out under the Government. I fear that this is part of the Government&#039;s ongoing and deliberate attempt at resource redistribution. Resources are being moved away from rural shires to the inner boroughs that are the Government&#039;s traditional political heartland. I hope that that trend will cease forthwith. I do not ask for special treatment for Lincolnshire or for the people of Boston and Skegness, but I do ask for our fair share. The people of Lincolnshire are not receiving it, and we demand that that changes.
</p>



<a name="41026h02_time1"><h5>11.14 am</h5>


<p><a name="41026h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mr. Simmonds) on securing this debate on funding in Lincolnshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para22">The Government have high aspirations for local government, which we continue to match with proper investment. Before I comment on specific issues raised by the hon. Gentleman, I shall say a few words about the real improvements that we have made to the funding of local government since we took office and which are set out in the latest spending review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para23">I am pleased to say that we have been able to continue the considerable investment that we have been making in local government since we took office. That investment has seen a real-terms increase in grant of 30 per cent. since 1997. That compares starkly with the 7 per cent. real-terms cut in grant that councils saw in the last four years of the previous Government, of whom the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) was a member.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hogg </b> : In that case, will the Minister please tell us why the council tax funded 25 per cent. of spend in 1997&#150;98 and in 2004&#150;05 is projected to fund 31.46 per cent?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h02_spnew6"><b> Phil Hope </b> : I will come to that point in detail, but the simple answer is that it is because Lincolnshire authorities have been increasing council tax substantially, despite significant increases in grant each year in the past five years. I shall give him those figures in a few moments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para24">The other bit of bad news for the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness is that, if there were a change of Government, his councils would be in extreme difficulty. We announced our spending plans up to 2007&#150;08 just before the summer. They mean a &#163;7.2 billion increase in general grant for local government programmes by 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 384WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2007&#150;08 over 2004&#150;05; 4.8 per cent. more a year above inflation in the level of local authority capital investment; and continued funding for the neighbourhood renewal programme. Funding for local authorities&#039; emergency planning responsibilities will also be increased and there will more money for private finance initiative credits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para25">That contrasts with the shadow Chancellor&#039;s position, which is to impose a cash freeze in the first two years of a Conservative Government, were one&#151;heaven forbid&#151;ever back in power. A cash freeze on the local authorities in Boston and Skegness would wreak havoc on the services that the hon. Gentleman has so eloquently and rightly defended. He would like further increases in grant. As well as securing a debate in this Chamber, he might like to secure a debate in his own party about its policies on local government finance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para26">We hope shortly to announce the provisional local government finance settlement for 2005&#150;06. That will include decisions on floors and ceilings. I will come back to the specific point about Boston. Local authorities will know that we are considering the operation of the ceiling for next year in areas of rapid population growth. I can confirm that the latest population estimates provided by the Office for National Statistics&#151;those for mid-2003&#151;will be used in the grant settlement. In addition, the ONS has released revisions of the mid-2001 and mid-2002 population estimates that were used in the 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 settlements respectively. We are committed to amending the grant distribution in those settlements to take account of the new figures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para27">We have also announced that the 2001 census data&#151;other than on population&#151;cannot yet be used in the settlement. That is because using updated data would require the recalculation of many of the formulae used in the settlement, which would break the formula freeze to which Ministers committed themselves following the formula grant review in 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para28">Authorities in Lincolnshire have benefited from the extra money that we have made available since taking office. Lincolnshire county council received a grant increase of &#163;30 million, or 7.8 per cent., in the 2004&#150;05 settlement, which is above the average for county councils. The district councils also received good grant increases, with most authorities receiving grant increases well above inflation.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hogg </b> : Must the hon. Gentleman not also address the absolute figures? He will know, for example, that the North Kesteven rate support grant per head of the population is &#163;122 less than the national average. Those are the absolute figures.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h02_spnew8"><b> Phil Hope </b> : The right hon. and learned Gentleman refers to the North Kesteven settlement. General grant to North Kesteven council has increased yearly between 2001 to 2004&#150;05 by 6.3 per cent. That is the average yearly increase and it is well above inflation. The council has introduced council tax increases of more than 6 per cent. a year. So, it has had a 6 per cent. yearly increase in grant over the past three years, and has raised council tax by 6 per cent. over those three years. Given those figures, it is difficult to understand the statement that the council has not had sufficient resources to provide services.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 385WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para29">I remind hon. Members that Boston borough council received an increase in 2004&#150;05 over 2003&#150;04 on a like-for-like basis of 6 per cent. There were also increases of 4.2 per cent. for East Lindsey district council; of 3 per cent. for Lincoln city council; of 5.9 per cent. for North Kesteven district council; of 5.2 per cent. for South Holland district council; of 4.5 per cent. increase for South Kesteven district council; and of 7.7 per cent. for West Lindsey district council. All but one authority in Lincolnshire received grant increases of above the average for similar tiers of authority in 2004&#150;05.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para30">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness is right to demand more money for services in his area. However, I say to him that since the Government were elected in 1997 we have provided those extra resources on a consistent basis. The past three years have seen substantial increases in grant to his authorities. He is right to come to this Chamber to demand more, but I hope that he appreciates that the figures demonstrate that those moneys have been given.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para31">I shall now deal with some of the specific points that the hon. Gentleman made about particular areas. He has written to me about various complicated matters concerning formula and, in particular, about the impact of large-scale voluntary transfers. This week, he will again receive a letter, to clarify some of the issues that he has raised in correspondence with me.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para32">Let me make it clear, however, that whatever the system for distributing formula grant to local authorities, we can only distribute a fixed pot, because there is only a certain amount of money to give out to local authorities. Distribution formulae do not confer entitlements to exact amount of grant. Decisions have to be taken on how to make the formula system work with the amounts available, and floors and ceilings are one way of doing that. However, even if we did not have those, it would remain true that in the circumstances of any particular year, a council could not rely on the formula to deliver a particular amount of grant.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para33">We introduced floors and ceilings in 2001&#150;02 for education authorities and then extended them to cover all authorities in 2002&#150;03. We have reviewed their operation each year. We have always calculated floors and ceilings to provide an increase based on the actual grant received by a council in the previous year, after allowing for changes in funding and function. We have made two refinements since: one on schools funding, and one that relates to shire districts by adjusting the base position to allow the revenue grant consequences of recent capital investment allocations to come through over and above the ceiling or floor. We did that because we took the view that capital investment deserved special treatment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para34">I am aware, from correspondence and other mechanisms, that Boston would have wished us to exclude from the grant ceiling formula grant increases that resulted from a transfer of housing stock under the previous arrangements. In principle, it would have been feasible to make other adjustments for other cases, and we did consider adjusting for the result of voluntary housing transfers. We took the view, however, that the benefits of making many further adjustments did not outweigh the considerable disadvantage of greatly complicating an already very complex grant system.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 386WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para35">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness also raised questions about funding for Lincolnshire police. I assure him that ensuring that there is good and proper funding for the police service remains a top priority for the Government. Lincolnshire will receive a general grant allocation&#151;Home Office police grant, revenue support grant and redistributed business rates&#151;of &#163;60.6 million, which is a cash increase of &#163;1.9 million over last year. If the funding formula alone had been applied, Lincolnshire would have received a grant of &#163;60.1 million, but because of the floor of 3.25 per cent. on top of last year&#039;s grant, it will in fact receive &#163;60.6 million&#151;&#163;500,000 more. The operation of the floor in the case of Lincolnshire police has benefited them to the tune of &#163;500,000. That is a significant contribution to delivering better police services in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para36">The Lincolnshire force will continue to benefit from additional resources from targeted programmes. Lincolnshire will receive resources from the crime fighting fund, the rural policing fund and the basic command unit fund, and money for Airwave, for the DNA expansion programme, for special priority payments, for community support officers and for capital grant&#151;an additional &#163;7.65 million. Most police authorities receive a similar range of grants. The hon. Gentleman is right to press for resources for better policing in his constituency and we are right to have delivered it to his police authority in the past few years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para37">The hon. Gentleman also raised the matter of education funding. Lincolnshire has had an increase in total recurrent funding of &#163;880 per pupil in real terms since 1997, which is a huge investment in children&#039;s education in the county, and the Government are proud of that. Lincolnshire&#039;s schools formula spending share increase this year is 6.1 per cent per pupil, which is above the national average. Lincolnshire also receives transitional grant of &#163;600,000 this year&#151;and a further &#163;300,000 in 2005&#150;06&#151;to help schools in the greatest difficulties, which the hon. Gentleman described, to balance their budgets by 2006&#150;07. We recognise the difficulties that can occur, even with the extra money, and have responded positively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para38">The measures that we have introduced for 2004 to 2006 have restored confidence in the school funding system. As part of the funding settlement for next year, we have guaranteed all schools a minimum per-pupil increase of 4 per cent. for secondary schools and 5 per cent. for primary and nursery schools. That will promote continued stability and certainty for schools, and it has been welcomed by representative teachers, head teachers and school support staff on the work force agreement monitoring group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para39">Mention has been made of council tax. Our spending plans will provide overall above-inflation increases in funding for local authorities. In common with the rest of the public sector, councils need to be more efficient and we expect local government to contribute significantly in that respect, delivering at least &#163;6.45 billion-worth of efficiency gains. Putting aside party political points, I suspect that there is agreement on both sides of the Chamber on the need for greater efficiency in public services, including local government services. I am pleased that the Local Government Association is committed to delivering those savings, which can and will be invested in front-line services.

<p>
<a name="41026h02_para40">There is considerable variation between authorities in their scope for making future savings, but in local government as a whole there is scope for efficiency savings of about 2.5 per cent. a year in procurement, back-office reforms and so on, which is 7.5 per cent. over the next three years. Those savings are possible because they have been demonstrated by some innovative partnership agreements set up by local authorities, and by some local e-government initiatives for which I, as Minister, have been responsible. We will work closely with local government and with the Audit Commission to ensure that those gains can be achieved and delivered to improve front-line services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h02_para41">We have worked hard to improve the local government funding formula and taken steps to ensure that all local authorities receive sufficient support and to provide a stable financial climate, as I hope I have shown in the debate. I hope that I have not been too robust, but I feel strongly about the matter. Lincolnshire county council and the district authorities in the area have benefited directly from this Government&#039;s extra investment in local government. We want local authorities to continue to improve local services. We set out in our latest spending review the framework for delivering them, while allowing local authorities to ensure that council tax increases are at an acceptable level. I cannot emphasise too strongly that we expect next year&#039;s council tax increases to be in low, single figures. Authorities will need to play their part through continued efficiency savings, but we will work with local government to help them to do so.

<a name="41026h03_head0"><h3 align=center>Coal Health Claims</h3>

<a name="41026h03_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41026h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Todd  (South Derbyshire)</b>  (Lab): This is ordinarily a popular subject for an Adjournment debate, so I expect a full complement of speakers and I do not want to take too much of the time available in introducing the points I shall focus on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para0">I have chaired the English regional sub-group of the monitoring group on coal health claims, covering Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire, for the past four years or so. At the end of last month, nearly 3,200 claims for respiratory disease damages and just over 1,500 claims for vibration white finger had been submitted from South Derbyshire residents. Taking the two schemes together, a little over one third of claims have been fully settled or withdrawn or denied. Settlements commenced on both sets of claims in 1996, but the bulk started to be settled only in 2001. Anyone unlucky enough to be subject to a policy dispute may have been waiting many years for any form of offer or settlement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para1">It has been claimed, both by Government advisers and the solicitors claimants group, that the sheer volume of claims for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was unexpected. That view was strongly expressed by the solicitors claimants group at the last monitoring group meeting, and I found it surprising. Virtually all hon. Members present represent constituencies where substantial groups of former mineworkers live. As soon as it was clear that family members could make claims on behalf of deceased mineworkers, most people expected a vast claims mountain to accumulate. Most of us also recognised that as soon as any closure date was announced on the scheme, those who handle claims, and those who farm for them, would vigorously seek to increase the number of claims made by the final date. I find it stunning that the volume of claims submitted has come as a great surprise to the solicitors representing the claimants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para2">The huge task of processing 570,000 claims for COPD&#151;I shall touch on both claims schemes at various points&#151;is, I imagine, the largest claims process for damages in the United Kingdom and probably in Europe, and it presents issues of process management and of focus of expertise, which should have been clear to the parties to the process at an early stage. It was clear that there were significant complexities in discovering the work history of mineworkers. In many cases, pits were closed and records either destroyed or woefully incomplete because no one had imagined that they would be required for this purpose. National health service records for those who died more than 10 years ago are kept only in exceptional circumstances. For those reasons, collecting information was always going to be a challenging task, particularly on behalf of deceased mineworkers.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Nigel Griffiths) </b> : I do not want to take up time, Mr. Sayeed, because I shall respond in full later, but it may be helpful if I point out that deceased miners and their rights were envisaged and built into the original court judgment, rather than their emerging later. When the initial calculation was made, in all good 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 389WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
faith and taking that fact fully into account, it was estimated that 100,000 or fewer miners might be eligible for compensation. The figure is now six times that.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jonathan Sayeed  </b> (in the Chair): Order. Many hon. Members want to take part in the debate. If interventions are brief, I shall be grateful.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Todd </b> : I appreciate that, Mr. Sayeed. This subject could be debated at length, but I do not want to do that. We can all claim expertise in hindsight. I have a record, which has been laboured to some extent, of pressing for some years for changes in process within the scheme. I find it frustrating that the two parties to the process have only recently decided that they can move to an accelerated system for dealing with the volume of claims that they face.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para3">It is right to congratulate the Minister on one step that he has taken to deal with the expedited process. Once it was recognised that we needed to accelerate claims&#151;otherwise, no settlements would be found for many people until almost the end of the decade&#151;he facilitated the process of designing a scheme that has many merits. It has cut out medical examination of records, used the data that we have already collected on the average of settlements made, and accepted the principle of discounting in cases in which it is difficult to obtain proper information, which many well-advised claimants will understand. Those design elements are sound, but I know from talking to colleagues, some of whom are here today, that the most important is the acceptance that any expedited process cannot be mandatory and that it would be wrong to tell claimants that they must accept the expedited offer or leave the scheme and pursue their claim by a civil process. That would be manifestly unfair, and I am delighted that the Minister took the initiative in saying that that would not be the Government&#039;s position in representing the coal industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para4">There are other circumstances in which expedited offers might be seen as reasonable. I have been startled by the process introduced to handle services claims for vibration white finger. Although the overwhelming majority of claimants are alive and have had their hands examined so that the disability that they suffer is well known when they claim, they have to go through a further medical examination to test their fitness and whether they require assistance services to do things that most of us, albeit incompetently in my case, can do for ourselves, such as DIY, gardening and cleaning around the house, which they cannot do because of the damage to their hands.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para5">My view, which I have expressed repeatedly, is that an expedited system for handling services claims would make sense. Many VWF claimants just want to see the end of the process, and having an overhang on services that may run until 2007 does not suit them. Provided that a fair mechanism was designed to remove some of the complex and expensive steps involved, it would be worth while to examine an expedited process for offers on that element of the outstanding claims.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para6">We also need to reflect on the unit costs of processing claims. All of us know that the costs of handling claims, compared with the offers made at the end of the process, are widely resented in mining communities. The fact 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 390WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that the cost of solicitors, claims handlers, IRISC, the medical team and so on examining a claim and producing an outcome is sometimes far higher than the offer at the end of the process is regarded with considerable resentment.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Helen Liddell  (Airdrie and Shotts)</b>  (Lab): My hon. Friend makes an important point. One dimension that has changed in relation to coal health claims is the intervention of claims-handling companies and rogue solicitors&#039; firms that see these claims as a dripping roast. I postulate that the number of claims, which at 570,000 is six times higher than was expected at the beginning, may be a consequence of claims-handling companies and so on coming into this arena. I am interested to know whether my hon. Friend has any suggestions as to how we deal with the problem of those who are exploiting miners and the families of deceased miners.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Todd </b> : I welcome what my right hon. Friend says. We all recognise that unscrupulous claims handlers have added to the pile of claims. They have sometimes done so when most people would say that there was no substance to the claim and that they have simply induced people who have the most vague notion of what they may be involved in to submit a claim because they want to claim the proceeds on their own behalf. Obviously, such matters have been pursued; my hon. Friend the Minister will be well able to comment on some of the steps taken to deal with the more unscrupulous practices, and I do not want to detract from what he will say. My only suggestion is that we should try to maximise the information available to potential claimants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para7">The finish dates for the schemes have passed, so the opportunities for the sharks have gone away: they are probably circling in the water elsewhere in the system to try to find ways of making money. However, what has happened has been an illustration, from which we need to learn, of how innocent people can be exploited by people with narrow aims of their own.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para8">I shall rattle through some key points. On vibration white finger, I have found that many claims for damages have been denied on the basis that the jobs a man did failed to fit within the list of occupations. I am talking about group 3 claims, as most of us will know of those. Subsequent checks by IRISC after longer experience of the scheme produced information about significant errors in the initial categorisation. I was stunned that of some 15,000 claims referred back to be checked as group 3 claims, 2,500 or more were recategorised as group 1 and 2 straight away through a manual exercise. That suggests an error level that we should not be prepared to accept.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para9">It also suggests that in relation to some claims rejected early in the process, particularly those involving solicitors with little mining knowledge&#151;one weakness in the English system, in particular, is that many solicitors with relatively little mining knowledge have been involved&#151;the problem has been that initial rejection on the basis of occupation has simply led to the claim being denied and time running out. It has been argued powerfully that the initial denials need to be reviewed to check whether the error level found in group 3 categorisation might also apply to the initial denials. I understand the argument that the solicitors should have 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 391WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
briefed their clients more effectively and should have responded to the issues that arose when the initial denial occurred. However, we all, as practical people, must understand what has happened, which is that where solicitors of poor quality were involved, they may well not have done that. In the interests of justice, we should ensure that it is done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para10">When evidence is produced, another aspect of VWF that causes problems is the pursuit of witnesses by loss adjustors who appear to demand a level of proof in handling the claim that is much greater than one would usually expect in a civil court process. That affects the number and quality of witnesses and the quality of information that those witnesses provide about exposure to the relevant tools. As was discussed heavily in monitoring group meetings, I urge a more sensitive approach and a recognition of the need to understand the principles of the level of proof on exposure required in the basic civil process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para11">Finally, there is a small number of surface-only claims in my constituency. Common sense tells us that people exposed to surface dust in the dusty environment in which coal is sorted have been exposed to as much dust as most underground operators. The position taken until now may have been based on medical advice, but it simply flies in the face of the intuition of most of our constituents and, frankly, of all of us. We are seeing an early move towards quite properly including surface claims in this process so that they can be handled as quickly as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para12">This has been a major issue for the residents of South Derbyshire. The area has benefited substantially, but in the cruellest way. So far, &#163;14 million has been distributed to my constituents, and I understand that a great deal more will eventually be delivered. However, it will have been delivered out of injury and tragedy, compounded by some of the processes imposed on the system and by the legalistic way in which some of the scheme was thought out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para13">We all recognise that we would not have pursued the matter in this way if we had started the process back in 1996&#151;the Government were not in power then&#151;and if we had decided how to define a sensible scheme to deal with the predicted outcome that we have. We would have delivered a faster and better outcome for the many claimants whom we represent.

<p><a name="41026h03_spnew7"><b> Adam Price  (East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</b>  (PC): I congratulate the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) on securing this important debate, which is particularly timely, given some of the changes to which I shall refer.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 392WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para14">There is a sense of frustration that we must continually scrutinise the scheme in this way, and although the hon. Gentleman is right that the Government are not to blame for all the problems associated with the scheme, they have certainly created as many problems over the years as they have solved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para15">I shall briefly refer to three aspects: the new scheme for minimum payments; the new Government rules on unassessable claims; and surface workers. I echo the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments on surface workers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para16">I welcome the Government&#039;s rejection of a compulsory system for minimum payments. Something had to be done. Some 54,000 claims are made a year, and there are 400,000 outstanding claims, so at the current rate of settlement, a claim would be settled in 2011&#151;some 14 years on from the court case. That would clearly be unacceptable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para17">I would, however, like the Minister to address cases that have already been settled but below the new minimum payment. Does he agree with the unions that a top-up should be paid in respect of cases already settled at less than the new minimum payment? That precedent was set by the previous improvement in the expedited offers, when people who had received less than the minimum payment under the new, expedited scheme received a top-up. Surely that precedent should be used in this case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para18">I move on to claims that are unassessable&#151;in the Government&#039;s view, that is&#151;which are those of colliers who died without medical records. Last week, the Department of Trade and Industry put before Lord Justice Turner some new proposals on what it called unassessable claims. Those proposals said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There will be deceased claims which fail to be assessed under the scheme where insufficient notes to enable the claim to be assessed by a respiratory specialist&#151;whether this be after the rejection of an optional risk offer earlier in the process or not. The Department&#039;s current thinking is that there is no basis on which such claims can be assessed and they should therefore be denied.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para19">We should like some clarity from the Minister&#151;the most important thing today. How does he define those cases that fall within that paragraph? What is the definition of unassessable? I would point out to the Minister the early-day motion in the name of the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham), which reflects the feelings of many coalfield Members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para20">In September 1999, when the Government signed it, the original handling agreement specified how to deal with such cases. Where there were no medical, coal board or benefits agency records, assessors were to be allowed to use the death certificate and a claims questionnaire to make a judgment. Every claimant who had those two documents was to be allowed to proceed with the claim. It would be beneficial if records had been preserved. To be fair to the unions, they called on the Government to ensure that as many records as possible were preserved at the beginning of the scheme. If that has not happened, it is not the unions&#039; fault, and it is certainly not widows&#039; fault if records have been destroyed. We would like from the Minister the Government&#039;s definition of unassessable, because another meeting with Lord Justice Turner is planned for next month. We coalfield Members need the information from the Minister today, because the suspicion&#151;rightly or not&#151;among many in the coalfield 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 393WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
is that the DTI is trying to avoid paying out to tens of thousands of miners. Today is the day on which the Minister can allay those fears.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para21">Finally, in relation to surface coal workers, I entirely agree with the hon. Member for South Derbyshire. We have heard the case for that from so many hon. Members over so many years. We even have the Government contesting surface dust claims. If those miners lose, the Government will force them to cover the legal costs. That is immoral, in my view. Dust levels in washeries and coal preparation plants were in many cases worse than they were in mines. Another Department, the Department for Work and Pensions, has recognised pneumoconiosis as a prescribed disease for surface workers and dock workers working with coal, but the Government see matters differently in relation to this scheme. That is not sustainable. Here is an opportunity for the Government to allay fears about new rules that are unacceptable for miners&#039; widows and in relation to a relatively small group of workers who have suffered enough. They should be treated equitably by a Labour Government.
</p>



<a name="41026h03_time2"><h5>2.24 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41026h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) on having secured the debate. In my constituency, the Labour Government&#039;s implementation of the coal-handling agreement has been welcome. It has paid out more than &#163;10 million to former coal miners and families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para22">However, the way in which certain members of the legal profession and claims handlers have descended on a constituency such as mine and greedily plundered people&#039;s compensation is nothing short of a national scandal. I raised that issue in a debate on 3 March, and I cannot understand why there has not been a bigger outcry nationally. As I said then, I can only assume that national newspapers and others are not interested because it is not happening in leafy middle England.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para23">In the debate of 3 March, I mentioned a case involving the Newcastle law firm Mark Gilbert Morse, which charged claimants 25 per cent. of their compensation in addition to the fees that it received from the Department of Trade and Industry. That was totally unjustified and, as I said on 3 March, was pure greed. I am pleased to say that, following the helpful intervention of the Minister and the Law Society, and thanks to publicity from the <i>Newcastle Evening Chronicle</i>, those fees were paid back to claimants. In the cases that I highlighted, more than &#163;50,000 that was wrongly plundered from my constituents&#039; compensation has been returned to them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para24">The Law Society assures me that Mark Gilbert Morse has paid back all moneys that it deducted. I asked the Law Society to give an overall figure, but it could not, which shows some of the weaknesses in its self-regulation policy. I ask anyone out there in the coalfields of the north-east, or anywhere else, who has been a client of Mark Gilbert Morse and has not had his or her deducted fees back to please come forward. Also, I challenge the Law Society to ensure that we get a proper breakdown of the wrongly deducted moneys that Mark Gilbert Morse paid back to its clients.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para25">It is annoying that companies such as Mark Gilbert Morse knew that it was wrong to deduct those moneys, but that absolutely nothing is being done against them 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 394WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
apart from their being forced to pay it back. The Law Society is toothless when it comes to bringing any kind of sanction against such firms. There is a growing call for the self-regulation imposed by the Law Society to end and for some other form of regulation of solicitors to be introduced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para26">Claims handlers, or claims farmers as I call them, have descended on many coal-mining constituencies like vultures. Such firms are totally unregulated, are represented by people who are not qualified solicitors, and have been set up purely to exploit the coal handling arrangement. Such people call themselves compensation advisers or legal advisers, although 99 per cent. of them have no legal qualifications whatever and are simply middlemen, but they do not make that clear to the people on whom they call. They often approach elderly people on their doorsteps. In the worst case that I dealt with, an 83-year-old in Beamish was forced to sign an agreement on her doorstep, although she clearly did not have a claim because her brother, whom the claim was for, died in 1952.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para27">In other cases, companies have held meetings in working men&#039;s clubs and have sometimes purported to be from representative trade unions. Indeed, some of the firms&#039; representatives are former union officials. Such firms make their money by charging claimants administration fees or deducting a percentage from their compensation. I have been told that they sell claims to firms of solicitors. Two solicitors&#039; firms in Newcastle have informed me that they have been approached by claims-handling firms wanting to sell them claims.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para28">The relationship between solicitors and claims farmers needs to be investigated urgently. In the debate of 3 March, I discussed the case of my constituent, Mr. Jobes, who had more than &#163;3,000 of his compensation deducted by a claims farmer called Industrial Disease Compensation Ltd. of Ashington, Northumberland. IDC passed his case on to a firm of solicitors in Liverpool called Silverbeck Rymer, which, on completion of the claim, deducted the money to cover IDC&#039;s costs under the agreement that Mr Jobes had signed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para29">The Law Society is pursuing the case, and I thank it for its involvement. It is unclear what cost IDC incurred. In a letter to the Law Society dated 13 October, Silverbeck Rymer stated that the agreement with IDC was justified because such claims were being vigorously denied and no compensation scheme existed at the time; charges levied by IDC were intended as an indemnity for payments of other parties&#039; solicitors and disbursements incurred; and there was an element of risk in such claims. At the time, however, that was total nonsense.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para30">Silverbeck Rymer was first instructed about the case on 5 February 1999, but the judgment that set up the coal handling agreement was given in 1998. So, when the firm took the case from IDC, it knew that the scheme was under discussion and that it would not have to enter into litigation. It was also a member of the claimant group of solicitors, so it was well aware of developments. Indeed, the judge at the time warned the claimant group not to incur any unnecessary disbursements while negotiations were taking place on the scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para31">When it took on the case, Silverbeck Rymer knew, as IDC did, that there was no risk at all. When the handling agreement was put in place in September 1999, it also 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 395WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
knew that its costs would be covered and that the DTI would not attempt to recover costs from claimants in cases that failed. Why, then, did it deduct the money and pass it to IDC? I do not know. I challenge both firms to explain why the money was deducted and to return it to Mr. Jobes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para32">I know of many similar cases in the north-east and elsewhere. This case angers me because a decent, hard-working constituent has had his compensation plundered in a totally appalling way. I am aware that there are other such cases, and I ask the Minister urgently to investigate IDC in particular, because what it is doing is daylight robbery.
</p>



<a name="41026h03_time3"><h5>2.32 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41026h03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire)</b>  (LD): It is a pleasure to appear under your chairmanship for the second time today, Mr. Sayeed. I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) on obtaining the debate, because the ongoing scheme needs scrutiny at all stages.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para33">Where compensation has been delivered to families and individuals whose lives have been ruined by disease, it has brought justice. However, several claims remain on the books, and hardly a week goes by without either myself or my office being approached by people who are having difficulty with their claim or with its slow resolution. As has been said, such things would have gone on for many years if something like the minimum payment scheme had not been brought in.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para34">It is not only individuals, but areas that have benefited from the payments. However, a huge amount of money has also gone into the coffers of solicitors. Some have been very efficient and effective on behalf of their clients, but others have been less so. We have not had such problems with unscrupulous solicitors in the south Wales area, although claimants who have engaged solicitors from outside the area have had that experience. There is certainly evidence of claims being handled very inefficiently, and one firm sent a family a lot of confidential and sensitive legal documents that related to a completely different claim from the one that the family was pursuing. That caused both the family and the people involved in the other claim considerable concern.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para35">In the short time available, I want to speak about two issues. One, which has already been touched on, is surface workers. Some people who worked on the surface were subject to even worse conditions than those who worked underground. Furthermore, the job titles describing the activity in which they were involved differed from coalfield to coalfield, as did the conditions in which they did their jobs. I therefore ask the Minister to consider the possibility of decisions being made on the basis not of job title, which, as I say, varied from coalfield to coalfield, but of the conditions and medical history that the surface workers set out in their claims.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para36">The main issue that I want to raise is about those people who spent part of their time as miners and colliers not in the nationalised industry but in private small mines and the difficulty that they have in bringing their claims to a satisfactory conclusion. As hon. Members know, many such claims are pursued on

behalf of the widows or descendants of those miners, so information about the record of their employment history is even more difficult to obtain with any certainty. However, I have been assured, by answers to questions that I have asked the Wales Office for instance, that a policy would be developed shortly to deal with such claims.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para37">It therefore came as a great disappointment when I received a letter from Mrs. Carpenter, who was making a claim on behalf of her late father, Mr. Morris. The letter, addressed to Mrs. Carpenter from her solicitor, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I have been in contact with the Defendant&#039;s Insurers and unfortunately, your claim cannot currently be progressed as the claim is subject to a Policy Issue. I asked for this issue to be explained and basically they are unable to provide an offer until new software is developed in relation to the PMF element&quot;&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para39">Will the Minister indicate when such claims can be addressed and brought to a conclusion? A number of people are hanging on, sometimes in very poor states of health, and their lives could be radically improved by the compensation due to them that they have not received.

<p><a name="41026h03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Michael Clapham  (Barnsley, West and Penistone)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd). The debate is timely, because the Department of Trade and Industry, together with the claimants group of solicitors, is seeking the court&#039;s approval to make adjustments to the scheme. That is what I want to concentrate on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para40">I am a member of the English monitoring group, which was established by my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Mrs. Liddell). The group&#039;s purpose is to try to ensure that the scheme continues, overcoming blockages that can occur with the insurers, who are very much involved, and the solicitors; and to report to the Minister. The coal-handling scheme was established in 1999, after 18 months of discussion and negotiation between solicitors for both sides. The scheme has worked well, albeit not as fast as some would have liked. That is why we are considering how we might speed it up. The Minister has suggested introducing standard payments for certain categories of claimants, and I think we all agree that that would help speed up settlements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para41">At the same time, there are concerns about some of the suggestions that, I understand, the DTI made in the court on 18 and 19 October. In particular, I refer to the new concept of the unassessable case. Will the Minister clarify what an unassessable case is? Under the handling agreement, there is provision to settle cases with a paucity of medical evidence, so that a case with, for example, only the death certificate, together with the form that the widow has completed, could be settled with an offset&#151;that is, a discount. That provision seems to have worked well, but there is now a new concept, of the unassessable case. It seems to solicitors that it is the DTI&#039;s intention to rule out an unknown but potentially large number of cases.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para42">I received a letter from the claimants group of solicitors only two days ago. The penultimate paragraph states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I trust you will agree that it would be wholly wrong for the DTI to seek to exclude deceased cases in the way apparently contemplated, particularly when they were expressly catered for under the coal handling agreement from the start and in many cases the lack of British Coal records is a result of British Coal&#039;s inappropriate continuation of their destruction.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para43">That refers to the fact that, after the case was taken to court in 1996, British Coal continued to destroy some records. Consequently, not every case registered will have a record that can be traced through British Coal&#039;s archives, which are based in the midlands.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para44">Will the Minister clarify the new concept of the unassessable case? In doing so, will he say how many cases are likely to be disallowed or stopped from proceeding if the unassessable case concept is implemented? There have been a number of other suggestions. Medical contractors suggest that a little tweaking to the medical assessment process would allow them to complete all the medical examinations required within three years. Again, the Minister may wish to comment on that, because the medical contractors have completed a document for the court, which was made available to the DTI before the hearing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para45">In conclusion, I ask the Minister to reconsider the surface work issue. He has heard from many colleagues that mining communities feel strongly about that. Many of us who know the industry are aware that surface workers in certain areas of the colliery worked in extremely dusty conditions. Will he consider allowing certain categories of surface workers to make claims? That would mean bringing in a new claims procedure especially for those surface workers who worked in certain areas of the colliery, but we could do that.

<p><a name="41026h03_spnew11"><b> David Hamilton  (Midlothian)</b>  (Lab): I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) on securing this debate. I shall not go over ground that has already been covered, such as problems with the legal system, but shall talk about my personal involvement in the issue, which can be important.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para46">As an ex-miner, I realise how the problems have come about. As a councillor in my local area, I proceeded with a number of cases, as all hon. Members present have done. I spent hours, nights and weeks trying to assist people to fill out the appropriate forms to get to the stage that we are at now. Since I became an MP, continuing cases, such as those we are now discussing, still stand out as my biggest case load. Partly, that is because I am recognised as being an ex-miner. Many people come to me because they know me, and because I live in the community I represent&#151;I was born and bred there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para47">The amount of money secured is important. In Midlothian, &#163;9.5 million has already been paid out in cases of vibration white finger. For cases of chronic bronchitis and emphysema, &#163;9.5 million has been paid out with a lot more to come. In Scotland, &#163;98 million has been paid out in cases of chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and &#163;64 million has been paid out in cases of vibration white finger. By September, &#163;1.2 billion had 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 398WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
been paid out in the whole of the United Kingdom. The concept of providing such an amount of compensation for industrial workers is the first of its kind that I have ever known, and the Government should be congratulated on that. Let us not forget that it was this Government who delivered that package; it would not have been delivered by any other Government. We are entitled to make criticisms when we have them, but we should not lose sight of the fact that we are debating an issue that would not have been debated had things been left to another Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para48">Two or three early-day motions were tabled in my name yesterday and last week. We are concerned, in spite of all the good work that the Government and we have been doing and the work done by previous Ministers. My right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Mrs. Liddell) is to be congratulated on setting up the framework for many of the cases that we are now dealing with. The Minister who followed her, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), took on the same mantle. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths)&#151;the Ministers are all Scots, I notice&#151;continues to carry through the good work of his two predecessors, so that we do not have this great victory taken out of our jaws.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para49">The amount of money that I mentioned earlier sounds like an awful lot, but let me put it in personal terms. An old lady in my area, who has known me since I was born, came to me, and I sat down to read through the form with her four years ago. She then got an award of about &#163;3,000, and of course she was tickled pink&#151;she was over the moon. She did not have very much money&#151;she never has had&#151;and she lost her man quite early in her life and has a family of eight. I told her that that was not all that was going to come, and later on she received a further &#163;60,000. We are talking about a group of people who have never seen that level of income in their life&#151;that is the human aspect. Those people have never had that amount of money; the sad thing is that her man is lost, and although each of the eight members of her family received &#163;1,000, one had already died, so that she received a further &#163;1,000 on top. That is the sad, but good, thing that happens in such cases. That human aspect is not always considered in relation to the cases that go forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para50">Two issues are really important. Private and small mines are a big issue, not just in south Wales or certain parts of the English or Scottish coalfields, and that has to be addressed. That concerns people who worked in the private mines all their lives. The second issue needs to be dealt with effectively and could include miners who worked for the National Coal Board and then for British Coal before the pit was privatised or turned into a private mine. That person&#039;s settlement cannot be made until the facts and figures about his employment with the private mine have been released. He may have worked with the private mine for only one year of a 40-year or 30-year service, but he cannot get a single penny because of that.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Roger Williams </b> : The hon. Gentleman raises a point that I could perhaps have spoken about. Often, miners are quite prepared to have that small piece of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 399WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
their service in a private mine disregarded in order to settle the claim. However, it seems that that cannot be achieved.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew13"><b> David Hamilton </b> : That is a very good point. I have already seen a number of cases where people have disregarded the second part, just to get the claim dealt with. That is unfair and wrong. However, in a number of cases people throughout the coalfield are in that category. It is surely not beyond the realms of possibility for the Minister or the Department to settle the claim while waiting for the outstanding claim on the final part to be done. I believe that that could be done with the stroke of a pen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para51">There is one more thing to discuss, which concerns surface workers. When I started in the pit, there was an old saying: &quot;You start on the hill, you go down the pit, and you finish on the hill.&quot; A man&#039;s body was so wrecked by the time he finished in the coal industry that he had to finish back on the surface. I acknowledge that the Government recognise that someone with five years&#039; underground service qualifies anyway, irrespective of whether he ended on the surface.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para52">Let us think of the change that took place even over the short time I spent in the industry&#151;some 20 years. In 1965, I worked in what they call a washery, and a couple of hundred people worked in the pit. When I left the pits, unceremoniously, during the miners&#039; strike in 1984&#150;85, Monktonhall colliery had 2,000 men, and a prep plant that produced 1 million tonnes of coal a year.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : As a former miner, does my hon. Friend agree that dust levels in the screens and washers were higher than some underground? My constituent, Mr. Ken Lynne, who worked in the screens comes into my surgery every month gasping for air, and he cannot claim. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that dust levels were perhaps higher in the screens than they were underground?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew15"><b> David Hamilton </b> : Yes. I was coming to the point about the major change in the coal industry when the mega pits, as they were called, began to be introduced. In the mega pits, the miners did not move around to different jobs; a person who was brought in to the baths stayed in that job for the rest of his working life. My hon. Friend&#039;s point about where someone worked on the surface is valid. Some people who worked on the surface never worked in the prep plants, and conversely, there are people who worked in the prep plants who never worked anywhere else. It is grossly unfair for those people to be disqualified. Records are available from witnesses by word of mouth&#151;ex-managers, for example&#151;that would confirm where those people worked in a particular period. There are ways forward; I am proud to be part of a Government that has delivered so much for a group of people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para53">There has been a lot of talk about the court case, but as far as I know whatever that court decides it will not be applicable in Scotland. There will, therefore, be a major division between MPs, because the legal position in England and Wales does not apply to the Scottish courts. The agreement at present is between the National Union of Mineworkers, Scotland area, and the

Department of Trade and Industry. Rest assured that if there is a problem in relation to the courts, the Scottish area will step back from it and it will end up in the Scottish court. We have such a big success record behind us&#151;we are on the last track to that success story&#151;and we want to take the scheme forward and make it work for everyone.
</p>



<a name="41026h03_time6"><h5>2.52 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41026h03_spnew16"><b> Jeff Ennis  (Barnsley, East and Mexborough)</b>  (Lab): I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) on securing this important and timely debate. I shall not detain hon. Members too long, as many of the points that I wanted to make have already been made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para54">I reiterate the point made in early-day motion 666 on 24 February, which formed the basis of my Adjournment debate on 9 September: there is a pressing need to establish a minimum compensation payment for miners suffering from chronic bronchitis and emphysema; after all, solicitors are guaranteed an average of &#163;2,200 for every CBE claim they deal with.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para55">It would be remiss of me not to add my congratulations to the Government on implementing a scheme that has put more than &#163;72.5 million into the pockets of people in my constituency alone. Barnsley always vies with Easington about who has had the most money, and I do not know who has had the most at present; it is a photo-finish. There are only 69,000 people on the electoral register in Barnsley, East and Mexborough, and &#163;72.5 million has gone to 12,500 former miners in the constituency, which is fantastic. However, the case for a minimum payment scheme is overwhelming because an analysis of the claims shows that about 150,000 have been settled so far. Roughly, half the claims are live claims&#151;the miners are still alive&#151;and half are bereavement claims. If we established a minimum compensation payment to speed up the process, we would get the money to as many miners as possible who are still alive. Miners suffering from chronic bronchitis and emphysema are not getting any younger, and if we do not pay them shortly, the percentage rate and balance will change quickly. If we cannot make the full payments, we should make further progress on delivering interim payments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para56">A closer look at the analysis shows that two thirds of the full and final offers already made were for less than &#163;5,000. Just under half the claims settled so far were for less than &#163;2,200, which is the amount of money that the solicitors are guaranteed. Further down the scale, 22,000 claimants have received less than &#163;1,000, some 10,000 former miners have received full and final payments of less than &#163;500, and about 3,500 miners have received less than &#163;200. How can we justify giving compensation of less than &#163;200 to someone whose lungs have been so badly damaged while we pay solicitors a guaranteed &#163;2,200? That cannot be right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para57">I want to repeat one example that I quoted in my September Adjournment debate, because it is appropriate to the point I am making. It concerns a miner who worked in the coal industry in Derbyshire. An ex-miner with 13 years&#039; experience, he was found to have chronic bronchitis and emphysema. His unapportioned award was assessed at &#163;5,304, but using the handling agreement calculator, the recoverable 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 401WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
proportion, after taking his smoking into account, was just 0.31 per cent. of the total, resulting in an offer of &#163;17.64. So he received &#163;17.64 for 13 years underground, while his solicitor got at least &#163;2,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para58">I know that, after consultation with the claimants&#039; solicitors, consideration is being given to introducing a minimum compensation payment. We heard earlier from my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) about the standard payment initiative, which is currently being negotiated, but will the Minister update the Chamber on the situation as regards establishing a minimum compensation payment, rather than a standard payment?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para59">A minimum compensation payment would serve a number of useful purposes. First and foremost, it would speed up the process and allow more miners to receive their compensation while they are still alive. It would, I hope, cut the current end date from 2011 to 2007 or thereabouts. A minimum payment might also cut the money going to solicitors. That may sound harsh, but we should look at ways of trying to get more money from the solicitors&#039; pockets into the miners&#039; pockets, and that might be a secondary outcome of establishing a minimum compensation payment. I have great difficulty in morally defending a derisory compensation payment of less than &#163;200 to some of my constituents when solicitors get an average of &#163;2,200. In the long run, a minimum compensation payment of &#163;1,500 could actually save the Government money. I hope that the Minister will continue to give serious consideration to that important point.
</p>



<a name="41026h03_time7"><h5>2.59 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41026h03_spnew17"><b> Malcolm Bruce  (Gordon)</b>  (LD): This debate focuses on the tragic human legacy of our coalfields. We have heard a lot of speeches from Members who represent coal-mining constituencies or have worked in coal mines, which give us, as one Member said, the human flavour of the subject. I want to reinforce one or two of the points that have been put to the Minister, and it seems to me that much of the problem relates to the complexity of the scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para60">My connection, such as it is, with the industry is that I have been down pits, although not to work; I had an association with the co-operative at Monktonhall, which the hon. Member for Midlothian (David Hamilton) will know about; and I had the honour&#151;or privilege, or perhaps I should say surprise&#151;of marching through Edinburgh shoulder to shoulder with Mick McGahey, the Scottish miners&#039; president, at the last Scottish miners&#039; gala before that folded, not least because the pits had pretty well all disappeared by then.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para61">I do not regard myself as an honorary member of either of the unions, but I have huge respect for people who have worked in the industry. I want to make it clear that if any of the things that I say grate, they are not intended to show any disrespect for those people. I absolutely agree that they deserve to be compensated for what they have suffered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para62">I happened to be at lunch today with Derek Ezra, former chairman of the National Coal Board, and I mentioned that this debate was coming up. He said to me, on the issue of pneumoconiosis, that he was the chairman at the time when &#163;100 million was paid into the fund, and that dealt with it; yet now we are talking about &#163;7 billion for the remaining compensations.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 402WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para63">I accept entirely that the Government have established a scheme that should have been established long ago. I give them credit for that. I do not give them credit for the scheme as it is functioning. It has been made too complicated. Cynically, I sometimes think that it is deliberately too complicated. As a consequence, many miners die before they receive any compensation. Even their estates&#151;their widows, and others&#151;are dying. My challenge to the Minister is that if the Government are serious, they must find a way of dealing with the matter expeditiously. It is in everyone&#039;s interest to bring it to an end and pay out what is needed in compensation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para64">I am sceptical, because the Government are very good at setting up schemes and getting headlines, but there are all kinds of rules. For example, we have it on the record that the Government&#039;s expectation for, and whole funding of, the minimum income guarantee to pensioners is based on the fact that more than 1 million pensioners will not claim it. The challenge to the Minister is whether we can find a way of showing that we want to get the money to the miners by a method that is clear and simple and that can be processed fast.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew18"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : Clearly, the hon. Gentleman is paying tribute to the Labour Government for delivering the scheme to many of my constituents, among others, but does he know that some of the complexities of the scheme are not down to the Government, but result from decisions made by the judge and the court? Some of what the hon. Gentleman describes is not in the hands of the Minister and the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew19"><b> Malcolm Bruce </b> : That is a slightly questionable point. If Governments set up complicated schemes, they create a field day for lawyers. Governments have the capacity to change the legislation or a scheme in a way that would cut out the lawyers. Several hon. Members have quite reasonably and understandably complained about the costs and lawyers&#039; fees being taken from money that should go to the deserving miners and their families. That is a serious and fair point, and under a simpler scheme the compensation would not be a case for the courts, but could be administered without reference to solicitors or other lawyers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para65">Hon. Members they should make common cause. A feature article from <i>The Guardian</i> of 18 September asks:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Who is to blame? The County Durham claimants all blamed Labour, the party they had supported all their lives but which they believe is now run by young, middle-class political advisers who know nothing about mining communities.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para66">That is clearly not true of the hon. Members who have spoken in the debate. The passage continues:

</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew20"><b> Mr. Jones </b> : Clearly, <i>The Guardian</i> has become a mouthpiece for the Liberal Democrats. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that in my constituency, and in Durham as a whole, many thousands of people are grateful for the compensation that they have had.

<p><a name="41026h03_spnew21"><b> Malcolm Bruce </b> : That is fine, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will make sure that it goes out on his leaflets. Those who have received the money have every reason to be grateful. However, we have heard several things about the compensation&#151;it takes a long time; some people do not get it in full; some are dead before they get the substantial amount; and many people are still waiting and being processed. Hundreds of thousands have not received anything under the scheme. Of course, the ones who have benefited are grateful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para67">I have constituents who are retired miners who have retired to the fresh air of north-east Scotland, and I can quote one who had been through the whole process. By the time he got to me he was, to use a phrase from our area, scunnered with it. He had marginally failed to qualify, having been put by the tribunal through two medical examinations, in spite of the fact that the union medical advisers were clear that he qualified to be compensated. He was told that he did not qualify because he had &quot;only&quot; chronic bronchitis. Other hon. Members have probably heard about such cases many more times than I have. It is a pretty desperate deal. I asked a Government Minister for advice, and I received some sound advice as to what that constituent could do but, not surprisingly, the constituent said, &quot;I have no intention of doing that, I have had enough; I really do not wish to exercise my rights any longer in this process. I have finished with it,&quot; and he was not prepared to take it any further.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para68">I suggest to the Minister that many of his colleagues are saying&#151;he has been quoted as hinting at it himself&#151;that a clear simplification of the scheme might achieve the right result. In an ideal world&#151;I agree with the points about private mines and about surface workers&#151;it would be better to say, &quot;You were that category of worker and you had that many years&#039; service. Without medicals or anything else, you qualify for that amount of money.&quot; If it were possible to devise a scheme of that kind, there would not be tens of millions of pounds going into lawyers&#039; pockets; it would be going to the miners. The interesting thing about the destruction of National Coal Board records, which is obviously a matter for concern, is that the Inland Revenue ought to have records for the period going back to the beginning of the scheme. Whether it requires legislation or not, the Inland Revenue might be able to help where the National Coal Board cannot. The Minister is shaking his head. Perhaps he can answer that point. Clearly, there has to be a point of qualification.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para69">It seems demeaning and insulting to put people through such tests and then tell them that they are, marginally, not ill enough&#151;they have not inhaled enough dust to qualify. That seems a degrading way to treat people, rather than saying, &quot;You clearly worked in that environment for a considerable number of years,&quot; which should be enough for them to qualify and justify a payment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para70">The final point of concern, which the hon. Member for Midlothian alluded to, is the difference between the Scottish and English situations. Let me link them. If the Government could come up with a simplified, catch-all scheme that applied uniformly across the country, they might avoid the possibility of challenges in different courts and the fact that an English court, while it might set a precedent, would not automatically resolve the matter under Scottish law.

<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 404WH</b>

<p>
<a name="41026h03_para71">I conclude by saying to the Minister that the whole House recognises, as the claims demonstrate, that hundreds of thousands of people&#151;mostly men&#151;and their families have worked in those conditions over many years and have suffered appalling consequences to their health. I give credit to the Government for acknowledging that and setting up the scheme. I do not demur from that. However, I can tell the Government that they will lose a lot of good will among their own supporters if they do not deliver the end result in a timely, fair and expeditious way. My challenge to the Minister is to come up with a scheme that is less litigious, more practical, more easily resolved and quicker, and to ensure that the miners get their just desserts while they and their families can still benefit.
</p>



<a name="41026h03_time8"><h5>3.9 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41026h03_spnew22"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson  (Tewkesbury)</b>  (Con): I will not detain the House long. I am aware that hon. Members are waiting to hear the Minister&#039;s response to this important debate. I congratulate the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) on having introduced it. I seem to remember a similar debate in this Chamber a few months ago, which I think was initiated by the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham). That another debate is taking place shows how important people feel the issue is, and that there are one or two problems with the scheme&#039;s administration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para72">In considering how the scheme was set up, I have to agree with the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) that it is complicated. I suppose that it was inevitable that it would be so, given the number of claimants and the difficulties in assessing health, and therefore what compensation people are due. Given, as we have heard, that many people have received payouts, we could say that the scheme is working reasonably well, considering its complexities. However, I am concerned, and not only as a result of my own research. I was also concerned to hear the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) say that although a number of his constituents had been well compensated, quite a few had received a derisory amount, some &#163;200, when the claims handlers would be receiving something like &#163;2,200. When that is the case, we have to ask the Minister again whether nothing can be done to make the system fairer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para73">We have heard in the past that solicitors have double claimed. From the information that I have, I believe that not many have, and I know that the Minister has written to solicitors who have been accused of double claiming and has reported those who have not replied to the Law Society. However, according to information that I have managed to find, of 173 complaints received by the society, 63 have been concluded, but repayments have been made in only 23 cases, so there is still some way to go. As I said, only a relatively small number of solicitors have double claimed, but to prove the benefit of the compensation scheme, it is important to bring justice to them and, indeed, to the people who should have been compensated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para74">It needs to be said that some solicitors have done quite well out of the scheme. I think that the most profitable group of solicitors has received almost &#163;50 million. When one considers that it has dealt with a great many cases, one can say, &quot;Well, perhaps that is fair enough.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 405WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
However, we should remember that many of these cases will be much the same, if not all the same, so perhaps we should look at what is really happening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para75">Claims for deceased miners were mentioned. I suppose that they are the saddest of cases and will be the most complicated, but the Minister would do himself justice if he went into detail in describing not only that scheme but any changes proposed to it. There seems to be doubt about what changes are proposed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para76">Finally, will the Minister update the parliamentary answers that he has given by letting us know when he expects all claims to be settled? In other words, what is the completion date for compensation payments due to people who in the past, let us face it, kept this country going? I recognise right now that there have been disputes between mining unions and Conservative Governments. However, as someone who grew up in mining areas, literally next door to a coalfield, and whose father was a miner&#151;he told me one Christmas that I got present only because he had had an accident, albeit a fairly small one, down the mine and was compensated for it&#151;I have a natural sympathy for the miners who are claiming compensation and I am proud and pleased to align myself with the hon. Members who have spoken so far.
</p>



<a name="41026h03_time9"><h5>3.14 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41026h03_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Nigel Griffiths) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) on securing the debate and giving me the opportunity to update hon. Members on the progress made in meeting the health liabilities of British Coal, and on the review to speed up compensation payments that is being undertaken by Sir Michael Turner, the judge responsible for British Coal respiratory disease litigation. I shall respond also to the points that my hon. Friend and others made. My hon. Friend chairs the regional monitoring group on coal health claims for Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire, so he speaks with considerable authority on the matter. I am sure that he will want to correct the 1996 date that he inadvertently gave in his speech, since the High Court judgments were not handed down until 1998.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para77">I thank all hon. Friends and hon. Members who have contributed to the debate. As I said in the last Adjournment debate on the subject, this is about justice and securing justice. As was said earlier, the Government are administering the largest health compensation scheme in history. We have made payments&#151;of up to &#163;370,000&#151;to almost 430,000 sick miners and their widows or families, with an average payment of &#163;7,340 per case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and &#163;7,970 for vibration white finger. Some 92,000 payments, totalling &#163;1.1 billion, cover the damage to health caused by vibration white finger, and 238,000, totalling &#163;1.2 billion, cover the damage to health caused by respiratory diseases. In summary, we have paid &#163;2.3 billion to approximately 430,000 miners. In my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, we have so far paid nearly &#163;15 million to almost 2,700 sick miners or their widows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para78">My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) asked how payments of less than &#163;200 could be defended. The simple answer is that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 406WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
they cannot. I am therefore happy to confirm that we are negotiating on a tariff system that would wipe out those minimal payments of &#163;200 or less and replace them with a series of fixed payments to miners. I shall say more on that later.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para79">Hon. Members will know that I want to see everything possible done to accelerate payments and tackle the backlog of claims. Many of the claims were submitted this year, and they mostly cover those miners who were less affected by lung disease. I am advised that half the claims come from former miners whose lungs show no medical effects of disease on their function. There are also many claims from families of miners who died many years ago, for whom there are no medical records. We always planned to compensate families of deceased miners, but not if there is no medical evidence. In November, the judge will decide the minimum evidence needed in the cases of deceased miners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para80">To tackle the backlog, we have recruited every available lung specialist in the UK. Around 200 of the 600 qualified respiratory consultants are contracted to us to tackle it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para81">Some time ago, my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire suggested that we use GPs to assess estate claims&#151;the claims of miners whose widows have also died. My predecessor considered that, but concluded that because the top respiratory specialists were having difficulty in assessing such claims, GPs could not be expected to have anywhere near the expertise required. Today, my hon. Friend revisited that matter in respect of vibration white finger and suggested simplifying the process by rolling together the two medicals that may currently apply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para82">The first medical is designed to assess general damages. It is designed specifically to assess the extent of the claimant&#039;s vibration white finger, examines that condition only and is carried out by specialist doctors. The second medical relates to services that will compensate for the lack of ability to carry out household tasks and is used to assess conditions other than vibration white finger that affect the claimant. The second medical is carried out only for those who have claimed for services&#151;not all claimants are eligible for services compensation. I am sorry to inform my hon. Friend that to subject all claimants to a single medical covering both general damages and services would be a waste of resources and would subject claimants to unnecessary medical tests. It would add to the bureaucracy rather than reduce it.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew23"><b> Mr. Todd </b> : Will the Minister reflect that if we continue with the process as so far defined, services claims, which have not yet all been submitted, will be settled perhaps sometime in 2007? Would it not be easier to set out a simpler paper-based solution to claims based on the evidence collected so far, which could be offered at a discount to reduce the cost to the scheme of going through the second medical?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew24"><b> Nigel Griffiths </b> : No, it would not be practical. My hon. Friend&#039;s clever and thoughtful idea for GPs to do more of the assessments was rejected by all parties on the basis that specialists were required. I do not rule out Sir Michael Turner&#039;s examining aspects of the process that will meet our common aim of ensuring that the time taken to deal with the backlog is reduced.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 407WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para83">In July, Sir Michael instructed solicitors representing claimants and the DTI to examine ways of tackling that backlog. On 22 September, he instructed the DTI and the claimants&#039; solicitors to consider how mandatory offers might be made so that medical resources could be focused on those most likely to be ill. Together, we examined risk offers based on the calculation that about 70 per cent. of people would accept the average figure already awarded and accepted by claimants with a similar disability. Those were not the miners whose lungs were more clearly damaged&#151;they will continue to be fully medically assessed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para84">We know from claims already settled that only 6 per cent. of claimants whose spirometry tests show normal lung function are deemed by the consultant to have measurable disability, and even then, at low levels. The remaining 94 per cent. are found to have no measurable disability and therefore receive no or very little compensation. The judge asked the parties to consider making mandatory offers to those with normal lung function on the basis of a spirometry test. He believes that avoiding putting such claimants through a full medical assessment would have a significant impact in shortening the scheme and would allow medical resources to be focused on those most likely to be ill. However, I recognise concerns that a minority of people made mandatory offers might have received higher compensation if they had gone through the whole medical process. That is why the offers will not be mandatory in the terms that we have proposed to the judge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para85">Hon. Members representing miners accepted that introducing the option of rejecting a tariff offer and having the option to request a full medical assessment would delay clearing the backlog as quickly as a mandatory scheme would do it. I agreed that the offer would be voluntary. Under Department proposals, spirometry levels will be split into four categories, with an average payment to be calculated for each category of live claimant based on recent compensation settlements. Cases in which spirometry tests indicate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will automatically go through to the medical assessment process as before. The judge is currently considering the proposal, as well as the claimants&#039; solicitors&#039; proposals to have six categories and for payments to be higher than the average already settled. I imagine that Sir Michael will have to rule on whether that is fair to people who have already settled.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para86">Sir Michael has asked the Department and the solicitors to consider separately how best we can speed up the processing of claims by the widows and families of former miners. My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) asked directly about deceased miners, and I hope that I covered that in my earlier comments.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew25"><b> Adam Price </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew26"><b> Nigel Griffiths </b> : I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is trying to intervene, because I was about to address his point. I emphasise that this has never been a cost-saving exercise. The Government&#039;s and the judge&#039;s objective is simply to speed up the settlement process. I deplore the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 408WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
actions of Plaid Cymru and its agent Bleddyn Hancock who, in the <i>South Wales</i> <i>Evening Post</i> on 15 October, made the ludicrous claim that the Department was speeding up the process to save &#163;600 million in administrative costs. That sort of alarmist statement, made without foundation, is typical of Plaid Cymru, which has still not said what it has done with the &#163;13 million that the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers South Wales pocketed from administering the scheme. I therefore will not take lectures from Plaid Cymru about the greedy lawyers in this case.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew27"><b> Adam Price </b> : Will the Minister take an intervention?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew28"><b> Nigel Griffiths </b> : Willingly, if the hon. Gentleman will justify what has happened to that &#163;13 million.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew29"><b> Adam Price </b> : I simply want the Minister to answer the question asked by his hon. Friend the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) which is why must we change the perfectly acceptable arrangements agreed by the Government and set under the agreement for cases where there is a paucity of evidence if those arrangements have worked until now? What has changed?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew30"><b> Nigel Griffiths </b> : The arrangements for cases in which there is a paucity of evidence were envisaged at the beginning of the scheme. Sir Michael Turner now has to decide whether the arrangements are adequate to ensure that payments are made to miners. As I made very clear, the scheme was never envisaged for cases in which there is no medical evidence, rather than where there is a paucity of evidence, which was, I believe, the phrase used by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone and echoed by the hon. Gentleman just now. We want Sir Michael to recommend the way forward in cases in which where there is absolutely no evidence so that we can ensure that settlements are fair.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para87">So far as surface-only claims are concerned, the original judgment did not cover miners who had worked solely on the surface. The expert medical advice is that respirable dust levels on the surface of coal mines were insufficient to cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the great majority of cases. Surface workers&#039; claims for COPD cannot be paid on a scheme basis under the claims-handling agreement for respiratory diseases. As Minister, however, I instructed the miners&#039; solicitors to have access to British Coal archives to assist them to find evidence to support the case on behalf of affected miners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para88">Following the latest court hearing on 4 and 5 October, the judge gave the claimants&#039; solicitors until 18 November to secure funding for any litigation from the National Union of Mineworkers, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers, NACODS South Wales and others. I will be happy to report back on that.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew31"><b> Paul Farrelly  (Newcastle-under-Lyme)</b>  (Lab): Like all hon. Members, I welcome the efforts that have been made to speed up the claims process. We can also see the good progress made by the number of offers being made and the number of cases being closed. However, cases 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 409WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
involving small mines are the largest single group of my priority cases to be held up. I wonder whether the Minister could give us some comfort as to when he expects a final agreement.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h03_spnew32"><b> Nigel Griffiths </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that issue, which has been raised by other hon. Members. Negotiations have been difficult and protracted, and have been frustrating for everyone involved. However, as I announced in the spring, the claimants&#039; solicitors and the small mines representatives have, following mediation and negotiation, been able to resolve the remaining difficulties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para89">As a result, small mines will now be included under the terms of the claims handling agreement. The Department is working with the other parties and its claims handlers to put the settlement reached into operation. As a result of this settlement, small mines claimants should be able to move from interim payments to full and final settlement. I will take a close interest in that and report back to hon. Members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h03_para90">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire on raising this important issue and on giving me the chance to keep Members up to date on the Government&#039;s position.

<a name="41026h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Tetra Mast (Perry Barr)</h3>

<a name="41026h04_time0"><h5>3.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41026h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Khalid Mahmood  (Birmingham, Perry Barr)</b>  (Lab): Tetra masts are being erected all over the country as the emergency services install new radio systems. However, there are fierce debates among residents, local authorities and scientists about their effect on health. For the past 12 months, my Labour action team and I have been supporting the residents in the Baltimore road area of Perry Barr. They do not want the 15 m Tetra mast tower on their doorstep. More significantly, they do not want a potential health hazard and actual eyesore next to a primary school that serves 700 children between the ages of three and 11.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para0">When my constituents first told me that the operating company, mmO <sub>2</sub> , had erected a mast without any consultation with the community, I was unaware of the unscrupulous tactics of mobile phone companies. I was astonished to learn that they exploit a flaw in planning guidelines that allows them to erect a mobile mast prior to obtaining planning permission, because it is used for emergency services. The operating companies abuse part of planning policy guidance note 8, which allows the erection of the masts under emergency powers. Effectively, that means applying for retrospective planning permission.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para1">My constituents had every right to believe that, not withstanding emergency powers, the application would eventually be turned down. Public meetings were held, concerns were raised and petitions were presented. The community and parents of the Baltimore road area had the support of the Labour councillor, who did not want the potential health hazard and visual eyesore on their doorstep. They had my support, because I did not want a mobile phone mast on the doorstep of schoolchildren. They had the support of the Labour Administration, who rightly turned down the application. Finally, the community and parents of Baltimore road were supported by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, who dismissed a subsequent appeal from Airwave mmO <sub>2</sub> .
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para2">All that was in vain, however, because on 7 October, almost a year to the date on which the Tetra mast was erected, planning permission was granted. In the end, a valiant and emotional campaign that put the quality of life of the community on the front line of planning ended in betrayal, when the Liberal-Conservative coalition granted planning permission for the mast.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para3">How can that have happened? That 15 m tower is just one of many needed for the West Midlands police new multi-million pound Tetra radio system, which relies on mobile phone technology instead of radio frequencies. Although the new system promises to be a far more efficient way for police officers to communicate than their current outdated system, the installation of the mast has sparked controversy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para4">It is claimed that the new installations are being made under emergency powers. Those emergency powers allow the operators to install and use the equipment for up to six months, while they apply for planning permission and make any necessary subsequent appeals to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and his planning inspectorate. That is a complete misuse of the planning guidance, of which I hope my hon. Friend 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 411WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the Minister will take note and act on with the telecoms industry. Indeed, one of the recommendations of an inquiry recently held by the all-party group on mobile communications was that the Government should investigate the ways in which emergency provisions can prevail. The inquiry suggests more stringent regulations on what constitutes an emergency, with suitable penalties for operators who do not comply with such procedures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para5">There is nothing intrinsically wrong with wanting to provide an emergency service with a digital radio system. Such a system promises improved local and inter-service communications, with better signal quality and high reliability. I am not against our police having the best tools to beat the criminals, particularly if we are to maintain and improve on the reduced crime figures in the area. However, in my constituency, the governors of a 700-pupil school and the Labour team, along with the residents and the parents, are worried about the possible health risks&#151;the mast is only 300 m from Dorrington school. More concerning is the close proximity of residential properties that are fewer than 100 m away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para6">The Stewart report&#151;the independent study carried out in May 2001&#151;found that the possibility of harm could not be ruled out. It suggested that a precautionary approach should be adopted.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mohammad Sarwar  (Glasgow, Govan)</b>  (Lab): My hon. Friend will be aware of various studies that have been undertaken to establish whether such masts pose an increased threat of cancer and other illnesses. As yet, the evidence has not been conclusive. Rightly, the parents of schoolchildren, and people in residential areas, are extremely concerned about the health hazards. Should the Government not have a national strategy to deal with this serious issue?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mahmood </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I totally agree that more work needs to be done. In order to allay residents&#039; fears, it is important that we undertake such studies, and on health grounds we must ensure that the issues are dealt with properly. The Trade and Industry Committee reported that it was
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;disturbed at the lack of examination of the potentially adverse health effects of the masts.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>




<p><a name="41026h04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Si&#244;n Simon  (Birmingham, Erdington)</b>  (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that, regardless of the health impact or otherwise of the devices, we have a consultative framework for planning legislation in this country so that ordinary people who live in an affected area have a right not just to be consulted but to have a say as to whether they have such things at the end of their gardens? They have a right to say, &quot;OK, build it, by all means, but we do not want it dumped at the end of our road.&quot;
</p>




<p><a name="41026h04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mahmood </b> : I thank my hon. Friend. He is right about consultation. One of the things about this escapade is that there has been very little consultation with residents, and one of the residents&#039; reasons for being totally against the mast is that it was put up before any of them had been informed about the process. The complete lack of consultation with the residents of the

&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 412WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Baltimore road area has done nothing to stem their fears that something is being hidden from them, and that is creating some distress in the community. Surely, Airwave mmO <sub>2</sub>  could have relocated the mast to one of several more suitable industrial sites, away from residential properties and Dorrington school. It could still do so, but it has chosen not to.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para7">One of the recommendations of the all-party group on mobile communications is that, in their development plans, local planning authorities lay down policies and guidance on the siting, design and appearance of telecommunications installations. The group aims to build confidence in the community, involving people in the decision-making process, suggesting a more rigorous approach to the allocation of sites, and throwing the book at communications companies that bend the rules to suit themselves and do not consult local people, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon) has said.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para8">My constituents were let down by the Liberals and Conservatives, who gave mmO <sub>2</sub>  a helping hand to erect a mobile phone mast on Baltimore road. The residents of that area cannot comprehend why the mast has been granted planning approval despite the application&#039;s having been refused by the previous planning committee, and a subsequent appeal to the Secretary of State having been lost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para9">Sadly, the residents were led to believe by a local Liberal councillor that a legal challenge to the decision of the local planning authority was possible. However, even he has now confessed to me by e-mail that his advice was not practical or viable, because of the expense of a judicial review. He is a person who, when challenged by me at a Perry Barr ward committee meeting about whether he supported the residents of the Baltimore road area or the Liberal parliamentary candidate for the neighbouring Birmingham, Hodge Hill constituency&#151;fondly known as &quot;Nokia Davies&quot;&#151;who worked for the telecoms industry installing phone masts, gave his categorical reply that he supported the Liberal candidate and hence not the residents of Perry Barr. What my residents need is constructive advice from their local elected representatives and not crocodile tears with no achievable end.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para10">Clearly the jury is still out on the health risks, and clearly the unsightly and potentially harmful masts should be subject to increased public consultation not only on their siting and appearance but on health grounds. I hope that my hon. Friend will provide a constructive way forward for us to deal with unscrupulous telecoms mast operators. I urge him to refer to all the recommendations made by the all-party mobile communications group and, more importantly, to include health grounds as a planning issue when applications for masts are submitted. The only way that I can help my constituents now is by giving my support in complaining to the local government ombudsman about how the development control committee has dealt with the issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para11">I urge my hon. Friend to consider all grounds in planning regulations&#151;I am sure that he will&#151;and particularly those relating to health. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sarwar) has said, that should cover the health studies that need to be carried out, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington has noted, the people who want

to install the masts should hold proper consultations so that communities can be informed of issues pertaining to them. We have to look for the best possible sites. It is no good companies putting up masts under emergency powers on the first available site without any consultation and then applying for retrospective planning permission.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para12">I say again that the only way for me to help my constituents is to contact the local government ombudsman about the shabby way that the local government planning committee has dealt with my residents in the Baltimore road area. I hope that my hon. Friend will have something to add to that.

This is an important debate, and the concerns that they raised are shared by many of our constituents and us as Members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para13">I will start by explaining where we are vis-&#224;-vis the case in question and the Airwave programme, looking at some of the possibilities, and emphasising the importance that the Government place on health issues and related matters&#151;I know that they are of particular concern.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para14">The debate relates to Tetra, which stands for terrestrial trunked radio and is a standard for digital private mobile radio. Tetra is a European standard agreed in the 1990s by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. There is no &quot;Tetra project&quot; as such&#151;as I have said, it is a radio standard&#151;so the police are not the only organisation to use its technology.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para15">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr is right to say that Airwave mmO <sub>2</sub>  is currently rolling out a Tetra system on behalf of the Home Office for the police in England, Wales and Scotland. It uses the digital Tetra technology because it offers higher standards. Indeed, my hon. Friend alluded to the fact that it will undoubtedly improve matters for police officers and for the general public, and recognised that such a change was required in order to meet those goals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para16">The Tetra system will ensure that police forces throughout Great Britain can communicate directly with one another. They cannot do so with the old analogue systems, which are incompatible and do not provide sufficient coverage or clarity of signal. The new Tetra system will provide that coverage and clarity. It will also provide additional services that are not currently available: not only does it offer better security, but data other than normal voice communications can be transmitted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para17">The roll-out of Airwave is progressing well. It is currently available to 40 forces and about 78,000 police users. The Government expect it to be available to all forces by mid-2005 and that it will be fully operational by mid-2006. About 80 per cent. of the 3,000 masts required for Airwave to provide a national service have 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 414WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
been approved without causing untoward circumstances. Obviously, further masts may be a problem&#151;the one referred to by my hon. Friend at Baltimore road is one such&#151;but they will be few and far between.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h04_spnew6"><b> Mr. Simon </b> : I have no doubt that the Minister will come to this matter in a moment, but such masts cannot be that few or that far between. In my constituency of Erdington, which is next door to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr, people have come to me during the past year having woken up one morning to discover a huge, loud, dirty and ugly mobile phone mast at the bottom of their garden. Such masts have no planning permission; they do not require it, because they are apparently temporary structures&#151;although, lo and behold, they never go away. It cannot happen that rarely; if it is happening in my constituency and in that of my hon. Friend, it must be happening all over the place. People are furious, not about the principle of masts or the health implications but about the fact that these things suddenly appear the bottom of the garden&#151;and they have no say in the matter.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h04_spnew7"><b> Paul Clark </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for that. I was specifically talking about the masts required to allow the roll-out of the Tetra system, not mobile phone masts per se. I recognise what my hon. Friend says, but as I said in my introductory remarks, we will all have faced problems over communications masts&#151;it may be clearer if I put it that way. Certainly, as far as the Tetra roll-out is concerned, the vast majority have gone through okay, but some have caused problems, one of those obviously being the one that we are discussing now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para18">I understand that the mast at Baltimore road is necessary to help complete the network for the West Midlands police force, which adopted the Airwave network earlier this year. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is aware that at some key sites it has been necessary for Airwave to install communications equipment and to seek planning approval retrospectively. We are well aware of that; I shall deal with the question a little later. The company had to do that in order to ensure complete radio coverage of the area with no black holes, otherwise the local police forces would be unable to transfer to the enhanced communications network as planned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para19">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr clearly explained that the development control committee of Birmingham city council was initially minded to reject the application for the Baltimore road development on potential health grounds. The equipment was perceived as a risk to the health of residents and to that of children attending the nearby school, to which my hon. Friend referred. On 7 October, the development control committee considered a full planning permission application, and was minded to approve it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para20">There was a possibility that enforcement action towards the removal of the mast could have been taken at the stage to which my hon. Friend referred, but it was held in abeyance until the outcome of the application, which was considered on 7 October. As my hon. Friend is aware, it is normal practice for a local authority to hold certain actions in abeyance until various stages 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 415WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
have been completed and followed through to exhaustion, and then to use enforcement if required. Having said that, there are ways to challenge that decision and my hon. Friend is minded to support consideration by the local government ombudsman of maladministration if a matter has been handled incorrectly by the planning authority or if someone feels that they have suffered an injustice in the processes followed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para21">I would advise my hon. Friend again to exhaust all procedures with the local authorities to give them a chance to rectify the situation before taking things to the next stage. That is common sense, and I am sure he is aware of that. The Government give responsibility to local planning authorities, which are closer to the ground, to take decisions about local communities and local planning applications.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h04_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mahmood </b> : Would the Government support whatever decisions were taken by the local planning authorities?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h04_spnew9"><b> Paul Clark </b> : I am coming to the local planning authorities&#039; options. At certain stages, the Government and my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister can be involved. We have laid down a system that ensures that there are procedures to be followed in dealing with these matters. On planning regulations, especially for telecommunications developments, any installation that is in a designated area&#151;such as an area of outstanding natural beauty or an SSSI&#151;or one elsewhere that is more than 15 m high, is the subject of a full planning application. Outside the designated areas that I mentioned, licensed communication code system operators are authorised under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 to install specified communications apparatus without the need to make a planning application to the local authority. Certain types of development, however, such as the installation of ground-based masts of up to 15 m in height, are subject to a prior approval procedure, which allows the local planning authority the opportunity to say whether it wishes to approve details of the siting or appearance of the installation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para22">However, it is for the local planning authority to decide whether a particular development would require an application for prior approval or a full planning application, and it would have to decide in the light of local development plan policies and any other material considerations, including representations for and against any specific application.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para23">A number of options are open to local authorities in terms of enforcement, and it is a matter for the local authority to decide what is the best course of action in the light of the issue it is dealing with. That is the broad line along which we expect local authorities to operate.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h04_spnew10"><b> Mr. Sarwar </b> : I appreciate that the matter is for the local authority to decide, but it is a national issue, not a regional one, and parents and others in all parts of the United Kingdom are rightly concerned, especially when there is professional advice that mobile use by 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 416WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
individuals affects health and increases the risk of cancer and other illnesses. Should there not be some national strategy to allay people&#039;s fears?
</p>




<p><a name="41026h04_spnew11"><b> Paul Clark </b> : I recognise what my hon. Friend is saying about the health issue, and I will come to that. There is a national issue, but a Government can only lay down a framework of options and processes for planning applications, and local authorities will then make a judgment. I will come on to health because it is a serious issue of concern to many.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para24">I want to deal now with the enforcement powers open to local authorities. First, there is the operation to serve a planning contravention notice. That may be used where it appears that there has been a breach of planning control, and the local planning authority requires information about activities on the land. Secondly, authorities have the option of serving an enforcement notice, which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr referred to and which requires steps to be taken to remedy the breach within a given period of time. There is a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against an enforcement notice, but there is a maximum penalty of &#163;20,000 if it is upheld on conviction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para25">Thirdly, authorities have the power to serve a stop notice, which has the effect of immediately stopping any activity that contravenes the planning control guidelines. Fourthly, they have the power to serve a breach of condition notice where there is a failure to comply with any condition or limitation imposed on the granting of planning permission. Fifthly, an injunction can be sought through the High Court or the county court, which would restrain any actual or expected breach of planning control. Finally, local authority planning officers have powers of entry on to land to gain the information that they require to assess what is going on and to undertake the enforcement process. Local authorities, whatever the planning application or the activity that has gone on, have a wide range of powers open to them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para26">There are emergency development powers. There is no specific definition under the orders on general permitted development as to what emergency works are, but one is contained in the planning policy guidance note 8, on telecommunications. Emergency developments are various

stations. That was comprehensively addressed in a report by the board&#039;s independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation, chaired by Sir Richard Doll. That report, which is available on the board&#039;s website, noted that the signals from Tetra base stations, like their mobile phone counterparts, are not pulsed&#151;there was concern that they are.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h04_para30">A number of steps have been taken, and the emissions from base stations under Tetra are well within international guidelines. I assure hon. Members that we continue to review the work of and to work with the industry and independent organisations to consider the possibilities on the health side, including the excellent work undertaken by the all-party parliamentary mobile communications group, some of which has been mentioned. We have undertaken to review the group&#039;s recommendations in taking forward our policies on planning for telecommunications.

<p>
<a name="41026h04_para31">Time defeats us, but I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr on securing this debate on an issue that is important, not only for his constituents but for us all. The Government are conscious of the concerns raised by hon. Members.

<a name="41026h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Housing (Brent)</h3>

<a name="41026h05_time0"><h5>4 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41026h05_spnew0"><b> Sarah Teather  (Brent, East)</b>  (LD): It is a great pleasure to have secured this debate to raise important issues concerning housing in Brent. Access to housing and overcrowding are the No. 1 issues in my constituency. Of course, the issues surrounding that of housing in Brent are wide and could fill perhaps a dozen Adjournment debates; perhaps the House will allow me to raise those issues on other occasions. Today, I will confine my words to issues of access, overcrowding, and supply and demand across the sector, but with specific reference to the impact on social housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para0">In common with much of inner London, Brent is an area of mixed economies, with varied wages and living standards. The average wage in Brent is about &#163;25,000 a year, which is lower than the London average of about &#163;33,000, but about the same as the UK average. However, that number masks huge variations. Unemployment is running at the 23rd highest of any constituency in the country, and 31 per cent. of children in my constituency are eligible for free school meals&#151;I am sure that hon. Members will agree that that is a very high figure. The Audit Commission said that Brent is an area of significant deprivation, and the 13th most deprived London borough. Against that background, Brent has some of the highest property prices in London&#151;in Brondesbury and Queen&#039;s Park&#151;and has consistently been among the boroughs with the fastest rising house prices in London.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para1">Rents are similarly high, which probably explains why so many people live in house shares. Brent is thought to have the highest level of houses in multiple occupation&#151;HMOs&#151;anywhere in the country. According to figures from the Brent private tenants rights group, one in 20 of unfit HMOs in England and Wales is in Brent. That extraordinary and shocking figure is borne out by my experience of constituents coming to my surgeries to complain about overcrowded bedsits, into which large families are packed, with poor escape routes and the concomitant fire risks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para2">Such pressures on the housing market and rented accommodation put increased pressure on the social housing sector. There are 2,076 applications on the housing transfer list in Brent&#151;those are applications from Brent tenants who are waiting for transfers, and may well involve entire families&#151;but there are 17,151 applications on the total register list, which includes everyone else, totalling 19,227 applications to move, as of September. That has risen by 40 per cent. in 18 months.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para3">The ethnic breakdown of people on the housing waiting lists in Brent is as follows: 40 per cent. are black, compared with 20 per cent. of the Brent population; 19 per cent. are white, compared with 45 per cent. of the Brent population; 18 per cent. are Asian; and 6.5 per cent. are of mixed or other race. So, the problem disproportionately affects black residents in my constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para4">Brent expected the overall waiting list to reach 20,000 by 2006, but it will almost certainly reach it by 2005. However, lettings by Brent authority have declined to a 15-year low; it expects to be able to let properties to fewer than 7 per cent. of current applicants in 2004&#150;05. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 419WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Brent housing needs survey, which is compiled from a mix of census and sampling data and which looks at all the properties in the borough, whether inhabited by homeowners or tenants, found that 10.6 per cent. of households are overcrowded. That figure rises to 16 per cent. of local authority and registered social landlord homes, as compared with 2.4 per cent. of all English households.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para5">Some 35 per cent. of those on the housing register are overcrowded. The 2001 census figures showed that Brent has the fourth highest level of overcrowding in London. Overcrowding disproportionately affects people from immigrant and ethnic minority families, as they tend to have larger families and because there is a chronic shortage of larger properties in the borough.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para6">The impact of overcrowding and the sense of hopelessness about moving have an enormous impact on families. Week after week I hear the same heart-rending stories in my surgery, and it is to my immense frustration that there is often little or nothing that I can do to help. In almost every surgery the same story is told: a family of four has been on the waiting list for a number of years, and usually one or both parents are on anti-depressants as a result. The parents have mood swings and are often angry and lash out. The children have asthma caused from the damp in the property. The family have letters from their GP and the school stating that illness is affecting the child&#039;s ability to thrive and their academic standards. It is all because of the way they are living. The family have no sense of hope that they may be able to move.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para7">The costs of treating the illness and the costs to society of children who are less well educated and of adults who are economically unproductive are obvious. It is an awful injustice when so much potential goes to waste. That story is repeated week in and week out. There is no more pressing injustice in my constituency. I want to tell a few of the stories.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para8">Siobhan McCutcheon and her partner, Mr. Cottle are housing association tenants with three children who live in a tiny, two-bedroom flat in Willesden Green. The sitting room is very small; it is not big enough for a table. Their oldest child is too old now to share a room and the overcrowding is affecting his schoolwork. There is nowhere for him to do his homework because there is no table, so they have given him the small boxroom. However, there are two other children and the overcrowding problem has got worse as the family have got older.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para9">The family have tried to make the best of it. The other two children are in the same room as their parents, but that is big enough only for a cot by the bed, so the three-and-a-half year old is in the cot. That child is the only one who will fit in a cot; the five-and-a-half-year-old is in the bed with the parents. That situation has been going on a long time. My representations to the housing association and the council have achieved nothing, because there is nowhere to move the family. The family are extremely angry and the mother is extremely depressed. I am sure that hon. Members would understand why and sympathise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para10">Another constituent who did not want to be named is also sharing a bed with one of her children. She has sickle cell disease, which at times causes her extreme 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 420WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
pain and chronic problems with her hip. She cannot turn over in bed for fear of rolling on to her baby. Her other three children share a single room.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para11">Mrs. Alderson and Mr. James live in a three-bedroom maisonette where there are eight people. The baby shares the bed with the parents and the two-year-old is in the same room. Their teenager, who has exams and is trying to get on with schoolwork, is in the boxroom. The other three children share one room. My representations on behalf of the family have brought them higher priority but no new home.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para12">The story is similar for temporary accommodation. Brent spent &#163;6 million on temporary accommodation in 2003&#150;04. That covered both accommodation costs and housing benefit subsidy. It had 4,238 households in temporary accommodation in March 2004. It met the Government&#039;s target for reducing the number of people in temporary accommodation, but an awful lot remain. A recent Shelter survey of homeless households in temporary accommodation showed very similar effects of living in overcrowding to those that I have described.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para13">In the survey, 78 per cent. said that they had health problems, 50 per cent. were suffering from depression and 50 per cent. said that their health had suffered from living in temporary accommodation. Children missed an average of 55 school days because of disruption caused by temporary accommodation. Two thirds of respondents&#039; children said that they had problems at school. Nearly half the respondents described their children as &quot;often unhappy or depressed&quot;. In 77 per cent. of those households there was no family member working, often because of health or mobility problems and insecurity about where they were living.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para14">On the basis of a comparison of those needs, Shelter estimated that the additional annual cost to the public purse associated with temporary accommodation is about &#163;500 million. That includes not only housing benefit expenditure and take-up of income support, but the result of missed school, additional take-up of sickness benefit and additional visits to GPs.The cost is huge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para15">Against that background Brent council has introduced Locata, which is a choice-based letting system. There are four bands in the Locata system&#151;A to D, defining a homeseeker&#039;s priority. Locata, not the local authority, manages the allocation of property for each homeseeker. There are five steps to inclusion on the Locata scheme. First, one must become a member, which is automatic for local authority tenants and homeseekers. Once someone is a member, they are given a number defining their banding and their priority date&#151;the date that they registered. They then check a fortnightly &quot;freesheet&quot; that lists properties. Those must be picked up from libraries, but for a small fee they can be sent out. They are free to the infirm.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para16">Members can bid for any property for which they are eligible. The sheet is issued every other Friday and bids must be received by the following Wednesday. Bids can be sent by coupon for the cost of a stamp, by text for the cost of a text, by telephone at 25p per minute, or on the web, which is the cost of a dial-up&#151;so tenants now pay to be rehoused.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para17">Locata allocates the bids in priority order, and puts them on a shortlist that goes to the landlord. Therefore, if lots of band C members bid for a property, the one 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 421WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
with the most points&#151;based on the usual criteria of waiting time and overcrowding&#151;wins. The successful bidder is told that they have won; others have to look at subsequent &quot;freesheets&quot; to find out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para18">In this week&#039;s &quot;freesheet&quot; there are 29 non-sheltered accommodation properties available for Brent residents: two studio flats, 13 one-bed flats, 10 two-bed flats, one three-bed house and three four-bed homes. Hon. Members may recall that earlier in my speech I gave the number of people who were waiting to be transferred&#151;just over 19,000. That housing will not go very far.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para19">The housing stock in north-west London has not increased by virtue of the system; there is still chronic need. Those who were considered a priority before and were thus almost the only ones who were likely to move, are still a higher priority and more eligible. However, they, rather than the local authority, now have to look actively for properties every week. If they do not bid, they will not get rehoused. No guidance is given to people on what properties they can realistically bid for. The only benefits of the system are that void properties can be let more quickly and that there is now no penalty for refusing a property. Other than that, the system is merely an elaborate scheme to change the way in which people are let down by the lack of housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para20">I am not against choice, but I am against lack of real choice and false choice&#151;the residents are led to believe that they have a choice and that they will get a new home through this system. They get a glossy magazine through the post and think, &quot;Great, look at all these properties I can bid for.&quot; Then, if they are a larger family, they find that there are no properties that they can bid for, and that the chances of their being rehoused are almost nil. That is not explained to people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para21">I spoke to Lorraine King from one of the local papers&#151;the<i> Willesden & Brent Chronicle&#151;</i>who sees many people in a similar situation to those whom I see. Such people are right at the end of the road; they have run out of options. She explained her frustration that people often cannot manage the system because they are disabled or because they cannot read. They do not realise that they are falling through the net.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para22">One option is to get more people into the private rented market, but there is a huge problem in persuading people to consider that. The reasons for that unwillingness are both cultural and pragmatic. Brent takes 34 days to process changes in circumstances for housing benefit; its tenants have the fourth longest wait in London. It also has the lowest percentage in London of new claims processed within 14 days. Many landlords, therefore, are not willing to work with the sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para23">Brent has a rental deposit scheme. That is good, but the loan under the scheme is only &#163;500. For a large family, that loan is not enough to get a new property&#151;it will not go very far. Brent also has a private housing unit, which holds people&#039;s hands, takes them through the system and tries to explain what it means to rent privately. However, all too often, when the introductions are made, the private landlords say, &quot;No, I won&#039;t take you on housing benefit&quot;, despite the fact that they are on the list for the council. We need to do much more to encourage people to rent privately. A 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 422WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
better loan system is needed, but housing benefit must also be processed much more quickly, and more action must be taken to tackle unscrupulous landlords.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para24">Many of the provisions introduced by and accepted when considering the Housing Bill are welcome. I was disappointed, however, that licensing was not extended to include two-storey properties. There are many bedsits in my constituency that fall into that category.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para25">The real problem is lack of supply. Brent has one of the highest rates of empty properties in London, at 5.4 per cent. of private sector and 3.7 per cent. of public sector dwellings. I was pleased that some of the Liberal Democrats&#039; recommendations were incorporated into the Housing Bill, such as provision for empty property management orders. We would also require local authorities to maintain a register of empty properties in their area, and Whitehall departments to audit their properties annually and report on that to Select Committees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para26">However, we also need more houses to be built. The Mayor&#039;s office estimated that 23,000 homes needed to be built in London annually, and that 10,000 of which should be affordable. I know that money has been invested in the decent homes initiative and into the new deal in my constituency, but neither of those initiatives tackles the problem of supply. They improve the quality, but not the total supply. That is the most important issue. We need to examine other areas for building.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para27">Finally, I ask the Government to make public what land is publicly owned and underused. I ask the Minister to consider making Brent a pilot project&#151;to survey all public sector holdings, be they in education, the NHS, local authority or ex-publicly owned, so that they could be made available either to sell off, ploughing the receipts back into social and affordable housing, or so that money for affordable housing could be gained through section 106 agreements. It is no good Departments sitting on publicly owned land and speculating about its future land value. The crisis affecting my constituents is here and now and needs an urgent solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para28">The costs of the crisis are felt elsewhere in the public sector. I refer to high rents for temporary accommodation, and to mental and physical health problems. A decision to make the existence of the land public knowledge and to sell it off would require leadership, but that is no more than my constituents deserve.
</p>



<a name="41026h05_time1"><h5>4.15 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41026h05_spnew1"><b> Paul Clark  (Gillingham)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) on securing this debate on what is undoubtedly an important issue not only to her constituents but to all of us where there are the pressures and the combination of factors that she described. She explained how they come together in particularly large numbers in Brent, East, and I shall come to that in a moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para29">The long-term solution to the problem is to increase supply. The hon. Lady will be well aware that the sustainable communities ethos of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is about providing increased supply where we need it; about quality, better use of land, and design to a decent standard where there are pressures such as in Brent, East; and about bringing 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
areas of low demand and abandonment back into use and making them more attractive. As with many of these issues, as I am sure she is aware, there is no single straightforward solution to all the problems that we face throughout the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para30">I shall now deal specifically with Brent. The hon. Lady knows well that it is ethnically a very diverse borough of London. In fact, it is one of only two boroughs where the ethnic minority groups together make up the majority in the area. That diversity is having a positive effect on community cohesion and regeneration in Brent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para31">I am well aware of the hon. Lady&#039;s history of raising issues such as house prices, empty homes in her constituency and the waiting list for housing, which she graphically described today. The Government share those concerns and are committed not only to reducing significantly the number of those in temporary accommodation but to raising the standard of homes, because that is the other side of the coin. We must not only increase the supply of additional properties but consider those properties that already exist. If I am correct, some 29 per cent. of dwellings in Brent, East are termed unsuitable for accommodation. Clearly, that situation is not acceptable, and some of the projects to which the hon. Lady referred are helping to address it. Indeed, much of the money going into her constituency and Brent as a whole is focused on housing issues rather than other matters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para32">The Brent housing partnership, the arm&#039;s-length management organisation, is one of only six in the country to have been rated as excellent by the Audit Commission. That partnership has been awarded &#163;68 million for the period from 2003 to 2007 to improve housing stock, and is on course to meet the decent homes target. I am sure that the hon. Lady is aware that when the Government came to office seven years ago, there was a &#163;19 billion backlog in repairs and refurbishments required of the housing stock. We set a target, which is to have those completed by 2010, and we are well on the way to meeting it. Equally, Brent is well on the way to achieving its decent homes standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para33">As the hon. Lady said, we have begun to spend substantial sums in Brent, but we recognise that spending is not the only requirement. We are talking about a population of more than 250,000 living in approximately 104,000 households. The majority of those dwellings&#151;63 per cent.&#151;are owner-occupied, 13 per cent. are privately rented,12 per cent. have registered social landlords, and only 10 per cent. are directly managed by Brent council. A number of wards in Brent, such as Brentwater, Wembley Central, Sudbury and Preston are in the top 5 per cent. of the most housing-deprived wards in the country. The housing in those wards is predominantly owner-occupied. It is estimated that to bring all non-local authority housing up to standard would cost some &#163;7.7 billion. That is an indication of the size of the problem that faces those of us concerned with housing and living conditions across the country.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para34">Other issues complicate the situation in Brent. For example, a large number of families require units of three or more bedrooms. That is an added factor that is different from the norm that we might find elsewhere.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h05_spnew2"><b> Sarah Teather </b> : That point in particular is a grave concern, because many families of Asian background tend to be larger. There is a sense that the lack of larger properties discriminates against larger families of Asian origin.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h05_spnew3"><b> Paul Clark </b> : The hon. Lady makes a valid point. The ethnicity of the area of Brent is beginning to help find some solutions. As I was going on to say, Brent council, along with its partners, has made housing and regeneration a policy and is good at forming partnerships with all sectors. That is fundamentally important, because if we are to meet needs in areas such as the hon. Lady&#039;s constituency, we need lasting sustainable solutions that come about not only in conjunction with local authorities and national Government, but with the constituent parts in a given area, such as the community with all its different facets. That is how to start addressing the specific problems of a given area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para35">One of the major leaders for regeneration in Brent is the local strategic partnership, &quot;Partners for Brent.&quot; It has been allocated some &#163;9.5 million-worth of neighbourhood renewal funding for the areas of St. Raphael&#039;s, Stonebridge, Harlesden, Church End and Roundwood. It has also determined that regeneration of Wembley associated with the national stadium should deliver housing supply for Brent. When I looked through the Brent regeneration action plan for 2004 to 2006, I noted that it stated that the regeneration at Wembley must deliver for local people as well as providing a national stadium.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para36">The hon. Lady raised the issues of unemployment, jobs, skills and so on. We must address those issues through skills training for the jobs that exist and for new jobs to come. I recently attended a launch of a skills audit for my area, which examined where there are skills gaps, how we can plug them, and what we need to do to deliver training and support for local people. The Brent regeneration action plan also raises that point. That will help in the cycle of welfare and good living as well as in housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para37">Another example of where moneys are going to start addressing the housing problems that the hon. Lady referred to is the housing action trust, which is based on the single neighbourhood that makes up Carlton ward. It involves the complete demolition of the Stonebridge estate and the provision of about 1,500 new homes, together with residual land for additional homes. That comprehensive programme of community development shows that the Government take seriously the concerns that have been raised in this debate.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h05_spnew4"><b> Sarah Teather </b> : I should make the Minister aware that none of the areas that he has so far described are in my constituency; Wembley, Stonebridge and Harlesden are all outside it. However, that is not to say that the change will not have a knock-on effect on supply in Brent as a whole. The point about the new deal for communities and the regeneration work that is taking place, particularly in south Kilburn, is that there will be no net 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 425WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
increase in social housing units. However, there will be no net loss, which is a tribute to the work of that new deal.
</p>




<p><a name="41026h05_spnew5"><b> Paul Clark </b> : I thank the hon. Lady for that comment. People&#039;s housing demands and needs do not just reflect the arbitrary boundaries of the parliamentary constituencies that are drawn up by the boundary commission. One must consider the matter holistically, as I am sure she is aware.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para38">Equally, the issue is not just about building new units. As I said at the outset, in the long-term, the goal is to increase supply, which may not be directly available in the hon. Lady&#039;s constituency. Certain sites may be coming&#151;I am aware that some have been flagged up as possibilities&#151;but the problem is getting together the mix to make things work. The aim is also to bring the nearly 30 per cent. of the existing housing stock up to a decent standard, so that those who live in it can have a standard that is acceptable for the 21st century.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para39">On the housing action trust, we have also committed another &#163;165 million over 10 years. Through that trust, additional homes will, I understand, come through. The process will involve removing the existing homes but rebuilding and providing refurbished homes for the secure tenants by 2007, and will also bring on stream some additional properties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para40">The hon. Lady referred to the new deal for communities in south Kilburn, where &#163;50 million has been allocated over 10 years. The residents there identified housing as their key priority at the outset of the programme. They are on the cusp of an exciting programme that will turn what I understand to be one housing estate back into four high-quality 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>26 Oct 2004 : Column 426WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
neighbourhoods, each with its own character and facilities. Some 1,500 of the existing properties will be demolished and rebuilt, an additional 1,400 homes will be provided for private sale and 775 existing homes will be retained and refurbished. That will go some way to address some of the concerns that have been raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para41">We are well aware that 73 per cent. of households in south Kilburn live in council-rented accommodation. That is why the bulk of the funding is targeted at housing projects. Not only are we putting in a substantial amount of money, but the introduction of other money will lead to a total of &#163;630 million being given to the project. That is important to get things moving.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para42">The hon. Lady referred to a number of other issues. I am pleased that she welcomes the developments in the Housing Bill, and she is right about the empty property management orders, which hopefully will be on the statute book before the end of this year. On overcrowding, the new housing health and safety rating system should help, with a fitness standard for housing, as should the licensing of houses in multiple occupation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026h05_para43">Those are just some of the initiatives and moneys that are going in. We recognise the frustration that families and communities in the hon. Lady&#039;s constituency suffer, as we do for other parts of the country. The investment in housing is high on the political agenda and the hon. Lady recognises that. We are putting money into the areas where it is most needed. Brent, East is one of those areas, as is Brent itself. We continue to monitor, to see that that money is used well and effectively for the benefit of her constituents.
