 I know that it is customary to praise the occupant of the Chair at such moments as these, Mr Howarth, but I am very pleased indeed that you are presiding over this debate on such a critical issue. My aim in calling for the debate is to hold the Government to account for their unannounced refusal earlier this month to sign the International Labour Organisation convention on domestic workers.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">“domestic work continues to be undervalued and invisible and is mainly carried out by women and girls, many of whom are migrants or members of disadvantaged communities and who are particularly vulnerable to discrimination in respect of conditions of employment and of work, and to other abuses of human rights”.</p>

               <a name="11062959000012"> It is for that reason that there have been international efforts over some years to produce a convention that covers basic human and workplace rights for people all over the world who work in other people’s homes as cleaners or cooks, or do other kinds of domestic work. The convention will entitle them to the basic labour standards that we expect for all workers.</p>

Some Members might feel that we did that yesterday in the House, but it is a regular occurrence for people in these circumstances.</p>

Let us see what company we  were in: the Governments of El Salvador, Panama, the Czech Republic, Sudan, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Swaziland did not vote in favour. All other 173 Governments voted in favour of the convention, including the USA and China. All the worker representatives voted in favour, as did many employer representatives. It looks to me as if, in that list of shame—I do regard it as such—the UK is the country that is probably on its own in having a record of receiving rather than generating victims of human trafficking, a problem that is so rife in this sector. We should be especially ashamed of that.</p>

            <p>issue is a very important human rights one. I have heard some excuses already. The UK Government representative at the ILO conference gave the following explanation:</p>

            <a name="11062959000389"> 
            <p class="tabletext">“The United Kingdom already provides comprehensive employment and social protection to domestic workers; however, the strength of our general provisions means that it is occasionally inappropriate to treat domestic workers identically and, sadly, the Convention does not recognize this. For example, we do not consider it appropriate or practical to extend criminal, health and safety laws, including inspections, to private households employing domestic workers. It would be difficult, for instance, to hold elderly individuals employing carers to the same standards as large companies. Accordingly, the United Kingdom will be unable to ratify this Convention in the foreseeable future.”</p>

Local inspectors, if they engage with a company—I have worked for many small companies and have never been inspected by a health and safety inspector—usually offer advice notes before proceeding to criminal prosecution, unless there has been a death or a very serious injury, for example. Perhaps the Minister will therefore give specific examples of when small employers who are suspected not of putting customers’ health at risk—I accept that there are criminal prosecutions in such cases—but of putting employees at risk, have been subject to criminal prosecution and active investigation without prior advice, unless there has been a fatality or a serious injury. I do not believe that there is the rash of examples of heavy-handed health and safety implementation that the Minister implied in his letter.</p>

 To my surprise, when I conclude my remarks, I am going to read a quote from the Centre for Social Justice. That is not normally a place to which I look for guidance, but when it launched its inquiry into human trafficking its director said that it was critical that all the sectors—the Government, voluntary organisations, employers and employees—worked together on a coherent strategy to deal with this modern-day form of slavery. My contention is that the Government’s position is confused—if I am kind—or actively malevolent —if I am not—and that it is not working coherently to deal with this serious and substantial human rights problem in the UK.</p>

               <a name="11062959000027"> Removing the right for migrant domestic workers to change employer means a return to bonded labour. The visa has been recognised as the main form of protection for this group of workers, who, as has been recognised by the international convention, are especially vulnerable to severe exploitation, including slavery and trafficking for domestic servitude. Indeed, the 2009 report of the Home Affairs Committee included the statement:</p>

Removing the visa altogether will increase both trafficking via illegal routes and unlawful working, which will leave these workers believing that they are unable to contact the authorities for assistance and with fewer, if any, enforceable rights. Limiting the length of the visa makes it likely that unscrupulous employers will keep workers working for them beyond the length of the visa, again without any recourse to meaningful legal protection against severe exploitation.</p>

It is the most effective group that represents migrant domestic workers. I have known its work since about a quarter of a century ago, when it helped illegal entrants to the UK who did not know that they were illegal entrants. Together with others who work with victims of trafficking, it has produced a report that shows how ineffective the measures we already have are in practice for all victims.</p>

Workers who do not benefit from those protections, particularly domestic workers who enter the UK accompanying diplomats, are more likely to be in slavery than those who work in private households. Kalayaan’s figures show that seven in every 100 of the diplomatic workers they have seen were trafficked, compared with one in 1,000 migrant domestic workers in private households. That shows how effective the visa is.</p>

Three quarters of them worked on call and had to be available 24 hours a day. More than half of them worked 16 or more hours a day, and 70% received a salary of £50 or less a week.

 Signing the convention would make a difference in three ways. The first is the signal it would send to traffickers, who will otherwise believe, no doubt, that the UK is joining their infamous gang and saying that this country is open to human trafficking. We know how extensive human trafficking is in the UK and that it is more profitable than drug dealing. It is the most profitable activity for organised crime, although the field of human trafficking is unorganised as well as organised, because people as well as agencies supply domestic workers. Moreover, individual families bring domestic workers with them. It is, therefore, important that Britain sends out a signal that we are closed to that kind of abuse.</p>

               <a name="11062959000035"> Secondly, the victims themselves would also get a signal. People who work with victims of trafficking have told me that those victims believe that they have no recourse to help and that the clear signal is that they are dependent on their owners/employers, who usually retain their passports. They do not believe that anyone can help them. They are frightened of approaching the police and, frankly, our national referral mechanism is an incompetent way for them to get help.</p>

Our laws apparently say, and we claim at international events, that we have fantastic working hours and protection and so on. However, 67% of the migrant domestic workers who approached Kalayaan said that they did not have any time off, were working seven days a week and worked on call for 24 hours a day, and more than half of them worked for 16 or more hours a day.

About half of those who approached Kalayaan did not have their own room and had to sleep on the floor. We do not expect to see those sorts of working conditions in Britain in the 21st century. Two thirds of them were not allowed out unaccompanied, and two thirds had their passport withheld. That is unlawful. I know of no prosecution, except in cases in which someone has succeeded in being declared as having been trafficked, but that applies to only a tiny minority of these poor victims.

It suggested that our aim was not in any way to improve conditions for these vulnerable workers. Apparently, the UK often led European Union amendments to attempt to dilute the convention in areas such as working hours and occupational safety and health. I have described the working hours that migrant domestic workers frequently face. Will the Minister tell us what working hours he thinks are reasonable for workers in people’s homes?

Indeed, the Government intend not to ratify the convention and will not even vote for it, citing apparent conflicts with EU regulations.

 That organisation should be better at dealing with the issue, but I am not sure that it is easy to do so properly at borders. That is one of the challenges. There needs to be an in-country resource to which vulnerable trafficked people know they can turn for help. Their fear is that if they turn to the authorities for help, they will be outed. Unfortunately, that happens too often as those concerned are classed as illegal. For many people, that is through no fault of their own. They are here without status and they are illegal because their owner—we must not forget that we are talking about a kind of ownership and slavery—has retained their passport unlawfully and has said, “Don’t worry, I’ll sort this out,” and so on.</p>

There is a laborious tick-box process and, because there is no real prospect of prosecuting someone for trafficking and getting a conviction, often the national referral mechanism will suggest that a person is not really trafficked.

I had the privilege of speaking to a Nepali trade unionist who talked about how she had organised domestic workers in Nepal. Frankly, if someone can organise domestic workers in Nepal, they must be a genius organiser. It was wonderful to hear about their work in connecting to this vulnerable group of people.

We believe that whilst there is much good work going on in the UK to confront slavery, much of it led by the voluntary sector, there is a need for a strategic overview to detail how this hidden criminal activity can be defeated once and for all. For instance, it is essential that all government departments, the voluntary sector, the police and local authorities move in the same direction in order for the UK’s response to be appropriate and effective…One slave in this country is one too many, and it is time for the UK to take a lead again.

Member for Slough did not mention, and the reason that I have come to speak in this debate today, are people such as child minders, carers, housekeepers, cleaners and nurses who work for many of our frail and elderly constituents. The worry is that the imposition of criminal health and safety law in people’s private homes could mean that some of our frail and elderly constituents could be forced out of their homes and into residential care. All I would say to hon. Members is that they can come here and share my passion, and the passion of the hon. Lady, against the evils of human trafficking—we are as one in this Chamber on that issue. If she looks closely, however, at the text of the convention and its implications, inspectors could come into our constituents’ private homes, examine the rooms, gadgets and layout of the house, and perhaps tell a frail, elderly lady that her home is not fit to have a carer. That lady could be forced to move into a residential home.</p>

There could be unintended consequences. I will press the Minister to ensure that we enforce the convention—we can do this ourselves, we do not need to sign all parts of it—where we think that it is right, and where we think it bears down properly and legitimately on unscrupulous employers.

In terms of treatment in the home in which they are working, fewer than a third received sick pay, with the majority forced to work when they were unwell, and a third of them were injured in that workplace, their employer’s home.</p>

She and the other worker representatives hoped that our Government would accept their responsibilities, as had, she said, virtually all the other employer and governmental representatives.

We are in a sorry minority of those failing to accept their responsibilities. We are talking about desperate circumstances facing good women, of whom I have met many over the years. I remember a particular meeting, with 30 of them. They were people with bright eyes and hope on their faces, who had come here often to support their families or villages back home. They thought that coming to and working in this country would be a brave new world, but they came here and were treated utterly shamefully. This Government and this House should be on the side of such people. What this Government have done is to abrogate completely their moral responsibility.</p>

Nevertheless, the Government decision on the ILO convention has significant consequences which will reverberate across the globe. It is significant because of what is being said to some of the most vulnerable people throughout the world as well as to potential traffickers. It leaves a stain on Britain’s reputation as an advocate of basic human rights, casting a cloud over our democratic values.</p>

By abstaining from voting on the ILO convention on domestic workers, Britain has lined itself up alongside countries where workers’ rights are routinely infringed. Press reports state that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills does not intend to ratify the convention “for  the foreseeable future”, ruling out the application of the convention to British workers.</p>

               <a name="11062959000089"> The decision to abstain has two damaging effects. First, it will leave domestic workers in the UK, namely nannies, cooks, cleaners and the like, vulnerable to the risks prevalent for them. Secondly, it will undermine the UK’s standing and moral leadership on the international stage. For countries whose citizens, including domestic workers, have far fewer legal protections, Britain has abdicated its position as their champion. By neglecting their duty in this matter, the UK Government have tarnished their international reputation. People would be astonished to learn that workers who live with their employers in the UK and are treated as family are not covered by the working time or health and safety legislation, and are not entitled to the minimum wage. In fact, the ILO convention would have extended to those in domestic employment only very basic labour rights that are available to all workers—rights such as reasonable hours of work, weekly rest of at least 24 consecutive hours, a limit on in-kind payments, clear information on terms and conditions of employment, and some of the most basic rights of workers, including freedom of association, and the right to collective bargaining. Those are not extreme demands; they are moderate requirements.</p>

Domestic workers are often hidden behind closed doors, so they are all too often unregistered, and that higher estimate may be conservative. The ILO’s Director-General, Juan Somavia, said:</p>

Some are effectively prisoners in the homes where they work, and rely on their work for their home, shelter, food and livelihood.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) on securing the debate. She has a long track record of vigorous campaigning on this and related issues. She has explained the reason for the debate: to call the Government to account for their decision to abstain on the vote a fortnight ago on the International Labour Organisation’s convention on domestic workers. Detailed preparation of the ILO’s landmark convention continued for some time—indeed, since last year—with opportunities for countries to contribute to the work in progress in readiness for the vote on the convention at this year’s ILO international labour conference in Geneva some two weeks ago on 16 June.</p>

               <a name="11062959000103"> Many people were taken aback to discover that although 173 Governments voted for the convention and only one, the Swaziland Government, voted against, the UK was one of eight countries that abstained from voting for the ILO’s convention on domestic workers. It is even more surprising that given the recent media reports about abuses in other countries and inexcusable treatment of domestic workers, the UK has, in abstaining, aligned itself with El Salvador, Malaysia, Panama, Singapore, Thailand, the Czech Republic and Sudan. The USA Government voted for the convention, and with the exception of the Czech Republic all EU countries voted for it. As we know from our previous discussions on the European working time directive, there is a plethora of different opt-out arrangements in many EU countries, but that has not prevented them from signing up.</p>

When trying to help and protect them, they are often among some of the hardest to reach, particularly if they have recently arrived from abroad, live in, and have little knowledge of where to find help. Since 1998, following legislation by the then Labour Government, the UK has offered the overseas domestic worker visa, which provides workers with the possibility of independence from their employers. Will the Minister tell the Chamber what plans the Government have for the future of the overseas domestic worker visa, and whether there is any truth in the suggestion that they are looking to scrap it? I remind the Minister that the visa was introduced in 1998 with cross-party support, and that scrapping it would be a backwards step.</p>

Friend the Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden), then the Minister responsible for employment relations, set up and chaired a fair employment enforcement board. Campaigns were run to raise awareness of employment rights and encourage the reporting of abuses. Some £6 million of extra funding was provided to supply information about workers’ rights. As the hon. Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) suggested, that educational role is important and we must get information about workers’ rights to the relevant people. That campaign included outreach work using buses, but nevertheless, domestic workers are particularly difficult to reach, and both the carrot and the stick are important. We need education, but also the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004, the temporary and agency workers directive, and now, the domestic workers convention.</p>

Before the meeting in Geneva, the UK Government expressed concerns about three areas of the draft text: first, the articles covering working time; secondly, the potential application of health and safety regulations to private dwellings where domestic workers are employed; and thirdly, those sections of the convention that call for greater regulation of private employment agencies.</p>

For example, article 10 states:</p>
            <a name="110629h0001.htm_brev17"> 
            <a name="11062959000404">

In other words, as would be expected for an agreement that is prepared for endorsement by countries across the globe that have different laws and traditions, the convention allows countries to refer back to their own national laws and regulations. Legislation already in place for workers generally can be extended to domestic workers.</p>

Those are sensible and routine questions that every office should be able to answer appropriately. Exactly the same should be the case with domestic workers. We would not want people to work in circumstances that are not safe. We now have higher standards than we used to have—thank goodness; those standards have considerably reduced the number of accidents at work. The convention states that although what is appropriate in a home may be different from what is appropriate in a corporation, that does not mean that protection should not exist.</p>

 The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 does apply to domestic workers. The only exception relates to criminal legal sanctions. We know that in practice the Act is already enforced differently for small employers and large employers. Therefore, in response to the hon. Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), it would be perfectly proper for the Act to be imposed more lightly in a domestic workplace with only one worker than it would be in a big workplace with dangerous machinery and many workers. That is already the case in Britain. My view is that the Government are trumpeting an excuse.</p>

What has he done to find out what happens in other countries, so that we can learn from those models, look into the best ways of dealing with the matter—best practice—and achieve improvements in standards?</p>

By not supporting the convention, the Government are sending a bleak message to domestic workers not only in the UK, but throughout the world—perhaps 100 million people, who in some countries constitute up to 12% of the work force. The UK still commands considerable respect in the world, but  at a time when the convention has been supported by 173 countries, including the US and almost all of the EU bloc, the Government seem to be suggesting that they will not stand up for the idea of extending to domestic workers the same basic rights as those enjoyed by workers throughout the economy. That is sending a very gloomy message to the world.</p>

If we are not yet in a position to meet all the demands of the convention, surely it would be an aspiration to work towards and we should look towards ratifying it. Will the Minister explain why the Government have chosen to put us in an extremely embarrassing position in the world by not signing up, sending out a very negative message to workers both in this country and abroad?</p>

 I have to tell the hon. Lady that domestic workers are excluded from part I of the Act, which covers health, safety and welfare in connection with work and the control of things such as dangerous substances, and which includes some general duties. There are protections under civil law, and I will come to them in a second, but I am afraid that signing the convention would have meant extending the Act to private households employing domestic workers.</p>

Hon. Members might ask what is wrong with that, but they should consider the implications. The Act would place specific duties on such employers to ensure the health, safety and welfare of domestic workers in so far as that was reasonably practicable, and individual householders would have to familiarise themselves with the law. According to the Act, they would need to consider the information, training, instruction and supervision that their helper needed. They would need to assess the helper’s tasks and any risks from equipment and substances to which the helper might be exposed. The householder would also have to carry out a wide range of risk assessments, which would be different for each home.</p>

I think they would have supported the convention, but it no doubt had some burdensome implications in domestic law. The previous Government also abstained in the 2006 vote on the ILO’s recommendations on employment relationships. That was probably not because they were against the principles, but because they realised that the provisions would have an impact on UK legislation. In other words, we are taking exactly the same approach as the previous Government.</p>

Members should consider the Department for International Development’s funding for the Salvation Army anti-child trafficking project in Malawi or its new programme aimed at reducing human trafficking in south Asia, which focuses on helping women and girl domestic workers and garment sector workers. Members should also consider our support for other Governments’ anti-trafficking efforts, such as the Bangladesh police reform project, which established a specialised police unit to combat human trafficking.

               <b>Rachel Reeves (Leeds West) (Lab):</b>
 I am pleased to have secured this debate, which means an awful lot  to my constituency. The prospects for Kirkstall Forge are hugely important to local residents, who have been waiting a long time for them to advance. My predecessor worked hard on the issue, and I too have devoted a lot of time to it as the Member of Parliament for Leeds West. It would be reassuring to hear some answers about the future of Kirkstall Forge today.</p>

               <a name="11062959000181"> If you will indulge me slightly, Mr Howarth, I want to explain some of the history of the site, which gives an important context to the issues I want to raise. The site lies between the A65 and the river Aire, one of the major routes in and out of Leeds. The A65 runs along the valley floor, past the remains of the Cistercian abbey. Hon. Members may have seen the production “Frankenstein’s Wedding” that took place there, on the BBC recently. It is one of the best preserved abbeys in the country, and as well as playing host to fictional weddings it is the home of an annual festival, which will take place next week, live concerts, plays and, recently, a farmers market.</p>

               <a name="11062959000182"> The monks of the abbey commenced work on the site of the forge more than 800 years ago, and until its closure at the turn of the century it could lay claim to being the longest operating forge in the country. The monks powered their forge through a mill race diverted from the river, which remains today. More recently the forge was turned to heavy industrial use, seizing the opportunities of first rail and then road transport to manufacture axles for trains and motor vehicles. The forge employed an army of workers, who were housed in Hawksworth wood, just up the hill from the site. Its economic success depended on a stop on a railway line at the forge site.</p>

               <a name="11062959000183"> Now that has all gone. The high wall that once hid a hive of activity is now a barrier between the community and derelict space. Since the forge closed it has been purchased by a developer, laying the groundwork for a major project that could mean the forge being brought back into the heart of the Kirkstall community. The plans for Kirskstall Forge are exciting. They offer the prospect of more than 2,000 jobs and more than 1,000 new homes—regeneration for an area much in need of investment. Crucially, however, they also offer improved sustainable transport into Leeds city centre in the east and Bradford to the west, because a new station is integral to the plans. That is why this debate falls within the remit of the Department for Transport.</p>

When decisions were made about investment in major transport projects in October, there were three categories: supported projects, unsupported projects and a rather more ambiguous development pool in the middle.

               <a name="11062959000190"> First and foremost among the scheme’s benefits are its transport benefits. The forge site used to depend on a rail halt to distribute axles around the country. Now, the development that is planned depends on a rapid link into Leeds city centre, and to Bradford. The construction of a station at that point would offer journeys of five minutes into Leeds city centre, a vast improvement on the prospects when travelling by bus or car on the busy A65, which can take as long as 30 minutes, as I know well. The new station would be linked to both Kirkstall and Bramley, and would encourage more sustainable transport for both those communities. Does the Minister agree that we should be encouraging a shift away from cars, particularly in busy urban areas where traffic jams are a common problem, with big environmental, business and economic costs?</p>

It would lever in £350 million of investment in the area, and support 2,400 jobs, in construction and then on site permanently in offices, shops and leisure venues. That is hugely important to  an area that has for a long time missed out. Average earnings in my constituency are £18,000—two thirds of the national average—and unemployment stands substantially above the national average.

At programme entry, the developer had pledged £4 million towards the overall £23 million cost of the Leeds rail growth package. That in itself is a considerable investment on top of the wider investment in the Kirkstall Forge site. The funding requested from the Department for Transport will have fallen by more than 30% since the development pool was initiated, and the station will now cost the Department between £12.3 million and £12.9 million. The local contribution will be over £5.5 million, or more than 25% of the total cost of the project, reflecting an additional £2.6 million investment, subject to agreement.</p>

               <a name="11062959000214"> The hon. Lady asked specifically about the shift from the car. The Department recognises, first, that we have to use transport to drive economic growth. Secondly, however, we have a responsibility to use transport in a way that reduces carbon emissions. We are certainly keen to secure a reduction in carbon emissions, and that could mean a modal shift from car to rail, particularly until the road transport network has been decarbonised, which is some way off.</p>

Nevertheless, that cannot fund all the schemes from the previous regional funding allocations process that promoters wished to deliver, and we will need to rationalise. Put simply, we inherited a completely unrealistic pipeline of schemes, and we have had to rationalise those as best we can. For the future, we want to move away from a top-down approach to determining local transport needs, working towards a more devolved system for funding local authority major schemes, with local enterprise partnerships taking on an important role. However, for this spending review, we need to rationalise the previous Government’s programme, so we have invited final bids from the promoters of 45 schemes from the previous programme. The Leeds rail growth package is one such scheme, and we believe it will now consist of new stations for both Kirkstall Forge and Apperley Bridge. Metro will submit  <br/>

It is for Metro to discuss with Northern train operating company and Network Rail how those calls are to be accommodated within the timetable, given that the additional stops will increase end-to-end journey times by about four minutes in each direction. The good news is that we have recently agreed to fund the provision of additional carriages on the electrified routes to the north-west of Leeds, so Metro and Northern are now in a better position to determine whether further rolling stock will be required to enable the calls to be made.</p>

The Secretary of State recently published a new transport business case appraisal system, which was announced to Parliament through a written ministerial statement. The hon. Lady may want to get a copy of that. She will be able to see the factors we now take into account to determine transport projects. Broadly speaking, the changes made to the valuation process have increased the value of carbon, so, on the face of it, they marginally benefit public transport schemes and marginally disbenefit road schemes.</p>

The deadline for all bids is September, and obviously we will not be able to make a judgment until they all come in. I reiterate that private contributions are important.

As well as the aggregate externalities and economic benefits that would come from the development, will the Department look at the importance of economic regeneration and how the returns in areas such as Kirkstall or Bramley might benefit some of the most deprived communities when compared with developments in areas where there are already good jobs and low levels of unemployment?</p>

Norman Baker: As a Government, we recognise the need to support areas where there is economic deprivation. If we applied a simple economic test to everything, there would frankly be a lot of investment in south-east England, because it has a very good rate of return, and not a lot elsewhere. We do not do that. We try to ensure that we take into account a wide range of factors and ensure a modal balance of transport investment, as well as a regional balance. The hon.

In recent winters, when the weather has been cold, that base load lifted to 50% of the supply generated by coal. That emphasises not only how dependent we are on coal, but how flexible it is, responding to the requirements of the British public. On a cold Christmas day when everyone is trying to cook their turkey at the same time, we need a great deal of flexibility in the supply chain to be able to respond. I want to touch later on the fact that, unfortunately, the wind does not blow harder on Christmas day than on any other day of the year. We need that flexibility to respond to demand.</p>

            <p>world demand for coal-fired generation will increase by 70% in the period up to 2030. China is currently constructing the equivalent of two 500 MW coal-fired power stations a week, a capacity comparable to the entire UK power grid each year. Those figures are quite pertinent and put in perspective where the UK fits into a global generation market. About a third of UK electricity is generated from coal but it currently emits more CO2 per unit of electricity than all other forms of generation. That is something we need to address.</p>

By 2016, it is expected to face a shortfall of 32 GW, as older coal, nuclear and oil plant is closed down, as demand rises. That is crucial and key to the debate today. Government policy is currently to introduce a floor price for carbon. Many of the coal-fired generators recognise that that is going to put enormous pressure to be economic on their business. In the medium to short term, it will not be possible to secure nuclear power stations that deliver the energy that we require. Generators that produce power via coal are working their units very hard to secure as much return on their investment as possible. There will be a period when our ability to generate power will be short, and the Government need to look long and hard at how we will close that gap.</p>

We are not prone to outages, and coal is not vulnerable to geopolitical risk. Coal generates about 40% of the world’s electricity, with about 10% each for gas and nuclear. Coal burned by major electricity generators, which account for 80% of total coal use, was up 3% in 2005. Coal burned in UK power stations was 23% higher in the third quarter of 2006 than in the same period in 2005. Coal demand is rising.

It basically works by mixing limestone with water, which is then sprayed into the power station chimneys through which the flue gases pass after the coal is burned. The sulphur in the flue gas reacts chemically with the injected spray and forms calcium sulphate, with only a small proportion of the sulphur being ejected into the atmosphere. The resultant slurry is then pumped away, dried and made into gypsum, which is beneficial to the power station and can be used to generate income for it.

Powerfuel is now constructing one of Britain’s first IGCC clean coal power stations in Yorkshire, again using British coal from an adjacent colliery.

The benefits of operating a super-critical power plant over a conventional plant are clear. Conventional boilers have an operating efficiency of about 30%, which means only 30% of the energy in the coal is converted into electricity with the rest being lost as heat. Super-critical boilers have efficiency levels of around 42% to 46%, so more energy is directed to turning the turbines to generate electricity and therefore less greenhouse gas is produced per kilowatt-hour. Improving the efficiency of boilers used in coal-fired power stations not only reduces CO2 emissions, because less coal is needed to generate the heat energy that turns the steam turbines, but it results in higher generator efficiencies in the provision of the electricity. The boilers are available commercially and can be retrofitted to existing coal-fired plants, which means no major retraining of staff, faster deployment and reduced capital costs with greater efficiency.

Typical construction costs for current coal-fired power station designs are in the region of £700,000 to £900,000 per megawatt. More advanced integrated gasification combined gas cycle plants cost between £900,000 and £1.3 million per megawatt, although lower capital costs of £750,000 to £900,000 per megawatt are predicted as technology moves forward and we become better at fitting it. The 2002 energy review by the performance and innovation unit put the costs of coal-fired power stations in the 3p to 3.5p per kilowatt-hour range by 2020.

The CO2 can then be disposed of in, for example, the emptying fields of the North sea, where it can consequently extend the life of those oil fields by applying pressure to an old and difficult-to-extract reserve, thereby prolonging production. I shall try to put that into layman’s terms. The gas is pumped into the hole where the oil is coming from, which assists in removing some of the oil, and stores the CO2 back underground, where the carbon was for millions of years. It is a three-step process, of capturing the CO2 from the power plant, transporting it—as my hon.

It could be argued that that is because a coal plant produces more, but coal is certainly cheaper per tonne than gas for CO2 emitted. Using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery can generate revenue that offsets the other costs of CCS. The cost of storing CO2 in aquifers is close to  £l per tonne, and the cost of storing it in oil and gas field plants ranges from £1 to £20 per tonne. Therefore, as well as being fairly reasonable, this method could generate income if we can get it right and make it work. Depleted oil and gas fields are the first sites to be considered for storage capacity because they are known to be equipped with infrastructure such as pipelines and platforms, and are almost ready to run now.</p>

The basic UCG process involves drilling two wells into the coal, one for the injection of oxidants and another—some distance away—for bringing the product gas to the surface. I acknowledge that the process involves a number of challenges, not least of which is whether once the process has been started it can be controlled, and there are also the impacts on subsidence above surface level, depending on what happens to the coal below ground. Nevertheless, we should consider using UCG for reserves under the sea. Cost estimates of UCG clean gas stand at £2.50 a gigajoule, whereas the current price of national gas is £6 a gigajoule.</p>

 It is true that we need to take a balanced view and ensure that we explore the new technologies. I think that tidal and wave power are great, and if they work they will contribute a small amount to this nation’s energy security. The important thing to note though is that it will be a small amount, because those technologies do not have a large enough share of the market. The number of areas where we could secure a tidal scheme—the Severn estuary is one example—is small, and there are no opportunities to generate enormous amounts of electricity via such schemes. I acknowledge that we need a mixed portfolio, but that works only if there is something there to pick up the base load. The crux of my argument is that the only methods that can be used to pick up the base load are nuclear power and coal-fired power stations, and we are not in a position to build nuclear power stations fast enough to plug the inevitable gap.</p>

The beauty of that fuel is that, once fired through a conventional gas turbine, the only emission is water vapour. Although cleaning up the existing plants is welcome, it will not have the impact that those who want to reduce our CO2 emissions significantly require, nor will it capture any CO2 for alternative income generation. Coal gasification is the only process that changes one form of energy—coal—into another flexible energy source—hydrogen—but without a clear Government energy policy, IGCC technology will not happen. To be viable, the new IGCC plants require the same allocation of CO2 allowances as existing coal plants, but at present they receive the allowances for a CCGT-fired—combined cycle gas turbine—power station.</p>

Member for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer) on wind power and explain why I feel that wind power is not adequate to support our needs. Fitting clean coal technology to the UK’s 16 power plants would cost an estimated £6 billion. In comparison, 2,000 wind turbines will be put up in the UK over the next six years at a cost of £9 billion. The Government’s renewable energy policy is currently over-dependent on wind energy. That imbalance is largely the result of the renewables obligation, which provides no clear boundary as regards the merits of various renewable technologies, so the cheapest option in terms of start-up costs—wind power—has been pursued, irrespective of its failures on grounds of unreliability and secure energy.</p>

            <p>power demand. That rarely occurs, but it does happen on occasion. Last year, Danish carbon emissions rose, because the Danish grid fell back on older fossil fuel generation to plug the gap left by underperforming wind farms. Danish power stations used 50% more coal than in 2005 to cover wind’s failings and wind turbines generated 21.7% of electricity, which is down from 29.4% in 2005. To put it in simple terms, when the wind does not blow, the turbines do not move and the power is not there. As the Danes have to have a stopgap base load, they use coal. Ironically, during that period, the use of fossil fuels rose, which demonstrates the frustrations with the system that we are pursuing.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman completely, but the situation is actually worse in Denmark. The Danes have stopped investing in wind, because it is too expensive and destabilises the grid.

               <a name="11062959000296"> If we are not careful, our leading position on carbon capture and development will be quickly lost, and we will be overtaken. America is putting a lot of money into carbon capture development, and China is doing the same. Indeed, it already has a project that is supported by Germany and others. We are at the tail end.</p>

The issue, however, is the timing as we move forward on carbon capture projects. The contract at Longannet has to be signed  by the end of the year, but the project will not take off until some years later. We also need to get the other three projects up and running. If we want to be at  the forefront, we must be able to develop our strategy quickly. I make a plea to the Minister to sign the contracts by September and to bring the other three projects online as soon as possible for the sake of everyone in this country.</p>

The bottom line is that we are here to protect and support the people we represent, and we are here to support industry and this country. The only way we will do that is by ensuring that our energy policy utilises everything we have. This is, therefore, an important debate, and I hope that the Minister takes it on board.</p>

When he has his discussions with the Scottish Government, will he ensure that they invest the same amount as us in the Longannet complex? If that fateful day ever happens and Scotland goes independent—I hope it never does—I would not like this country to be putting money into Longannet, when the Scottish Government are not putting a penny in. I would therefore like to hear what the Minister has to say about the Scottish Government putting money into that important project.</p>

            <p>this extremely important debate. A compelling case for coal has been made by hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber, and the debate is all the better for that.</p>

               <a name="11062959000303"> I fully endorse my hon. Friend’s comment that energy security is hugely important and that coal must play a major role in it. That said, I want to make a few points about the other opportunities for coal-fired power stations through reference to the Tilbury power station in my constituency.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_197"> 
               <a name="110629h0002.htm_para22"> 
               <a name="11062959000304"> Tilbury has been running for 50 years on its current site. Until March this year, it was a coal-fired power station, but thanks to investment by RWE npower, it is now becoming the world’s largest biomass-fired power station. That gives the opportunity of a new lease of life for some of our older coal-fired power stations, which will have to be decommissioned because of the EU directives. I therefore beg the indulgence of hon. Members today, while I give the story of Tilbury.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_198"> 
               <a name="110629h0002.htm_para23"> 
               <a name="11062959000305"> At its peak, Tilbury employed 750 people. Today it employs 250, in highly skilled jobs. It was facing closure in 2014, which would have left a big hole in the economy of Tilbury, which is quite a small town. The power station generates more than 1,000 MW—enough to power 1 million homes. It has never breached its environmental licence, in 50 years of operation. Looking at the debate from the point of view of climate change and environmentalism, it is worth bearing that in mind, particularly as the general manager tells me that when sulphur emissions in the locality have been measured at dangerous levels it is not because of the power station but, generally, when there is traffic congestion on the A13 and the M25. That raises the question whether we are looking at the right things, in our rush away from coal.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_199"> 
               <a name="110629h0002.htm_para24"> 
               <a name="11062959000306"> RWE npower, which runs the station, originally intended to construct a new cleaner coal power station at Tilbury and its plans were far advanced, but it had to reconsider the decision in November 2009. That was because of the cost, in the economic climate at the time, but also—and this reinforces the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood—because of the unclear regulatory status of investment in cleaner coal. It is important to lay the foundations to establish a clear regulatory picture so that companies are prepared to make the investment. Considerable amounts of money are involved.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_200"> 
               <a name="110629h0002.htm_para25"> 
               <a name="11062959000307"> Having decided not to go ahead with that plan, the company was still wedded to the site at Tilbury—it is a very responsible company and wanted to maintain the relationship. It decided to investigate the burning of wood pellets instead of coal. There was a lot of scratching of heads, but the management decided to have courage and invest money in trying it out. It was a great success.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_201"> 
               <a name="110629h0002.htm_para26"> 
               <a name="11062959000308"> In March this year the power station burned coal for the final time. I lament that, but what is happening now is very exciting. The company is converting the existing station to burn wood pellets for the remainder of the hours that will take it to 2014; it also intends to invest in creating a new biomass generator beside it. The new arrangement is not quite as efficient at generation as coal. In comparison to the previous figure of 1,000 MW, the wood pellet scheme reaches 750 MW, but it is still an efficient system and it will contribute massively to the national grid—much more than the wind turbines that we have been hearing about, in relation to investment.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak, Mr Howarth, and am aware of the time; I did not intend to speak. I congratulate the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer) on bringing this important matter before the House.</p>

               <a name="11062959000312"> I have two or three things to say. The policy of the Government—this was true of the previous Government as well—is based on two illusions. One is that what this country does, both in relation to carbon dioxide, and industrially, will affect anyone else in the world. It will not, and the hon. Member for Sherwood developed that argument with his statistics, and illustrated it effectively.</p>
            <p>

               <a name="11062959000313"> The second illusion is that there is a shortage of fossil fuels in the world. If we read what environmentalists say and look at what is happening, we can see that the real problem will be a huge surplus of fossil fuels in the world in the next 300 or 400 years, not just because of the figures on coal and oil, but because of the new source of shale gas that is being developed, which has already dropped the price of fuel in north America by up to 50%.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_206"> 
               <a name="110629h0002.htm_para31"> 
               <a name="11062959000314"> That is the background against which this country must consider energy policy. There must be a hierarchy of priorities in thinking about energy policy, and security of energy supply must be at the top. At the moment we are staring at the prospect of a huge problem in three or four years’ time. The Minister shakes his head, and he may or may not be in his post in three or four years’ time, but European obligations at the moment put an absolute limit on the amount of coal that can be burnt in our power stations. If we get another cold winter and they burn twice as much coal as they intended, those power stations will have to be switched off. There will be a gap before we can build new nuclear power stations. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr Hamilton), I spent most of my life opposed to nuclear power stations, but in the world we now live in, the facts, and my opinions, have changed.</p>

               <a name="11062959000315"> We must put the facts together. It will take shale gas some time to come on. Because of the dominance of Russia in the gas market, that is insecure. We know what is happening in the Arab world at the moment and we could be in for a real problem. Rather than putting vast subsidy into wind farms, which are likely to destabilise the national grid as they are put in, and to industrialise the countryside—not just because of the wind farms themselves, but because of the power lines, which will  <br/>

They are focused on what the Labour Government saw as priorities 10 to 15 years ago. The Government need to look objectively at the world and think about how to deal with the energy gap that will exist in four, five or six years’ time, and how to get the best value for money out of the investment we make in energy.</p>

Members have spoken about carbon capture and storage, which I shall mention later. I want to focus my remarks on how coal-fired power stations fit into Britain’s transition to a low-carbon future, and the integral role that clean coal has to play as we reconcile the competing demands of reducing the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, while ensuring that enough energy is generated.

               <a name="11062959000319"> It is clear that a low-carbon future will not be realised without some contribution from fossil fuels. The urgent challenge that we must overcome is how to ensure through the use of technological innovation that the fossil fuels that we use are cleaner. The UK must be a world leader in investment, research and development, infrastructure and planning across our energy portfolio; but the window of opportunity is closing. We have drifted from 2010 to 2011, still awaiting crucial decisions: from the re-banding of ROCs, to grid investment, to the detailed sign-off on the first CCS project.</p>

A quarter of the UK’s energy generating capacity will close by 2018, and as much as 30% will need to be replaced by 2020. Without prompt action, we face an electricity generation gap in the next 10 to 15 years as our nuclear and coal-powered stations are retired. World energy demand is rising and highly politicised. As North sea reserves decline, we are increasingly reliant on imported oil and gas, and UK electricity demand is forecast to double over the next 40 years.

We will need to create sufficient capacity to meet electricity generation needs at all times, and we will need to put the necessary supply chains in place. We will require the development of smart grid and electricity networks to meet the needs of a reconfigured, smart and diverse electricity infrastructure and, of course, investment in coal and gas infrastructure. All that does not come cheap. Depending on what we read, it could cost between £200 billion and £450 billion to achieve.

In fact, we have a duty to develop this technology, alongside our European neighbours, because with rising global use of electricity generated by coal, the downsides of delay are significant.</p>

Some calculations suggest that for every year that widespread global deployment of CCS is delayed after 2020, the long-term atmospheric stabilisation level of CO2 increases by one part per million. Therefore, if we delay by  more than a decade, the stabilisation of atmospheric concentrations of CO2 at lower levels becomes near impossible. According to the International Energy Agency, without CCS and if we were to rely on other technologies alone, the costs of tackling global CO2 emissions will rise by more than 70% each year. In simple monetary terms, it is a cost of $1.3 trillion annually by 2050.</p>

Will next month’s electricity White Paper identify the level at which the EPS will be set? What effect does he envisage the EPS having on the British coal industry? As the EPS applies only to new-build coal-fired power stations, is it the Minister’s intention that the carbon floor price will be the mechanism to incentivise a reduction in CO2 emissions from plants?</p>

 It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr Howarth. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer) on securing the debate and on the manner in which he introduced it. If there were any doubt about it, he has proved today that he is a very fine heir to the seat of Sherwood. The bipartisanship, expertise and understanding that he has shown on the coal industry and wider energy issues are certainly traits that Paddy Tipping and Andy Stewart had. I very much welcome the debate that he has instigated. It would also perhaps be appropriate to put on the record that the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) would normally reply to such a debate for the Opposition. He is understandably not here today because of family circumstances and our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family at a very difficult time.</p>

               <a name="11062959000342"> As I say, we have had an important and useful debate. There should be no doubt that we recognise that coal has been and will continue to be an integral part of our energy infrastructure. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood reminded us, coal makes up on average 35% of our electricity generation, but on a cold winter’s day that figure could readily be 50%. It is therefore vital to our energy security. As we have heard during the debate, coal is also the most carbon intensive form of electricity generation, producing around twice as much CO2 per unit of output compared with a gas-fired power station, together with other environmental pollutants. He put the issue in an international context and outlined the role that coal is likely to play internationally over many years to come.</p>

               <a name="11062959000343"> The imperative of tackling climate change means that we will need to decarbonise our electricity system. In the future, our energy supply will have to be diverse, adaptable and clean. The technologies that can help to deliver that are: nuclear, which should be built without public subsidy; renewable, including biomass, to which I shall return; and fossil fuels with the use of carbon capture and storage. I absolutely agree with the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr Hamilton) that this should not be a debate about one technology versus another. We need to secure a tremendous amount of investment in our energy infrastructure, and we should be encouraging that to come from a wide balance of resources. I hope that we can agree that our energy security is enhanced by the breadth of that investment portfolio.</p>

               <a name="11062959000344"> As my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood mentioned, there is certainly a case for having back-up at times when the wind is not blowing, but that would not necessarily have to be coal; it could be gas. At the moment, the investment case would be much stronger for a new gas power plant than for coal with CCS because of the relative costs. That back-up supply could also be provided through interconnectors. For example, an interconnector to Norway could provide a huge amount of potential clean electricity and there could also be additional interconnectors to France or Iceland. They could be part of that process. During this decade, other storage technologies have been developed, such as battery, the use of hydrogen, compressed air or heating hot water. Those are all ways in which one can enhance the reliability of the renewables sector. Nevertheless, we recognise—and the structure we are looking to put in the place recognises—that there will also need to be back-up power plant available.</p>

               <a name="11062959000345"> We should also recognise the continuing role for gas in the mix, which has often been missed out in many of these debates. We have increased the expectation of the likely role that gas will play, which picks up the point made by the hon. Member for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer). The world outlook on gas has changed beyond recognition in the past few years and it is right that energy policy should evolve to take account of that reality. When he noted that I was shaking my head, I was not disagreeing with him about the fact that there is an energy crunch, but about the time scale. My expectation is that the problem will not arise in four or five years, but towards the end of the decade.</p>

            <p>new investment is coming through in gas; indeed, of the 20-plus GW of consented plant, 60% is gas. A great deal of new plant is coming through, but when we consider that we will lose a third of our coal plant by 2016—it may be more by the end of the decade—and much of our nuclear plant during this decade, there is a real urgency to secure new investment. During this decade, we are talking about an investment figure in excess of £100 billion in terms of electricity generation and the associated infrastructure.</p>

She talks about drifting on the CCS time scale, but in fact, we will secure that first project much quicker than was anticipated under the previous Administration. She talked about us drifting on the renewable obligation review; in fact, we have brought that forward by a full year from the time scale we inherited precisely to give clarity to investors. Where there was ambition before, we have decided to match that with a delivery programme, and put in place a road map for the development of carbon capture and storage, a dedicated Office of Carbon Capture and Storage and a developers forum to identify the barriers to investment, so that we can directly focus on those. I hope that we are putting in place a clear programme whereby we are saying, “We understand what the challenges are. How do we make dealing with those a reality?”</p>

               <a name="11062959000348"> As I said, coal generation remains an important part of our energy mix. UK coal production to date is much stronger this year than last, with surface mine output up 400,000 tonnes and deep mine output up by almost a million tonnes. Consequently, this year, there has been a significant drop in the volume of imports, which I think we would all be pleased about. That is partly a result of destocking and partly because of a steady output from Daw Mill colliery—I was pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr Jones) was here to pay tribute to that. We very much welcome the development plans that UK Coal has announced for Thorseby and the extension of its life that that might bring about.</p>

               <a name="11062959000349"> Total production in 2010 was up on 2009 at a little over 18 million tonnes, and total coal use was also up. The net effect of contributions from indigenous production and the use of stocked coal was to reduce UK coal imports from 38 million tonnes to 26.5 million tonnes, which is a significant fall of 30%. The generating sector continues to be the main market for coal from all sources, particularly from indigenous production. Some 80% of the coal we consume is used in electricity generation. I want hon. Members from all parties to be in no doubt whatsoever that I, and the Government, believe that there is an important continuing role for coal, including indigenous coal, in the energy mix. We need to put in the place the right structure to secure the investment that will bring that forward. Indeed, we also need the right approach to carbon capture and storage.</p>

That is why, during the past year, we have started the process of electricity market reform. Although the old market structure brought benefits to consumers—we had some of the cheapest electricity and gas prices in Europe, although it did not always feel like that—it did not attract important investment in low-carbon technology. </p>

That could be used to provide for the additional plant that is needed on stand-by for those cold days when the wind does not blow, for half-time during a world cup football match or whenever additional capacity is required. Alternatively, we could find better ways of spreading the demand more evenly across the day and using that additional plant more sensibly.</p>

               <a name="11062959000354"> The electricity market reform process will also look at the emissions performance standard, which the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree raised. We will set out our plans on that in the forthcoming White Paper. We have listened carefully to the industry. I agree with her that if we set the EPS at the right level, it could be a strong steer towards new investment. Such an approach will make this country more attractive to investors because they will know what is expected of them over the longer term—for example, what the approach to grandfathering will be and when the reviews might happen. The EPS could be a very important steer and plus point in terms of attracting investment into this country, although I think I heard her indicate that there may be a case at this stage for applying it to gas as well. My anxiety about that is that we are not in the position to turn away investors who want to invest in gas at this time, too. We need to be very clear and careful about how it is introduced. The main drivers for low-carbon technology would be less from the emissions performance standard, and more from the feed-in tariff arrangements that we will introduce. We have also said that we will introduce a carbon floor price in 2013, and increasing gradually to 2020. That gives an early and credible long-term signal to investors that we are serious about encouraging investment in low-carbon technologies.</p>

We have been talking closely with the coal industry, and other people who are intensive energy users. We have to balance the urgent need to bring forward investment at twice the rate in this decade than was achieved in the previous decade, to meet the security of supply requirements that this country faces, and to do so in a way that does not create carbon leakage. It would not be sensible to drive away from the United Kingdom industries that can be a critical part of our manufacturing process—carbon emitters and heavy energy users.

 Energy remains a retained power. Clearly, the Scottish Government have decision-making powers on planning. That is why they have ruled out such things as new nuclear in Scotland. Nevertheless, energy policy is driven from Whitehall and Westminster. We therefore believe that if this is something that we want to achieve as a national Government, then we should be in the driving seat. If the Scottish Government were to say, “Here is a few million pounds to make it happen”, we would of course be very enthusiastic and grateful to them, although there are not many indications so far that the cheque is in the post.

We know that the individual parts of it can work. We know that it can be separated—we have seen that done on a small scale. We know that it can be transported and we know that it can be injected into the sea bed. However, nobody in the world has done that at scale, so we do not yet know what the challenges are of doing that at scale, or what the costs will be. In terms of a time scale, to have four projects running by 2020 is extremely ambitious. We are not going to arrive at a stage where we can move it beyond that. We can absolutely see this technology moving forward in the 2020s. Global ambition suggests perhaps 100 projects by 2020, but 3,000 projects by 2050. This is therefore a process that will inevitably start carefully, but then build up dramatically over time. Everything that we are doing here is determined to ensure that the United Kingdom can be in a real leadership position. What we also see from industry shows that it wants to be part of that process. The NER300 process is a European competition, and almost half of the schemes coming forward for CCS are in the United Kingdom. That shows the appetite among our industry, our universities and our whole supply chain to help lead in this area.</p>

Electricity from biomass is important to our renewable energy targets, because it brings security of supply benefits. It is dispatchable; in other words, when we need more power, we can generate more power. It can be turned up and it can be turned down. It is one of the few renewable energy sources that is genuinely adaptable in that respect. Large-scale dedicated biomass has the potential to develop significant levels of renewable electricity by 2020. Electricity from dedicated biomass is cheaper than some other large-scale electricity sources. If biomass generation needed to meet the renewable energy target was displaced by more expensive technologies, then inevitably there would be a higher cost to consumers.</p>

Friend the Member for Thurrock in paying tribute to RWE npower for the work it is doing to make that happen. Part of the renewables obligation banding review, which, as I said, we have brought forward by a year, will be to determine the appropriate level of support to bring forward either biomass conversion or co-firing, because of the contribution that they can make.</p>

The city is not standing still, however, with a new deep-water port at the port of Bristol making the docks of greater national and international significance, the possible sale for commercial use of Filton airfield in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Jack Lopresti) and the substantial housing development across the northern arc of Bristol. They are all opportunities but, unless the city’s transport infrastructure is capable of supporting them, opportunities could represent burdens.

I am tempted to draw an analogy with Joseph Bazalgette’s building of the great London sewer system. There is no more time for devising more effective ways of throwing waste out of the window.

The solution is a no-brainer: the resurrection of our local lines in Bristol, to complete the circle line around the city that we partially enjoy already with the Severn Beach line. A Henbury loop circle line could link with the major stations of Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway, and could provide a reference point for shuttle transport to major visitor destinations such as the Mall at Cribbs Causeway, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke. He cannot be here today because he is opening the new St Peter’s school in Pilning, but he has rightly said that, given the likely commercial and residential development if the sale of Filton airfield goes ahead, the case for examining existing rail provision and the possibility of resurrecting mothballed stations such as Filton would be really strong.

I understand that some Ministers have already travelled on the Severn Beach line, which runs from Temple Meads station up the west side of the city. That suburban line provides a demonstration of the untapped need and desire for local railway infrastructure, and the benefits of pump-priming investment. Since welcome investment by Bristol city council in 2008, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol West was active in campaigning for, introducing more frequent services on the Severn Beach line, passenger numbers have rocketed by about 60%, enabling a long-term subsidy decrease as the service becomes economically more successful. Were the circle line circuit complete around the city, that percentage of passenger increase and revenue would likely be an awful lot higher—but what we need is joined-up thinking.</p>

That is why I take this opportunity to back strongly the creation of an integrated transport authority for the region. Other areas, such as West Yorkshire and Merseyside, have seen a major resurrection of their local suburban rail services and they have something significant in common: an ITA.

Failing to secure that now is a false economy, holding us back for the future, in particular given the existing demonstrable demand for more services. The electrification of the Bristol to London route is incredibly welcome, not only in itself but for the further opportunities it will provide, but any update from the Minister on how far the electrification will extend—for example, to Yate or Weston—would be most appreciated. Such an extension would open enormous opportunities for the suburban lines, with greater flexibility in rolling stock, new routes and diversionary routes for electric trains when needed. A 30-minute service from and to all stations in the former Avon area would be transformational, although it is quite a modest vision when compared with other major cities around the country.</p>

An issue worked on and frequently raised by the hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) is the safeguarding of Plot 6 at Temple Meads for a bus and train interchange. In the more immediate term, I seek clarification from the Minister about additional carriages for crowding relief in Bristol; more rolling stock is badly needed, which is an indication of the appetite for rail travel and the enormous unmet demand. I ask him to consider that seriously.</p>

               <a name="11062959000382"> A Henbury loop line circuit is big thinking indeed, but rail gets to the core of tackling the underlying problems of Bristol’s transport system. Rail infrastructure for Bristol would be an absolute game changer for all the other methods of transport that we need to improve, freeing up the roads for buses and cyclists and transforming the park-and-ride potential. The idea has backing—indeed, the scheme is recommended in Network Rail’s route utilisation strategy—and I ask the Minister to look specifically at backing the scheme with practical financial support. Yes, the thinking is ambitious and long term, but I argue strongly that long-term strategic thinking and infrastructure investment is exactly what is needed if the entire Bristol region is to meet the real, pressing and ever-increasing transport challenges of the future. I called for the debate today because the future comes sooner than we think.</p>

Friend the Member for Bristol North West set out with great clarity the importance of the rail network in Bristol to the local economy, and how it can contribute to helping to address congestion problems in and around the city. She said that Bristol is the gateway to the south-west, and the Government fully recognise that in our planned investment in the inter-city rail network to Bristol. Indeed, it would not be possible to discuss local rail issues—I will return to them later—without referring to the significant developments that are planned for the network over the next five to 10 years, and which will transform Bristol’s links with London and the south-east.</p>

            <p>I am pleased to hear hon. Members’ support for that project today. The line will be equipped with brand new inter-city express trains, and the current proposal is for four trains an hour to run between Bristol and London, two an hour via Bath and Chippenham and two an hour via Bristol Parkway. Those via Bristol Parkway will transform the links between the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol North West and London, given the proximity of Bristol Parkway station.</p>

               <a name="11062969000005"> Both routes into Bristol will be electrified and, with electrification of the Severn tunnel route through to Cardiff, three of the local routes—Cardiff to Bristol, Bristol Parkway to Bristol, and Bath to Bristol—will be able to accommodate electric trains. There are no plans to electrify the line to Weston-super-Mare or the Severn Beach line. However, because some of the new inter-city trains will be bi-mode trains and able to run on electric or diesel power, some inter-city trains will continue to operate to Weston-super-Mare, as they do today, and will switch seamlessly—at least, I hope so—from electric to diesel power at Bristol Temple Meads.</p>

               <a name="11062969000006"> Another recent announcement is significant for the area. The Secretary of State has announced that the Thameslink route through London will receive new rolling stock from about 2015. That means that, as far as Bristol is concerned, there will be a pool of electric rolling stock available to operate some Bristol area local rail services should the operator of the new Great Western franchise choose to use them. I realise that capacity is an issue. We are currently negotiating with First Great Western for provision of additional diesel carriages, but I cannot confirm at the moment when they will arrive or what the exact number will be. However, the prospect of electric trains will ease the position considerably.</p>

               <a name="11062969000007"> I said that this debate is timely, and there are three reasons. First, detailed planning of the electrification scheme is now under way, and there may be opportunities to add to the scheme better to meet the needs of the local area if funding can be identified locally. Secondly, First Great Western has recently announced that it is taking up the option that the previous Government made available to it under the terms of the franchise of terminating it in 2013 rather than 2016. Therefore, detailed work will have to be carried out on the specification for the new franchise. Local authorities need to be ready to input into the process, and to discuss their ideas with bidders when they emerge in due course. For the avoidance of doubt, we welcome local people’s views of the new franchise arrangements which we are putting in place throughout the country. Thirdly, we are keen to explore the scope for devolving further aspects of rail to local authorities, and a good time to do so is when a franchise is due for renewal and the area is set to benefit from major investment.</p>

               <a name="11062969000008"> The electrification scheme creates major opportunities for the local rail network around Bristol. Electric trains are cleaner, quieter and have better acceleration than diesel trains, so they are ideally suited to providing local rail services in densely used urban areas. The journey-to-work area in Bristol is expanding, as my hon. Friends know only too well, so now is the time for the local authorities to consider how the local rail network can be adapted to maximise the benefits of electrification.  <br/>

            <p>That may require some reconfiguration of local services, but the local authorities are well placed to understand passengers’ needs. For example, we are aware that the West of England Partnership is keen to see the local rail service extended from Bristol Parkway to Yate. We would welcome local input into matters such as whether a short extension of electrification from Westerleigh Junction to Yate would offer value for money. Likewise, new stations have been suggested for the Bath route, and now is the time for the partnership to consider such issues.</p>

It is in nobody’s interest to promote unsustainable or undeliverable schemes or schemes that have little chance of securing funding. It is therefore important that work is undertaken to understand the viability of those options. I want to make it clear that the Government are pro-rail. We have a major programme of investment in the rail network. Indeed, it is reasonable to conclude without hyperbole that our rail investment programme is the biggest since the Victorian era.</p>

Although they are free to consider whether there might be benefits in forming an integrated transport authority—my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol North West referred to that, and some people believe that there would be significant benefits—it is not essential that they do so for the purposes of securing improvements or investment in local rail services. If local people want to consider forming an ITA, we will pay close attention to that.  The partnership has a number of plans for rail, and there are no institutional barriers preventing them from achieving them.</p>

For example, that structure could deal with the safeguarding of Plot 6 at Bristol Temple Meads. The West of England Partnership already takes an active role in transport, and has established a rail protocol with train operators and Network Rail. I understand that the local enterprise partnership has plans for regeneration around Temple Meads station.</p>

               <a name="11062969000012"> The West of England Partnership has created the concept of a Bristol metro network of regular-frequency local rail services, and has been very supportive of North Somerset council’s efforts to reopen the Portishead line. The next step will be to identify how those enhancements could be delivered and, more importantly, funded. The reopening of that line would required the reopening of passenger services on a freight-only line from Parson Street junction to Portbury junction, and the reinstatement of track from Portbury junction to a new station at Portishead. Our rough estimate is that reopening would cost £35 million to £40 million. Steps are obviously under way to make Network Rail more efficient, and to drive down costs, but that is our present estimate. Such a move would require the provision of new train services, perhaps every half hour during peak times and every hour off-peak. At the moment, that would need an ongoing subsidy, which is an important consideration when working out the economics of any reopening.</p>

 My hon. Friend has long campaigned very strongly on these issues and I welcome his involvement. Objectively, if we are to reopen a line it is a good idea to attract as many passengers as possible, and the provision of extra stations could be a useful way to achieve that. A cost-benefit analysis would be carried out for each station to look at whether reopening it would make sense to the project as a whole. My hon. Friend has given several examples of why he believes that would be the case for the station that he mentioned.</p>

               <a name="11062969000016"> Although the line between Filton Abbey Wood and Bristol is intact, we would need to increase its capacity, and Network Rail is considering how to accommodate the extra trains. There would also be the question of how to serve the branch line from St Andrews road to Severn Beach. In the first instance, the West of England Partnership will determine whether that scheme should be a priority, although to date it has provided no indication that it would seek to explore that proposal, given that the Bristol metro and the Portishead line appear to be higher priorities. Hon. Members from the Bristol area may wish to pursue that point with the West of England Partnership. Bristol city council funds additional services on the Severn Beach line, which has contributed to a significant growth in the usage of the line. Perhaps that model could be employed elsewhere in the area.</p>

Instead, local authorities should identify which local funding sources are most appropriate for a rail scheme, and decide whether such a scheme should have a higher priority than, for example, a highway or bus scheme.</p>

               <a name="11062969000019"> Although the coalition Government’s current priority must be to reduce the budget deficit, we are making available a significant amount of money—£560 million—through the local sustainable transport fund. That is more money for local transport than was provided over the past four-year period, despite the difficult economic climate that we face. We are also making a contribution to the regional growth fund to enable some schemes to proceed before 2014. All that is in addition to the major local transport schemes budget, and in September the West of England Partnership will make five bids to the Department for schemes linked to the development pool. We will make decisions on those schemes around Christmas. The area has already had one scheme approved for the Greater Bristol bus network, which is nearing completion. The West of England Partnership has made a key component bid and a large project initial proposal to the local sustainable transport fund, and an announcement on the key component bid will be made shortly.</p>

               <a name="11062969000020"> We will soon be consulting on a more devolved approach to major local schemes that will be in place from April 2015. Such an approach will provide the opportunity for groups of local authorities, working with local enterprise partnerships, to consider once again the transport priorities for their area that the fund might help to meet. That is particularly important for the reopening of the Portishead line, which has been frequently mentioned in this debate, through correspondence with the Department, and in other forums.</p>

               <a name="11062969000021"> The aspiration is to reopen that line by 2017, but it is essential to first establish that that is the best way to meet the needs of the area and a priority for investment among other potentially competing claims. The local authority has carried out important work with Network Rail through the governance for railway investment projects process—GRIP. It also, however, needs to establish demand for the scheme and to demonstrate that there is a business case and that ongoing financial support is affordable. Initially, that must be demonstrated locally and not by the Department. We will respond to that local pressure.</p>

               <a name="11062969000022"> To conclude, electrification brings opportunities for improvements to the local rail network around Bristol. There is an important role for local authorities, working together through the West of England Partnership, to carry on the good work and seize the initiative by taking advantage of such schemes. The Department will be happy to provide advice and guidance to hon. Members, councillors and others in the Bristol area, to ensure that people are able to maximise the opportunities in their area. Ultimately, however, it is for local people to lead on such matters, and the Department will have a supportive role.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Howarth, and I thank the House and the Speaker’s Office for giving me the opportunity to raise an issue of great importance to my constituency: the computer games industry.</p>

               <a name="11062969000024"> As hon. Members will be aware, calls for the Government to provide more support to this important industry have been made for some time, and during both the previous Parliament, and this Parliament, I and many of my colleagues have asked the Government to act. The previous Labour Government committed themselves to introducing tax breaks to encourage start-up companies and overseas developers to establish operations in the UK. The election of the coalition Government saw that policy scrapped, despite the support of Liberal Democrat and Conservative Front-Bench spokespeople before the election.</p>

               <a name="11062969000025"> The UK computer games industry is a substantial contributor to investment in the UK. In Scotland alone, £30.2 million is invested in salaries and overheads, £27.5 million is contributed to the Exchequer, and a direct and indirect contribution of £66.8 million is made to UK GDP. In the UK as a whole, those figures rise to a £1 billion contribution to GDP, and £400 million a year that goes to the Treasury.</p>

               <a name="11062969000026"> In Dundee, the arrival of a successful games developer has been a major factor in the revival of the city’s fortunes, following the loss of major manufacturing industries in the 1980s and ’90s. The computer games industry has contributed to help Dundee fast become a destination of choice for investors. Millions of pounds have been invested into the city and much-needed high-quality jobs have been created. Such investment has also provided an opportunity for young graduates, many of whom studied in Dundee, to pursue graduate careers in the city when before they would have left to work elsewhere. That has had a tremendously positive effect on the city.</p>

               <a name="11062969000027"> All that, however, is now at risk. Like many major industries, the computer games industry operates in a globalised economy and faces stiff competition from abroad. In that environment, just as in many others, global competition is squeezing British industry. Like ship building, general manufacturing and steel production before them, UK creative industries are being tempted away by countries that offer ever more enticing business environments. Canada is a particular threat. Last week the Entertainment Software Association of Canada produced a report highlighting the fact that Canada’s computer games industry has significantly benefited by poaching companies from the UK. It estimates that because of tax breaks, the industry will grow by 17% over the next two years. Between 2008 and 2010, the Canadian games industry grew by 33%; over the same period, the UK’s games industry fell by 9%.</p>

               <a name="11062969000028"> We have seen recent evidence of that phenomenon in the UK when a games developer in Warrington closed and staff were offered positions in the company’s Canadian office. There is more bad news for the UK industry. The US state of Pennsylvania announced this week that it is to introduce a 25% tax break for games developers. That makes it the 17th US state to offer such support.  <br/>

            <p>Alongside that, the Irish Culture Minister, Jimmy Deenihan, announced at the start of this month that the Irish Government were looking to implement tax breaks to encourage games developers to move to Ireland. That is all the more concerning given what we know of Ireland’s ability to attract high-investment technology companies to its shores—its banks notwithstanding. I am referring to companies such as Microsoft and Apple.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. The Government seem to be saying that differences in corporation tax and research and development tax credits are good enough to support the computer games industry.

That is additional to recent calls by major international developers.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we need to think not just about the short-term position, but the long term?

Everyone involved with the computer games industry—it is a big thing in my constituency of Dundee West—agrees that a long-term strategy is required, but in the short term, to prevent companies from going bust or moving to Ireland or Canada, tax breaks would be very important.

The Government’s one-size-fits-all approach to tax incentives simply is not working. While the UK Government remain outwitted by our international competitors, it is highly likely that inward investment will be lost.

This is a case not just of tax breaks, although they are fundamental, but of the range of measures that developers feel would support them. The Scottish Affairs Committee stated in its report that the Government must work with industry bodies to best determine how to better publicise the availability of R and D tax credits and to introduce a more targeted R and D scheme to the industry.</p>

I know that that is a wider problem experienced by small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the UK, but I ask the Government to redouble their efforts to ensure that the banks grant the finance required for start-ups to get going.</p>

They are much more likely than other industries to be turned down by the banks. That was highlighted in the Scottish Affairs Committee report on this subject. According to research by the trade body TIGA, the majority of 104 surveyed games companies reported either that there was no difference in their ability to borrow from their bank or that the situation had got worse in the course of last year.</p>

A product that fails to sell can have a dramatic impact on a company. However, without some risk being taken, industry and the economy simply will not grow.

 I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. He is absolutely correct. When we took evidence at Abertay university, we were told that, every day, students there who are studying the computer games industry and will graduate in that subject are receiving phone calls from France, Ireland and Canada saying that they will be offered a job there. Most of the students who study computer games do not end up employed by a company in the UK; they end up starting their own business. It is extremely galling for people in Dundee, who want to locate in Dundee, to find that it is much easier to move abroad than to stay in the UK, so I thank my hon. Friend for that point.</p>

            <p>There are other proposals that the UK Government could implement to support UK games developers. TIGA has called for the creation of a creative content fund. That would allow for funding on a pound-for-pound basis up to £100,000 for companies that produce highly creative content. The UK Government must acknowledge that computer games developers and other creative industries have specific requirements that are not being addressed. The creation of a creative content fund would target funding on those industries, and show that their needs were catered for. It would encourage investment, growth and job creation. I ask the Minister to draw up plans to consult on introducing these measures, and to work with the industry and the Treasury to put in place a policy that encourages and rewards creative investment.</p>

               <a name="11062969000050"> As for the value of higher education and of a skilled work force for the industry, I am well aware that higher education spending is a devolved matter, but the Government could do a number of things. A major requirement for developers is a highly skilled and trained work force. The industry is populated largely by graduates and, as I mentioned earlier, securing jobs for Dundee graduates has had a great effect on the city.</p>

However, it remains a small sum compared with the support that could be offered. The Scottish Affairs Committee’s report highlighted the real concern that there are too few mathematics and computer science graduates to sustain the industry. Abertay has led the way on this, and I urge the Government to work with universities and industry to ensure that we have the work force and skills base that the economy needs. Abertay has acted as an experiment on what can be done in partnership between higher education institutions and the private sector. I ask the Government to work with the Scottish Executive to develop working relationships of that sort, and to ensure that public spending cuts do not harm access to higher education or the quality of teaching and research.</p>

I well understand Ministers arguing that we need a simplified tax incentive structure. I am sure that we would all agree that unnecessary complication would be a hindrance to economic growth. However, we sometimes need an element of necessary complication. The temptation to find simple solutions to complicated problems can be far too alluring; instead, we should accept that there is a case to be made for having specific solutions to specific problems. Individual industries require tailored support to meet their needs. Whether it is tax breaks for the UK film industry or tax breaks for games developers, the Government must introduce policies that actually work for the many important industries that we have in the UK.</p>

That is why I ask the Government to think again about their broad-brush and overly simplistic attitude to supporting business.

I am therefore standing in for him. I toyed with the possibility of getting my ministerial colleague to represent himself by Skype, possibly by superfast broadband, as he is also Minister with responsibility for the digital economy, but I thought that might be a step too far even for the newly modernised House of Commons. I therefore stand in his stead.</p>

We are registering it under the next iteration of those rules, which is coming up. The reason is that it seemed at the time—we continue to agree—that it was an important piece of cultural ambassadorship as much as a business opportunity. We cannot necessarily say that for “Grand Theft Auto”, important though it may be for the UK industry and for jobs. The film industry does both jobs. It fulfils the role of cultural ambassador; the video games industry is economically important. That is the historic explanation. The shortage of money, which I intend to deal with in my response to the hon. Member for Dundee West, is why we are where we are; there is no money to extend such provision, even if we could.</p>

 I thank the Minister for giving way. The figures given to the Scottish Affairs Committee during its inquiry suggest that the tax breaks received by the film industry cost in the region of £110 million a year. The previous Government committed themselves to tax breaks for the computer games industry worth £55 million a year. However, the computer games industry generates more for our GDP than the film industry. Further to that, the Committee said that calling them video or computer games was rather misleading, as the industry is also involved in medical research and architectural science.

That is a fact of life in any industry, and certainly in the creative industries. There might be 100 options that could increase the bottom line, but they will not be able to afford to use them; they will not have the cash, the people or resources in general. That is the case with the Government. We inherited a terrible fiscal position, and the country’s balance sheet was in a very bad state. There are all sorts of things that might create a positive return, but we physically do not have the cash for them.</p>

I respectfully suggest that he will need his own Treasury Front-Bench team to sign up to what he suggests. I suspect that those Front Benchers will be leery of doing so, because they would then have to explain which bits of other budgets, such as health or education, they would cut in order to release money for this, which taxes they would raise to pay for the additional tax breaks, or how they would persuade the financial markets, on the day that Greece is voting for its austerity package, that we should be borrowing more money for this, that or the other. This is an essential piece of macro-economic prudence, and I suspect it is a fundamental difference of approach between us.

The Minister’s party also supported that, as did the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party. I am not looking for a U-turn; I am looking to the Government to honour their commitment. The Minister makes the point about the Labour legacy, which I think everybody is getting a bit scunnered listening to. If that is the case, why can Ireland offer tax breaks but the UK cannot?

 That brings me neatly to one of the other points made by the hon. Gentleman. He accused us of having an over-simplistic, one-size-fits-all policy. The difference between here and Ireland is that, over 13 years under the previous Government, the UK developed one of the most complicated, long, difficult, baroque and over-ornamented systems of business taxation in the developed world. We start with an incredibly complex taxation system, so moving gently towards a slightly simpler approach does not mean we are becoming over-simplistic or deciding that one size fits all. We would have to go a long way to get anywhere near the scenario the hon. Gentleman describes. Ireland is not starting from that over-complicated position. It has all sorts of other constraints. It has major macro-economic and public finance problems, as he rightly says, but it is not starting from one of the most complicated and baroque business tax systems in the world, as we are.</p>

What actually happens in business—and having been in business, I can vouch for it—is that one makes the right decision on the basis of what customers want and what is affordable and one tries to position the business in that way. One then turns to the bloke who runs the finance department and says, “Can you retro-fit any of this into some kind of useful tax break that the Government have already introduced?” That does not drive decision making, unless it is a very large and particular kind of system, of which there are few.</p>

               <a name="11062969000075"> The Chancellor of the Exchequer, as I have mentioned before, keeps all decisions on tax policy under review. However, we believe that in general providing a low corporate tax rate with fewer reliefs and allowances, as I have explained, will provide the best incentive for business development and promoting economic growth. Many games companies in the UK will benefit from the reforms announced in Budget 2010 and Budget 2011. To remind hon. Members, the UK’s main rate of corporation tax will fall to 23% by 2014. That means we will have the lowest rate in the G7 and the fifth lowest in the G20, ensuring the UK remains a competitive place to do business.</p>

It is worth pointing out that many major global games companies choose to locate their European headquarters in the UK, and continue to do so. For example, we have Sony Computer Entertainment, Sega, Disney Interactive and Activision all here in the UK.</p>

               <a name="11062969000077"> The Government have also made major reforms to the R and D tax credit. From 1 April 2011 the rate of tax relief for small and medium-sized enterprises increased from 175% to 200% of qualifying tax relief. From 1 April 2012 that will rise further to 225%, subject to   <br/>

               <a name="11062969000078"> The Government also announced changes to the schemes that help to incentivise equity investment in small, high-growth companies. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the importance of those to this industry, and many others. Those schemes are the enterprise investment scheme and venture capital trusts. We welcome the news that consultants Olswang plan to work with others on an independent analysis considering how measures such as EIS and VCTs can be exploited by games developers and the investment community to boost levels of investment in the sector.</p>

Gentleman rightly focused many of his remarks in that area. There are other things that can and need to be done to improve the environment for enterprise in this country. For example, the enterprise finance guarantee will provide up to £600 million of additional lending to around 6,000 viable SMEs in 2011 and, subject to demand, over £2 billion in total over the next four years. For the enterprise capital funds, the Government are increasing their commitment by £200 million over the next four years, providing more than £300 million venture capital investment into the equity gap for early stage innovative SMEs with the highest growth potential.</p>

 Is there not a criticism that there is a lack of strategic focus on the video games industry? I strongly support the investment in the Abertay graduate programme, but evidence indicates that the majority of young people who graduate from there are going abroad. They are not staying in the UK, whether they are from Dundee or south of the border.</p>

 That is a fact of life in an increasingly globalising market. This is a globalising market, not just for the product of video games, but for the staff. Many other industries are already incredibly globalised, everything from financial to medical services. This sector will be going the same way. I am sure we will all be delighted to see British brains and talent travelling the world. It is true to say that many people come back to the UK later in their career and start up businesses here or join at a senior level.</p>

Unfortunately, they are not precisely what he recommends. However, it is not true that we are a “do nothing” Government; we are doing a great deal. I fear that he and I will have to disagree on precisely what that should be.</p>
