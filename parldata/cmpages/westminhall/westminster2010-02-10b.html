 I welcome all Members to the first debate in Westminster Hall today. I am not sure whether the weather will deteriorate or improve, but for those who will have to go a distance, I hope that it will improve. As this is the last day before we break for the half-term holiday, may I express the hope that everyone has a restful and enjoyable time at home or in their constituencies? The first debate is to be initiated by someone who has come a very long way to be here—the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael).</p>

 It is indeed a long way from Orkney and Shetland to Westminster, but as it affords me the privilege of serving under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas, it is worth every inch of the journey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="100210h0001.htm_para1"><a name="10021066000013">I return this morning to a subject on which I have addressed the House on a number of occasions over the past nine years. It is a source of considerable and genuine regret that we have not made more progress on a public policy that brings with it one of the most significant burdens to life in island and rural communities. I shall confine my remarks this morning largely to the island communities, for reasons that I hope are so obvious that I shall not need to state them. It is plain from the geographical spread of the constituencies of Members here today that the problem affects communities in all remote and peripheral parts of the country, not only those that I represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="100210h0001.htm_para2"><a name="10021066000014">My ask for the Minister this morning, as on previous occasions, is that if she cannot consider a derogation of fuel duty—I recognise that a substantial element of the cost of petrol is attributable to fuel duty—there may be a possibility of getting a derogation from European Union legislation to allow the imposition in some areas of a lower rate of duty, thus recognising that that there are market-based reasons for the higher prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="100210h0001.htm_para3"><a name="10021066000015">The importance of the problem cannot be overstated. In communities such those that I represent, which are geographically substantial but with small populations that are spread very thinly, the use of the private car is not a luxury but an essential. It is also an environmental essential. If we had a fleet of buses running around the west side of Shetland to provide the required transport access to other parts of Shetland, they would effectively be running empty. Having smaller private cars on those roads makes environmental sense. Buses, with their emissions and their use of fuel, would be carrying air around the west side of Shetland or the remoter parts of Orkney. That makes no environmental sense. Although the mindset in many parts of the Government may be that the private car is bad for environmental reasons  <br></br>

 Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that the bus service is either thin or non-existent in many rural areas? The car is therefore a necessity. He talks about taxation on fuel. Does he also recognise that the price of petrol is much higher in many rural areas than in the cities? It is not as though we are trying to give a tax advantage to those who live in rural areas; we simply want to give them a fair crack of the whip.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman says nothing with which I could disagree. Indeed, he leads me on rather nicely to the first point that I wish to bring to hon. Members’ attention—the prices being paid at the pump by my constituents in Orkney and Shetland. I checked these figures yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="100210h0001.htm_para4"><a name="10021066000018">Lerwick is the largest town in Shetland, and the largest garages are able to provide the cheapest petrol. Pump prices there for unleaded petrol go from 124.5p per litre to 125.9p per litre. On other islands, including Unst, my constituents are paying 130.9p per litre. For reasons that I shall explain in a moment, the prices in Orkney are slightly lower. At most filling stations in Kirkwall, the pump price is about 120.9p, but in Westray, which has a fairly substantial island population in the context of Orkney, my constituents are paying 129.9p per litre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="100210h0001.htm_para5"><a name="10021066000019">I want to say a word or two about the structural market reasons why such variations should be the case. We have no supermarkets selling petrol in Orkney and Shetland. We do not have big retailers with the buying muscle of garages in the urban conurbations, which can get cheap fuel. One retailer on the west side of Shetland told my office yesterday that he makes only 6p per litre. He said that he could buy the fuel more cheaply at a petrol station in Aberdeen—at the retail price, including duty and VAT—than he can buy it from the wholesaler or distributor.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. He will know that the price of fuel has been long-running sore. He touched on the price differential. Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that has a land border with the eurozone. Filling stations in the border areas are finding it difficult; one can buy fuel a few yards down the road in the Republic of Ireland at 99p per litre, but it costs almost 116p a few hundred yards in the other direction. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will join me and include Northern Ireland in his debate.</p>

 Indeed. As a Front-Bencher, I am well acquainted with the situation that the hon. Gentleman outlines. For my constituents, it is particularly galling. His constituents look across the border to a foreign country; we look to other parts of the same country. The Treasury is not prepared to deal with that basic unfairness by treating my constituents in the same way as it would expect other constituents to be treated.</p>

responsibility in how they price petrol and diesel for rural communities? He has already indicated that one can buy fuel cheaper in Aberdeen at retail prices than one can buy it wholesale in Orkney.</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="10021066000023"><a name="100210h0001.htm_spnew7"><a name="10021066000553"><b>Mr. Carmichael:</b>
 I understand that there is a need for more responsible behaviour by the oil companies, particularly the wholesalers and distributors. I am not suggesting that the sort of difference that could be made by a duty reduction would be the silver bullet, but it could be part of a package that would make a significant difference. Moreover, it would be a useful way for the Government to send the message that it is time for the oil companies to smarten up their thinking. When one looks around the European Union, one realises that such behaviour is pretty well accepted there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="100210h0001.htm_para6"><a name="10021066000024">Let me briefly turn to how the extra costs of diesel and petrol and fuel duty have an increased impact on agriculture. The Minister will be aware that, since October 2007, the duty increases of 2p a litre have been applied across the board—to road fuels, rebated fuels or red diesel, biofuels and other domestic fuels—and that has affected the agricultural sector that relies on red diesel, because 2p as a proportion of the red diesel duty is significantly larger than it is on non-rebated fuels. Therefore, over the past six years, farmers have faced a red diesel price increase of more that 180 per cent., which has been driven not by increased oil prices but by the duty element. Such an increase is disproportionate, and for a community such as mine in Orkney and Shetland, which relies heavily on agriculture as the core of its local economy, the impact is particularly severe. If we add the peripherality of the area and the small size of the community market to the extra burden of fuel duty increases that have been imposed in a very crude way, we can see that the most fragile of economic communities has been put at the most substantial disadvantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="100210h0001.htm_para7"><a name="10021066000025">The Government’s argument for increasing duty on red diesel was to combat oil fraud. I do not know how such a measure will combat oil fraud. I would have thought that raising duty increases the incentive for people to take a chance of putting red diesel in their tractor or private car. None the less, combating fraud seems to be the basis of the Government’s logic, but it is not as robust as we might expect from the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="10021066000026"><a name="100210h0001.htm_spnew8"><a name="10021066000554"><b>Mr. Gregory Campbell (East Londonderry) (DUP):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. He touched on the issue of fraud, and I can appreciate the extreme difficulties that come from rurality and peripherality. Does he agree that one of the issues in Northern Ireland is that Revenue and Customs has not been diligent enough in dealing with the oil that is illegally brought across from the Irish Republic to be sold in Northern Ireland and that hundreds of millions of pounds are therefore lost to the Treasury?</p>

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="10021066000027"><a name="100210h0001.htm_spnew9"><a name="10021066000555"><b>Mr. Carmichael:</b>
 Indeed. As we scrutinise with ever-increasing rigour where money is coming from and where it is going to, such considerations will become more and more weighty. Indeed, the matter requires substantial attention.</p>

Concerning the details of the schemes, the Commission can inform the Honourable Member that in the case of Corsica, the reduction is 1 cent per litre. In the case of the Greek islands, the reduction can be up to 2.2 cents per litre. In the case of Azores and Madeira, the directive does not specify the amount of the tax reduction, however, according to the information available to the Commission, the degree of tax differentiations from the Portuguese mainland is 1.5 cents per litre (Madeira) and 3.8 cents per litre in the case of the island of Azores.”</p>

Members will know how much petrol costs in urban conurbations. They have heard the figures that I have offered today. We are talking about a difference of between 10p and 15p a litre. That is not a transport cost. The Treasury then tells us that, if we had derogation and a variable rate of duty in different parts of the country, people would drive from those urban conurbations to get their cheap petrol. It tells us something about how figures are added up in the Treasury that the people there think that petrol will still be perhaps 8p or 10p a litre more expensive in the communities that we represent, but that people will get in their cars and use petrol to drive to our communities to buy petrol that is still more expensive than they would get at home.</p>

very serious point about the price differential, which has an adverse effect on the community that I represent, where people who face paying higher prices actually go out of the community, 30 or 40 miles down the road, to purchase their petrol.

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para0"><a name="10021066000263">We have got to give some reality to the question, “Who is a fit and proper person in the game of football?” With Portsmouth, for example, nobody even knew who the owners of the club were, never mind whether they were fit and proper people to be in football. Clearly, the concept of a fit and proper person is way beyond not only the ordinary supporter but the wider stakeholders in football. Within that concept, we have to include the idea that financial stability and credibility is part of that matrix of fitness and properness. That financial stability and credibility must include the capacity to absorb debt, or rather not absorb debt, into the club. There is nothing anti-capitalist in this argument—I say that for the benefit of my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington.</p>

<p><a name="st_110"><a name="10021066000264"><a name="100210h0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="10021066000654"><b>John McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</b>

 Only because I want to appeal to the global audience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para1"><a name="10021066000266">The NFL—the National Football League in America—regulates American football and has very strict limits on the amount of debt that clubs can take on board. Frankly, if that is good enough for the Americans in this sporting context, we ought to learn at least some of the lessons from the United States and impose them over here.</p>

<p><a name="st_112"><a name="10021066000267"><a name="100210h0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="10021066000656"><b>Mr. Pelling:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman mentioned American sports. Would it not be better perhaps for the premier league to copy what is done in America, by sharing revenue among clubs to ensure a healthier and more competitive league system?</p>

<p><a name="st_113"><a name="10021066000268"><a name="100210h0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="10021066000657"><b>Tony Lloyd:</b>
 Many of these ideas obviously ought to be on the table. I can think of arguments for and against such revenue sharing; as a Manchester United supporter, my instinct is to say no to it. However, the reality is that football needs to see itself as a totality. No one club can compete against itself. I am sure that I will not be popular in my own constituency for saying this, but if Liverpool FC was to go out of business, it would actually not be in the interests of Manchester United or Manchester City, because we need quality teams to play against, however frustrating it is on those occasions when the wrong result emerges from those contests with Liverpool FC—they emerge less now than they did previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para2"><a name="10021066000269">Another issue is almost bizarre, and I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to look at it. Tax relief is available for those who buy football clubs with leveraged bids. It is preposterous that we are allowing rapacious corporate raiders to come in and use tax relief as a way of gearing their acquisition of otherwise financially sound clubs. Quite frankly, we ought to get rid of that tax relief in this industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para3"><a name="10021066000270">Across the board, let us go back to the football taskforce and its majority report and to the all-party group on football’s recommendations. Let us consider those recommendations and that report quite seriously, and let us begin to say that we will implement them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para4"><a name="10021066000271">I want to conclude with a couple of specific propositions. We have got to look at the models for protecting supporters’  <br></br>

interests that exist elsewhere. In Germany, for example, a club’s supporters have the golden share, which prevents abuse by the German football clubs against the interests of their natural support base. That makes a real difference. Germany has bigger crowds and lower ticket prices than this country does. Ticket prices come up, time after time, among ordinary fans here, because they feel that they are being ripped off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para5"><a name="10021066000272">We also need to look at the Barcelona model or, if people prefer, the John Lewis model of share ownership, which establishes ownership among the ordinary supporters. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I will not venture further down that path. However, it is important that we look at the different models that exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para6"><a name="10021066000273">Whatever happens, we must ensure that the supporter can be included. I was once a shareholder of Manchester United; that shareholding was liquidated, under company law, when the present owners took over the club. I had a nominal shareholding as a matter of tribal loyalty or tribal support, not because I wished to take over the club or run it.</p>

<p><a name="st_114"><a name="10021066000274"><a name="100210h0007.htm_spnew4"><a name="10021066000658"><b>Mr. Hancock:</b>

 I once had shares. Of course, they have now gone, because they have been liquidated and that has applied across the board. So we must find a way of involving the fans in the governance and running of the clubs and the leagues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para7"><a name="10021066000276">I want to finish on a very personal level. I mentioned the Munich air crash before. I can remember the impact on the city of Manchester when those young men died—at the time, when I was a boy, they were men to me. It had a profound effect on a city such as mine. That memory is still strong and vivid, and it is not a memory just for one generation; it is carried down culturally from one generation to the next. The same would apply to people in the cities of Liverpool, York or Portsmouth, or wherever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para8"><a name="10021066000277">Actually, I am one of those people in Manchester who has always watched both football clubs; I watched Manchester City as well as Manchester United. I can talk about City players from the past such as Johnny Crossan and not just the famous City players such as Lee, Bell, Young and Summerbee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para9"><a name="10021066000278">In the end, football does matter. It is about our tribal identities. That can be bad, in the worst excesses. But football is the beautiful game; it is the game that ennobles people if it is played in the right way, and it is the game that is about giving entertainment but also values if it is played in the right way. Most of us grew up thinking that those role models—the captain of England, when it was Bobby Moore or Billy Wright—were sterling people who had values that carried us through in life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para10"><a name="10021066000279">I look back to that older generation who gave me those values, and I am grateful for that. We should not put that at peril by saying that football is only a commodity to be bought and sold; if we do so, I am afraid that we betray this beautiful game of ours, and we betray the heritage that we ought to hold precious.</p>

This very day, the futures of Portsmouth, Cardiff City and Southend United are being debated in the courts. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the state of our national game and its governance and regulation. I have a keen interest as a lifelong fan and follower of football, and as a member of the all-party football group, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I represented the Conservatives on our reports on the game’s governance in 2003 and on the finances in 2008-09.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para13"><a name="10021066000285">I have long argued that the sport is too loosely regulated, perhaps in the self-interest of the top premiership clubs that have a global reach. One difficulty with trying to empower the Football Association is that the premier league will not have it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para14"><a name="10021066000286">As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, many people claim that politicians should not interfere in the running of our national game. However, in my view, it is perfectly legitimate for us to debate the issue. Tens of millions of pounds of public money have been spent over the past 25 years on repairing football stadiums since the Taylor report. Football plays an important and significant role in the local economies of numerous towns up and down the country. Furthermore, it is an integral part of British culture and remains a highly successful export.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I saw that work when I watched my local club at Aldershot, where perhaps it is understandable to see Help for Heroes, and Dagenham and Redbridge in recent months. I vouch for that being a tremendous initiative.</p>

the game, particularly in the premier league. The people’s game has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past 18 years since the formation of the premier league and there is an unprecedented and probably unbridgeable gulf between the top clubs and the run-of-the-mill premiership teams, let alone clubs playing outside the top flight. I fear that is partly due to the lack of competition that has been referred to. It is the direct result of lax governance and an absence of effective regulation. There are no wage, squad size or registration restrictions—a state of affairs unknown in other sports around the world, from Aussie rules football to US baseball, as the hon. Gentleman said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para17"><a name="10021066000291">Before discussing the potential reforms that could improve the situation, we must take a step back and consider how we got to this point. A key contributor to the radical change in English football is the huge revenue incomes of premier league clubs, in comparison with their Football League counterparts. To indicate the scale of that revenue, premiership clubs receive £2.8 billion, split between 20 teams over a three-year contract. In stark contrast, the Football League’s latest contract is worth £88 million annually, divided between 72 clubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para18"><a name="10021066000292">Crystal Palace, here in London, are the latest club to enter administration. They join a host of clubs that have experienced that traumatic fate in recent years, including Leeds, Southampton, Rotherham United, AFC Bournemouth and Luton, which is no longer in the league. Premier league clubs have hitherto only flirted with that prospect and we all await the fate of Portsmouth today. The sole difference is that the premiership clubs, by virtue of the vast sums of TV money, tend to have a greater ability to attract some form of bail-out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para19"><a name="10021066000293">One of the few pieces of regulation that premier league clubs adopted from the Football League is the fit and proper persons test. However, that is more honoured in the breach and is in urgent need of attention. Half of premiership clubs are foreign owned, often involving dubious investment made by cagey consortiums. It seems that the need for immediate cash-flow relief renders the test optional rather than compulsory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para20"><a name="10021066000294">Even at home, it is noticeable how much money talks. Last month, David Gold and David Sullivan completed their takeover of West Ham United. Twenty years ago, a similar approach by the same duo was rejected out of hand because they were regarded as below the salt, their money having been made in soft porn publishing. Today, they are rightly perceived as transparent and legitimate investors in football and as preferable to the many foreign and shady owners.</p>

<p><a name="st_121"><a name="10021066000295"><a name="100210h0007.htm_spnew11"><a name="10021066000665"><b>Mr. Hancock:</b>

 Indeed, they are fans. Even Manchester United and Liverpool are saddled with the burden of foreign leveraged buy-outs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para21"><a name="10021066000297">How can we improve the state of the game? Football agents have been under intense scrutiny in recent years. Sadly, it has become fashionable for the media, clubs and football authorities to heap all the blame on agents. Although they are easy scapegoats and, as we are told frequently, leeches on the great game, the facts are less simple. Clubs, managers and owners have often colluded in the worst practices, furtively using agents to tap up players who are not on the move, with the agents feeding soccer journalists self-fulfilling stories about player unhappiness or club desire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para22"><a name="10021066000298">The core of the problem is the eternal conflict of interests in all agency relationships, which is made worse by the grubby antics of all too many football clubs. Essentially, agents are not instructed on many of the transactions in which they involve themselves. They claim, and are given, fees by players and by clubs, both at the buying and selling ends of the deal. Some have wider consultancy arrangements whereby clubs pay for their services, which can involve sabotaging transactions and tipping off journalists with misinformation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para23"><a name="10021066000299">It is time for a proper code for agents in the game. There must be clear, punitive sanctions, especially against clubs and their employees. Any fee for agency services should be paid by only one party to a transfer deal. It is all too easy to blame agents for what has happened in the game. There are also a number of underlying problems. Financial irregularities have become all too frequent in recent times and have gained high-profile exposure. Football is languishing in the lurid world of celebrity, increasingly appearing on tabloid front, rather than back pages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para24"><a name="10021066000300">I have painted a somewhat grim picture thus far, but there is some positive news. It relates to the Football League, which continues to lead the way in good governance of the national game. Over the past few years, the Football League has rolled out a number of measures to try to stabilise the financial health and future existence of its 72 clubs. We should highlight those measures and promote them to our top flight clubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para25"><a name="10021066000301">In April 2003, the Football League clubs introduced a sporting sanction of 10 points for any club entering administration so that financial irresponsibility and unsustainable growth off the field is met with a real punishment on the pitch. The risk of losing points or a place in a certain league promotes responsible management and is surely factored into risk taking in the Football League, if not in the premiership.</p>

 I agree that losing 10 points is a bad sanction that encourages club owners not to go down that financial route. Unfortunately, it is the fans who lose out as a result of their club losing 10, 20 or 30 points.</p>

<p><a name="st_124"><a name="10021066000303"><a name="100210h0007.htm_spnew14"><a name="10021066000668"><b>Mr. Field:</b>
 It is the fans who lose out. To be brutally honest, when the Glazers first appeared on the scene in 2005, most Manchester United fans were entirely happy because they saw the huge amount of money coming into the club as a counterbalance to the influence of Roman Abramovich at Chelsea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para26"><a name="10021066000306">Another positive step forward is the divisional pay clause in players’ contracts, which states what each player will earn regardless of relegation or promotion. As the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) said, league two clubs have the obligation that only 60 per cent. of football revenue can be paid in wages. That is a sensible way forward.</p>

Member for Manchester, Central—it is very much a passion for him—has existed for the past 100 years, but is in great danger of drifting irreversibly towards a franchise structure that is more akin to that in American football, where only a small number of franchise clubs in just 10 or 12 of the biggest cities can play a part. We have already seen the first step in that direction, with the birth of the Milton Keynes Dons in 2004, which saw a south London club, Wimbledon, bought, relocated—notionally, at least—from south-west London to Buckinghamshire and given a new identity.</p>

Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn) for the Football Trust report, the first stages of its implementation and the 5 per cent. that we got from TV levies to support football at the grass roots—all that was excellent. I also support UEFA’s plans for financial controls, because we need a Europe-wide approach, despite the criticism from some premier league clubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="100210h0007.htm_para31"><a name="10021066000312">In the face of the crisis that has hit the football economy and the wider economy, however, we need to go much further, and I want to make a few brief points. First, on leveraged buy-outs, due diligence needs to be extended from directors to the sustainability of any bid proposal. Controls should be placed on debt ratios, and debt should be limited to reflect the realistic record of income levels, so that the debt and the club can be sustained in the future. Such issues should be assessed independently by a football financing commission, which could go in and prepare an independent and fully open and transparent report so that supporters and the wider public can see whether a buy-out or an investment is sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="st_163"><a name="10021066000397"><a name="100210h0010.htm_spnew0"><a name="10021066000707"><b>Mr. Pelling:</b>
 Let me put a question to the Minister to prepare him for answering questions when he is mayor of Birmingham. Does he really think that it was appropriate that John Terry was sacked as captain of England?</p>

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="10021066000398"><a name="100210h0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="10021066000708"><b>Mr. Simon:</b>
 As the hon. Gentleman mentions Birmingham, I can say on behalf of two soldier friends of mine that I am short of two tickets for the league cup final. As I am here, I thought that I might as well mention that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para0"><a name="10021066000399">The positive changes in the game have been a result of the work done by everyone concerned with the game, including the supporters, as has been said. However, that is not to say that football is immune to the problems that we all face in these difficult economic times. Although Deloitte’s well respected financial report tells us that the income into our top league remains healthy due to increased broadcasting, sponsorship and overseas rights revenues, the debt sometimes looks almost unsustainable, as many hon. Members have noted at length this afternoon. Clearly, one lesson of the global financial crisis is that models of business that look sustainable and solid at one moment can turn out to be precarious the next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para1"><a name="10021066000400">Of course we understand why fans are becoming increasingly concerned about the debt accumulated by some clubs. As hon. Members have said, clubs are valuable community assets and every care should be taken to protect their long-term financial future for the sake of not just the investors, but the supporters, future generations of supporters and the communities in which the clubs sit. The game today makes money because of the fierce, passionate loyalty of fans and the history of civic pride and local allegiance forged over decades and, indeed, centuries. Football, professional though it is now, has its roots deep in the community. It is an expression of personal, local—the word “tribal” has been used—and family identity. It is sport that has become big business, not vice versa. No one in the Government is in any doubt about that. That is why we are keen that supporters should have a bigger role in the financial accountability and governance of their clubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para2"><a name="10021066000401">There are many examples of supporters’ trusts proving their value in recent years. They have prevented some 37 clubs from going out of business. They have proven their worth, and more should be done to acknowledge their significant contribution to the game. We are pleased that the football authorities have financially supported that work in the past. Hon. Members may recall that my Department was among those responsible for setting up Supporters Direct—an organisation that has been very successful over the past few years in encouraging supporters to take a greater share of ownership in their own clubs.</p>

 Order. May I say to the Minister—I want to be helpful—that he has only two minutes left? I am sorry about that, but these debates are timed and hon. Members have contributed to that problem. I would just like him to know that he has two minutes.</p>

 I am grateful, Sir Nicholas. Would that I had longer. My speech, unfortunately, would take considerably longer than that to deliver, and I am resigned to the fact that I will not be able to put on the record all the points that I would like to make this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para3"><a name="10021066000404">Of course, it is not for the Government, ultimately, to run football or to tell the businesses that make up the football community how they should go about regulating their affairs. It is for the clubs themselves to ensure that they manage their finances well, and for the football authorities, as their governing bodies, to run the game. However, the Government have a legitimate role to play—that of a critical friend of the game. Given our long-term strategic investment in safety and security, our promotion of grass-roots participation, our role in the bidding process for major championship events and our relationship with the European Union on sport issues, such as protecting TV deals from regulation, it is right that we take a view and help to frame the debate and to reflect the views and interests of supporters in particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para4"><a name="10021066000405">We therefore have a legitimate expectation that those in the football world, including the associations, leagues and clubs, have the most effective governance and accountability arrangements in place and that they are working together for the long-term good of the game. That is why as far back as October 2008, the former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) asked the football authorities in England to respond to seven key questions concerning football finance, fit and proper persons for owning clubs, the competitive balance within the game and the strength of the national side. Last September, the Minister for Sport—the real Minister for Sport—wrote to them again, following their responses to the challenges that we set down. In his letter—</p>

 It is, as always, a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas. I am grateful for the opportunity to debate this issue on behalf of a constituent of mine and I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for giving of her time to respond to the debate. My constituent does not wish to be personally identified in the public record, and I thank the Minister and her office for respecting that wish while at the same time looking into his case at my request.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para5"><a name="10021066000408">The Child Support Agency website states on its home page:</p>
<a name="100210h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="10021066000506"><ul><p class="tabletext">“We make sure parents who live apart from their children contribute financially to their upkeep by paying child maintenance.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para6"><a name="10021066000409">I can assure hon. Members that my constituent would be the first to applaud that aim. He has two children by his former partner. He is the non-resident parent, but has always paid his child maintenance; he has never missed a payment since 2001.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para7"><a name="10021066000410">My constituent is on what I might describe as CSA 1, which means that his child maintenance contribution is assessed under the original scheme, under the old system—for cases that commenced between 1993 and 2003. Following his retirement, his income reduced, so his payments reduced, but he was still assessed under the old system. His current payments, after essential outgoings, leave him with approximately £49 a month. He has given me a list of his monthly outgoings, which include various modest amounts that he allows himself, such as £3.22 a day for food or £3.22 a day for petrol—in my constituency, getting around without a car is difficult. His outgoings are modest, but nevertheless he is left merely with £49 a month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para8"><a name="10021066000411">If my constituent were assessed under the new system—for cases post-March 2003—his contribution would be substantially less, because he would be required to pay 20 per cent. of his net weekly income, which is income after tax and national insurance deductions. Under the new system, non-resident parents have to pay: for one child, 15 per cent. of net income; for two children, 20 per cent. of net income, and for three children, 25 per cent. of net income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para9"><a name="10021066000412">The Child Support Agency website helpfully contains information on moving between old and current schemes. The website claims that the justification for the new, current scheme is that it is simpler to manage, easier to understand and better suited to parents’ needs. The website does not explain something that is also not mentioned by the calculator available for working out likely child maintenance: for someone on the old scheme, the calculation is significantly different and can be up to 30 per cent. of net income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para10"><a name="10021066000413">Under the old, original scheme, different criteria were applied. Part of the justification for the new scheme, as stated in the website, was:</p>
<a name="100210h0010.htm_brev1"><a name="10021066000507"><ul><p class="tabletext">“We no longer take into account or need to know the income of the parent with care...We no longer take account of the cost of either parent’s housing, council tax, etc.”</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para11"><a name="10021066000414">Yes, that may be simpler, but it is of small consolation to my constituent, because his contribution is still being assessed under the old system. For example, we learn  <br></br>

<notus-date day="10" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>10 Feb 2010 : Column 316WH</b><br></br>
that his former partner’s housing costs are taken into account. She claims more than £23,000 per annum in housing costs—£442 per week—which is rather a lot for someone with a net income, I am told, of around £26,500 a year. Yet the CSA has simply accepted the figure by virtue of a letter from the resident parent, with no further documentation to confirm its accuracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para12"><a name="10021066000415">As my constituent says:</p>
<a name="100210h0010.htm_brev2"><a name="10021066000508"><ul><p class="tabletext">“It is an insult to all honest payers like myself, who has never missed a payment since 2001, when a…parent with care can use tactics like this”.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para13"><a name="10021066000416">That refers to his former partner’s offsetting her income with high housing costs to ensure that her income is exempt from the maintenance calculation. My constituent also states that his former partner’s new partner is a “high earner”, making a mockery of the scheme. CSA 1 needs to be abandoned now, so that everyone can pay a fair amount without deductions for housing costs and so on, which do not form any part of the calculation under the second system or current scheme—CSA 2—which is based on a percentage of the net income of the non-resident parent only.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para14"><a name="10021066000417">I do not wish to get anyone at the CSA in Birkenhead into trouble—they are extremely helpful to me and my constituency office in the many cases with which they deal. They all do sterling work in difficult circumstances, but my constituent claims to have been told by a member of staff there that the two-tier system of CSA 1 and CSA 2—that is, the old and the current systems—is totally unfair and that rectification is long overdue. As my constituent points out, the move to CSA 2 for everyone would stop people making questionable—to say the least—claims for housing costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para15"><a name="10021066000418">The problem is that the CSA will move a child maintenance case to the current scheme only when it becomes linked to a new child maintenance application, made on or after 3 March 2003, meaning that many non-resident parents, such as my constituent, who are being assessed on the old scheme, are paying more than non-resident parents in identical circumstances who are being assessed on the current scheme. That cannot be fair and I do not believe it was the intention when the new system was introduced. My constituent has been told that he cannot be moved to the current system because—as he claims of the message given to him—the computers will not cope. The only alternative is for the parent with care to withdraw her claim and reapply under CSA 2, which I understand in the circumstances is extremely unlikely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para16"><a name="10021066000419">An organisation called Child Support Solutions, which specialises in advising parents on CSA issues, claims to have cases that were started on the old system but which are being moved to the new or current system. It describes that as conversion. If so, why can my constituent not be thus converted? Or must he, as he fears, continue to meet his obligations to his children as dictated by the CSA under a now much derided system? That system leaves him with only £49 per month in his pocket until his children are past the age when maintenance applies, which in his case will be another eight years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para17"><a name="10021066000420">I hope the Minister will answer that question. I hope she will also tell us her plans to resolve the overall problem. I am told that there is now a third system—CSA 3. Could the Minister, in her response, explain how that works and whether my constituent will benefit? Why  <br></br>

has it not been possible to move everyone from CSA 1 to CSA 2, and what is the justification for now introducing a third scheme?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para18"><a name="10021066000421">In conclusion, as I said at the beginning, my constituent loves his children. He is only sorry that he no longer sees them as often as he would wish, but he has never sought to evade or avoid his obligations to pay maintenance. He and I, as his Member of Parliament, are simply questioning the operation of the various systems as they stand at the moment, and asking—indeed pleading—that something be done to make them fairer.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas, and to recall that the last time I served under you was also in a Finance Bill Committee, although that was the 2007 Finance Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para19"><a name="10021066000423">I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Janet Anderson) on securing the debate. Child support is an important issue for many hon. Members—indeed, I have a strong personal conviction in getting the policy absolutely right. I very much welcome the opportunity to dispel some of the misunderstandings surrounding the child support issue, for which I thank my hon. Friend. I also thank her for raising the concerns of her individual constituent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para20"><a name="10021066000424">It is quite right that, from 2011 to 2014, three schemes will operate within child support: the old scheme, the current scheme and the future scheme. That period will represent a transition as we move from the cumbersome, inefficient older and current schemes towards our streamlined, simplified scheme for the future. Until the transition is complete, child support arrangements for some parents will be governed by the current scheme, while those for others will be governed by the older scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para21"><a name="10021066000425">Sir David Henshaw’s 2006 report on the issue called for a clean break from the past. One of the report’s conclusions was that the existing plans to convert cases from the old scheme to the current scheme would have been prohibitively challenging to administer. Past experience did not make a good case for such an approach, as I am sure that my hon. Friend knows better than me. The bulk transfer of cases between the old and current schemes would not have been possible because the kind of resources needed to facilitate such a transfer would mean diverting funds from where they were most needed—in other words, from supporting the ongoing improvements to the Child Support Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para22"><a name="10021066000426">Following the publication of that report, the Government decided to seek an alternative to the bulk transferring of cases and set out their proposals to reform the system in a White Paper. Those proposals were set down in statute in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008, which provided for the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission to deliver the new child maintenance system and deliver that clean break.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para23"><a name="10021066000427">My hon. Friend suggested that the decision not to transfer all existing old-scheme cases to the current scheme was unfair. Not transferring cases from the old to the current statutory maintenance scheme has inevitably had the result that some non-resident parents might be paying more under the old scheme than the current one.  <br></br>

<meta name="Date" content="10 Feb 2010"/>
<notus-date day="10" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>10 Feb 2010 : Column 318WH</b><br></br>
By the same token, other non-resident parents might be paying less. For every parent who believes that they could gain by moving their case to the current scheme, there is obviously another parent who might lose out. Clearly, to transfer a case to the current scheme on the basis of parental preference would be not only impractical but unfair.</p>

 Will the Minister tell us whether her Department has made an assessment of how many non-resident parents would be better off under the current system—that is, how many would be in the same position as my constituent?</p>

<p><a name="st_171"><a name="10021066000429"><a name="100210h0010.htm_spnew7"><a name="10021066000715"><b>Helen Goodman:</b>
 I do not hold that information at the forefront of my mind, but if I am inspired before the end of the debate, I shall tell my hon. Friend, or otherwise write to her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para24"><a name="10021066000430">It must be stressed that, under the old scheme, the assessment formula was designed to reflect the ability of both parents to contribute to the maintenance of their children. If parents with care had sufficient income, they would be assessed on the same basis as non-resident parents. That could have the effect of reducing the amount of maintenance that non-resident parents were required to pay. I assure my hon. Friend that once Parliament has approved the necessary transition regulations and the future scheme is live and operational—we hope that that will be next year—we will begin to move the old and current cases, which will take three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para25"><a name="10021066000431">It is essential that we devote our resources to the success of the future scheme. The current child maintenance system did not deliver what was expected of it. It was characterised by complexity, inefficiency and a wide lack of understanding. The new system will be simpler, and it will be supported by a fully functioning IT solution. That will enable us to overcome the systemic barriers that hindered past delivery. The future scheme will be faster, more accurate, and more transparent, thanks to a simplified maintenance assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para26"><a name="10021066000432">We are working in partnership with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to build an IT system that will allow us to share information. That will allow us to trace non-resident parents and calculate maintenance payments based on their gross income. The gross income data cover a person’s income before tax is taken or tax credits are added. We believe that that data will provide a better measure of a person’s ability to pay. Working in partnership with HMRC, we will be able to avoid delays. That will enable us to put effective child maintenance arrangements in place more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para27"><a name="10021066000433">The future scheme will enable us to build on the continued success and improvement that the CSA has seen over the last few years. However, it might interest my hon. Friend that in her constituency, by the end of December 2009, we saw an increase of 26 per cent. in the number of children benefiting from maintenance collected or arranged by the CSA since March 2005. The latest figures show that more than 800,000 children are now benefiting from child maintenance. In the years since 2005, we have seen a 12 per cent. rise in the number of parents meeting their maintenance liabilities, which puts the current figure for compliance at nearly 75 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para28"><a name="10021066000434">Through CMEC, the Government have implemented a number of initiatives in the child support system. We have launched “Child Maintenance Options”, which is  <br></br>

a free service that provides information and support to all parents on how to make child maintenance arrangements that best suit their needs. It is also open to friends and family so that other members of the family can seek advice on behalf of their relatives. We are embarking on a wider programme to change attitudes to child maintenance so that everyone understands that it is socially and morally unacceptable not to pay. In a few weeks, the Government will be introducing a full disregard so that parents with care who are claiming benefits can, for the first time, keep all their maintenance and benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para29"><a name="10021066000435">It is estimated that these measures, coupled with others made in October 2008, will lift about 100,000 more children out of poverty than would otherwise have been the case. The improvements and strategies laid out in the future scheme will empower us to do even more for children and give the best possible service to our customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para30"><a name="10021066000436">Before I finish, I shall address a couple of the questions that my hon. Friend raised about her constituent’s case. Officials are still looking into whether appropriate documentation was provided by the parent with care with respect to costs, and I shall write to my hon. Friend about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para31"><a name="10021066000437">My hon. Friend also asked why, in this instance, it was not possible to transfer when transfers can be made in some instances. Broadly speaking, transfers can be made in two situations. The first is when both parents agree that that should be done. As my hon. Friend said, that is unlikely to be so in this case. The second is if a significant change in circumstances has occurred. That does not mean that one person’s income has gone up or down; it could be that one parent has been re-partnered and new children have come into the equation. In the event of such a significant change, all the children would be assessed on the current scheme, because the calculations would interrelate between two or even three families, and then changes would be made.</p>

Friend asked how many non-resident parents would be better off under the current scheme compared with the old scheme. I am sorry to have to tell her that CMEC officials say that they cannot make an estimate without going through all the cases. Although the information would be interesting, they believe that the cost of doing so would be disproportionate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="100210h0010.htm_para33"><a name="10021066000439">I thank my hon. Friend for raising this important matter. Although I realise that her constituent will probably not be satisfied by my answer in respect of his situation, I hope that I have explained why we took the course of action that we did.</p>
