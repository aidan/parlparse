 It is a pleasure to introduce the latest report of the Committees on arms export controls and the Government response under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams. I think that this is the first time that I have spoken when you have been in the Chair. I hope that it will happen on many more occasions. The Committees on arms export controls used to be known as the Quadripartite Committee or, more familiarly, the Quad, but we have rebranded in an effort to be more transparent. At least when we say that we are the Committees on arms export controls, the public, the media and perhaps even hon. Members have a clearer idea of what we are about than was the case when we were called the Quad. Obviously, we are four Select Committees&#151;hence the Quad&#151;which come together to consider arms export policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08032758000008">May I start with a few thanks? First, I thank my colleagues on the Committees for yet again securing a unanimous report. I thank the staff of the Committees for all their efforts. I give particular thanks to our Clerk, Glenn McKee, for his excellent service to the Committees. Finally, I thank all those who gave written and oral evidence to the Committees, and the officials of Departments who had responsibility for preparing answers to our many extremely interesting questions. I am grateful to them all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08032758000009">In the course of the inquiry for the report, we held evidence sessions with the UK Working Group on Arms&#151;a coalition of non-governmental organisations, including Amnesty International UK, Oxfam GB and Saferworld&#151;the Export Group for Aerospace and Defence, which rejoices in the acronym EGAD and is often known as the defence manufacturers; officials from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office for their expertise on the enforcement of export controls; the then Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett); and last, but certainly not least, my hon. Friend the Minister, who was at the time an Under-Secretary of State for International Development. I think that he has now been rebranded and is the Under-Secretary of State for trade and development. I hope that I have got that right. I am delighted that he will respond to the  <br>

debate today. I thank all those who gave evidence to the Committee in one form or another. Self-evidently, our work would have been impossible without their efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08032758000010">The Export Control Act 2002 in effect came into force in 2004 and, in accordance with best practice, the Government announced that they would review the legislation last year. That review is under way. There has been the public consultation process. The Government have published their initial response to that consultation, and the debate continues. Inevitably, given the time at which it was published, much of our report is concerned with reviewing the legislation and making proposals that we hope the Government will take up in relation to that review. As I said, we have had an initial response from the Government. I would be grateful if the Minister told us when the Government&#146;s final response will be published and when drafts of any secondary legislation will be made available to the NGOs, EGAD and the Committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08032758000011">There is good news. Let me start with torture equipment. It might sound odd to say that there is good news in that respect, but for the past 10 years, since 1997, there has been a ban on the export and transhipment from the UK of certain equipment designed for the purposes of torture&#151;for example, electric shock batons, stun guns, leg irons, gang chains and electric shock belts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08032758000012">In our previous report, as a result of evidence supplied by Mark Thomas and Amnesty International UK, we called for the immediate banning of additional instruments of torture, including sting sticks. For those who have not seen them, sting sticks are metal rods about 2 to 3 ft in length with barbs sticking out of them. There is not much that a person can do with one of those things other than hit somebody. I am delighted that the Government have announced that they intend to add sting sticks to the list of restricted goods. The Export Control (Security and Para-military Goods) Order 2008 was laid on 10 March and comes into effect on 6 April&#151;I will probably for ever regard it as the Mark Thomas order. Introducing that order is a good thing to do. Sting sticks are another instrument of torture on the restricted list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08032758000013">As the Government say in paragraph 2.2 of their initial response to the consultation:</p>
<a name="80327h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08032758000179"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Sting sticks are not a general purpose item that could be used in acts of torture. They are designed for the purposes of torture or similar inhumane acts and have no other legitimate use.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08032758000014">I am not sure about the choice of the word &#147;legitimate&#148; there, but I think that we all know what the Government mean. I commend them, as do my colleagues on the Committees, for taking that decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08032758000015">I also congratulate the Government on their decision to introduce an end-use control on torture equipment. Again, the Committees had been pressing for that. It will enable the UK to license, and therefore refuse, the export of any goods from the UK designed for use in torture or similar acts. For the first time, those who knowingly trade in torture equipment, whether or not it is on the specific list of controlled items, will be covered by the law. The Government need to be congratulated on that. It is a very welcome development in our system of arms export controls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08032758000016">I understand and welcome the Government&#146;s intention to introduce that control at EU level. The arms trade, like business generally, is global, and political institutions  <br>

struggle to catch up with that. One reason why I have a strong interest in international affairs is that I think that, increasingly, countries have to co-operate to arrive at sensible solutions. I therefore welcome the fact that the Government are seeking to introduce the control at EU level, but I would like to make the obvious point about what would happen if by any chance the UK were to be rebuffed by our colleagues in the European Union, and that sane, sensible and long-overdue proposal were not to be agreed by other member states&#151;admittedly, today is not a day to be talking of disagreements in the EU. Will the Minister commit the Government to introducing such a control unilaterally, as they have done in other areas, because that is the right thing to do and would set a good example? I hope that we do not have to do it, but we have to address the need for a general end-use control on torture equipment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08032758000017">Arms brokering and extraterritoriality is another issue that the Committees have been exercised about for many years. We welcomed the extraterritorial controls introduced in the 2002 Act, but we have consistently argued that they should be extended to cover all items on the military list, not just some. Today, UK persons abroad are subject to control only if they trade in long-range missiles&#151;missiles with a range of more than 300 km&#151;or torture equipment, or if they trade to an embargoed destination. It seems to us that any UK person who seeks to avoid UK arms export controls by the simple device of leaving the country should be subject to extraterritorial controls. I am delighted to see that the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) is nodding vigorously. He is right.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08032758000019">It does not say control &#147;some&#148; activities and it does not exclude some of the most damaging activities. What were excluded, until the Government&#146;s recent announcement, and what are excluded until this provision is introduced through secondary legislation, are small arms, light weapons and man-portable air defence systems. Small arms and light weapons kill a person every minute in the world today; 500,000 people&#151;men, women and children&#151;are killed by small arms. Small arms are the current weapons of mass destruction. As of today, they are excluded from our extraterritorial controls. I am delighted&#151;as are the Committees&#151;that the Government have now proposed that UK persons who broker small arms, light weapons and MANPADS are to be controlled no matter where they are operating. That is absolutely right. I have to confess that I cannot understand why all conventional weapons are not controlled in that way. The Committees have consistently pressed for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08032758000020">May I ask the Minister why all items on the military list are not to be listed under the new category 2 and subject to extraterritorial controls?

trade in helicopters to a country such as Chad and then find that they are being used on the border with Sudan? Whether or not we introduce re-export clauses would be irrelevant because we would not need a licence for the trade in those particular weapons.</p>

 The hon. Lady makes a significant point, and I will come to re-exports in a moment. On why we should not include other conventional arms, I offer her the Government&#146;s comment. In paragraph 1.7 of their initial response to the public consultation on the review, they said that action was being taken on light weapons</p>
<a name="80327h0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08032758000181"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to ensure that unscrupulous traders cannot pursue deals that concern the UK simply by carrying out the business from another country.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08032758000023">That is precisely the point that we are both making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08032758000024">An obvious way for unscrupulous traders and business people to avoid UK domestic export controls is simply to carry out the business elsewhere. That argument is as valid for other conventional weapons as it is for small arms and light weapons. That is precisely why there should be full extraterritoriality in relation to policy towards brokers. This is the same reason, moreover, why we are concerned about licensed production overseas, why we want to ensure effective end-use monitoring and why we want to tighten up on re-export deals. What is that reason? As I said, it is</p>
<a name="80327h0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08032758000182"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to ensure that unscrupulous traders cannot pursue deals that concern the UK simply by carrying out the business from another country&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08032758000025">the Government&#146;s own words. I welcome and do not wish to diminish the importance of their proposals in relation to small arms. The decision has been welcomed by Amnesty International as a major victory for arms control campaigners. I like to think that our Committees deserve a small bit of credit, as well. However, we need to consider extending those controls to all conventional weapons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08032758000026">On the basis of the evidence that the Committees have received, we have concluded that controls over licensed production overseas are inadequate and need to be extended. We believe that there are advantages in pursuing the third option that the Government proposed in their consultation document, namely that they make export licences for supplies to licensed production facilities or subsidiaries subject to conditions relating to the relevant commercial contracts. For example, permission should be secured before making any onward supplies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08032758000027">Will the Minister tell us when the Government will reach their final conclusions on the options that they identified for controlling licensed production overseas, and will there be an opportunity for comment before the conclusions are finalised? In the past, those of us who argued that this was a major issue have had a response from Government that suggested, &#147;We understand the point that you are making, but it is all very difficult.&#148; I see movement here, but I would like to know when we are likely to get some final thoughts from Government and whether there will be an opportunity to pass comment before those thoughts are finalised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08032758000028">One of the concerns about licensed production overseas is the lack of control over ultimate end use. That takes me to end-use monitoring. The Committees have, for a long time, argued that we need appropriate end-use monitoring. In the past, we have recommended that the  <br>

Government establish a pilot programme of end-use monitoring, focusing on cases in which some degree of risk has been identified. The Government&#146;s standard response has been to say that end-use monitoring is no substitute for a rigorous assessment of a proposed export at the time of application. Therefore, it is all about investigating applications on a case-by-case basis. They indicate that that is the key thing and that there is not a lot we can do about end-use monitoring thereafter. Again, I detect some progress. This time last year, I drew attention to the case of Land Rover Defender military vehicles, which were used by Uzbek troops during the Andijan massacre in May 2005. The Committees raised the matter with the Government, who confirmed that Land Rover had sold flatpack civilian Land Rover Defenders to the Turkish company Otokar. Otokar then assembled them and added its own components to produce a military vehicle. We understand that the vehicles were given to Uzbekistan by Turkey and were used against civilians in the Andijan massacre in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08032758000029">The Government informed the Committees at the time that the UK had no power to control the export of civilian specification Land Rovers, which is entirely true. However, in light of the concerns that have been expressed, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office sent us a memo, which is the last memo in our evidence, page 159. It said:</p>
<a name="80327h0001.htm_brev4"><a name="08032758000183"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In respect of Land Rover...in the light of concerns about supplies to Otokar in Turkey, which were later used in Uzbekistan, special arrangements were agreed with Land Rover UK to more closely monitor supplies made by them to Otokar.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para22"><a name="08032758000030">Evidently, the Government accept the importance, in certain circumstances, of end-use controls and, evidently, they have introduced them. It may have been a voluntary arrangement with Land Rover, but the only conceivable reason for persuading Land Rover into a nice arrangement with the Government was that if it exported any more flatpacks to Otokar there would be some dialogue about where what might turn out to be military vehicles would end up. If that is not about end use, or an attempt at end-use control, I do not know what is. Do the Government accept that, in certain circumstances, there is a case for end-use monitoring, not unlike that which we have discovered the Government have been practising, and for which I praise them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para23"><a name="08032758000031">I tend to think that the only thing that matters with the arms trade is end use. The only thing that matters when we talk about controlling trade in weapons is who gets the weapons at the end of the day, and what they do with them. End use is all that matters; everything else is an attempt to control that end use. I accept the Government&#146;s logic on Otokar and Land Rover. I agree with the Government that we should not ignore end use if it is felt that a UK company is responsible for only the first part of the manufacture of a vehicle in a civilian context. If there are doubts, or if there is evidence to suggest that a UK company might&#151;inadvertently or otherwise&#151;be involved in providing a major component for a military vehicle that might, for example, end up in an embargoed country, the Government should be concerned. I hope that the Minister will confirm that there are circumstances in which end-use monitoring is essential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para24"><a name="08032758000032">The hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) raised the question of re-exports. The example that springs to mind from the last 12 months arose from  <br>

media reports that maritime patrol aircraft that had been exported from the UK to India were to be sold by the Indian Government to Burma. There was a lot of media coverage of that and right hon. and hon. Members may recall the case. We suggested to the then Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South, that the export licence for sending the aircraft to India should require a restriction on resale. I shall come to the general argument about re-exports later, but we made that point in light of the fact that the Indian Government were said to be planning to re-export to Burma. In her evidence to the Committee, the then Secretary of State responded to question 232 by saying:</p>
<a name="80327h0001.htm_brev5"><a name="08032758000184"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;With the benefit of hindsight I suppose one could say it might have been desirable&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para25"><a name="08032758000033">I think, with the benefit of hindsight, that it was desirable. We all learn from experience, so I suggest, and the Committees agree, that it would be desirable for a standard requirement of licensing whereby export contracts for goods on the military list contain a clause to prevent re-export to any destination that is subject to a UN or EU embargo, and for all export contracts to make provision to allow for end-use inspections. I would be grateful if the Minister could advise right hon. and hon. Members what conclusions the Government have reached on those recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para26"><a name="08032758000034">There is not much point having laws if they are not enforced so the question of whether it is worth while breaking the law and paying the fine in the UK environment arises. Penalties for breaching export controls in the UK seem to be rather modest compared with other countries. We received an example in a written submission from the UK Working Group On Arms and, as far as I know, no one has challenged the facts of the case. In the US, for example, the ITT Corporation was convicted and fined $100 million for illegally sending classified night vision technology that is used in military operations to China and Singapore and setting up a front company to escape detection. I repeat: that company was fined $100 million. By contrast, last year, a UK company, Avocado Research Chemicals Ltd, was found&#151;despite its attractive name&#151;to have unlawfully exported two controlled chemicals. I shall not attempt to pronounce the name of the first of those, but it is a possible precursor to VX gas; the other was hafnium, which can be used in the production of nuclear fuel rods. They were exported to a broker in Egypt, which is not a signatory to the chemical weapons convention, yet the company was fined only &#163;600 plus &#163;100 costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para27"><a name="08032758000035">It is not only members of our Committees who think that there might be companies out there that think that it is okay or more economical to break the rules and pay the fine. When EGAD gave evidence a week ago, it was asked about the contrast in the penalties between the US and the UK. EGAD replied that</p>
<a name="80327h0001.htm_brev6"><a name="08032758000185"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;from a company&#146;s perspective...non-compliance with the UK system can make economic sense but non-compliance with the US system never makes economic sense&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="80327h0001.htm_para28"><a name="08032758000036">I put it to the Minister that that is an indictment of the UK&#146;s enforcement regime. It is not a criticism of those who seek to enforce the law but of the nature of the penalties that are handed out. I would appreciate it if the Minister commented on the issue.</p>

The report congratulates the Government on their support for a ban on so-called dumb cluster bombs and on their commitment to withdraw the UK stocks with immediate effect.

The issue is important not only because cluster munitions have caused enormous damage to men, women and children all over the planet, but because progress on an international ban on cluster munitions under the Oslo process is urgent. In May, which is very close, a treaty of some kind will be signed in Dublin. I welcome the Government&#146;s support for the Oslo process but&#151;I am speaking personally&#151;I am concerned that they seem to be pushing for exemptions that could weaken the treaty. I hope that I am wrong, and I hope that the Minister will tell me that the Government will not seek limitations in the treaty that will weaken it or create loopholes.</p>

 Does the hon.

 I agree. My views on cluster munitions go beyond those of the Committees. Although the right hon. Gentleman must speak for himself, I suspect that what he just said goes beyond what the Committees have said, but he is absolutely right. In a personal capacity, I have met the Secretary of State for Defence and other Ministers to discuss the issue. I remain unconvinced that there is a case for the Government to retain their so-called smart cluster munitions. I do not think that a good military case has been made at all, and the implications in terms of civilian casualties are so great that I strongly support the tightest possible international ban on cluster munitions.</p>

I am simply passing on to the Minister my personal view&#151;I suspect that it is shared by other Members&#151;that we do not want exemptions; we want a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions. The ban on anti-personnel land mines involved a similar argument, as the right hon. Gentleman said. The Government led the way on that issue, and I hope that they will do the same on this one.</p>

 I commend my hon. Friend on yet another good report. It is an annual event, and he performs admirably. If he does not mind, I shall talk through him to the Minister. Surely my hon. Friend agrees that we cannot afford to repeat what happened at Oslo, where the British representative was left&#151;to put it mildly, as anyone will know who has read the text&#151;effectively trying to perform what could only be described as the last-ditch defence of the Alamo. It did not do Britain&#146;s reputation on the matter any good. More than anything, because there is clearly a split among Ministries, the least that the British Government could do is to come up with a cohesive and defensible line. One hopes, as my hon.

 I agree with my hon. Friend. The Government deserve credit not just for what they have done but what they are doing. They are playing a significant role in seeking to secure an effective international arms trade treaty. Again, I praise them for that&#151;one of the reasons why we need an international treaty is to deal with the arms trade&#151;but I do not believe that their efforts will be enhanced if they are seen to backslide on the Oslo process in relation to cluster munitions. I could not possibly speculate whether one Department has a different view from other Departments; that is an internal Government matter. I would be astonished if there were not one message. Seriously, though, I believe that the Government should sing a consistent song on cluster munitions and on other international measures to control the arms trade.</p>

The more we can agree responses and controls at the European and international levels, the better. This is not an era in which individual countries can sort out such problems on their own any more than they can sort out problems arising from globalisation, or indeed reap its benefits. They can, however, set examples, so an international agreement should be sought, but failing that, there is a duty to act unilaterally to make progress where possible.</p>

Let us be perfectly frank: the position on arms export control policy and its transparency and accountability are light years ahead of what they were 11 years ago at the time of the Scott report on arms to Iraq&#151;and to Iran, as we discovered. This country has made enormous progress in bringing the arms trade under some kind of effective control and scrutiny, and the Government deserve credit for that, but there are still concerns.</p>

There should be no incentives for anyone to say, &#147;It&#146;s more economical for my business to break the law and pay the fine.&#148; That cannot be right, and it cannot be right to allow the plethora of cluster munitions around the world to increase. I hope that the Government&#146;s final response to the welcome review of the 2002 Act will enable those and other serious loopholes to be plugged as quickly as possible.

 It is a pleasure to follow again in the wake of the hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry). Once again, with much efficiency and great capability, he has taken the Committees on strategic export controls through another year of scrutiny of this complex but extremely important policy area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="80327h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08032758000050">I shall deal with just two policy areas, one of which the hon. Gentleman referred to and the other of which he no doubt did not have time to include in his remarks. I shall start by putting the issue of extraterritoriality into simple terms. It is the key issue of how far the UK criminal law should be extended overseas to ensure that British traffickers and brokers of arms transactions do not escape British criminal law by carrying on overseas transactions that would be criminal offences, if they were carried out within the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="80327h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08032758000051">The principle of extraterritoriality is no longer contentious. While we were working to produce the latest report, the Library kindly researched the issue, and the fruits of that research are published in the annexe to our report. Hon. Members will see that there are 25 separate items of existing legislation that extend extraterritoriality in one sphere or another. Interestingly, that legislation goes back some 150 years. Our distinguished Victorian predecessors, when they passed the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, apparently became the first Parliament to extend extraterritoriality to bigamy, which I am sure hon. Members will endorse as an excellent decision. That has continued through 24 other separate pieces of legislation, right up to the Terrorism Act 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="80327h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08032758000052">The difference between the Committees and the Government is therefore no longer one of principle; indeed, the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the right hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) conceded the principle of extending extraterritoriality to the trafficking and brokering of  <br>

arms five years ago. Sadly, although she conceded the principle when she introduced her legislation, she did not concede about 99.9 per cent. recurring of the substance. At one end of the scale, she extended extraterritoriality to instruments of torture, while at the other end&#151;certainly in terms of range&#151;she extended it to long-range ground-to-ground missiles with a range of more than 300 km. As we all know, however, virtually all trafficking and brokering of arms takes place in other categories of weapons and munitions, all of which escaped the initial provisions that the Government laid down five years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="80327h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08032758000053">I acknowledge that the Government have made some significant progress, and I applaud them for that, but we have not gone as far as the Committees would wish.

Given that the Government have made those concessions, the Minister may feel that it is somewhat churlish to press for more, but I have no hesitation at all about doing so. As I see it, the Government have ended the anomaly of conceding the principle without offering anything of substance, but they have ended up with an even more glaring set of anomalies, given the weapons that have now been brought within the ambit of extraterritoriality and those that have been left outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="80327h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08032758000055">I have combed through the initial decision document, and I want to highlight some of those anomalies. Extraterritoriality will, for example, be extended to man-portable weapons, but it will be excluded from vehicle-portable weapons. Extraterritoriality will be extended to dumb cluster bombs, but it will be excluded from smart cluster bombs. Extraterritoriality will be extended to mortars up to 75 mm in calibre, but it will be excluded from mortars over 75 mm in calibre. Extraterritoriality will be extended to unmanned military aircraft, but it will be excluded from manned military aircraft, both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Extraterritoriality will be extended to surface-to-air missiles, which are primarily defensive, but it will be excluded from air-to-surface missiles, which are primarily offensive. Extraterritoriality will be extended to surface-to-surface missiles of more than 300 km in range, but it will be excluded from surface-to-surface missiles of less than 300 km in range. I will not take up more of hon. Members&#146; time by going through the anomalies, but hon. Members will understand&#151;certainly if they go through the document&#151;that it is not difficult to compile a list of scores more of the anomalies that are being created by the Government&#146;s position.</p>

proceeding in the way in which they have. I cannot believe that they do not accept the desirability of the principle that we advocate of extending extraterritoriality so that the arm of the British criminal law can reach British traffickers and brokers overseas who are involved in transactions that would be criminal offences in the UK. Surely the Government believe that that is an immensely desirable principle, and I cannot believe that they do not understand the desirability of extending it in that way. I do not for one moment believe that they want to connive in British persons evading criminal jurisdiction, so why do they not accept the Committees&#146; recommendation? The case is overwhelming. The Government have published what they say are their initial decisions, but they have not reached their final conclusions, even at this late moment. Again, I urge the Minister and his colleagues in the Government to accept in full the recommendations of the Committees on strategic export controls.</p>

Member for Kingswood said that this was not the day for controversy over anything relating to the EU, but there are slight differences within the EU on this issue, and I have no qualms about raising it even today. The Committees&#146; position is extremely clear. In our report, we said:</p>

Members on both sides of the House share this feeling&#151;for the Tibetan Buddhist monks who have come out to demonstrate entirely peacefully in Lhasa and elsewhere, in the past two or three weeks, in the certain knowledge that as a result they face the appalling features of the Chinese prison and torture system.

Hon. Members may be interested to know that two years ago I had the good fortune to go with members of the Foreign Affairs Committee to the Sera monastery. I sat on the couch next to the abbot and looked across the room to the wall facing me. There, staring down at me, was a portrait of Chairman Mao in a Buddhist monastery. That spelled out everything about the way in which the Chinese, as a matter of deliberate and sustained policy, have done all that they can to eliminate, as far as possible, Tibetan identity, including language, culture and the sense of being Tibetan in religion. That policy, coupled both with what has been going on in the rest of China&#151;its appalling rate of capital punishment, its prison system, the one-party state and the absence of freedom of expression&#151;and with events overseas and Chinese Government support for regimes such as those of Burma and, as the hon.

<a name="80327h0002.htm_brev5"><a name="08032758000191"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Leaders also discussed the EU arms embargo.

The EU side recognised the importance of this issue and confirmed its willingness to carry forward work towards lifting the embargo on the basis of the Joint Statement of the 2004 EU-China Summit and subsequent European Council Conclusions.&#148;</p>

On 5 December the Chinese Xinhua news agency reported that President Sarkozy had, during his visit, demanded the removal of the embargo.

The system that has been instituted for strategic export controls is one of which the Government and the country can be proud, and although further improvements may still be required, it is important to make the point that the system, and parliamentary scrutiny of it, have provided all hon.

given wholly false assurances to the British Government over previous arms sales: they assured the Government that the equipment would not be used in the occupied territories. Thanks to the vigilance of our embassy employees, it was found that vehicles had been modified and used in the occupied territories, thus demonstrating that any future assurances given by the Israeli authorities were not trustworthy and could not be relied upon. I am pleased, therefore, about the evidence that the British Government are looking carefully at applications for arms exports to Israel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para2"><a name="08032758000076">Having said that, I was slightly disturbed by a quote from the previous Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett), in which she pointed out that only 0.1 per cent. of Israel&#146;s total arms exports comes from the United Kingdom. She appeared to be saying, therefore, not that what we do does not matter, but that it is not that important. However, I think that it is very important not simply because the UK Government should not be complicit in arms being used in a way contrary to international law, but because by exercising such controls we send a clear message to foreign Governments about the standards that the Government believe should be upheld. Israel has a strong arms industry of its own, which means that it can plug any gaps, but the fact that the level of our arms sales to Israel is so low sets an example and sends a strong message that we believe that international law should be adhered to in all circumstances and that we exercise such controls because we do not believe that the Israeli Government adhere to international law in all circumstances. It is right to send that strong and powerful message to the Israeli Government and public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08032758000077">I shall make a slight digression. I have raised before the technical issue about which of our arms export criteria apply to the occupied territories. Clearly, there is no internal oppression by the Israeli Government, because it is clear under international law that the occupied territories are just that&#151;occupied&#151;and not part of Israel. Neither is Israel acting aggressively against another country, because there is not yet a recognised Palestinian state. I suppose that they could fall under the middle criteria about not provoking or prolonging armed conflict, or aggravating existing tensions or conflicts, in the country of final destination, but again the occupied territories are not a recognised country. I am not saying, &#147;Well, therefore, it does not matter and we can export any old arms to Israel for use in the occupied territories, because they are not covered by the criteria&#148;. I simply point out that the criteria appear to leave a slight gap when one country using arms is occupying another territory that does not have statehood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para4"><a name="08032758000078">I want to reiterate the point that the Israeli Government have form in using high and low-tech weapons carelessly and without sufficient concern in areas where civilians will obviously be hit&#151;I am not saying that they deliberately target civilians. I have seen the effect of those policies in Gaza, and particularly in southern Lebanon, which I visited immediately after the war. The consequences in southern Lebanon, and parts of Beirut, of the Israeli bombardment were appalling. The bombardment was clearly wholly disproportionate and demonstrated complete disregard for civilian casualties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para5"><a name="08032758000079">Commonly, the Israeli Government use the excuse that their opponents&#151;Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas, and others, in Gaza&#151;are responsible for civilian damage,  <br>

because they release rockets against Israeli territory from areas where civilians live. I make no justification for the behaviour of Hezbollah or Hamas, but I strenuously reject the notion that because rockets are fired from civilian areas the Israeli Government are absolved of their responsibility to act within international law in all circumstances.</p>

Our Government know that it is the responsibility of the Government using weapons to assure themselves that the probability of civilian damage is extremely low and that they are taking all possible care to avoid civilian casualties. On the other hand, the Israelis have used bunker-buster bombs in southern Lebanon and other high-tech weapons in Gaza, supposedly to assassinate &#147;targets&#148;&#151;known militants. They are aware of the level of tolerance in the accuracy of their weapons and they know that they are using them in densely populated areas so they cannot possibly be reasonably assured that they do not present a huge risk of innocent civilian deaths. Figures from Gaza clearly demonstrate a very high number of innocent civilians being killed using those methods.</p>

They now eschew negotiation and seem to believe that they can achieve a military solution. Not only do they use military action against the armed groups in a way that shows blatant disregard for collateral civilian damage, but they involve themselves&#151;either directly or by turning a blind eye to what other groups do&#151;in the wholesale repression of, and discrimination against, the Tamil population at large.

The country faces relatively few external threats, but for a country of its nature, its spending on defence is large and growing. As I mentioned, it has also used high-tech weapons&#151;fighter jets in particular&#151;disproportionately and caused a significant number of civilian deaths and injuries. One of my constituents drew my attention in particular to one of their schools where the fighter jets were used, presumably against an armed group, but hit and damaged the school and injured a number of children.</p>

We have to produce our reports unanimously, and with four component parts, it is not always easy. However, it is relatively easy because of the good will shown by all members of the committee, which means that when we produce reports and recommendations, they are far more effective.

I should be grateful if the Minister in his reply at least clarified why there is still some level of arms exports, and military co-operation and co-operation with the authorities in Colombia. The Minister for the Middle East recently visited Colombia and was photographed with leading military figures in the country, so I should be grateful for clarification of the position of Her Majesty&#146;s Government on Colombia and the human rights issues there.</p>

It was mentioned in an intervention earlier that Chinese arms exports to Sudan are a matter of some concern, as are its arms exports to Zimbabwe. Given that both Sudan and Zimbabwe are on the list of major countries of concern on human rights, there is an indirect consequence. Therefore, the human rights dialogue that Britain and the European Union have with the Chinese should also focus on China&#146;s arms exports policy, as well as the wider issues of concern.</p>

 This has been a very good debate. There may be only a few speakers here, but they are all very knowledgeable and their contributions have been of high quality.

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08032758000099">This is an excellent report. It seems to me that the committee is always careful to balance justified support for a legitimate and important business in the UK with the question of adequate control and ethics. There is no doubt that the arms industry is important to the UK economy and to Britain&#146;s influence abroad. However, our reputation is also dependent on the ethics and practice of those countries with which we trade, and on the transparency and probity of our relationships with those countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para24"><a name="08032758000100">I will not attempt to deal with everything in the report today; rather, I just want to address a few specific issues that I hope the Minister can clarify. First, I want to say something about the power of the committee itself. It clearly works well. Everyone on it feels that it is an example of cross-departmental work that could be held up as a model for many other areas, where we could do with far more breaking up of silos and a different type of thinking. The committee&#146;s reports have all been very thoughtful and the conclusions have been reached through consensus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para25"><a name="08032758000101">Despite those obvious strengths, however, it remains true that the committee has the power to scrutinise licensing of arms exports only retrospectively. It recommends in the report before us that it should have the power to scrutinise particularly sensitive arms transfers. The Government have not dealt with that recommendation in their response, and I wonder whether the Minister might do so today. The committee suggests that a trial period could be established so that such scrutiny could be applied to countries that have previously been under embargo, or in cases where there have been particularly sensitive or precedent-setting licences. I hope that the Government will agree to pilot that use of a trial period, if nothing else.</p>

arms industry in general. The first recommendation is on re-export clauses, which other Members have already referred to. The committee recommended that</p>
<a name="80327h0003.htm_brev1"><a name="08032758000194"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it should become a standard requirement of licensing that export contracts for goods on the Military List contain a clause preventing re-export to a destination subject to UN or EU embargo.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para27"><a name="08032758000103">In their response to the report, the Government said that they would deal with that recommendation as part of the review of the Export Control Act 2002, but in their initial report they made no mention of that. What is the Government&#146;s thinking on this subject, and are they intending to include re-export clauses when they produce their final response to the review of the 2002 Act?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para28"><a name="08032758000104">The Chairman of the committee, the hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry), mentioned the transfer of British-made maritime patrol aircraft from India to Burma. The thought of that transfer made us all feel deeply queasy, particularly if one thinks of last autumn, when we watched the oppression in Burma of monks, especially in Rangoon. It makes me very queasy to think that, whatever advances we may have made on control of arms transfers, we seem to have little influence beyond the initial arms transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para29"><a name="08032758000105">The second issue relates to extraterritorial jurisdiction. The committee made another very clear recommendation: that</p>
<a name="80327h0003.htm_brev2"><a name="08032758000195"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Government should bring forward proposals to extend the extra-territorial provisions of the export control legislation to encompass trade in all items on the Military List.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para30"><a name="08032758000106">The Government have made significant advances by including light weapons and small arms in the military list. I also acknowledge the point made by the hon. Member for Kingswood that small arms are the current weapons of mass destruction. I thought that that was a very good way of explaining the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="80327h0003.htm_para31"><a name="08032758000107">However, the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley) made an absolutely devastating critique of the anomalies concerning what is included in the military list at the moment and what is not. I cite the example of what might happen if aircraft and vehicles were sold to Chad. No licence would be required if that sale took place from abroad and those aircraft and vehicles could then be used on the border with Sudan. There is a separate point about whether they could then be re-exported into Sudan. Even if the Government were to adopt the re-export clauses that the committee has been calling for, it would make no difference in that situation, unless the arms or vehicles are already included under a licensing agreement.</p>

However, I agree entirely with both the hon. Member for Kingswood and the right hon.

to stockpile even though they say that they wish to see the end of stockpiling of such weapons. That shows the poor distinction between the two types of munitions. Will the Minister say what his intentions are for the forthcoming treaty? What definitions of cluster munitions do the Government intend to use as they seek, I hope, to move toward a worldwide ban later this year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para1"><a name="08032758000109">The third issue that I want to discuss is end-use monitoring. I welcome the view of the Government and the committee that EU-wide end-use monitoring is vital, but the hon. Member for Kingswood made a good point about the need to move toward end-use monitoring of torture equipment from a UK perspective. The Government have already instituted end-use monitoring of some sensitive transfers, and I wonder why they have been so unwilling to introduce a system of end-use monitoring of particularly sensitive contracts. It clearly is not practical to introduce such monitoring on all transfers&#151;that would be impossible&#151;but having a system that dealt with obviously sensitive transfers would be a sensible way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para2"><a name="08032758000110">Since the report, there have been several changes to the Government&#146;s system of support for the arms industry. The abolition of the Defence Export Services Organisation was largely welcomed by everyone, but the full consequences of its move to UK Trade &amp; Investment have yet to be seen. I hope that it will signal a shift such that the Government&#146;s support for the arms industry, which needs to be specialist because of the nature of the industry, will not be substantially greater in value than their support for other industries that are equally or even more important to the UK economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para3"><a name="08032758000111">Continuing in that vein, the continued underwriting of risk through the export credits guarantee scheme must have had its day. Estimates of the scheme&#146;s cost to the UK taxpayer vary from &#163;150 million a year to four times that level by some NGOs. The Government have always justified the ECG by claiming that companies often have to trade with countries that do not have developed insurance markets, but that is surely an outdated view in a well-developed derivatives market. It is difficult to see why the taxpayer should pick up the risk for such deals, given that private companies keep the profits. Similarly, the accounts of the Export Credits Guarantee Department remain somewhat opaque, and that lack of transparency leads to a widespread suspicion of bad practice. I think that the transparency issue was another reason why the committee made several recommendations on combating bribery and corruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para4"><a name="08032758000112">There is a widespread view that the Government&#146;s decision to halt the inquiry into the al-Yamamah arms deal severely damaged the UK&#146;s reputation in the fight against corruption. That is certainly the view of the Foreign Affairs Committee; it also my view and that of my party. I shall not rehearse the entire debate at length, as this is not the appropriate time, but I note that this issue underscores the need for the Government to be clear and straightforward about their anti-corruption policies. They must be seen to make progress on that issue because of the impact of that decision on the UK&#146;s reputation abroad. The committee recommended that the Government should press for provisions to be included in the arms trade treaty to promote good governance and to combat bribery and corruption. I would strongly support such moves, but there is no reason why such provisions could not already be included  <br>

in licences. I reiterate the point made by the hon. Member for Kingswood about including criterion 8 as a means of assessment. He asked the Minister to update us regarding the review into that issue, and I, too, hope that the Minister will address that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para5"><a name="08032758000113">Let me turn to issues of enforcement and practice rather than the need for new laws. According to parliamentary answers given in 2006, there were more than 500 breaches of arms export controls between 2000 and 2005, but just four successful prosecutions. Those cases included export seizures and unlicensed exports that were referred to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs by compliance officers from the Department of Trade and Industry. In his initial remarks, the hon. Member for Kingswood said that the current, low penalties do not particularly influence or affect behaviour, and seem to be poor at preventing infringement of the law. Will the Minister tell me how many staff currently scrutinise licences in the export control department? There is no point in having great law if we do not have the resources to enforce it, or if we do not ensure that there are significant consequences for breaching it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para6"><a name="08032758000114">The arms industry is highly complex and five Departments are involved in monitoring it, while four Departments are involved in scrutinising it through the committee. There have been incidents of arms exports being approved in apparent breaches of the Government&#146;s own international policy priorities. An obvious example is the 2001 deal to sell a military air traffic control system to Tanzania for &#163;28 million. That was an odd decision, given that Tanzania is one of the world&#146;s poorest countries. The World Bank described the deal as a waste of money. It is obvious that we need a more joined-up approach within government, and I hope that the Government will consider how to ensure that their internal policies, particularly on international affairs, are being fed through to the scrutiny of licences and, therefore, the transfer of arms. The sale of arms is not a morality-free zone; it differs from other industries in that regard. I acknowledge that the Government have made significant progress in the past 10 years, but significantly more needs to be done.</p>

Our process of scrutiny in this important field is envied by many Parliaments around the world. The hon. Gentleman is clearly holding the Government to account, and that accountability is clearly having an effect on them. Several Members have spoken today, although perhaps not quite enough for some. They have mentioned individual countries, but I shall try to avoid that because I want to keep to the generality of the report. It is a big report and I shall cover some areas that have already been covered, but others that have not.</p>

the auspices of the Ministry of Defence to functioning under UK Trade &amp; Investment. This country has a proud heritage of exporting arms, which is something that we depend on. Furthermore, we have been a lead player in promoting peace, human rights and decency within our borders and around the world, and our defence export industry contributes positively to the continuity of that profile. We need to uphold the highest standards in the world, so it is welcome that the Committees on strategic export controls were able to report, on page 20, that</p>
<a name="80327h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08032758000196"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Export Control Act 2002 has provided a sound legislative basis for controlling and regulating the UK&#146;s strategic exports&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para9"><a name="08032758000118">On the whole, it is a good report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para10"><a name="08032758000119">In the face of rapid and growing globalisation, technological advances, the ever-changing nature of threats and the rise and rise of global terrorism, the challenges of legislating for and controlling exports can rarely have been greater. While remembering the positive changes that have been made since 2002, we must be all too aware of the &#147;gaps and shortcomings&#148; mentioned on page 20, on which I shall comment. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s answers on that issue. The report is detailed and constructive, and I hope that the Government are able to use its recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para11"><a name="08032758000120">I want to touch on the important subject of compliance, because, whatever system one has, its effect is completely weakened if compliance is not good enough. The report states on evidence page 155, in the memorandum from David Hayes:</p>
<a name="80327h0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08032758000197"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;More OGELs&#148;&#151;</p>

Can it really be accepted that an industry with 2 per cent. of GDP accounts for 66 per cent. of export licences and there is not an export control compliance problem with the industries accounting for the remaining 98 per cent. of GDP?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para13"><a name="08032758000122">Of course, that is deeply troubling given the rise of dual-use export products for use in torture, which has been referred to frequently in this debate, and violent displays of internal repression. In the transcript of oral evidence from 20 March, Mr. Oliver Sprague from Amnesty International UK suggests that the situation with OGELs is not that</p>
<a name="80327h0004.htm_brev3"><a name="08032758000199"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;all they do is allow non-sensitive equipment to non-sensitive destinations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para14"><a name="08032758000123">I have received from the Defence Manufacturer&#146;s Association a note about a real situation of non-compliance, in which the exporter stated:</p>
<a name="80327h0004.htm_brev4"><a name="08032758000200"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Export control only catches arms, and is actually nothing to do with my key component for a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile.&#148;</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para16"><a name="08032758000125">We have a situation where only 35 per cent. of companies that should be applying for export licences actually do so. Obviously, we must not ignore military exports, but I feel that there is much greater need for discussion of compliance within the dual-use and academic sectors, as in general the defence sector has a commendable record of compliance. I am sure that all Members would be most interested in hearing the Minister&#146;s response to the report&#146;s severe criticisms of the licensing regime for dual-use categories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para17"><a name="08032758000126">The Minister will note further that Mr. Sprague remarked that the misuse of OGELs stood at 5 per cent. in 2004, 8 per cent. in 2005 and 11 per cent. in 2006. That is a worrying upward trend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para18"><a name="08032758000127">It was further suggested by David Hayes in his evidence that non-compliance emerges</p>
<a name="80327h0004.htm_brev5"><a name="08032758000201"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;for two reasons: ignorance of the controls coupled with a lack of consequences arising from non-compliance.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08032758000128">That is on evidence page 154. He further stated in his oral evidence that</p>
<a name="80327h0004.htm_brev6"><a name="08032758000202"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;non-compliance with the UK system can make economic sense but non-compliance with the US system never makes economic sense.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para20"><a name="08032758000129">That was a point that the Chairman of the Committees made amply in his excellent speech. He used the example of the ITT Corporation in the United States, which was fined $100 million for non-compliance, whereas Avocado Research Chemicals was fined only &#163;100 plus costs. It must surely never be the case in any compliance system that it makes economic sense to pay the fine and ignore the regulations. That cannot be right, and I ask the Minister what he proposes to do about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para21"><a name="08032758000130">The issue of non-compliance with the regulations does not cease with domestic importers. The report suggests on page 91 that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para22"><a name="08032758000131">Unfortunately, one has to look no further than the next sentence, which tells us that the committee has &#147;serious concerns about enforcement&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para23"><a name="08032758000132">As the case is mentioned in the report, the committee will no doubt be aware of the discovery by Mr. Mark Thomas at the UK Police and Security Fair&#151;the so-called IFSEC&#151;that a representative of Echo Industrial Company from China had three electroshock devices on public display. It is reassuring to note that Mr. Sam Shar of the company was subsequently convicted of possession, but he was regarded as small fry&#151;too small for the Crown Prosecution Service to warrant continuing the investigation into his dealing activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para24"><a name="08032758000133">What was troubling about the case was that when the prosecution branch of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs was asked to investigate what was a prima facie breach&#151;instruments of torture were on display&#151;somebody from the organisation had to be summoned from the nearest airport in Birmingham. It seems to me that the very least one would expect is that enforcement officers would be on site at a major arms fair, available to deal with possible breaches and inquiries relating to breaches. That situation needs to be looked into.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para25"><a name="08032758000134">I shall comment on the international system. Although the actual enforcement of the legislation and its inference for those who should have it has been demonstrated as lacking both through the committee&#146;s words and through examples of actual failure, the UK currently has one of the most effective and broadly-based strategic export control systems in the world, but, as has been stated by several Members, there are great concerns about extraterritoriality. Members have given the example of maritime surveillance aircraft being exported to India and then re-exported to Burma. Members on both sides of the House have said that there should be a standard paragraph in every contract to prevent such re-exporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para26"><a name="08032758000135">I turn to another subject that is mentioned in the report: defence attach&#233;s. One of the ways that the regime can be affected is by the gathering of effective intelligence. I am fully aware of the evidence of the Secretary of State for Defence to the committee. He stated:</p>
<a name="80327h0004.htm_brev8"><a name="08032758000204"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The principal role of the defence attache in the 21st century is to help strengthen international peace and stability...help boost peace support operations and to reduce the risks of terrorism.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para27"><a name="08032758000136">He went on to say that he estimated that only about 5 per cent. of a defence attach&#233;&#146;s time is involved in dealing with strategic licensing issues, but that is not the point. The point is that one never knows when that 5 per cent. might come into operation. The attach&#233; spends 100 per cent. of his time looking for opportunities and intelligence, and one never knows when the 5 per cent. might come into operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para28"><a name="08032758000137">We need to look carefully at the number of defence attach&#233;s we have around the world. Wherever I have met them, I found that they perform an admirable role and that they bed in well with other Foreign Office officials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para29"><a name="08032758000138">In paragraph 272, the committee raised an important subject: electronic transfers. They will become increasingly important. After all, at the touch of a button it is possible nowadays to send any form of technological specification and, indeed, detailed plans and maps electronically around the world. That will become increasingly difficult to detect. The committee referred to e-mail</p>
<a name="80327h0004.htm_brev9"><a name="08032758000205"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as a means to transfer entire software packages or detailed technical manuals&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para30"><a name="08032758000139">I welcome the words on page 24 of the Government&#146;s response to the committee that they</p>
<a name="80327h0004.htm_brev10"><a name="08032758000206"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will continue to keep under review the need for legislative or operational changes to reflect technological or other developments in this field.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para31"><a name="08032758000140">That is a welcome response. I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to that important subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para32"><a name="08032758000141">In conclusion, I would like to say something about the role of the Defence Export Services Organisation and UK Trade and Investment. Defence is an important industry for the country, bringing some &#163;5 billion-worth of exports. I would like to think that the Minister will be satisfying himself that UKTI is at least building on progress, now that responsibility has been transferred to that organisation. We in the Opposition have severe doubts about that and, like other Members, we will watch carefully how UKTI performs in the role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para33"><a name="08032758000142">As I have made clear throughout my speech, this report is an important element in the scrutiny of the Government&#146;s functioning in this field. There are gaps and shortcomings in the current legislation and, inevitably, the task of dealing with such a complex area will present numerous challenges. It is fair to say that you cannot please all the people all the time, but we should never be led into complacency. There is always room for improvements. The British Government have one of the highest records in upholding human rights. Let us make sure that we have such a record in respect of our arms trade as well.</p>

the first time, Mr. Williams. I join other hon. Members in taking this opportunity to celebrate the work of the Committees on strategic export controls. I commend committee members generally and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry) in particular for chairing the committee. No Minister who has had the privilege of appearing before the committee has dared take such an appearance lightly. I am sure that hon. Members think that that is entirely appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para34"><a name="08032758000144">I am responding to this debate in the absence of my colleague the Minister for Energy, who has immediate responsibility for this issue but who is unable to attend today. I hope to do justice to the many questions asked and comments made by hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para35"><a name="08032758000145">Let me begin with some context. The Government are committed to maintaining a strong defence industry as part of our industrial base. The industry is important not only because of the jobs that it directly creates, but because of the many jobs that are reliant on it and because of the spin-offs to other parts of the economy generated by a strong defence industry. We have a world-class defence sector. We are the second largest exporter of defence equipment in the world, with exports close to &#163;10 billion last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para36"><a name="08032758000146">As all hon. Members have rightly mentioned, there are occasions when the industry is particularly controversial. In a debate such as this, however, we should also celebrate the fact that, actually, the defence industry&#151;particularly the UK defence industry&#151;can be a significant force for good. The key is ensuring that export controls in this country strike the right balance. Defence exports can contribute to international stability, help strengthen collective defence relationships and contribute to important humanitarian work, which is why last year we approved some 15 licences for exports to equip and support, for example, United Nations peacekeepers operating in a number of difficult settings around the world. We need to get that balance right in terms of the way in which our defence sector operates. That is why we refused a series of licences because of human rights concerns in a number of countries. I will return to the specific countries that hon. Members have mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="80327h0004.htm_para37"><a name="08032758000147">As hon. Members have acknowledged, we have one of the best-regulated defence industries. Our controls are acknowledged as being among the most rigorous in the world. However, not content with the improved regulation of our defence sector, we are taking the lead on the introduction of an international arms trade treaty. There is now wide support for the principle of an arms trade treaty, but there is still substantial work to be done on agreeing what should be in such a treaty. Given the expertise in the Chamber today, I am sure that all hon. Members will recognise the considerable complexity of the discussions that are under way about what such a treaty should contain. We want an arms trade treaty to help set global standards for the arms trade to ensure respect for human rights, international humanitarian law, sustainable development and good governance, at the same time as allowing states to participate in the arms trade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para0"><a name="08032758000148">It is worth mentioning that our country has been an important supporter of the UN programme of action on small arms and light weapons. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood has rightly pointed out that the trade in small arms and light weapons is the part of the arms trade that does most damage in facilitating the  <br>

abuse of human rights, causing instability and preventing development. That programme of action commits all UN member states to controlling small arms through better export control, improving the way in which stockpiles of weapons are managed and taking measures to take weapons out of circulation. That programme of action is particularly important in countries affected by conflict and violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para1"><a name="08032758000149">The UK has provided more than &#163;31 million to help states implement those commitments under the UN programme of action. For example, we have funded the Nairobi-based Regional Center on Small Arms, which has helped to strengthen controls in east Africa. We have also supported Viva Rio, a non-governmental organisation that has helped collect and destroy some 600,000 weapons in Brazil and that provides young gang members with alternatives to violence. The UN programme of action is scheduled for review again this summer. We will encourage UN member states to use the opportunity of that review to step up efforts to help those states most seriously affected by gun violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para2"><a name="08032758000150">Throughout last year, we took steps to improve further how we operate the licensing arrangements. Hon. Members, particularly members of the Committees, will be aware that we introduced a new IT system last September that allows applications to be issued and processed online. Perhaps most importantly, in terms of today&#146;s debate and the points raised by hon. Members, we also began the review of export control legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para3"><a name="08032758000151">On that review, we need to ensure that export controls are having the intended effect and that there are not disproportionate burdens on business. We need to recognise, in terms of how trade is conducted, that we live in a rapidly changing world. That is why the public consultation document included a wide range of options on further change and sought evidence and views from respondents generally and, in particular, from experts in the sector. We received 23 substantive submissions from a range of groups, including NGOs and industry, and more than 5,000 letters and e-mails touching on a range of individual points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para4"><a name="08032758000152">As my hon. Friend has set out, the Government&#146;s initial response to that consultation was published on 6 February, and in it we committed to introducing change in areas of concern to the committee. Notably, as the Prime Minister announced in November, we committed to extending export laws to control brokering and trafficking of small arms by UK persons anywhere in the world and extending the controls on man-portable air defence systems and certain cluster munitions to UK persons anywhere in the world. As my hon. Friend has said, that commitment will add sting sticks to UK-listed torture equipment. We will also seek to start European Union negotiations to introduce a new torture end-use control. That is a significant package, as my hon. Friend has acknowledged, and it will lead to significant enhancements in our controls in areas where there have been concerns in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para5"><a name="08032758000153">My hon. Friend asked specifically when we would publish our conclusive response to the consultation. I understand why he asked that, but I hope he understands that I cannot give him a definite date. We are still working through various responses and thinking through a number of highly complex issues, but clearly we want to make progress as soon as we can.</p>

Friend asked specifically whether, if we are unable to secure a European Union ban, we would consider a national control. Of course, we would consider a national control but, as he acknowledged, an EU-wide measure would be by far the most preferable outcome, which is why we will have serious negotiations with fellow member states. Nevertheless, we will keep in reserve the question whether we must introduce our own national measure. It would not be as good as an EU-wide measure, but we would consider it.</p>

He also asked about publication more generally of criterion 8. He will remember our discussion, when I appeared before the committee and indicated a number of our concerns about publication. Nevertheless, we are considering whether publication of criterion 8 would be appropriate. I cannot give a definite date by which cross-Government internal discussions will be concluded, but we are seeking to reach a decision shortly.</p>

 Given that the overwhelming majority of the Government&#146;s proposed legislative changes were put forward by the committee and others when the Export Control Act 2002 was drafted, will the Minister speculate on why the arguments then that things could not be done have been able to be dispensed with so easily?</p>

 My hon. Friend asks a challenging question, not least because I was not in the Government when the 2002 Act came into force. He is a persuasive and effective advocate for the committee, and I suspect that his influence has worn Ministers down.</p>

I know that its members put in a substantial amount of work thinking through the complexities of suggestions that are put to them. I do not always agree with my hon.

We are considering those issues, and I hope that deals with the concerns of the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley), who highlighted what he called &#147;anomalies&#148;.

cluster munitions by 1 October this year and to make any further changes to matters under discussion by 6 April 2009. That is our aim, but I would not want the House to hold us rigidly to those target dates. The issues are highly complex, but those are the dates for which we are aiming.</p>

 I asked about smart cluster munitions, as it was not clear whether they were included in category 2. Do the Government intend to include them in category 2? Why have they decided not to include such munitions in category 1?</p>

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="08032758000164"><a name="80327h0005.htm_spnew3"><a name="08032758000234"><b>Mr. Thomas:</b>
 The hon. Lady gives me the opportunity to move on to cluster munitions, which I intended to do. A number of hon. Members have referred to the negotiations on the Oslo process, and whether there is clarity on alternatives to cluster munitions. The right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling asked specifically what alternatives there are. We have taken all the steps that we can so far, including taking so-called dumb cluster munitions out of service. We want to ensure that taking all cluster munitions out of service would not put our forces in harm&#146;s way. Although we are not currently using cluster munitions in Iraq or Afghanistan, such use may be necessary in other scenarios, but we are committed to trying to make progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para13"><a name="08032758000165">The negotiations on the Oslo process are serious; its purpose is to secure a ban on weapons that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. We want a good agreement that will make a genuine and lasting difference, which means an agreement that major cluster munitions users and producers will sign. We are playing a key role in those negotiations. We are seeking not loopholes, but agreement on definitions that will genuinely make what comes out of the Oslo process workable and effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para14"><a name="08032758000166">A number of Members asked whether enforcement of export controls is effective enough. The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) referred to recent successful prosecutions. Last year, there was a prosecution for an offence of trading sub-machine-guns between Iran and Kuwait, and another for the illegal export of missile technology to Iran. One case resulted in a four-year prison sentence and the other resulted in an 18-month sentence and a fine of &#163;430,000, which were by no means insignificant sanctions. We are considering whether we need to alter the balance in terms of fines, penalties, and other sanctions for breaches of the law in that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para15"><a name="08032758000167">The introduction of the new IT system has freed up some additional resources that we are using to strengthen awareness of the controls and compliance work. We continue to seek to enhance the annual and quarterly reports that we publish. This year, we aim to introduce a public, searchable database of licensing decisions. There has been an increase in usage of the electronic self-help checker tools that we provide to assist exporters in their licence applications. As the Chairman of the committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood knows, we have been reviewing the methodology for criterion 8 assessments. In terms of our country programmes, we have launched new guidance for DFID staff on how to use those criterion assessments. That will enable us to continue to develop the effectiveness of our staff in those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para16"><a name="08032758000168">I turn now to some of the specific country issues that have been raised by hon. Members. The right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling mentioned the current arms embargo on China. We have no plans to support an immediate lifting of the embargo. He is right to note that there is no consensus in the European Union at the moment on the issue of embargo lifting. I suspect the right hon. Gentleman is aware of it, but I draw his attention to the code of conduct as well as to the embargo. The code of conduct is as important, if not more important, in terms of the effect it has on exports to China. It is an effective means of controlling those exports, particularly because it covers the high-tech defence equipment that the modern Chinese military want to acquire. I draw hon. Members&#146; attention to the fact that some 33 applications for arms sales to China were refused last year, which is an indication of the continuing seriousness with which we take and review each individual application that comes before the export control organisation.</p>

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="08032758000169"><a name="80327h0005.htm_spnew4"><a name="08032758000235"><b>Sir John Stanley:</b>
 Will the Minister answer the question asked by me and the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes) and tell hon. Members&#151;or undertake to do so by letter&#151;what conditions the Government believe must be satisfied by the Chinese Government before they judge it right to lift the EU-China arms embargo?</p>

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="08032758000170"><a name="80327h0005.htm_spnew5"><a name="08032758000236"><b>Mr. Thomas:</b>
 In the end, a political judgment will have to be made. Our view of whether the correct situation exists to lift the ban will be affected by a series of questions, issues of human rights and how we think such military equipment would be used. I will reflect on whether I can give him further information and clarity by way of correspondence, but I say to hon. Members that in the end a political judgment will have to be made. I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman and other members of the committee will already have a sense of the different issues that will help to inform the decision on whether arms embargoes can be lifted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="80327h0005.htm_para17"><a name="08032758000171">On the issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), as she will recognise, Israel like all other countries has a right to self-defence. Nevertheless, there are clearly cases where some defence exports are of more concern than others. All applications to Israel are rigorously assessed against the criteria that the export control organisation uses. If issuing a licence is considered to be inconsistent with that criteria, it will be refused. My hon. Friend may be aware that in 2002, the Government refused some 84 individual licences to Israel. Since then, the annual figure for refusals has fluctuated between nine and 26. In 2007, for example, some 24 standard individual licences were refused. I reassure my hon. Friend that we keep each individual application for arms sales to Israel under close review.</p>

will be aware that Sri Lanka has been the subject of debate on a number of occasions in the House, which has involved discussion of not only the deteriorating human rights situation, but the increasing ethnic conflict, which is a source of considerable concern to many constituents and hon. Members. That is one of the reasons why the Government took the decision to suspend the debt relief that was granted in the wake of the tsunami last year. It is also one of the reasons why, again, applications for arms sales to Sri Lanka are reviewed carefully. In 2007, six standard individual licence applications for Sri Lanka were refused. We regularly consult the British high commission in Colombo about the possible impact of exports in terms of the arms trade to Sri Lanka. Given the situation in Sri Lanka, I do not envisage any significant change in that practice. We do not want any exports from the UK to facilitate further human rights abuses or inflame the conflict that is taking place.</p>

Let me confirm that licences are not granted where there are significant human rights concerns. Criteria 2, 4 and 7 are relevant to that issue. Again, we considered applications to Saudi Arabia and where there are concerns we will turn those applications down.</p>

 Before the Minister sits down, will he say something about the issue of dual use not applying to licences, to which I referred in my speech?

That committed the Government to a series of additional pieces of work on corruption&#151;not least the establishment of a dedicated unit within the City of London police. We are also considering whether there is further action we can take to encourage transparency in defence procurement. That work is under way. The police unit has been established, and there are further steps that the Government are considering.</p>
