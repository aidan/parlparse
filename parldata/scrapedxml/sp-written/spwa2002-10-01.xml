  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why it will require an additional &#163;25 million for Scottish Enterprise to increase the number of modern apprenticeships (MAs) to over 25,000 given that the number of MA&#146;s in 2001-02 was 21,993.</p>

  <p>The additional resources for modern apprenticeships are being phased in over three years, allowing the total number of apprentices in training at any time to grow to over 25,000 by 2006. Over this period, the number of individuals employed and trained as modern apprentices will thus far exceed 25,000. The additional resources for the Enterprise Network will also be used in other ways to increase the number of people in employment undertaking training. Agreed targets will be published in the Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise annual Operating Plans.</p>

  <p>At any time there are a variety of potentially new technologies for the treatment of cancer being researched or undergoing clinical trials throughout the world. These may include novel gene therapy, new equipment or more sophisticated forms of existing equipment, new drugs or other interventions.</p>

  <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland is responsible for providing evidence-based advice to NHSScotland on the clinical and cost effectiveness of new and existing health technologies (medicines, devices, clinical procedures and health care settings).</p>

  <p>The Spending Review 2002 settlement reflects the Care Development Group's costing assumptions for free personal care. These assumptions estimated an increase in demand from unmet need and a shift from informal to formal care of approximately 12% building up over the first two years of the policy to 2004-05. Within that framework, identification of individuals in need of care is a matter for local authorities. The Scottish Executive has provided the necessary resources.</p>

  <p>The first four weeks of the campaign attracted 3,458 notes of interest. The details have been passed to the local authorities responsible for sifting and assessing applications arising out of these notes of interest. Children&#146;s Panel Advisory Committees will submit recommendations to Scottish ministers later in the year on who should be appointed as members of their children&#146;s panel. No recommendations have yet been received by Scottish ministers. The tables set out the position on gender and age of those expressing interest by local authority area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-10-01.S1W-29707.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80178" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1001.htm#4">

  <p>The cost to date to the Scottish Executive of the children&#146;s panel national recruitment campaign is &#163;395,000. &#163;385,000 is for development, artwork and advertising costs <strong> </strong> and &#163;10,000 for publication of literature. There are no discrete costs for staffing. Sifting and assessment of applications by Children&#146;s Panel Advisory Committees involves the volunteers on the committees with input from local authority staff. A separate budget meets the cost of the handling agency fee which is based on response levels. Local authorities meet the costs of any local advertising to augment the national campaign.</p>

  <p>The regulation of international trade is a reserved matter. However, the Executive continues to be in regular contact with the Department of Trade and Industry and other UK Government Departments on trade issues and how these may impact on the Executive&#146;s responsibilities.</p>

  <p>The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) applies to measures affecting trade in services taken by central, regional or local governments and authorities, and by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments and authorities. Progressive liberalisation under the GATS concerns the reduction or elimination of the adverse effects on trade in services of such measures as a means of providing effective market access for foreign service suppliers. Requests for liberalisation by World Trade Organisation (WTO) members do not seek the privatisation of state-supplied public services.</p>

  <p>The GATS makes clear that liberalisation shall take place, if at all, with due respect for national policy objectives, and recognises the right of WTO member governments to regulate, and to introduce new regulations, on the supply of service within their territories in order to meet national policy objectives. The GATS does not therefore impact on the Executive&#146;s ability to bring forward legislation affecting education.</p>

  <p>The spending of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) for 2003-04 was originally planned to increase from &#163;74 million to &#163;77 million as published in the Scottish Executive's Annual Expenditure Report, <em>The Scottish Budget, 2003-04</em> . Since then, all non-departmental public bodies&#146; budgets have been converted from a cash to a resource basis. Resource budgets are published in <em>Building a Better Scotland</em> .</p>

  <p>The increase in 2003-04 comprises the original &#163;3 million (in cash terms), plus approximately &#163;2 million more in that year to reflect resource budget adjustments between 2002-03 and 2003-04. Finally, the balance of the increase for 2003-04 is an additional &#163;0.5 million which HIE were allocated in the Spending Review for Modern Apprenticeships.

  <p>The national clinical effectiveness organisations, for example the Health Technology Board Scotland, the Scottish Inter-Collegiate Guidelines Network and the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland, are funded to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of health technologies and develop evidence-based clinical guidelines and standards. NHSScotland is expected to take account of advice and evidence from these organisations so that effective medical advances are quickly adopted as mainstream practice across Scotland.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are expected to allocate their funds so as to meet national and local priorities, including taking account of clinical advances where relevant.

  <p>Substantial additional resources are being made available to the NHS in Scotland over the years of the spending review as announced on 12 September 2002, with an average annual increase of 8.7% over the years 2003-04 to 2005-06 rising to &#163;8.6 billion a year by the end of the period. Within these substantially increased resources, NHS boards are responsible for ensuring that patients residing in their areas have access to clinically appropriate treatment, including new drug treatments. At Scottish level, the Health Technology Board for Scotland reviews new drug treatments and provides guidance on their use. NHSScotland is expected to take account of advice and evidence from the HTBS and ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet clinical need. At local level, Area Drug and Therapeutic Committees are responsible for giving advice to clinicians and for ensuring consistent application of national and local guidelines.</p>

  <p>Following the changes introduced to the Capital Planning and Approval processes in April this year, it is anticipated that the majority of the &#163;750 million will be allocated directly to NHS boards to undertake those improvements already under way or planned as part of the board&#146;s Capital Investment Programme.</p>

  <p>Those building projects currently under development include the provision of appropriate facilities for mental health; ambulatory care and diagnostic facilities; reconfiguration of services arising from completed or on-going acute services reviews; improved primary care and community hospital facilities, and investment in and the upgrading of medical equipment.</p>

  <p>IT projects costing under &#163;1 million are managed under delegated authority by the NHS boards and trusts. Projects managed by NHS boards and trusts costing over &#163;1 million are subject to business case approval by the Health Department. These projects are likely to include the development of electronic integrated care records and systems supporting accident and emergency and ambulatory care and diagnostic services. Such investments will be directed in line with the national Information Management and Technology (IM&amp;T) strategy and the health board IM&amp;T Action Plans currently under development.</p>

  <p>In setting the new national maximum waiting time target of six months for a first out-patient appointment, we have taken account of record levels of investment in the NHS which will enable more resources to be deployed to meet growth in demand, for example by increasing numbers of consultants and nurses and making substantial investment in buildings and IT equipment. Moreover, the Centre for Change and Innovation will support and facilitate new and innovative ways of working. The Executive believes that NHS boards and trusts will meet the new target by 2006 and that the people of Scotland will welcome this commitment to reducing out-patient waits.</p>

  <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland provides timely advice on the clinical and cost effectiveness of the broad range of existing and new health technologies to NHSScotland, including most recently for mental health on:</p>

  <p>the prescription of anti-cholinesterases to people with Alzheimer&#146;s Disease, and</p>

  <p>the prescription of atypical anti-psychotics to people with schizophrenia.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland and their care partners will also continue to invest in treatments, approaches, services, support and other interventions that aim not only to treat but also to prevent or reduce the incidence and individual severity of mental illness in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In terms of investment, over &#163;600 million spent last year alone offers a clear signal of the priority we attach to and our national programme to improve mental health and well-being further signals our intent to maintain this profile.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not readily available. Each NHS board is responsible for assessing the health care needs of its population and for putting in place arrangements to meet these needs. These arrangements may include sharing treatment and other facilities and services with partner agencies and neighbouring NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>Mental health is, along with cancer and heart disease, one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland. NHS boards provide resources for mental health services from within their general financial allocation. These are growing at an average annual rate exceeding 7% in cash terms.</p>

  <p>The 2002 review of latest evidence by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network determined that 10 to 15% of women in Scotland who give birth can suffer from post-natal depression. Depression as a separate condition can affect a large proportion of women of childbearing age, though studies are evenly divided in reporting one condition more or less severe than the other. There is, however, some evidence that there is an increased risk of depression occurring in the early postnatal period.</p>

  <p>The care objective is to apply proper screening and follow up that identifies and responds to all assessed needs in each case.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not funded any research on the incidence of post-natal depression. Details of recent and current research on post-natal depression can be found in the <em>National Research Register</em>, which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404).</p>

  <p>Substantial additional resources are being made available to the NHS in Scotland over the years of the spending review as announced on 12 September 2002, with an average annual increase of 8.7% over the years 2003-04 to 2005-06 rising to &#163;8.6 billion a year by the end of the period. Within these substantially increased resources, NHS boards are responsible for ensuring that patients residing in their areas have access to clinically appropriate treatment, including new drug treatments such as the new atypical anti-psychotic drugs. At national level, the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) reviews new drug treatments and provides guidance on their use. NHSScotland is expected to take account of advice and evidence from the HTBS and ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet clinical need. At local level, Area Drug and Therapeutic Committees are responsible for giving advice to clinicians and for ensuring consistent application of national and local guidelines.</p>

  <p>Copies of report into a review of the work, policies and structures of the administration are being laid in the Parliament today. The review was the first for SCRA under the five-yearly examinations of non-domestic public bodies (NDPBs). The report concluded that despite the recognised resource pressures from SCRA&#146;s inception and an increase in referrals, SCRA has established a core organisation which is sound in structure and process. The report identified various areas for improvement and these are detailed in the recommendations which affect both SCRA and the Scottish Executive. The Scottish Executive accepts all the recommendations which have the potential to improve outcomes from the hearings system. The Scottish Budget announced increases in resources to the hearings system to enable these recommendations to be taken forward.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-29496 on 25 September 2002, in which new resources of &#163;11.2 million were announced for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for the period 2003-04 to 2005-06. It is for SEPA to decide what proportion of the additional funding is to be devoted to increasing staff resources.

  <p>The social justice annual report 2002 will be published by the end of the year. There will be no changes to the milestones and baselines. There will be some additions to some of the indicators, for example new gender analysis, which will be detailed in the technical report.</p>
