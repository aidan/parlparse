  <p>A number of strands of Scottish Executive policy recognise the importance of play and access to play facilities and other services for children with additional support needs. The primary responsibility for assessing what individual services and facilities are needed at the local level lies with local authorities, who should ideally work with local families and voluntary organisations in assessing need.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides resources to local authorities through a number of funding streams including Quality of Life and Community Regeneration that can be used to support outdoor play facilities for children, including those with additional support needs. In addition, almost &pound;273m of grant aided expenditure (GAE) provision is made available to local authorities for additional support needs services and &pound;44m GAE for the childcare strategy, the scope of which includes provision of outdoor play facilities.</p>

  <p>In line with Scottish Executive policy directions, the Big Lottery Fund has named play as one of its priorities in Scotland for the period 2006-2009. This is a significant source of funding for projects which support and promote play.</p>

  <p>Through the Unified Voluntary Sector Fund, the Executive is providing funding to The Yard, an adventure centre in Edinburgh, catering primarily for children with a range of additional support needs. The Yard also promotes and develops inclusive play for children throughout Scotland by working with teachers, parents and community groups to transfer skills and good practice.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware of research by the Energy Institute indicating that the number of petrol stations in Scotland has almost halved since 1990 from 1,723 to 970, resulting in job losses and causing congestion as drivers travel further to fill up, and what action the Executive will take to address the issue.</p>

  <p>We are aware of the research quoted in <em>The Scotsman</em> on 13 May. The Energy Institute&rsquo;s figures are, however, at variance with the latest data produced by the Office for National Statistics, which show that the number of petrol stations operating across Scotland fell from about 880 in November 1999 to approximately 700 in November 2004.</p>

  <p>Since 1998-99, the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Rural Transport Fund has spent &pound;57.7m to improve transport services in rural areas. In addition to providing grants to rural petrol stations to help with the capital costs of fuel supply infrastructure, the Fund is also helping to reduce people&rsquo;s need for private transport by funding new and improved public and community transport services in rural areas.</p>

  <p>Urban areas which have a higher concentration of petrol stations also benefit from a wider and more frequent range of bus and rail services which reduce the need to rely on private transport.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Rural Petrol Stations Grant Scheme is succeeding in its aim of supporting the retention of a sustainable and accessible network of fuel supply throughout rural Scotland and whether its budget of &pound;400,000 for 2005-06 is adequate for this task.</p>

  <p>Independent research in 2004 found that the Rural Petrol Stations Grants Scheme was a successful scheme that had provided substantial social, economic and environmental benefits to many rural communities in Scotland. The research also found that the scheme was responsible for almost all rural LPG provision in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Although the 2005-06 budget for the scheme was &pound;400,000, actual spend amounted to almost &pound;483,000, with the excess being funded from underspends elsewhere in the Transport budget. The 2006-07 budget has been increased from the proposed &pound;600,000 to &pound;1 million to cope with the current high demand for the scheme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many deaths were linked to MRSA in 2005.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-08-09.21.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0809.htm#9">

  <p>MRSA was recorded on Scottish death certificates as likely to be &quot;the underlying cause of death&quot; in 38 cases in 2005. In a further 174 death certificates, MRSA was mentioned as a contributing factor.</p>

  <p>These data should be treated with great caution. Detailed information on healthcare associated infections (HAIs) as a cause of death from specific infections can be difficult or impossible to interpret safely. As at the end of 2005, there was no international code in use for recording MRSA as a cause of death and the MRSA data above were obtained by analysing the original written text recorded on the death certificate by certifying doctors.</p>

  <p>Recording of specific HAIs as a cause of death is often influenced by the general level of professional and public awareness of that HAI at the time and may reflect an increase in awareness, rather than a real change in the actual number of deaths in which the HAI was an underlying or contributory factor. It is also important to note that these figures are not set in the context of the total number of patients treated in the NHS. Reports from national surveillance of serious MRSA infections in Scotland provide evidence that MRSA rates have remained stable in recent years.</p>

  <p>As NHS 24 implemented its phased rollout across Scotland, recruitment was also phased and began in the Grampian area, to staff the Aberdeen Contact Centre in advance of its launch on 8 May 2002.</p>

  <p>At that stage, NHS 24 employed 23 frontline nurses (headcount) and now, between its three main contact centres and the five smaller satellite centres, there are 491 nurses (headcount) which equates to 294.0 whole time equivalent.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-08-09.27.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0809.htm#14">

  <p>Information on the number of patients on the in-patient and day case waiting list and the waiting list as a rate per 100,000 of the population, for the last 16 quarters, is provided in table 1.</p>

  <p>The majority of patients who require in-patient and day case treatment are treated quickly. Nearly 53% of the patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals receive immediate treatment and never join a waiting list. Of those who do wait, over 40% are admitted within 1 months and over 70% within 3 months.</p>

  <p>The distribution of waiting times for in-patient discharges is highly positively skewed. The arithmetic mean is an inappropriate statistical measure for such distributions because a very small number of long waiting times can have a disproportionate effect on the mean waiting time.</p>

  <p>The median and mean are not targets for NHSScotland; they are only summary measures for patients who waited for treatment. Reducing maximum waiting times is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s priority for NHSScotland. The current national maximum waiting time for in-patient and day case treatment is 6 months. This will be reduced to 18 weeks by the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland is delivering on the 6 month national maximum waiting time and is making good progress towards meeting the next key target of a maximum wait of 18 weeks by the end of 2007. At that point, a new approach to defining and measuring waiting will also be introduced to replace availability status codes (ASCs), which have the effect at present of excluding patients from waiting times guarantees where for example, they are medically unfit for treatment, where they have asked for their treatment to be postponed, or where their treatment is highly specialised or of low clinical priority. The new approach will be fairer, more consistent and more transparent.</p>

  <p>Median and mean waiting times are derived from retrospective analyses of waiting times for hospital treatment. These are compiled from SMR01 returns and are based on data that does not record whether patients have had an ASC applied. The information requested on median and mean waiting times is provided in table 2. It includes the waiting times of patients who have been exempted from waiting times guarantees for the reasons given above and therefore overstates true waiting times. It is not possible to estimate the extent of the overstatement.</p>

  <p>Waiting list and waiting times information for England are not directly comparable with Scottish data due to definitional differences in the collection systems. Information on waiting lists and waiting times for England is available at: <a href="http://www.performance.doh.gov.uk/waiting times/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.performance.doh.gov.uk/waiting times/index.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>ISD Scotland is working closely with the Executive and NHSScotland on the development and implementation of a data collection system for waiting times for key diagnostic tests and procedures. Central data collection is scheduled to begin in the Autumn, and it is expected that provisional information will be available early next year.</p>

  <p>In June last year, I announced a maximum 9-weeks waiting time for 8 key diagnostic tests. This commitment will come into effect from the end of 2007. Meantime, NHS Boards are working to reduce diagnostic waiting times for patients through service redesign, investment in capacity and more efficient working to ensure that the target is met.</p>
