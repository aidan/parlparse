  <p>The Scottish Executive&#146;s annual statistical collection on children in secure establishments is reviewed regularly. I have asked my officials to consider including information on the nature of the learning disability, as part of the next review of these statistics. Should this be feasible, such figures could be published, subject to restrictions to preserve confidentiality if the numbers were found to be very small.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service plans to introduce a new G-Pass computerised medical record system by 2005 following the upgrade of its prison record system in 2004. This will enable the collation of statistics on a wider range of health related matters currently held on individual confidential health care records.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-09-10.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80053" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0910.htm#3">

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been carefully considering the issue of civil partnership registration in recent months. The Department of Trade and Industry published a consultation paper at the end of June on a possible civil partnership registration scheme for same-sex couples. The scheme is a mixture of reserved policies such as pensions, benefits, taxation and immigration issues and devolved matters such as registration, family law issues on the breakdown of a relationship or the death of one party, and detailed considerations such as prison visiting and who can register a death or consent to medical treatment for an ill partner.</p>

  <p>We have been considering how best to handle the implications of the UK Government&#146;s proposals should they decide to proceed with legislation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has also been mindful of the legal rights of same-sex couples. The creation of a civil partnership registration scheme to provide same-sex couples with the opportunity to register their partnership and trigger access to some employment benefits is the approach taken by the UK Government to ensure compliance with the EU Employment Directive (2000/78/EC). In the absence of Scottish provisions, couples will have to travel down south to get some of the rights of their counterparts in England and Wales. There could be a legal challenge by a Scottish same-sex couple on grounds of discrimination.</p>

  <p>In examining the options for Scottish legislation, key considerations have been the intertwining of devolved and reserved policy issues, our desire to avoid a complex web of differing rights emerging between Scotland and England and Wales, and the advantages which parity offers in relation to cross-border issues. Separate legislation north and south of the border would lead to a complicated set of arrangements understood by few people. We have therefore concluded that a Sewel motion to include Scottish provisions in any future UK legislation offers the most effective and sensible means of delivering a package of rights and responsibilities for committed same-sex couples.</p>

  <p>The DTI is already consulting with Scottish interests on the reserved elements of their civil partnership scheme. It is our intention to consult on the devolved elements and to publish a short paper around the end of this month.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Costs will vary considerably within each type of tenure according to the assessed needs of each individual homeless person as well as between local authorities. While local authorities should now hold improved homelessness data as a result of recent work to develop local homelessness strategies, we have no plans at present to request an analysis of such cost information from local authorities.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Acting Chief Executive, Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>There are some circumstances where lenders require assignation of right to buy (RTB) proceeds to accounts held with the lenders (often referred to as blocked RTB accounts) and thereafter proceeds are released subject to completion of monitoring processes.</p>

  <p>The proceeds of these sales from RTB receipts, on release from blocked RTB accounts, are always allocated according to the agreed sharing arrangement. They are used to firstly redeem the private loan attached to the property sold and thereafter repaid to the local authority or Scottish Homes or Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>There is no circumstance where money held in blocked right to buy accounts is exclusively available to Registered Social Landlords (RSL) until all their obligations, which are set out in various procedures have been fully complied with by the RSL.</p>

The costed project plan will set out all the stages, dates and progress to be achieved in making the relocation to Inverness happen.</p>

  <p>In response to Ross Finnie&#146;s invitation of 9 July, SNH has put forward a case to retain a number of staff in Edinburgh, or nearby. No decision has yet been taken on this matter.

  <p>Since 1960 there have been no notices served under the Weeds Act 1959 which have resulted in prosecution. They have therefore not been followed by further offences under section 2(2) of the act.</p>

  <p>Each of the 16 Environment and Rural Affairs area offices which undertake day-to-day enforcement of the Weeds Act 1959 has a co-ordinator who is responsible for the investigation of all written complaints about injurious weeds. The table gives man days spent enforcing the Weeds Act over the last four years, taken from 1 April to 31 March.</p>

  <p>In headquarters, three members of staff are involved in enforcing the Weeds Act 1959. This work comprises around 2% of their combined annual workload.</p>

  <p>The number of personnel involved in the enforcement of the Weeds Act 1959 in local authorities is a matter for the individual local authorities. The information requested is not held centrally.</p>
