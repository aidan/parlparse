  <p>We look forward to seeing the conclusions from the council&#8217;s consultation in due course. Glasgow City Council has also recently decided to proceed to consultation on Glasgow Housing Association&#8217;s transfer proposal, which includes proposals to undertake, in consultation with local communities, the demolition of up to around 11,000 existing houses by 2009. I would also draw attention to the Scottish Executive&#8217;s recent announcement that if transfer proceeds additional resources of over &#163;400 million will be made available for social housing in the city. Together with existing resources, this will support the provision of 13,000 additional houses of social rent in the city over the 10 years following transfers.</p>
