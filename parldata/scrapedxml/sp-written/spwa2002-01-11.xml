  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the population of (a) cormorants, (b) goosanders and (c) red breasted mergansers was in each year since 1994, also expressed as a percentage of the 1994 figures.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-01-11.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80258" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0111.htm#1">

  <p>This information is not held directly by the Executive. The following estimates and commentary have been supplied by Scottish Natural Heritage. Data are available separately for breeding pairs and for the peak wintering population.</p>

  <p>Breeding Population:</p>

  <p>Figures for the breeding population of goosander are available only for the year 1987, when the estimated population in Scotland was about 1,443 breeding pairs. In 1997, when the survey was repeated on a sample selection of the river lengths surveyed in 1987, no significant change in the breeding population was estimated to have taken place.</p>

  <p>Red breasted mergansers breed in coastal areas and no reliable estimate of the breeding population has ever been obtained.</p>

  <p>Breeding cormorants have only been censused fully in the years 1985-87 and more recently for Seabird 2000, although figures for this latter survey are not yet compiled. Overall trends for cormorant populations, where detailed surveys of individual colonies are undertaken, show that declines in population have occurred.</p>

  <p>Wintering Population:</p>

  <p>Counts for wintering populations are available from Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) counts, though for all species these are not complete surveys, especially for red-breasted merganser and cormorant which are predominantly coastal dwelling birds. However, WeBS data showing peak counts for Scotland as a whole are provided for each species in the following tables. The proportional change from 1994 is also shown as well as the month in which the peak population was counted.</p>

  <p>The populations of red breasted merganser and goosander wintering in Scotland are thought to include birds from breeding grounds in Scandinavia and continental Europe. The proportion of birds from these areas has not been determined.</p>

  <p>The Foot-and-Mouth Disease Declaratory (Controlled Area) (Scotland) (No 3) Order 2001 has not been revoked. There is still a possibility that there could be latent disease in some sheep flocks in the north of England and the south of Scotland. However, if the disease position is maintained early in the New Year then it is hoped that the whole of Great Britain will become free of foot-and-mouth disease and the country&#146;s Controlled Area status will be able to be removed by early February.</p>

These distributions coincided with elections for vacancies for parent members on school boards. In 2001 we produced a poster to accompany the leaflets.

  <p>The contract of employment for special advisers states that in certain circumstances Advisers should obtain the agreement of the Crown before accepting any offer of employment outside the civil service which would start within two years of leaving Crown employment.</p>

  <p>In common with other members of the public, there is nothing to prohibit former special advisers from applying for an appointment to a public body. All such appointments are made on merit after a fair, open and transparent process, which is subject to independent scrutiny.</p>
