  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress is being made in respect of raising the current limit on the value of claims that can be made under the small claims court procedure; with whom agreement on a new limit must be reached, and whether it will give reasons for any delay in making the necessary changes.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-07-27.2.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80046" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0727.htm#1">

  <p>We have had a number of discussions with a wide range of interested stakeholders in considering the related questions of the appropriate level of the small claims limit, the summary cause limit and the privative limit of the Sheriff Court, above which actions can be raised either in the Sheriff Court or the Court of Session.</p>

  <p>It is for Members of the Parliament to set the appropriate levels, on consideration of Orders laid in draft by Ministers.</p>

  <p>Our consideration of the issue requires us to balance competing issues. These include issues around access to a simplified court procedure but one in which legal aid is not available and freedom for pursuers to litigate in the court of their choice against the costs for defenders in being forced to defend cases in the Court of Session as opposed to the more local sheriff court. As part of that balancing exercise, we have proposed that personal injury cases are exempted from the small claims procedure.</p>

  <p>We accept that the case is made for an increase in all three of these levels and are considering where we can properly strike the balance in proposing the new levels.</p>

  <p>The Procurator Fiscal Depute at Wick instructed an interpreter from an agency which is regularly used by COPFS, the Sheriff Clerk and the Police. The interpreter was instructed to assist three prosecution witnesses, who speak Polish, for a trial at the Sheriff Court in Wick on 26 June 2006.</p>

  <p>The Sheriff Clerk instructed an interpreter to assist the accused &ndash; who speaks Polish.</p>

  <p>Both interpreters attended for their respective assignments in this trial.</p>

  <p>Having regard to the possibility that a miscarriage of justice could have occurred due to possible errors in interpreting the witnesses&rsquo; evidence, it was appropriate for the Procurator Fiscal Depute to invite the Sheriff to desert the case for the time being with the intention to bring the case again at a later date.</p>

  <p>The Sheriff decided to dismiss the case outright, based on a number of factors.</p>

  <p>The circumstances of this case were very unusual and do not often occur.</p>

  <p>COPFS has asked for a report from the agency which provided the interpreter and is in discussions with the agency to ensure that such difficulties do not arise again.</p>

  <p>Independently, COPFS is currently reviewing the arrangements by which interpreting services are provided in relation to prosecution in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what arrangements have been made to provide translation services during court cases where some or all of those involved do not speak English.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-07-27.5.r0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Colin Boyd QC" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0727.htm#1">

  <p>Translation relates to the written word. Interpreting relates to the spoken word.</p>

  <p>The prosecutor is responsible for translation of documents served on the accused and on witnesses (and written information provided to victims through the VIA service) and interpretation of information for prosecution witnesses and in some circumstances for family members in cases involving a crime-related death.</p>

  <p>If it is known that a victim&rsquo;s first language is not English, Procurators Fiscal are required to arrange for the translation of all of the routine and case progress information normally issued in the course of an investigation and prosecution to accused, witnesses, victims and bereaved next of kin in crime- related deaths.</p>

  <p>In general, it is considered inappropriate for Procurators Fiscal to commission translation of productions for the defence because legal aid is available to the accused for interpreting and translation work and an interpreter will be provided for the accused at every court diet.</p>

  <p>The role of the interpreter in the criminal court is crucial. The Procurator Fiscal, the Scottish Court Service and the police will ensure, so far as possible, that interpreters are engaged through recognised interpreting services and that interpreters engaged have appropriate qualifications and experience.</p>

  <p>COPFS has an agreed protocol with the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland (ACPOS) and the Scottish Court Service, setting out the arrangements for instruction of interpreters.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of the police to advise the Procurator Fiscal in the police report whether the accused or any proposed prosecution witness requires the services of an interpreter to give evidence in court. The reporting officer should specify the language and dialect required.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of the Procurator Fiscal to engage a suitably qualified and experienced interpreter, skilled in the language and dialect specified in the police report, to assist prosecution witnesses in giving their evidence.</p>

  <p>In all cases where accused are appearing for the first time from custody the police will, so far as possible, arrange, on behalf of the Scottish Court Service, for a suitably qualified and experienced interpreter to appear at court to assist the accused.</p>

  <p>In respect of all other criminal court diets, it is the responsibility of the Scottish Court Service to engage a suitably qualified and experienced interpreter, skilled in the language and dialect required to assist the accused.</p>

  <p>The Executive announced its decision in principle to commence sections 25-29 of the <em>Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990</em> on 2 March this year. Before commencing these sections, a statutory defect will have to be corrected which we are seeking to do in section 42 of the <em>Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Bill</em> . If the Parliament enacts the latter provision, we shall commence sections 25-29 of the 1990 Act shortly thereafter.</p>

  <p>We announce overseas visits by ministers at appropriate times in advance of the visits&rsquo; taking place, bearing in mind programme planning and security considerations, and our discussions with visit hosts. We expect ministers&rsquo; visits in coming months to include travel to China, the United States and Brussels. Plans are of course subject to change in response to changing business priorities or if ministers have to be available for parliamentary business.</p>

  <p>No decisions have been taken on ministerial visits after April 2007.</p>

  <p>Officials travel in response to Scottish Executive business needs. No central register is kept of officials&rsquo; planned visits. We expect that over the next six months officials&rsquo; travel will include visits to Brussels and Finland to deal with EU business.</p>
