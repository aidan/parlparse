  <p>A group chaired by the Scottish Executive has been established with several partners to develop a strategy which will help us to maximise the opportunities for tourism and the promotion of Scotland that the iconic status of Robert Burns could provide. Plans to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth in 2009 are still at a very early stage but it is hoped that the programme for the Year of Homecoming will include a range of events and activities which will engage people as widely as possible.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not received guidance from HM Treasury in connection with commercial confidentiality. The Executive&#8217;s current policy on handling commercially sensitive information is contained within the <em>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</em> , which was introduced in 1999 and updated in June 2003. This code is similar to the <em>Cabinet Office&#8217;s Code of Practice on Access to Government Information</em> , which came into effect in 1994 and was revised in 1997.</p>

  <p>The code, which applies to agencies within the Scottish Executive and to functions carried out on behalf of the Scottish Executive or public bodies by contractors, is published on the Executive&#8217;s website.</p>

  <p>From 1 January 2005, the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 will apply, and this will govern the processes to be applied when dealing with commercial confidentialities. Requests to disclose such information will be made on a case by case basis. This act will replace the code of practice. Westminster has legislated separately for the rest of the UK.</p>

  <p>In applications to the High Court for leave to appeal, it is the responsibility of the Clerk of Justiciary to notify without delay the appellant or his solicitor and the Crown Agent of the High Court&#8217;s decision and, where leave has been refused, the reasons for that decision.</p>

  <p>Where leave is refused, and the appellant is on bail and the sentence imposed on his conviction was one of imprisonment, the High Court must grant a warrant to apprehend and imprison him. The enforcement of the warrant would be a matter for the police.</p>

  <p>The Criminal Confiscation Unit and the Civil Recovery Unit have undertaken an extensive training programme to raise awareness of the new powers amongst law enforcement agencies and to encourage suitable referrals which includes crimes relating to alcohol and cigarettes.</p>

  <p>Since my answer to question S2W-7501 on 10 May 2004, one case relating to the importation of cigarettes has been reported by Her Majesty&#8217;s Customs and Excise for restraint. A Restraint Order was granted at Glasgow sheriff court on 2 June 2004. The value of the assets restrained is approximately &#163;40,000.</p>

  <p>The sum of &#163;13,675.36 relating to contraband cigarettes is currently detained in one case under the cash seizure provisions Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Since my answer to question S2W-7501 on 10 May 2004, however, no assets have been seized in respect of crime relating to alcohol and cigarettes.</p>

  <p>The Civil Recovery Unit considers cases which are referred to it by law enforcement agencies through the Criminal Confiscation Unit. The unit assesses referrals for suitability against the statutory criteria set out in Part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.</p>

  <p><em>A Framework for Maternity Service in Scotland</em> , published in 2001, sets out a vision and philosophy for maternity services which provides women with high quality, accessible and responsive maternity care.</p>

  <p>The framework makes it clear that health professionals should adopt a flexible and evidence based approach to post-natal care, working in partnership with women. The duration of a post-natal hospital stay should be individualised, using clinical judgement, to meet the specific needs of the mother and baby. It should be reinforced by a comprehensive support service in the community after discharge. There are no specific guidelines issued for post-natal hospital stay.</p>

  <p>The report of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services (2002) makes it clear that professionals at all levels of maternity care must have appropriate skills and competences for the service they provide. They should have access to regular continuing professional development opportunities to equip and maintain the competencies and skills they need to provide high quality, safe maternity care.</p>

  <p>It will be for NHS Greater Glasgow to ensure that staff have appropriate skills and receive appropriate training to maintain a high quality of maternity and neonatal care in any reconfiguration of maternity services.</p>

  <p>There is a pan-Scotland specialist neonatal intensive care transport service based on three regional locations in the north of Scotland, west of Scotland and south east Scotland. Also with increased antenatal care and diagnosis of foetal abnormality, planned neonatal transfers between units can be carried out so that emergency neonatal transports are minimised.</p>

  <p>The decision by Scotland the Brand Ltd to go into voluntary liquidation is a matter for the company itself and has no impact on the research work currently underway into Scotland&#8217;s international image. No decisions have yet been taken about the shape a new promotional campaign might take. Scottish Enterprise retain ownership of the Country of Origin device used by Scotland the Brand, and have confirmed that fully paid up members will be allowed to continue the use of the device.</p>

  <p>Both the Chairman and Chief Executive of Scotland the Brand have been in regular contact with officials about the future of the company and the promotion of Scotland&#8217;s international image. The Chairman of Scotland the Brand has also had a number of discussions with ministers on these issues.</p>

  <p>The proposed National Sexual Health Strategy, which has been the subject of consultation, will address the rise in sexually transmitted infections, which include Chlamydia and genital herpes.</p>

  <p>Healthy Respect, the health demonstration project in Lothian, has developed a Chlamydia testing programme which makes an innovative postal testing kit available free at music stores, pharmacies and other retail outlets to promote and facilitate testing for infection. To date, 10,000 testing kits have been distributed.</p>

  <p>More generally, NHS Health Scotland has a range of activities on sexual health across all its programme areas, including a high profile TV campaign, which targets teenagers to warn of the increasing risk of sexually transmitted infections in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There is no consultation requirement in respect of a bridge scheme promoted under s.75 of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984. However, notice of the making of the scheme (and a copy of the scheme and any relevant map or plan) must be served on every navigation authority concerned with or having jurisdiction over the waters affected by the scheme, and on Scottish Water.</p>

  <p>There are no alternative procedures to be followed if the organisations in question have ceased to exist. However, Scottish ministers must be satisfied that the reasonable requirements of navigation have been taken into account when considering such schemes.</p>
