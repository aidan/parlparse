  <p>The Computers Within Reach scheme has been piloted by the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) in certain areas of England only. The scheme does not operate in Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. The scheme is currently being evaluated by DfEE, and the Scottish Executive will examine this evaluation with interest.</p>

  <p>The Executive will launch a digital inclusion strategy later this year which will aim to ensure that all people in Scotland are able to benefit from digital technologies.</p>

  <p>The decision by the Argyll &amp; Bute and Highland Councils to set up disinfectant points in their areas was taken despite advice from the Scottish Executive that such measures were unlikely to prove effective in disease control terms.

  <p>The funding of individual colleges of further education is a matter for the Scottish Further Education Funding Council. The council has been in detailed discussion with the college on the preparation of its financial recovery plan, which is now expected to be incorporated into the college&#8217;s management action plan by the end of July 2001. Implementation will be a matter for agreement between the council and the college.</p>

  <p>I have seen Quality Meat Scotland&#8217;s forward plans and am impressed with the approach set out. Quality Meat Scotland is owned jointly by the Meat and Livestock Commission and the two bodies representative of levy payers, NFU Scotland and the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers. Any review is therefore a matter for the industry as I have no direct responsibility for Quality Meat Scotland itself.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> requires all NHS boards to work in partnership with local authorities to ensure that integrated independent advocacy services are available to those who need them.

  <p>Both the Scottish Health Advisory Service and the Mental Welfare Commission have indicators which cover joint working. For our part, we have set up a range of measures to further progress implementation of the <i>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> , including joint working. The lead rests with the Mental Health and Well Being Support Group, which is visiting each health board area and assessing implementation with the partners locally, including how they work together.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are currently consulting on the Performance Assessment Framework for the new unified health boards which will cover joint working on, amongst other things, mental health, and in the course of the next few months we will be reviewing with the Accounts Commission the range of performance indicators across the whole of community care.</p>

  <p>Education authorities are required to make appropriate provision for all children with special educational needs, including those with speech and language impairment. In addition, Section 2 of the Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools Etc Act 2000 places a legally enforceable duty on education authorities to ensure that the education they provide is directed to the development of the personality, talents and mental and physical abilities of children and young people.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. The September School Census collects information on the main difficulty in learning of pupils with Records of Needs. Each pupil with a Record of Needs is classified into one of a list of main difficulties in learning. The Executive is currently undertaking a review of the Records of Needs process and if there appears to be a need to alter the range and extent of statistical data collected, this will be given due consideration.</p>
