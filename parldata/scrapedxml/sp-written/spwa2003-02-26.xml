  <p>There is no information on which to base such an estimate. Any local authority stock in these postcode areas which currently lacks central heating should have it by 31 March 2004.

  <p>The recommendations in the Victoria Climbi&eacute; Inquiry cover a wide range of child protection issues. We are carefully considering these recommendations to ensure that the lessons learned are taken into account in developing our child protection reform programme. The reform programme was announced in response to the national child protection review which reported last November. A Commissioner for Children and Young People could play an important role in this through raising the profile of children&rsquo;s rights and helping children to be heard.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the development of service provision for psychostimulant users, including cocaine and crack cocaine, was issued last August by the Executive&rsquo;s Effective Interventions Unit, based on the work of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse. Training modules on dealing with those with psychostimulant problems have been available from STRADA (Scottish Training on Drugs and Alcohol) since November 2002.</p>

  <p>It is for Drug Action Teams and their local partners to assess the level of need in their areas and to ensure that the treatment needs of their local drug using population are met. Individual Drug Action Teams will be asked to detail the work they have undertaken on psychostimulants in this year&rsquo;s Corporate Action Plans.</p>

  <p>I understand that, whilst the areas in question have not identified a need for specific services for cocaine and crack cocaine users, training has been commissioned for staff of existing services to ensure that they are able to meet the needs of users, should they present to services.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-32272 on 27 December 2002, and on 3 February I did announce the approval, in full, of additional capital consent, amounting to &#163;1.83 million, to Moray Council to assist with the costs attributed to the floods in Elgin and Forres in November 2002.</p>

  <p>In relation to the Common Agricultural Policy and European Structural Funds, so far as the European Union Solidarity Fund is concerned, this is intended to provide rapid financial assistance in the event of a major disaster. Major disaster is defined as damage estimated at or above &#8364;3 billion or more than 0.6% of the gross national income of the state concerned. This clearly would not extend to Moray.</p>

  <p>The Corporate Body has noted that these four questions are in addition to the 149 the member has already asked about the Holyrood Project. Accordingly, I shall write at length to the member in due course, placing a copy in SPICe.</p>

  <p>The Parliament's lease of the Assembly Hall may be surrendered on provision of six months' written notice. No notice is required where the lease is surrendered at the end of the period of lease.</p>

  <p>There are no notice periods stipulated by our current arrangements with the City of Edinburgh Council in respect of 369 and 375 High Street, the Parliamentary Headquarters on George IV Bridge, the Committee Chambers or Cannonball House.</p>

  <p>The Parliament's lease of office accommodation at the Tun may be surrendered by either party with effect from 28 May 2004, on provision of not less than six months' written notice. There are no notice periods stipulated by the Parliament's lease of the Interim Visitor Centre, also at the Tun.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Parliament's license in respect of interim office accommodation at the MWB Business Exchange in Edinburgh may now be terminated on provision of three months' written notice.</p>
