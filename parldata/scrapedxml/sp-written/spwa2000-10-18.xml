  <p>The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) already operates an appointment system at its five main donor centres. SNBTS is committed to improving this system and will assess donor feedback with a view to offering the facility more widely if demand is shown to exist. However, an appointment system does not appeal to all donors, and SNBTS is also committed to retaining its &quot;walk in&quot; facility.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Registering of patients with dentists was first introduced when a new dental contract came into force in October 1990. During 1990-91 registrations were under-counted as patients were only added to the dentists registered list when they visited a dentist after this date.</p>

  <p>2. Prior to 1 September 1996 adult registrations lapsed after 24 months and child registrations lapsed at the end of the following calendar year unless the patients returned to the practice. This contributed to the fall in adult numbers between 1997-98 and 1998-99.</p>

  <p>3. A new payment system for dentists was introduced in April 1999. Prior to this, records for new patients, patients registering after a period of being lapsed and patients whose information had been written or captured incorrectly were excluded from the registration figures and so some under-counting occurred.</p>

  <p>Current indications are that the main sectors of the Scottish economy experiencing skills shortages are:</p>

  <p>information technology/electronics;</p>

  <p>financial services;</p>

  <p>construction;</p>

  <p>engineering;</p>

  <p>hospitality/tourism;</p>

  <p>call centre operations; and</p>

  <p>oil/gas.</p>

  <p>Robust labour market information and intelligence systems are essential if sectoral skills shortages are to be forecast accurately and timeously. The Scottish Labour Market Intelligence Unit is presently being established to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the information needed to inform decisions about steps needed to address current and future sectoral skills shortages. The new unit should be fully operational by spring 2001.</p>

  <p>At last year&#8217;s December Fisheries Council, we successfully invoked Hague Preference for West of Scotland Saithe. This provided an additional 1,840 tonnes of saithe for UK fishermen this year.</p>

  <p>We shall examine closely the scientific advice on saithe and, at this year&#8217;s December Council, will seek to maximise the quota available to the Scottish industry, in line with sustainable stock management practices.</p>

  <p>Also, as a matter of routine, we approach other member states when UK uptake is high to see if we can obtain quota through an international swap. We have done so for North Sea saithe but EU uptake, particularly by the French who have the major share of this quota, is currently higher than UK catch levels. Other member states are therefore understandably reluctant to swap away any fish at present but we shall continue to monitor the position.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency issued Guidance Notes to all local authorities on 14 July 2000. I am advised by the FSA that this was followed by updates in August and September. The Scottish Food Co-ordinating Committee (SFCC) also produced and distributed a further guidance document for enforcement officers on the criteria to be met by butchers applying for a licence.</p>

  <p>Under the current arrangements, GPs can receive payments for providing a Chronic Disease Management Programme for patients with diabetes. This is an organised programme which has to be approved by the Primary Care Trust/Island Health Board and has to provide specific services detailed in the Statement of Fees and Allowances. Currently around 92% of all GPs are providing such programmes.</p>

  <p>Payments under the programme are reviewed annually by the Doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB) and are increased in line with the annual GP pay uplift. Other than this there are no plans to increase the payment further.</p>

  <p>A number of initiatives which use electronic data interchange are underway. An important initiative is being taken forward as &quot;Electronic Clinical Communications Implementation&quot; (ECCI). This programme will establish widespread electronic clinical communications between primary and secondary care over a three-year programme. These communications include:</p>

  <p>widespread clinical email including seeking consultant&#8217;s opinion;</p>

  <p>co-ordinated referral information;</p>

  <p>electronic booking - protocol based where appropriate;</p>

  <p>test ordering and results receiving;</p>

  <p>discharge letters and summaries and clinic letters; and</p>

  <p>information in support of shared care.</p>

  <p>Other national projects being led by Common Services Agency include GP practices submitting patient registration data electronically to Practitioner Services Division (PSD), with over 50 practices now live. Similar electronic links to PSD are currently in planning covering payments to dentists. A project to provide community pharmacists with access to NHSnet is underway; this would be an important step towards enabling transmission of prescriptions from GP Practices to community pharmacists.</p>

  <p>Although there were shortages of generic drugs during 1999-2000, contingency arrangements already in place ensured both that patients continued to receive their medicines and that community pharmacists were appropriately reimbursed. Scottish Executive Health Department officials are in regular contact with the Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council to ensure that these arrangements continue to achieve these twin objectives in cases of shortages.</p>

  <p>I also support the steps taken by the Department of Health to commission a fundamental review of the way the generics market serves the needs of Primary Care. I will be looking carefully at the department&#8217;s conclusions and the implications for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Establishing a serogroup for a case of meningococcal disease is straightforward if the organism itself has been isolated from the patient. However, it is good clinical practice for suspected cases to be given antibiotics as soon as possible, even before transfer to a hospital. In such cases, in particular where antibiotics have been successful, isolation of the organism is frequently impossible (around two thirds of the total) because the treatment makes the organism more difficult to extract.</p>

  <p>Technical improvements in diagnostic techniques are being made all the time, and the level of submission of specimens to the Scottish Meningococcal Reference Laboratory, which carries out such testing, has never been higher.</p>

  <p>Ongoing demand in Scotland exists primarily for slate to repair historic buildings of importance. Scottish slate has been out of production since the 1950s and demand for slate in Scotland is met either by recycling slate from existing buildings or by import from the rest of the UK or abroad. Reliable estimates are not available for the amount of slate imported into Scotland although at a UK level around half of demand is met by imports from overseas.</p>

  <p>Reliable estimates of demand for slate in Scotland are not available. However Scottish Homes estimate that there are currently 642,000 houses with slate roofs in Scotland. It is estimated that around 50% of these homes will require roofing renewal over the next 30 years. In addition, the stock of listed buildings, most of which have slated roofs, provides a large maintenance market for Scottish recycled slate. Approximately 100 listed building repair projects are grant-aided by the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland each year. <br /></p>
