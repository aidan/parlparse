  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there have been economic advantages to the Scottish economy as a result of implementation of the Air Route Development Fund and the reduced need for short-haul flights through hub airports.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Route Development Fund has contributed substantially to the growth of direct international air routes to and from Scotland. As a result, Scotland is now much better connected to the rest of Europe and served by a growing number of intercontinental connections to key markets in North America, the Middle East and beyond, reducing the reliance on connecting internal UK flights and providing journey time savings for both business and inbound tourists.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive conducts an annual census of staff employed in local authority social work services departments. Information collected includes the age and gender of staff employed in day care and residential services for children. However, this information is not broken down into the type of unit providing the service, such as secure accommodation. Additionally, not all staff in these services may be directly involved in the care of looked after children and not all children receiving these services may be &quot;looked-after children&quot; as defined in the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. The latest census is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/06/27100810/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/06/27100810/0</a> .</p>

  <p>The Care Commission collects information on the age and gender of staff employed by services which they regulate and inspect, which include early education and childcare services for children and care homes for children and young people. This would include services provided by the voluntary and private sectors.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Social Services Council records the age and gender of social services workers who have applied for registration and are registered with it. The registration of particular groups of workers in day and residential services for children is being commenced in phases between 2005-08.</p>

  <p>In 2006, the Executive published the <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Social Services Labour Market</em> report, which contained aggregated information across the local authority, voluntary and private sectors, including information on the age and gender of staff employed in care homes for children and young people and in early education and childcare. This is available at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-1052 by Maureen Watt on 21 June 2007, whether it considers that a consequence of an imposed council tax freeze could be to force local authorities to raise additional revenue from increased charges for council services in order to continue delivering services to meet local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Government is committed to delivering a freeze in council tax at 2007-08 levels and we will be discussing with COSLA and local authorities how best this can be achieved. It is too early to speculate on the impact of what may emerge from those discussions.</p>

The resultant report highlights various options for securing sufficient resource to meet the additional demand and for uniform procurement procedures.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many cannabis factories have been discovered by the police in each year since 1999, broken down by police force.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-07-17.S3W-1500.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0717.htm#5">

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not collect information about the number of police operations that have discovered cannabis factories.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does collect drug seizure data from the eight police forces within Scotland and these data do contain information about seizures that have recovered cannabis plants. In most cases it is known many cannabis plants were recovered in each seizure operation. However, specific details about size of plants, how the plants were being grown, whether they were grown for the purpose of sale etc are not known.</p>

  <p>Presented are the number of cannabis plants recovered in drug seizures broken down by the corresponding police forces from year 1999.</p>

  <p>The number of plants from Central was not available over the period. Where plants were recovered in Central, the plants were &quot;weighed&quot; and not counted. This means that plants could not be distinguished from cannabis in herbal form in the statistics. This matter has now been rectified and Central will be able to produce figures in relation to the number of plants recovered in the future.</p>

  <p>1999-2000</p>

  <p>The Centre for Education for Racial Equality in Scotland has been commissioned to update and augment the Executive&rsquo;s anti-sectarianism education resource <em>Don&rsquo;t Give It, Don&rsquo;t Take It</em> . As part of that work a new section on twinning between denominational and non-denominational schools is being added. It is also our intention to run for a second year a &pound;100,000 fund to support anti-sectarian projects in schools, including twinning initiatives.</p>

  <p>On shared campuses, it is entirely a matter for local authorities to decide the configuration of their school estate.</p>

  <p>In May 2006 the Executive, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Catholic Education Service ran a national seminar to promote twinning. This was followed in December by publication of <em>Building Friendships and Strengthening Communities: a guide to twinning between denominational and non-denominational schools</em> , a copy of which was sent to every school in Scotland. It is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41267). A &pound;100,000 fund was made available in 2006-07 to support innovative anti-sectarian projects in schools, including establishing new twinning arrangements.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of probationer teachers employed in publicly funded schools, by local authority and by sector, on the 2006-07 teacher induction scheme.</p>

  <p>There will have been other probationer teachers employed in publicly funded schools on a temporary/supply basis who either turned down their allocation to the scheme or opted not to apply to the scheme or were not eligible to join the scheme, and there will have been a number of probationer teachers employed by independent schools.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many probationary teachers were employed in the 2005-06 academic year, broken down by local authority and into primary and secondary schools and, of these, how many obtained full-time employment at the end of their probationary period in each category.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of probationer teachers employed in publicly funded schools, by local authority and by sector, on the 2005-06 teacher induction scheme as at September 2005 and how many were subsequently employed as full time teachers as at September 2006.</p>

  <p>There will have been other probationer teachers employed in publicly funded schools on a temporary/supply basis who turned down their allocation to the scheme, opted not to apply to the scheme, were not eligible to join the scheme, or were employed by independent schools. Data relating to these categories of probationer teachers are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>There will be a number of teachers who chose to defer taking up employment following successful completion of their induction year or were employed on a part-time or supply basis (whether or not by choice) or were employed in independent schools. While comprehensive data relating to all these categories are not held centrally, a survey conducted by the General Teaching Council for Scotland found that 91.8% of 2005-06 probationers who responded to the survey were employed as teachers in some capacity.</p>

  <p>The Glow (formerly Scottish Schools Digital Network) programme will start offering live services to schools in the first term of the 2007-08 school year. Technical development is largely complete. During the first half of 2007 a series of pilots have been run, involving up to 36 schools from 13 local authorities. The project team has been working with local authorities and other user organisations to help them plan for the introduction of Glow. Most local authorities now have well-developed implementation plans, and eleven have progressed to the point of signing the Customer Agreement which will allow them to take the services.</p>

  <p>I have set out my plans for the Sea Fisheries Advisory and Reference Group (SeaFAR) in my answer to question S3W-923 on 28 June 2007. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>I acknowledge the good work done by the Scottish Inshore Fisheries Group (SIFAG) towards the shared aim of profitable and sustainable inshore fisheries and a modern and effective inshore fisheries governance system. I strongly support the principle of delegating responsibility for inshore fisheries management to local fishing interests. I have asked my officials to take stock between now and the summer with local interests on the development of Inshore Fisheries Groups (IFGs). In the meantime, SIFAG members, with whom I will meet in due course, will have the opportunity to contribute in full to the process.</p>

  <p>The distribution of local government finance is kept under regular review and the needs-based formula currently contains indicators to recognise the additional cost of delivering services to areas with sparse populations such as the number of pupils in small schools and population living in settlements of less than 1,000.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Special Islands Needs Allowance (SINA) provides additional funding for local authorities with habitable islands in recognition of the unique circumstances that they face in delivering services to their Island communities.</p>

  <p>As I indicated in Parliament on 28 June, I am always open to suggestions for possible improvements to the distribution formula.</p>

  <p>In the transport debate on 27 June 2007, we informed the Parliament about how we would take forward and manage our investment programme for transport.</p>

  <p>We confirmed our commitment to the Waverley Railway (Borders) project, advising however that the funding package proposed by the Waverley railway partnership would not be sufficient to deliver the project and that the opening in December 2011 was not achievable. We confirmed funding support of &pound;115 million in 2002 prices, subject to the project meeting the three remaining funding conditions i.e. (1) assumptions underlining the business case must hold, (2) a clear and comprehensive risk management strategy must be developed and delivered and (3) the railway must be integrated with local bus services.</p>

  <p>On the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine project we advised that due to concerns that the project was running late and over budget we would introduce a simpler project structure to strengthen governance which would take the project through to opening in spring 2008 at a cost of &pound;80 million to &pound;85 million.</p>

  <p>In respect of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link project Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) and Network Rail (NR) are working together to combine the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) with NR&rsquo;s Paisley Corridor Renewal (PCR) project.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland, SPT and NR will, over the Parliament&rsquo;s summer recess, work to deliver the detailed schedule, cost and risk model for the integrated projects and we expect to be in a position to provide the Parliament with an update in the early autumn.</p>

  <p>We will press Network Rail for the delivery of the full Airdrie to Bathgate scheme by December 2010 and we expect them to contain costs within the range of &pound;300 million to &pound;375 million in outturn prices.</p>

  <p>Similarly we expect Network Rail to deliver the core of the current Waverley station works on schedule and within budget by the end of 2007. Network Rail continues to work with the Balmoral hotel to reach agreement on the proposed improvements to the Waverley steps.</p>

  <p>The Larkhall to Milngavie project was delivered on schedule in December 2005. The original budget for the project was &pound;34.5 million and the current estimated final cost is &pound;35.24 million, which is subject to discussions between Transport Scotland and SPT. You will be pleased to note that the patronage figures for the service as of March 2007 show an increase of some 53% against the original business case forecasts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not set a minimum benefit to cost ratio for rail projects. Since 2001 it has been a requirement that all transport projects, for which Scottish Executive support or approval is required, be appraised in accordance with the Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance (STAG). STAG ensures that the contribution of transport improvements to the economy is fully assessed alongside contributions and impacts on the environment, accessibility and social inclusion, safety, and integration. The successful completion of the STAG process allows the rationale behind a potential transport intervention to be presented in a clear, evidence-led manner and provides the information required by a decision maker to make an informed and appropriate choice.</p>

  <p>The estimate for local roads is a matter for the local authorities. The Scottish Executive does not require councils to provide the information requested and therefore has no centrally held estimate. The Scottish Executive supports local authorities&rsquo; net revenue expenditure on roads maintenance through the core local government finance settlement. <em>Spending Review 2004</em> added a further &pound;60 million in both 2006-07 and 2007-08 to the Roads and Transport Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocations, the majority of which was added to the roads maintenance GAEs. Total GAE for roads maintenance will amount to &pound;320 million by 2007-08 and this represents an increase of 23% on the 2004-05 allocation to local authorities. Each council is responsible for the maintenance and improvement of local roads in its area and it is entirely a matter for councils to decide what priority is given to local roads and to allocate the resources available to them accordingly.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland have budgeted &pound;60.4 million for structural road and bridge maintenance and &pound;51.9 million for routine maintenance and winter service on the trunk road network for 2007-08.</p>

  <p>The 2011 deadline was challenging and had no room for slippage. As the project has developed it has become clear that the land searches required to complete the draft Compulsory Purchase Orders have been more complex and have taken longer than anticipated. New procedures for confirming orders within the Transport and Works (Scotland) Act 2007 which came into force earlier this year will also have an impact on the overall timetable.</p>

  <p>When carrying out roadworks, roads authorities are expected to comply with the Code of Practice <em>Delivering Best Value in Highway Maintenance</em> . This Code of Practice has been prepared by the Institution of Highways and Transportation and is endorsed by, amongst others, the Scottish Executive, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Utility Companies such as gas and electricity suppliers also carry out roadworks and are required to comply with the statutory Code of Practice &ndash; <em>Safety at street works and road works </em>issued jointly by the Scottish Executive, the Department for Transport and the Welsh assembly Government.</p>

  <p>The New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 requires utilities to serve notice on roads authorities giving advance intimation on all proposed road works and reinstatements. It further requires roads authorities to keep a register of road works in roads for which they are responsible. Information submitted by utility companies is circulated to other utility companies so that, where possible, they may co-ordinate road works.</p>

  <p>Provisions contained in the Transport (Scotland) Act 2005 will further improve the co-ordination and planning of road works. Measures include new requirements for improving the quality of information submitted and the appointment of a Scottish Road Works Commissioner who can impose penalties in the event of systematic failure to comply.</p>

  <p>My officials in Transport Scotland have had regular discussion with Highland Council representatives about their proposals for the B8082 Inverness Southern Distributor Road (trunk link road), including the possibility of trunking the route. Formal written approaches were made earlier this year by the Chairman of Highland Council&rsquo;s Transport, Environment and Community Services Committee and senior officers in Highland Council asking about the possibility of trunking the route.</p>

  <p>I shall await the outcome of the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) before taking any decision on the issue of trunking and funding. The STPR will consider the need for alternatives to the existing trunk routes through Inverness as a strategic transport hub and this will take account of the work undertaken by Highlands Council on the Inverness South Connectivity Study which includes the Inverness Southern Distributor Road.</p>

  <p>Details of the local authorities that have been selected to take part in the free school meals pilot schemes were announced on Wednesday 11 July 2007. The pilots will involve all pupils in primary 1 to primary 3 (P1 to P3) in Glasgow City Council, West Dunbartonshire Council, Fife Council, East Ayrshire Council and Scottish Borders Council. These authorities have been selected because they include recognised areas of deprivation and cover urban areas as well as small towns and rural areas. Further details of the pilots will be set out in due course.</p>

Other measures to benefit town centres include our support for Business Improvement Districts pilots, the substantial funding we provide to local government to support a range of local services including for housing and regeneration, and our commitment to remove or reduce the burden of business rates for small businesses, many of which are located in town centres throughout Scotland.</p>
