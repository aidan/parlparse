  <p>Adoption certificates are issued, on request, by the General Register Office for Scotland. It is not possible to identify the number of certificates issued in any given year for children under the age of one.</p>

  <p>Statistics on the number of adoption applications for children are published each year by the Scottish Executive. The latest figures, including those for children under one year, can be accessed at:</p>

  <p>Our Programme for Government sets out our intention to introduce crofting reform legislation. Our plans were explained in the White Paper <em>Crofting Reform Proposals For Legislation</em> published in July 2002. This included a proposal to create a new constitution for the Crofters Commission which would give it power to make grants.</p>

  <p>This legislation will enable the Crofters Commission to implement the Crofting Development Programme. A date for the introduction of legislation is yet to be determined. However, we hope to be able to publish a draft bill later this year.</p>

  <p>This subject, which involves reserved matters relating to the provision of financial services, is currently under consideration. The Cabinet Office, in consultation with other government departments and devolved administrations responsible for emergency services, is currently pursuing the matter of personal insurance cover. At present they are collecting evidence to establish if there is a problem and what the implications may be for the emergency services. Furthermore, discussions are also taking place with the insurance industry.</p>

  <p>There has never been a formal ruling as to the status of the Livestock Improvement Schemes under European Union state aid rules. However, concerns have been expressed by the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (which is responsible for ensuring UK compliance with the Community Guidelines for State Aid in the Agricultural Sector) as to the extent to which the schemes are consistent with the guidelines. In particular these guidelines prohibit the granting of an ongoing operating aid and limit the level of permissible support. On the basis of legal advice, we share those concerns.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to replace these schemes. We have ended the Ram Hire Scheme because it was not effective and it did not deliver measurable improvement or value for money. We ended the Shetland Ram Scheme because the purpose for which it was created is no longer relevant. These issues are clearly explained in the evaluation of the schemes. That document is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 32088) and is published on the Crofters Commission Website. Paper copies are also obtainable on request from the Crofters Commission and the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the Livestock Improvement Schemes concluded that the Ram Purchase Scheme was not meeting its objectives. In deciding that it should therefore be discontinued, we recognised that some members of the crofting groups who currently use that scheme might benefit from assistance in adjusting to the new circumstances. The offer of training is therefore to the members of the various groups who utilised the Ram Purchase Scheme. We shall be consulting interested parties shortly on the form the training will take. This will depend on the level of interest in taking up the offer and the circumstances and existing skills of those who wish to do so. It is our intention to provide training to meet the needs of the individuals concerned.</p>

  <p>In Building Better Cities, we commissioned each city to prepare a ten-year City-Vision. As part of the City-Vision process, we required detailed consultation with neighbouring local authorities and other regional stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The City-Visions describe the outcomes the Cities Growth Fund is intended to secure for each city and its surrounding city-region and form the basis for the allocation of funding among different projects. Responsibility for allocating the funds to individual City-Vision projects rests with each city-based Community Planning Partnership. Local ownership of the City-Visions, combined with management and evaluation of individual projects by Community Planning Partnerships, ensure that funding is targeted directly at the realisation of locally-identified priorities.</p>

  <p>The results of this process are reflected in Edinburgh's City-Vision (Building a Better Edinburgh: <a href="http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/citiesreview" target="_blank">www.edinburgh.gov.uk/citiesreview</a>), which describes the set of projects (including a number put forward by neighbouring councils) to be financed by the Cities Growth Fund and which are designed to form a coherent package which will provide significant benefits for both Edinburgh and the wider city-region.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for management and evaluation of individual City-Vision projects funded by the Cities Growth Fund rests with each of the six city local authorities, as lead partners in the Community Planning Partnership.</p>

  <p>We expect rigorous processes to operate in each local authority for management of Cities Growth Fund grant allocations, in line with their duty under section 95 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 to make arrangements for the proper administration of their financial affairs. Each city local authority is required to submit an annual report to the Executive by 30 June each year, covering the outcomes achieved by each City-Vision project, third-party leverage funding obtained, the award of any contracts and future investment plans. By 31 July 2006, each authority must prepare a consolidated report covering the full grant period. Annual reports detailing expenditure must be certified by the authority's Director of Finance as having been spent according to the grant conditions.</p>

  <p>We also expect the city local authorities to have regard to the need to secure Best Value in the management of all City-Vision projects. Individual elements financed by the Cities Growth Fund are subject to the same degree of scrutiny, including external audit, as other items of council expenditure: this should include pre-expenditure assessment of significant projects and regular progress reporting to council management teams and executive members.</p>

If the caller remains on hold, an announcement is activated stating that the advisers are all busy and the call will be answered as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>An out of hours announcement is also in place which is activated when the office is closed. This invites the caller to call back during office hours or leave a name and telephone number in order to allow an adviser to call back.</p>

  <p>After a competitive tendering exercise, a one year contract was awarded on 2 February 2003 with an option to extend it for a further 12 month period. This option was taken up and the contract has been extended to 1 February 2005. Action to re-tender for the period from 2 February 2005 onwards will commence shortly.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises the important role that rural village halls play in the life of their local communities. They are often the focus of a rural community's social and community activities &#8211; allowing groups to meet locally and providing other services such as internet access or advice surgeries that may not be easily accessible otherwise.</p>

  <p>We want to ensure that communities across rural Scotland learn from each other. With funding from the Scottish Executive Rural Voices programme in 2003-04, the Collieston community in Aberdeenshire spoke to a wide range of village hall committees to learn from their experience. We will be working with Collieston in the next few months to build on this work and produce comprehensive guidance for rural communities across Scotland on developing village halls.</p>

  <p>The Local Capital Grants Scheme is designed to assist local voluntary and community organisations to provide new or upgrade existing community facilities for educational, social and recreational activities. Projects can apply for 50% of eligible costs up to a grant limit of &pound;100,000.</p>

  <p>The State Veterinary Service (SVS) is a GB-wide organisation supporting the delivery of animal health and welfare policy of Scottish, Welsh and DEFRA Ministers. The SVS, which will move to agency status in 2005, is overseen by a Management Board comprising of officials from the three administrations. The board oversees the SVS's strategic direction and monitors its performance.</p>

  <p>In Scotland the SVS is headed by the Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland) who is supported by a team of policy vets who provide independent veterinary advice to Scottish ministers and a Head of Veterinary Services who line manages the five Scottish animal health divisional offices which are responsible for the implementation of Scottish Animal Health and Welfare policies.</p>
