  <p>This information on modern apprentices has never been held centrally.

  <p>The Scottish Public Finance Manual, which applies to the Scottish Executive, its agencies and non-departmental bodies, states that all procurement of goods and services should be based on value for money, having due regard to propriety and regularity. &quot;Value for money&quot; is defined as the optimum combination of whole-life cost and quality (or fitness for purpose) to meet the user&#8217;s requirement.</p>

  <p>Consideration of the costs of greenhouse gas emissions from appliances and energy installations can be taken into account when determining value for money where it is relevant to the subject matter of the contract.</p>

  <p>The Executive has published guidance on sustainable development issues in procurement which emphasises the need for purchasers to take full account of their organisation&#8217;s environmental policies and to seek environmentally preferable goods and services wherever they are available, affordable and fit for purpose. For example, over 75% of motor vehicles owned by the Executive are alternatively fuelled and the Executive&#8217;s electricity contract specifies that 100% of the electricity used by the Executive comes from renewable sources.</p>

  <p>These figures exclude agency consumption of cost of capital and capital depreciation. They exclude also the provisions made for the 2001 and 2003 decommissioning schemes and in-year allocations made for the 2003 Transitional Aid package and for a new Fisheries Protection Vessel. Decommissioning expenditure under the 2001 scheme was &#163;3.6 million and &#163;21.2 million in 2001-02 and 2002-03 respectively. For 2003-04, additional in-year provision was made for the Fisheries Decommissioning Scheme (up to &#163;40 million), the Transitional Aid package (up to &#163;10 million) and the new Fisheries Protection Vessel (&#163;18 million). Excluding such exceptional items, provision for the two Agencies typically accounts for over 75% of total Executive expenditure on fisheries. The balance of spending in any year is mainly in respect of awards under the EU Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance and the related domestic back-up grant scheme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions have been held with the Department of Trade and Industry and other government departments in respect of General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) negotiations relating to the water industry; where such discussions took place; who attended the meetings, and whether it will publish any minutes of such discussions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has ensured that the UK Government&#8217;s representations to the European Union on GATS reflect the Executive&#8217;s commitment to retain Scotland&#8217;s water services in the public sector. The UK Government has confirmed that no requests have been received for the UK to include water services in future GATS commitments, and that it does not have any intention of pressing for water services to be included.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not disclose details of exchanges between the Executive and the DTI about GATS, as these fall within the category of information whose disclosure could harm the candour and frankness of discussion between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government (<em>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</em>, Exemption 2).</p>

  <p>The Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 places NHS boards under a new duty to provide, or secure the provision of, primary medical services. It is a matter for NHS boards to determine whether or not general medical practitioners will need to be employed directly for the provision of these primary medical services.</p>

  <p>A key factor in reaching such decisions will be how boards intend to re-provide out-of-hours services. They are currently developing their plans in this area and therefore information is not yet available on this matter.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of research published in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> concerning the widespread prevalence of prescribing errors caused by computer systems in use at GP surgeries, what steps will be taken to (a) identify which GP practices are affected by prescription errors due to the use of these types of computer systems, (b) ensure that any faults are identified and rectified as expeditiously as possible and (c) ensure that GPs are instructed in the interim not to issue prescriptions, including automatic repeat prescriptions, without first checking in relation to errors and patient risk.</p>

  <p>The clinical responsibility to prescribe appropriately lies with individual GPs but the IT system support available to them must underpin safe and efficient prescribing behaviour.</p>

  <p>Whilst the <em>British Medical Journal</em> report referred to focused on GP IT systems used in England, and which account for less than 20% of those used in Scotland, the issues identified will be reviewed by the clinical information sub-group of the department&#8217;s eHealth programme board. A commentary in the report makes clear, however, that computers already help more effective prescribing and have reduced medication errors by as much as 60% simply by ensuring that prescriptions are legible, complete and in a standard format.</p>

  <p>The department is already working with all GP IT system suppliers active in Scotland on a programme of functionality enhancements, which has been agreed with GP representative bodies, to meet the ongoing needs of NHS Scotland, and which is supplementary to the existing accreditation standards. As part of this process, we will be reviewing the prescribing support arrangements in individual systems and requiring any improvements, which the clinical information sub-group deems to be necessary, to be put in hand.</p>

  <p>At present, as part of the dispensing process, community pharmacists are professionally responsible for checking prescriptions for accuracy, accurate dosage and any potential significant drug interactions before they are dispensed. Additionally, and as part of the migration path towards a new community pharmacy contract, new arrangements are being phased in to give community pharmacists an enhanced role to work with GPs in the management of patients with chronic but stable conditions. These arrangements are intended to improve the effectiveness of current repeat prescription arrangements.</p>

  <p>Once the clinical information sub-group has considered the report, the Chief Medical Officer will write to all GPs to make them aware of the report&#8217;s findings and any action required by the Scottish Executive Health Department. In addition, GPs will be encouraged to review their existing prescribing practice on an ongoing basis so that they make best and safest use of their IT system. NHS board prescribing and IT advisers are already in place to help GPs do this.</p>

  <p>The fees for the attendance by a registrar at a place other than a registration office to conduct a civil marriage, and for the approval of that place for civil marriages are not prescribed by the Registrar General for Scotland or the Scottish ministers. The fees are set by each local authority on a cost recovery basis and vary between local authorities according to the circumstances of each local authority and the type of place.</p>

  <p>The average fee for the attendance of a registrar at a place approved for civil marriages on Mondays to Fridays is &#163;154. Similarly, the average fee that would apply to attendance on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays is &#163;210.</p>

  <p>The Marriage (Scotland) Act 2002 allows for either a periodic approval of a place (for up to three years) or a temporary approval for a single wedding. The average fee across 32 local authorities is &#163;348. The average fee for a temporary approval is &#163;383.</p>

  <p>There is no fee set in statute or regulations relating to the authorisation of a minister of religion as an approved celebrant. Nor is there a fee for the authorisation of a registrar to conduct civil marriages. However, there are fees which apply nationally that are prescribed by the Registrar General for Scotland with the approval of the Scottish ministers relating to the legal formalities that must be completed for marriage in Scotland, whether a civil marriage or a religious marriage. There is a fee of &#163;20 when each person submits notice of intention to marry. Also, if the couple wish to have an extract from the marriage register (a marriage certificate), the charge is &#163;8.50 per extract. If the couple wish to have a civil marriage, the prescribed fee for the solemnisation of a civil marriage by a registrar is &#163;45. A religious celebrant will often charge a fee to cover his expenses for conducting a religious marriage.</p>

  <p>Officials within the Executive have met with the Atkinson team, and will be helping them to source the Scottish data for the devolved services as they develop any new measures for the UK as a whole. In parallel, Scottish Executive analysts are considering the wide range of existing measures of public sector activity for Scotland, and will assess the appropriateness of these alongside the conclusions of the Atkinson review.</p>

  <p>We will then be in a position to identify where more sophisticated or different measures are required, with the aim of developing measurements of productivity for the public sector in Scotland which take into account the new UK approach, where appropriate.

  <p>The Weeds Act 1959 places the responsibility for the control of certain weeds, including ragwort, on the occupier of the land. The act also empowers ministers to serve notices requiring the occupier to take action to prevent weeds from spreading. Failure to take action following service of a notice is a criminal offence under the act.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for ensuring the provision of local leisure facilities such as skateparks lies with local authorities. However, the Executive made available to local authorities Quality of Life funding for the three years to 2005-06 totalling &#163;180 million. This funding was to be committed to projects under two themes, one of which is children and young people. A number of local authorities have committed some of their allocation towards skatepark projects.</p>

  <p>Funding for skatepark facilities is also available from the Lottery Sports Fund administered by <strong></strong>sportscotland. Applications for funding are considered against set criteria and other competing bids. Further information on the Lottery Sports Fund can be found on <strong></strong>sportscotland&#8217;s website at www.sportscotland.org.uk.</p>
