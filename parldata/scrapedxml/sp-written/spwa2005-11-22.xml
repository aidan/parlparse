  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-20084 by Malcolm Chisholm on 3 November 2005, what information it has on how the child care subsidy provided to parents under the Working for Families Fund affects the working family tax credit paid to those parents.</p>

  <p>The subsidy provided varies between parents as the amount is based on individual need. However, the subsidy usually takes the form of funding 100% of child care costs for the parent for a short, time-limited period only. It is then replaced by the child care element of Working Tax Credit which meets 70% of a parents&rsquo; child care costs. The difference between receiving 70% of child care costs through Working Tax Credit and 100% of child care costs through subsidy, for the initial period on entering employment, can be crucial in supporting parents to sustain their employment at this important but often difficult transition period.</p>

  <p>No specific study has been undertaken in relation to winter mortality. However, the Scottish Executive is funding two major research projects evaluating the impact of the central heating programme.</p>

  <p>The first is a long-term project being undertaken by the University of Edinburgh and TNS Social Research looking at the impact of the programme on the health of recipients. This work is expected to be completed towards the end of 2006.</p>

  <p>The second is an annual survey of households included in each of the first three years of the programme. This research showed that in the first year of the programme nearly 90% of the people surveyed who were in fuel poverty were lifted out of it after receiving the programme.</p>

  <p>Once the findings of these research projects are finalised they will be made available to the public.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers high-efficiency condensing boilers to be a more cost-effective or energy-efficient way of running central heating systems; whether it plans to introduce measures to require condensing boilers in all new heating system installations, and, if so, what the timescales are for introducing such a requirement.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>When compared with the level of efficiency for regular boilers required under the current Scottish building regulations, installation of condensing boilers as direct replacements can be difficult to justify in terms of cost-effectiveness or energy-efficiency alone.</p>

  <p>Condensing boilers, however, can make significant savings in terms of reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and consequently consideration is being given to introducing them into Scottish building regulations as a part of the current review. They would not be made mandatory in all new heating systems as this would disadvantage other emerging energy-efficient technology such as heat-pumps, but could be one way of meeting the energy standard for heating systems. This review will be out to public consultation in early 2006 with subsequent changes being brought into effect in spring 2007.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Since the programme started in 2001, a total 33,992 non-condensing boilers have been installed. At this stage the types of boilers to be used in any successor programme have yet to be decided, and as such it is not possible to say if any non-condensing boilers would be installed between now and May 2007. It is estimated that if condensing boilers had been used in the programme to date, the additional cost (based on current prices) would be in the region of &pound;8.5 million.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that the average annual savings resulting in using condensing as opposed to non-condensing boilers would range between &pound;19 for a flat to &pound;41 for a detached property. It is estimated that there would be a 10% reduction in energy consumption but there will be wide variations in both price and energy savings as a result of climate, exposure, occupancy patterns, heating controls, insulation and other factors.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Householders, if they so wish, can install condensing boilers as an upgrade to the system provided under the Scottish Executive programme. Any additional costs would require to be met by the householder.</p>

  <p>The central heating guidelines are continually assessed and many improvements have been made since the programme was introduced. The existing central heating programme in the private sector will be complete by April 2006, and options regarding future delivery are currently being considered.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to achieving full compliance with the water quality standards set out in the European Bathing Water Directive (76/160/EEC), at all designated bathing waters in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To this end, the Scottish Executive has sanctioned the expenditure of &pound;1.8 billion by Scottish Water during the period 2002-06 to upgrade its assets, with priority action being taken to protect bathing waters. A number of pilot projects have also been taken forward by the Scottish Executive in partnership with others, tackling diffuse pollution from farms and urban areas. As a result, more than half of Scotland&rsquo;s bathing waters currently meet the stringent water quality standards required to attain Blue Flag status.</p>

  <p>However, for Blue Flag status to be awarded, other factors, such as the provision of beach amenities, are assessed. These however, are matters for individual beach operators. The decision as to whether or not to apply for Blue Flag status is also a matter for individual beach operators, although the Scottish Executive is pleased to note that Scotland currently has a record number of Blue Flag beaches.</p>

The appointment will be conducted following guidelines issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland, which will ensure that the process is open and transparent, and appointments made on the basis of merit.</p>

  <p>As I made clear at that conference, people with COPD will benefit from the generic approach to the management of long-term conditions set out in <em>Delivering for Health</em> . In the Scottish context, the most effective way of improving services for those with COPD is for organisations representing their interests to engage with community health partnerships and with the Long-Term Conditions Alliance for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>A separate figure for Scottish Executive spend specifically on health promotion is not available as there are a number of funding streams which also have a health promotion element in them but which are not separately identified as such. These include funding for drug services, alcohol services, smoking cessation services, the National Demonstration Projects (Starting Well, Healthy Respect, Have a Heart Paisley), and mental health and well-being.</p>

  <p>Health promotion is an integral part of the Executive&rsquo;s strategy for improving Scotland&rsquo;s health. <em>Delivering for Health</em> identifies the need to ensure that services reach those who need them most, and that real health improvement can be demonstrated, especially in our most disadvantaged communities. Such services would include health promotion activities.</p>

  <p>I should explain that responsibility for dealing with planning applications and planning matters generally rests initially with the planning authority. Scottish ministers would only consider intervening in the process, by calling in a planning application for their own determination, in the most exceptional circumstances, for example where a proposed development raises issues of significant national importance.</p>

  <p>The following is a list of applications notified to the Scottish Executive and Historic Scotland by planning authorities in respect of school PPP projects. It covers the period January 1998 until November 2005. The list indicates whether the proposals were called in for determination by Scottish Ministers or cleared back to the local authority:</p>

  <p>Last year the First Minister announced plans to establish St Andrew&rsquo;s Day as a day when Scots of all backgrounds, both at home and abroad, can join together in an annual celebration of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive has since planned a range of activities to celebrate St Andrew&rsquo;s Day this year.</p>

  <p>For the first time the Scottish Executive will be hosting St Andrew&rsquo;s Day festivities in Edinburgh city centre on 30 November with a free public ceilidh. The ceilidh in the capital on Scotland&rsquo;s day will take place at an open-air stage in the Lawnmarket and indoors in the adjacent Hub venue. The event is to be themed around our One Scotland Many Cultures campaign, and the evening&rsquo;s bill of entertainment will draw on Scotland&rsquo;s strong national identity for inspiration and will reflect our country&rsquo;s increasing cultural diversity.</p>

  <p>This year&rsquo;s celebrations will serve as a pilot event for future years, although the theme for future celebrations will vary from year to year. As such the focus for activity this year will be in Edinburgh, but it is our intention that in subsequent years there will be a programme for St Andrew&rsquo;s Day celebrations which communities across Scotland can embrace, and one which can also be promoted abroad.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers will be involved in a range of events on St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day.</p>

  <p>The First Minister will attend the Glenfiddich Awards Ceremony in Edinburgh</p>

  <p>Ross Finnie, Minister for Environment and Rural Development, will co-host a seminar in the European Parliament in Brussels, attended by the European Agriculture Commissioner, show-casing to European counter-parts Scotland&rsquo;s approach to rural development. Following that seminar, he will also co-host a <em>Taste of Scotland </em>reception in the European Parliament, attended by 500 key policy makers in Brussels from EU institutions, regions and member states.</p>

  <p>Patricia Ferguson, Minister for Culture, Tourism and Sport will be attending a St Andrew&rsquo;s Day event at the University of Glasgow&rsquo;s Crichton campus in Dumfries at which Scottish songwriters will perform for the first time selected songs in the Burns tradition;</p>

  <p>Malcolm Chisholm, Minister for Communities will be attending a Race Equality Champions lunchtime event being hosted by the Commission for Racial Equality in the Scottish Parliament, and together with Peter Peacock, Minister for Children and Young People, the Scottish Inter Faith Council&rsquo;s evening reception in the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>Tom McCabe, Minister for Finance and Public Sector Reform, will attend the annual Brussels St Andrew&rsquo;s Lecture on 29 November 2005. This year, the lecture will be delivered by Alexander McCall Smith, the author of <em>No. 1 Ladies&rsquo; Detective Agency</em> series.</p>

  <p>South Lanarkshire Council is hosting a St. Andrew&rsquo;s Night event in Rutherglen town hall. The event which is being organised by the Scottish Council on Archives is entitled <em>Documents that Shaped the Nation</em>, which will be chaired by the BBC Scotland reporter Brian Taylor and will feature a panel of Scotland&rsquo;s top historians, as well as MSPs Wendy Alexander and Tommy Sheridan.</p>

  <p>Further information promised in the answer to S2W-20088 is as follows:</p>

  <p>A St Andrew&rsquo;s Day message from the First Minister will be sent to all Foreign and Commonwealth Office British Embassy networks.</p>

  <p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) were contacted in October to offer a special package of promotional items for St Andrew&rsquo;s Day celebrations. The Scottish Executive has received fifty-seven requests to provide promotional items for events and other related activities.</p>

  <p>The FCO British Embassy networks are holding or supporting a large number of events around the world to celebrate St. Andrew&rsquo;s Day. The Scottish Executive is now aware of forty-one events being held around the world:</p>

  <p>The DEL cost of student loans issued by the Student Loans Company is currently 31p for every &pound;1 of loan issued.</p>

  <p>There is also a DEL cost of the unwinding of the write-off and debt sale subsidy provisions. This unwinding cost is not a static annual amount but is obtained by multiplying the opening balance on these provisions with the RPI rate and the cost of capital. In 2004-05 these amounts were &pound;10.8 million and &pound;4.6 million respectively (unaudited figures).</p>

  <p>The survey was run on the same terms as any other Social Research study. It was commissioned by the Scottish Executive from independent researchers, who are experts in the field &ndash; they completed several similar studies for the Department for Education and Skills.</p>

  <p>The project was overseen by a Research Advisory Group consisting of Scottish Executive officials and external members. The day-to-day management of the project was undertaken by the Analytical Services Division responsible for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. Project management included detailed exchanges on all aspects of the project, including emerging results, which were discussed by the Research Advisory Group in the presence of the researchers. The final report emanating from this process contains the facts that were found by the researchers and carries their name. Ministers were briefed on the final report recently and have not requested any changes.</p>

  <p>I look forward to a full, public and informed debate of the findings after publication.</p>
