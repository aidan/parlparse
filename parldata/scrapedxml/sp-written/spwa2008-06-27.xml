  <p>The information is not recorded. It is the responsibility of GP surgeries who have a contract with a NHS board to decide the manner in which their practice is staffed to ensure patients receive the services they require. The proportion of the NHS budget for GP surgeries for the employment of practice nurses is not separately identified. GP surgeries are paid a &quot;global sum&quot; for the basic costs of running a practice. Again it is a matter for the GP surgery to decide what proportion of the global sum is used to pay staff.</p>

  <p>The exact steps required in the control of an incident or outbreak is an issue for each local incident management team. These will vary depending on the circumstances and the organism concerned. The Chief Nursing Officer wrote to NHS Scotland in November 2007 to clarify the arrangements for reporting healthcare associated infection incidents and outbreaks.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of clostridium difficile cases is currently reported quarterly by Health Protection Scotland and broken down by NHS board. Scottish Government officials have, however, written to all NHS boards, including NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, to ask them to provide a report on the number of clostridium difficile cases for each acute hospital within their area, providing data at hospital level, for the period December 2007 to May 2008.</p>

  <p>The principal interventions effective against clostridium difficile (C.diff) in our hospitals are rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients; prudent prescribing of antibiotics; environmental cleaning; and rigorous hand hygiene procedures.</p>

  <p>Mandatory national reporting of C.diff cases by laboratories was established in 2006, and the national C.diff reference laboratory for Scotland was established in 2008, which is a source of expert advice as well as providing information on typing of strains such as the hyper-virulent O27 strain. A national policy on provision of single rooms in new hospitals is also under development.</p>

  <p>Prudent prescribing guidance was issued to NHS boards in 2005 by the HAI Task Force, and this was followed up by the launch in March 2008 of the Scottish Management of Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan. The action plan has already resulted in the funding and establishment of the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group, which will oversee national surveillance of resistance and antibiotic use, and drive improvements in prescribing practice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s HAI Task Force issued the national cleaning services specification in 2004, and the related monitoring system has shown continuing improvements in hospital cleaning standards across Scotland ever since. Monitoring of compliance with hand hygiene has also shown good improvements, with all NHS boards making good progress towards achieving our target of 90% hand hygiene compliance by staff by November 2008. This is supported by our ongoing national hand hygiene campaign.</p>

  <p>Health Protection Scotland have also issued a model policy document on transmission based precautions, advice on management of C.diff O27, and a &quot;care bundle&quot; of five essential elements of care for all C.diff patients. An overarching new Scottish guidance document on C.diff is currently under preparation by HPS.</p>

  <p>The independent review of Vale of Leven cases announced by me on 18 June 2008 will examine any failings there may have been in following these procedures.</p>

  <p>Every primary teacher is trained to cover the whole curriculum including PE. We are also committed to increasing the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of primary teachers in the field of PE by continuing support for the PGCE in PE run by Glasgow and Edinburgh universities. Already around 600 primary teachers have enrolled on this course. We will provide funding of &pound;1.8 million over the next three years for this course and related CPD activities in PE for primary teachers. In secondary schools there are 1,756 qualified PE teachers which makes it the fifth largest subject in terms of teacher numbers.</p>

  <p>The deployment of teachers is a matter for local authorities as they are responsible for the delivery of education services at a local level and therefore best placed to know what is needed to meet desired educational outcomes.</p>
