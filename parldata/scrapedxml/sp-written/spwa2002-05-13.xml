  <p>NHS Scotland employers operate under Family Friendly Policy guidance. These policies are designed to encourage recruitment and retention in the NHS, enabling men and women to combine work with home commitments and contribute to making NHS Scotland an attractive and exemplar employer. The Scottish Executive Health Department is also funding Return to Practice Schemes to help nurses and midwives return to work, as well as providing funds to support flexible training options for junior doctors.</p>

  <p>In relation to education the recruitment and deployment of teachers is a matter for the local authority employers.

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the programme of audits of ports in April 2001 was undertaken to help inform policy development on the issue of illegal importation of food products of animal origin. The board of the Food Standards Agency subsequently agreed, at its meeting in October 2001, that agency officials should explore a number of proposals to improve controls on imported food at ports. The agency has also been involved in the development of the Government Action Plan on illegal imports, published by Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at the end of March, as were devolved administrations. The information from the agency&#146;s audit programme will inform on-going work in this area.</p>

  <p>On 31 October 2001 we announced details of a new community safety award programme which will give all council-led Community Safety Partnerships a share of &#163;12 million over the next three years for local community safety initiatives. The programme will allow Community Safety Partnerships to identify local priorities and address issues such as graffiti. For 2002-03 the Inverclyde Community Safety Partnership has been allocated a total community safety award of &#163;113,140.61. One of the priorities within the partnership&#146;s strategy is to tackle vandalism, graffiti and fly tipping. Indeed, Inverclyde Council&#146;s Building Services Department has a dedicated graffiti squad which will remove obscene or offensive graffiti immediately when reported and other graffiti on a priority basis.</p>

  <p>Services for people with brain injuries are provided by local authorities from their general social work allocations in accordance with locally assessed needs and priorities, and are often provided in partnership with the health board and local voluntary sector organisations. These are set out in each authorities' Community Care Plan.</p>

  <p>Most local authorities provide services for the brain injured from their mental illness specific grant allocations, often in tandem with their health partners. Total local authority net budgeted expenditure on services for people with mental health problems, including acquired brain injury, was &#163;47 million last year, including funding from general Scottish Executive revenue grant and &#163;19 million through the Mental Illness Specific Grant (MISG). For 2002-03, MISG will support 22 projects offering services and support to those with brain injuries, many of which provide, or help facilitate access to, rehabilitation programmes.</p>

  <p>National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 11: <em>Sport, Physical Recreation and Open Space </em> provides guidance to planning authorities on the protection of playing fields. This confirms that playing fields should not be redeveloped except where:</p>

  <p>the retention or enhancement of the facilities can best be achieved by the redevelopment of part of the site without affecting its sporting potential and its amenity value; or</p>

  <p>there would be no loss of amenity, and alternative provision of equal community benefit and accessibility would be made available, and</p>

  <p>there is a clear long-term excess of pitches, playing fields and public open space in the wider area.</p>

  <p><strong></strong>Sportscotland take the guidance contained in NPPG 11 into account when considering development proposals.</p>

  <p>The parties to the agreement <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> estimated that an additional 3,000 teachers will be required in order to implement all of its key elements by the target date of August 2006. Funding allocated to cover the provision of extra teachers necessary to meet the agreement, whether through the training of new teachers or by the recruitment of those teachers already qualified still seeking employment, will be made available as and when demand arises. There are therefore no expected financial savings from the decision to revise teacher training places.</p>

  <p>The Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002 contains no provisions whose effect is to restrict relief on water and sewerage charges to charities.</p>

  <p>Section 40 of the act enables Scottish ministers to make regulations reducing the water and sewerage charges, or exempting from these charges, those specified in the regulations. Using this power, Scottish ministers made the Water and Sewerage (Exemption) (Scotland) Regulations 2002 (SSI1358) on 27 March 2002.</p>

  <p>The regulations, which came into effect on 1 April, set out conditions to be satisfied if premises are to be exempted from water and sewerage charges in the period to 31 March 2006. The main conditions are that premises were not paying the full charge for water and sewerage services on 31 March 1999 and that those responsible for paying the charge have an annual income of &#163;50,000. Sports clubs that satisfy these and the other conditions in the regulations will receive an exemption, regardless of whether or not they are registered charities.</p>
