  <p>There are several initiatives aimed specifically at reducing bureaucracy for Scottish farmers, including livestock farmers in particular. These are the Red Tape Review, the CAP Administration Review, the CAP External Communications Strategy and the Electronic Cattle Traceability System Project. Livestock farmers have already benefited from the following:</p>

  <p>- the introduction of electronic access to the central Cattle Traceability System (CTS). This is a key element of the proposed Electronic Cattle Traceability (ECT) system; it facilitates the electronic transfer of cattle information between the industry and the central database. The new system will reduce administrative burdens and the opportunity for errors.</p>

  <p>- the introduction of Electronic Service Delivery (ESD). We are building on last year&#8217;s successful SCPS pilot exercise to develop facilities which will allow each SCPS 2001 claimant the option of submitting their claim form electronically. Our intention is to introduce progressively arrangements for electronic claim submission under the remaining subsidy schemes.</p>

  <p>- for the new Less Favoured Areas Support Scheme (LFASS), the avoidance of duplication by using information already held in relation to the Suckler Cow Premium Scheme (SCPS) and the Sheep Annual Premium Scheme (SAPS). For most claimants, completion of the LFASS claim form only requires some ticks and a signature.</p>

  <p>- the introduction, under IACS 2001, of a &quot;no change declaration&quot; for forage-only applicants whose circumstances have not altered from the previous year. This will avoid repetition and save time.</p>

  <p>- the introduction of &quot;all bovine&quot; farm inspections from September 2000. These will reduce the number and duration of farm visits overall, saving time for the farmer and officials.</p>

  <p>- the introduction of an appeals mechanism covering, amongst other schemes, all the CAP livestock subsidy schemes. We intend extending this mechanism to cover livestock quotas.</p>

  <p>- the formation of an External Communications Panel which monitors and suggests improvements to scheme literature and forms. The panel&#8217;s work is being extended to assist in reviewing the department&#8217;s &quot;standard letters&quot;, published guidance and forms.</p>

  <p>In relation to the problems arising from foot-and-mouth disease, the department has made it clear in a &quot;Dear Producer&quot; letter that it will apply the force majeure provisions of the CAP subsidy schemes as flexibly as possible. Further information will be issued to producers shortly on foot-and-mouth disease matters.</p>

  <p>The site was selected with advice from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in order to minimise the risk of environmental pollution from the burial of culled animals. We are working closely with SEPA to undertake a risk assessment that will inform long-term management of the site. SEPA will monitor the site over the coming months as a quality check against baseline water parameters and will continue to provide pollution prevention advice on operations. The Executive has commissioned an environmental consultant to provide specialist engineering advice on excavation methods, site containment, drainage and related matters.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the Animal Health Act (1981), the Scottish Executive (SE) cleared the use of the site. Site suitability has been cleared by the SVS after advice from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). SEPA has assessed the suitability of the site and is satisfied that the risks of pollution can be minimised. SEPA is also closely involved with the SE in developing plans for monitoring and the on-going management of the site. Further advice has also been sought by SE from environmental consultants and this will be checked by SEPA so as to ensure that the risk of adverse environmental impacts will be minimised.</p>

  <p>Epidemiologists have undertaken a thorough review of all scientific literature on the possible dangers of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) spreading as a result of burning infected carcasses. This included the Northumberland Report on the 1967-68 outbreak which concluded there was insufficient evidence. The expert view is that FMD will <i>not</i> be spread by burning carcasses for three reasons: the concentration of virus in the smoke is relatively low, the virus falls out of the smoke within a fairly short distance from the fire, and the desiccating effect of the fire inactivates the virus (although this has not been proved conclusively). Additionally, carcasses are sprayed with disinfectant before they are cremated so there is no virus on the surface of the carcasses when the fire is lit.</p>

  <p>The Standing Veterinary Committee recently agreed Decision 2001/270/EC on third countries and BSE. All countries (including those not already assessed) will have to remove Specified Risk Material (SRM) before exporting meat products to the UK. The 10 countries exempt from this requirement are (recognised by the Scientific Steering Committee as being highly unlikely to present a BSE risk): Australia, Argentina, Botswana, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay and Swaziland.</p>

  <p>The Office International des Epicotes currently recognise foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) free status in Australia, Chile, New Zealand and Uruguay. Botswana and Namibia are FMD free in their export zones where vaccination is banned. Paraguay is FMD free using vaccination. Nicaragua have never reported FMD but are not in the current OIE list. Argentina&#8217;s status was recently suspended following a change in control policy. Swaziland&#8217;s status was recently suspended due to occurrence of disease.</p>

  <p>The farm scale evaluation programme is not designed to test the safety of the GM crop. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) and scientific advisors on other statutory bodies have advised ministers that this crop does not pose a safety threat to human health or the environment. Without this expert advice, these crops would not be granted consent to be grown.</p>

  <p>The three-year farm scale evaluation programme, which began in 2000, is one of the largest ecological research projects ever undertaken and will provide valuable information on any effects that the practices needed to grow GM herbicide-tolerant crops may have on local biodiversity. The Scientific Steering Committee that oversees the programme has suggested that data from between 60 and 75 fields of each trial crop are required over the duration of the programme across the UK. It is the committee&#8217;s view that this will provide sufficient data to enable significant conclusions to be drawn, taking account of the diversity of farm types and ecological conditions across the UK.</p>

This may provide a model of care for remote and rural areas, offering a local service choice for women. The <i>National Framework for Maternity Services</i> , published in February 2001, recommends that every community maternity unit have a clearly established link &#8211; support, advice and transfer &#8211; to a consultant-led maternity and neonatal unit.

  <p>Electronic Clinical Communications Implementation (ECCI) is a Scotland-wide programme to ensure the development of electronic clinical communications between primary and secondary care throughout NHSScotland. By 2003 it is expected that extensive implementation of clinical communications will be in place, including:</p>

  <p>widespread clinical e-mail</p>

  <p>co-ordinated referral information</p>

  <p>out-patient appointment booking - protocol-based where appropriate</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why only six medical oncologists in Scotland are funded by the NHS, given that cancer is one of the top three clinical priorities in the Scottish Health Plan.</p>

  <p>As indicated in the answer to Ms Scanlon&#8217;s question S1W-10403 there were 14 medical oncology consultants at September 2000. Of these, eight consultants held an honorary contract with the NHS and a substantive contract with a university or research organisation. For this, as for every other specialty, honorary consultants have a service delivery in addition to a teaching and research role, and there may well be NHS funding provided by local agreement. The position in medical oncology reflects the international standing of Scotland in research in this field, which makes a significant contribution to the quality of cancer services for the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition to the consultants, there are other doctors providing medical oncology services. 17 Specialist Registrars together with two non-consultant career grade doctors provide a high level of expertise, and Senior House Officers and Pre-Registration House Officers provide support.</p>

  <p>The clinical priority of cancer is also supported by clinical oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons specialising in cancer work and a whole range of other specialist staff. Six additional consultants and a proportion of the additional 100 junior doctors announced in June last year will provide cancer services. The further 375 junior doctors I announced on 1 April will be allocated according to service needs and I expect a proportion of those to support cancer services.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s recent provision of resources from its &#163;26 million Health Improvement Fund to all health boards is enabling them to work with their local partners to introduce a range of initiatives, including the provision of fruit for infants in pre-school settings and fruit and salad bars and breakfast clubs in schools. Initiatives are supported according to local needs, and projects vary in their format, length and costs from area to area. Each of these initiatives is designed specifically to stimulate children&#8217;s interest in, and enjoyment of, fruit and vegetables.</p>

  <p>Funding for the Health Improvement Fund has been committed until 2003-04, and health boards have been asked to give a full public account of how these resources are being invested, and what they have helped local people to achieve, through their annual reports and the accountability review process.</p>

  <p>The Executive has considered the initial findings of the study of the costs of answering Scottish parliamentary questions (PQ). The preliminary results suggested that the average cost of answering a PQ was &#163;82, which is broadly in line with the experience in Westminster. However, there were a number of outlying results from the study that it has not been possible to clarify. For that reason, the Executive is reluctant to draw any firm conclusions from the study and has therefore decided to extend the study into a second phase now that processes for handling PQs have settled down. This will be taken forward over the next few months.</p>
