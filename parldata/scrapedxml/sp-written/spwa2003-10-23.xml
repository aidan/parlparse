  <p>The partnership agreement makes an important commitment that &quot;We will legislate to introduce strategic environmental assessment to ensure that the full environmental impacts of all new strategies, programmes and plans developed by the public sector are properly considered&quot;.</p>

  <p>To meet this commitment we are adopting a two stage process. Firstly, we will bring forward regulations to ensure that we implement European Directive 2001-42-EC, which requires environmental assessment to be carried out on certain plans and programmes, by the due date of 21 July 2004. We will consult on the draft regulations towards the end of this year.</p>

  <p>The partnership agreement, however, makes clear our intention to extend the scope of the SEA process to apply it to a wider range of strategies, plans and programmes than the directive requires. To implement this we intend to introduce a comprehensive bill on SEA in early course. Once this bill is enacted, the regulations introduced as the first stage in the process will be revoked.</p>

  <p>It is clear that SEA will have implications throughout the public sector, and will likely be of interest to environmental organisations and the general public. We will therefore conduct a first consultation on the broad policy of the bill at the same time as we consult on the regulations. There would then be further consultation on detailed proposals for the bill before it is introduced.</p>

  <p>The full text of the directive can be found at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/eia/full-legal-text/0142_en.pdf.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it measures the impact on the forestry and forest products sectors of the economy of all proposed measures that will potentially add costs to those sectors, including additional measures regarding certification, the designation of forest areas as sites of special scientific interest and measures in other areas that may restrict economic activity, and what consultation there is with bodies representing such sectors about such measures in advance of their implementation.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-10-23.10.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa1023.htm#4">

  <p>We take seriously the need to take account of the interests of all stakeholders who have an involvement in forestry and forest products whether they are economic, environmental or social when we develop and implement legislation and other policy instruments. In some instances there is a need to strike balances and make choices, for example in the case of nature conservation where there may be UK and European considerations. In the case of independent certification this is not just a matter for the Scottish Executive. The UK Woodland Assurance Scheme has been developed by a much wider grouping of forestry stakeholders and is independent of government. Within this broad group, economic interests have their opportunity to contribute to the process and make the case for economic viability based on sustainable principles.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive wishes to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. In the National Waste Plan we have set targets to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste disposed of to landfill by 25% (of 1995 amounts) by 2010, 50% by 2013 and 65% by 2020. In addition, we have set a national target of 25% recycling and composting of municipal waste by 2006.</p>

  <p>It is clear, however, that there will still be a need for landfill facilities to dispose of residual amounts of waste. New landfill developments will need to comply not only with planning requirements, but also with those of the Landfill (Scotland) Regulations 2003 (as amended).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s planning policy on landfill sites and other developments involving the management of waste is set out in National Planning Policy Guideline 10: <em>Planning and Waste Management</em>. Further advice is contained in Planning Advice Note: PAN 63 &#8211; <em>Waste Management Planning</em>. These documents may be found at:</p>
