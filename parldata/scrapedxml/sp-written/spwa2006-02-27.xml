  <p>The List of Those Disqualified from Working With Children was established by the Protection of Children (Scotland) Act 2003. In accordance with the provisions of that act an individual can be placed on the list either when the courts have deemed this should be the case at the time of a conviction or when an organisation has referred them for consideration. The tests applied to referrals by organisations are that the person was working in a child care position, the referral is not frivolous or vexatious, the person harmed a child or put them at risk of harm and has been dismissed, moved away from working with children or left before that action could be taken. If these criteria are met, a Determination Panel considers the information provided by both the referring organisation and the individual as to whether they are unsuitable to work with children. The full determination process is set out in the Protection of Children (Scotland) Act 2003 Determination Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 523).</p>

  <p>As part of the work to be done in taking forward our proposals for a new vetting and barring scheme outlined in the consultation paper <em>Protecting Vulnerable Groups: Scottish Vetting and Barring Scheme</em> published on 8 February 2006, we will be considering the criteria for barring under the new scheme and will make clear the process and criteria upon which decisions will be made.</p>

  <p>Through the child protection reform programme, we have undertaken a pilot awareness raising media campaign in the north east of Scotland and are considering the evaluation from this. We have also issued almost 240,000 leaflets, &quot;Protecting Children and Young People: What you can do to help if you are worried about a child or young person&quot; for distribution across Scotland through Child Protection Committees (CPCs). In strengthening the role of Child Protection Committees through guidance issued in February 2005, we have made clear that a key function is the provision and dissemination of public information about protecting children and young people through developing, implementing and regularly reviewing a communications strategy. Protecting Children and Young People: Framework for Standardsalso requires agencies to work in partnership with members of the community to protect children.</p>

  <p>Before commencing the Protection of Children (Scotland) Act 2003, we issued some 6,500 leaflets to approximately 360 organisations across the country reminding them of the need to safeguard children and the duty they have under the act if someone harms, or risks harm, to a child and is dismissed, moved away from working with children or leave before this can happen. This was supplemented for the voluntary sector by the production of additional guidance, a training pack and the running of a series of workshops.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Scottish Borders Housing Association (SBHA)&rsquo;s performance in investing in its stock is being monitored on ministers&rsquo; behalf by Communities Scotland within a regulatory framework that puts tenants&rsquo; interests at its heart. This includes: frequent liaison meetings; inspection; monitoring of SBHA&rsquo;s business plan, and assessment of its capacity to meet the Scottish Housing Quality Standard.</p>

  <p>SBHA is due to be inspected by the regulation and inspection division of Communities Scotland this year with the on-site period scheduled for mid-summer. Its performance against business plan assumptions, the physical quality of housing and areas, progress in delivering planned maintenance and area renewal and arrangements for meeting the Scottish Housing Quality Standard will be examined as part of this inspection.</p>

  <p>Contact of whatever degree of formality or informality with the UK Government, its departments and agencies takes place in accordance with the overall scheme for ensuring that devolved Scottish interests are taken into account, which allows scope for the development of appropriate approaches for particular issues or organisations, including particular &quot;quangos&quot;.

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s approach to implementation was set out in the draft Scottish Regulations implementation of the Public Sector Procurement Directive 2004/18/EC and Utilities Directive 2004/17/EC. Essentially, our regulations are close to the Office of Government Commerce&rsquo;s (OGC) because we are both subject to the same overarching EU law framework. Also, suppliers operating in Scotland and the rest of the UK might find it difficult to interpret regulations which were substantially different in style and/or substance. Scottish Regulations therefore differ from OGC only where we believe this to be necessary in a Scottish context, for example in respect of the tier of the court in which remedies may be sought.</p>

  <p>These articles refer to information which prospective bidders may be requested to provide in the context of a procurement process. Making it a mandatory legal requirement that the information must be sought and provided by tenderers on every occasion might result in unnecessary burdens on suppliers and purchasers alike. The Scottish Regulations which give effect to the directives, therefore, allow individual public authorities and utility entities the scope to decide whether the information should be sought.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, given the deadlines for transposing the new EU Public Sector and Utilities Procurement Directives, whether it will publish its own separate and distinct social issues guidance in respect of the directives or whether it will copy the guidance currently being prepared by the Office of Government Commerce.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that the Executive intends to publish guidance on social issues in respect of the directives. Given that both Scotland and the rest of the UK operate under the same overarching framework of EU procurement law, the terms of the Executive&rsquo;s guidelines will inevitably be similar to the Office of Government Commerce&rsquo;s. However, in preparing Scottish guidance we would expect to draw on any unique Scottish examples and experience. For example, the Executive has been working on a pilot programme to examine the use of community benefit clauses in public contracts. In preparing its guidance for Scotland the Executive intends to consult relevant stakeholders, including the STUC.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the proposed review of the Sport 21 programme can be regarded as independent if <strong></strong> sportscotland and the Scottish Sports Association are appointed to the group which conducts the review.</p>

  <p>The review of Sport 21 has been established to produce recommendations on how the key partners in Scottish sport might better support the delivery of the Sport 21 aims and objectives. I believe it would be inappropriate for the review to exclude any of the key delivery partners such as <strong></strong> sportscotland and the Scottish Sports Association.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking as a result of a letter, dated 5 December 2005, to it from Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) in respect of the Electricity Act 1989 and an application for the development of the Muaitheabhal Windfarm in the Western Isles, in which SNH states that the methodology employed in the collusion risk assessment of the impact of the development on golden eagles and white-tailed eagles was flawed; whether the Executive considers that the methodology in other assessments may also have been flawed; whether it has asked SNH for any further information in respect of the methodology, and how much the assessment cost.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-02-27.18.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0227.htm#12">

  <p>The letter from SNH referred to by Fergus Ewing, was a revision of the advice in its earlier response to this application and arose from the error identified in the original collision risk assessment, which was undertaken as part of the Environmental Assessment prepared on behalf of the applicant. This was, I understand, not an error in the methodology, but in the way in which it was applied. The error has been acknowledged by the applicant. It has no particular bearing on other proposals.</p>

  <p>The revised advice from SNH will inform the eventual determination of this application by the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>The Executive conducts a statutory consultation exercise for all Electricity Act consent applications, which seeks the views of SNH, as advisers to the Executive on these matters, to help assess the likely impacts of individual developments on wildlife species and their habitats. As this incident demonstrates, this is a robust procedure.</p>

  <p>The cost of the collision risk assessment, undertaken on behalf of the developer, is not known to the Executive.</p>

  <p>A consultation paper will be published in the spring. A national strategy for youth work will be developed following the consultation.</p>
