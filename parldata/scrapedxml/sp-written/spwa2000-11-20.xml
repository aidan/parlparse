  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will seek the release by the study&#8217;s authors of the data on which the epidemiological study of a possible association between measles, mumps and rubella vaccination and autism, commissioned by the Medicines Control Agency and published in <i>The</i> <i>Lancet</i> in June 1999, is based.</p>

  <p>The epidemiological study published in <i>The Lancet</i> in June 1999 was an independent study commissioned by the Medicines Control Agency to investigate a possible association between measles, mumps and rubella vaccination and autism. The study found no evidence of a causal association.</p>

  <p>Although the study was funded by the Medicines Control Agency, the raw data are the property of the authors and are not held either by the agency or by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The study was accepted for publication in <i>The Lancet </i>only following a process of rigorous independent peer-review and it is not usual practice for peer-reviewed data to be subject to re-analysis by third parties. The Scottish Executive does not, therefore, propose to ask the independent investigators to release their data.</p>

  <p>The Learning Disability Review acknowledged the disparity across Scotland in assessing and diagnosing, and providing services to those with, autism.</p>

  <p>The review report, published in May, provides a new lead. It recommends that the Scottish Society for Autism and the National Autistic Society co-ordinate the establishment of a national service network to improve awareness and understanding of the needs of people within the autistic spectrum disorder. The network will provide access to specialist knowledge and training in both health and other fields. The network will be supported by the new Scottish Centre for Learning Disabilities which is also being set up under the review. Work is progressing on these developments.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are funding from the Mental Health and Well Being Development Fund, an innovative Multi-Agency Service for Children with Autism in the Borders which could serve as a model for services throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Pacific Quay is one of the key infrastructure developments associated with the Creative Industries Cluster Strategy. &pound;2.6 million has been identified in the operating plan for 2000-01 for infrastructure development on the part of the site owned by Scottish Enterprise. This is subject to Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s annual budget approval process. It is planned that Scottish Enterprise will expend on infrastructure such as site clearance, telecoms, and access and egress solutions over the next three to five years.</p>

  <p>It is envisaged that development of office and incubator facilities on the site will be undertaken in partnership with private companies with an interest in the digital media industries. Discussions are ongoing with a number of interested parties. Work is also being done in conjunction with Locate in Scotland to identify and target relevant potential inward investors to the site.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise, in conjunction with its partners in the Creative Industries Cluster, has agreed that the vision for Pacific Quay is one that brings together broadcasters, facilities/post-production companies, interactive software/media companies, independent producers, internet/web designers etc.</p>

  <p>The cluster as a whole includes links with academic institutions, in relation to training and skills development and the commercialisation of research projects through the Proof of Concept Fund.</p>

  <p>Discussions regarding the film industry&#8217;s potential involvement with Pacific Quay are ongoing.</p>

  <p>Digital hearing aids are not suitable for all types of hearing loss. It is for the clinician in charge of a patient&#8217;s care to decide which hearing aid best meets their clinical needs and it would not be appropriate for the Executive to intervene.</p>

  <p>I understand from Fife Health Board that the board, Fife Acute Hospitals NHS Trust and the Scottish Section of the Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research are evaluating current procedures for selecting hearing aids and the effectiveness of a sample of digital aids. This project is due to be completed by February 2001.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive allocated &pound;5 million in each of the years 2000-01 and 2001-02 for the establishment of the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency (SDEA). This provided start-up costs for the agency, funding for 100 additional officers for forces to tackle drug misuse at local level and provision for up to 100 additional officers for the agency. On 27 September, the Deputy First Minister announced in Parliament that an established and increasing baseline had been put in place for the SDEA. Funding of &pound;6.5 million in 2002-03 and &pound;6.7 million in 2003-04 has been secured.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-9968 by Mr Jack McConnell of 19 September 2000, of the five responses concerning better provision for pensioners, how many of those advocated implementation of the Sutherland recommendations with regard to personal care &quot;in full&quot; and, with regard to the issues raised at away days regarding &quot;properly funding care in the community&quot;, what the majority view was on the funding of personal care and which organisations&#8217; representatives supported this view.</p>

  <p>Five of the 172 written responses received to the Executive&#8217;s consultation document <i>Investing in You</i> concerned better provision for pensioners. Of these, one suggested the full implementation of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly recommendations. The other responses raised a range of issues including increased financial support to local authorities to enable them to provide better support for care for the elderly and care in the community, and provision of free long-term care for the elderly.</p>

  <p>The views expressed at the away days suggested that increased funding to provide better support to look after older people in their own homes and support for carers should be a key priority. These views were supported by representatives from the Prince&#8217;s Trust, Elderly Forum and Community Care Forum.</p>

  <p>The Executive is considering the responses to the consultation on the Scottish Climate Change Programme (SCCP), which ended on 2 June. I plan to publish the final SCCP in the near future. This will detail the action we will take in Scotland as a contribution to the UK Climate Change Programme, which is designed to meet the UK obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, by 12.5% by 2008-12.</p>

  <p>The Executive, in conjunction with the UK Government, has a contract with the National Environmental Technology Centre to produce a disaggregated UK greenhouse gas inventory. This allowed us to report in the SCCP consultation, the 1990 and 1995 emission figures for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We will produce an annual disaggregated inventory with effect from 1998. The 1998 figures will be announced soon.</p>

  <p>The capacity of the ships proposed would allow 100 trucks and 120 private cars to be carried each way per day. Although the issue of access has been considered as part of the development of this project, detailed route planning for cars and trucks to and from the port has not been finalised. However, it is envisaged that the ferry would operate outside peak traffic flow times.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-7968 by Mr John Home Robertson on 3 July 2000, when assistance will become available for the fish processing industry under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance; what plans it has for additional measures to assist the fish processing sector; whether these include any specific plans for assistance in response to the current level of white fish landings, and when any such additional assistance will be available.</p>

  <p>As announced recently we are making an additional &pound;11 million in FIFG funding available for fisheries over the next three financial years. Aid for developments in the processing sector designed to help secure its long-term future will be one of the key funding priorities. Decisions on which projects to support will take account of all relevant industry factors, including the prospects for fish supplies.</p>

  <p>Arrangements for implementing the FIFG programme for the Highlands and Islands, which has been approved by the European Commission, are well under way and the aim remains to open schemes of assistance up to the industry before the end of the year. The plan for the rest of Scotland has yet to be approved by the Commission, but we expect that will follow soon.</p>

  <p>The Executive, through its membership of the Ministerial Fuel Task Force and the Civil Contingencies Committee, has been involved in discussions about how the military might assist the response to any future protests. While there are no plans for the army to support the police, there are contingency plans in place for the military to assist oil companies with the delivery of fuel should this be required and this has been widely reported in the press.</p>

  <p>Reports of suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) to medicines marked in the UK are received by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA). A report may describe more than one ADR in an individual.</p>

  <p>As at 29 August, the MCA had received 7,742 reports of 16,527 suspected adverse drug reactions to the meningitis C vaccines authorised in the UK. Each report relates to one patient who may have more than one suspected reaction.

  <p>1. &quot;Episodes&quot; refers to the admission of a patient. Since the same patient may be admitted to hospital more than once during the course of one year, the number of individuals admitted may not be the same.</p>

  <p>2. The tables are not mutually exclusive, as a patient may be admitted to an acute general hospital then, in a subsequent episode, may be admitted to a psychiatric unit. Such patients will appear as episodes in both tables.</p>

  <p>A start will be made in 2001-02 in applying a resource allocation formula to general medical services. In that year, &pound;470,000 of additional money for general medical services will be distributed through the allocation formula recommended in the Final Report of the Arbuthnott Review. Implementation of the new formula will continue in subsequent years.</p>

  <p>The formula developed for general medical services takes into account the influence of deprivation and remoteness on the relative need for healthcare resources. By targeting resources on the areas of greatest need, the new formula will help to ensure that major inequalities in health can be tackled. More generally, the substantial increase in resources that we have announced for the NHS in 2001-02 will enable all health boards in Scotland to address the issue of health inequalities.</p>

  <p>The Arbuthnott Steering Group carried out an extensive review of the data, the methods of analysis and the results in response to the issues raised during consultation on the first report on <i>Fair Shares for All</i> . In particular, the method of taking into account relative deprivation was revised to improve its robustness and transparency, and this led to some changes in the assessment of the influence of deprivation on each health board&#8217;s relative need for resources. In addition, the method of assessing the influence of remoteness has also been strengthened. Other changes include updating the analysis to take account of data for 1997-98 which was not available when the earlier work was carried out.</p>

  <p>Although Shetland&#8217;s share of resources for hospital and community health services and GP prescribing will be reduced under the new formula, they will continue to receive a level of funding per head of population during the lifetime of this Parliament that is well above the national average. They will also continue to receive substantial increases in their level of funding which will enable them to develop and improve services for their population. In 2001-02 their funding for hospital and community health services and GP prescribing will go up by 5.5%.</p>

  <p>There is no definition of a public holiday in Scotland, although the phrase is sometimes used as a generic term to refer to both bank and local holidays. The dates of both bank and local holidays across Scotland can be obtained from the publication <i>Scottish</i> <i>Public</i> <i>Holidays</i> <i>2000</i> , a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 9399).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive commissioned consultants, Colin Buchanan and Partners, to carry out a research study into the likely costs of various options for enhancing concessionary fares arrangements. Their report will be made available shortly to the Transport and Environment Committee. The Executive will shortly enter into discussion with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and bus operators to clarify the actual costs associated with the introduction of the enhanced arrangements I announced on 28 September in question S1W-10099. It is envisaged that any additional resources required will be distributed through the GAE mechanism.</p>

  <p>The <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> , which we adopted in 1999, outlines the ways in which we intend to change the way waste is dealt with in Scotland. A basic principle of the strategy is that local solutions will be developed to deal with the problem of local waste. Eleven groups called Waste Strategy Areas have been set up to investigate the best practicable environmental option for dealing with waste in each area. Each group includes local authorities, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, waste industry representatives, local enterprise companies and other interested parties. The findings of these groups will be presented in Area Waste Plans.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to a more sustainable future for waste management in Scotland and, as Sarah Boyack explained in answer to question S1W-10588, has made available considerable resources for the implementation of Area Waste Plans by local authorities, including a Strategic Waste Fund of &pound;3 million this year and &pound;50.4 million over the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04. I expect that recycling will play a major role in the solutions identified in these plans.</p>

  <p>Sarah Boyack also announced in question S1W-10588 that we are contributing &pound;2.1 million to the Waste Resource Action Programme (WRAP) over three years. WRAP will have a business focus and will concentrate initially on market facilitation, promoting investment in recycling, research and information management and the provision of guidance, advice and technical support. In addition, the Executive will continue to fund the Recycled Markets Development (ReMaDe) Scotland programme which takes a hands-on, local approach to identifying and developing markets for recycled materials.</p>

  <p>By tackling the barriers to recycling through WRAP and ReMaDe we aim to lay a sound foundation upon which we can improve Scotland&#8217;s poor recycling record.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities and the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority to decide how much to allocate to particular services from their Rural Transport Fund Grant. The latest information received from authorities on the number of new and improved rural services (including services continued from 1998-99) which were supported in 1999-2000 in each local authority area is set out in the table below. It is entirely a matter for the authorities concerned to monitor each of the services which have been introduced since 1998-99 and make any changes they consider necessary.</p>

  <p>Research has been commissioned to evaluate the Rural Transport Fund and this is due to report shortly.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised me that algal blooms are natural, cyclic phenomena, and are believed to be influenced by a number of factors including environment, light, temperature, chemical nutrients and the abundance of herbivorous animals and fish grazing on the algae. Research into this issue is currently taking place and the Food Standards Agency has announced that nearly &pound;1 million will be spent on algal toxins, including their causes, over the next three years. Given the nature of the phytoplankton community, the possibility of developing deterrent measures seems unlikely at present. However, it is anticipated that this research may assist in helping predict the likely severity and duration of amnesic shellfish poisoning incidents.</p>

  <p>The early warning sign for an outbreak of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) is the presence of an algal phytoplankton organism called <i>Pseudo-nitzschia.</i> Scallops filter sea water and consume the planktonic organism which in turn causes a build-up of toxin in the shellfish.

  <p>The size of the boxes used to monitor offshore scallop grounds have to be large enough to ensure public safety and were set using hydrographic information. The boxes were accepted by the EU.</p>

  <p>The EC Directive (91/492/EEC) requires periodic monitoring of live bivalve molluscs. The Food Standards Agency Scotland (FSAS) ensure that Scottish boxes are monitored throughout the year. When algal toxin levels are above the statutory level the frequency of sampling is increased.</p>

  <p>10-12 scallops are taken as one sample, two of these samples, from separate tows, are taken from each box.</p>

  <p>Following closure of a box by a Food and Environment Protection Act Order, FSAS aims to resample every fortnight until the algal toxin level drops to close to the statutory limit. Thereafter, weekly sampling is requested.</p>

  <p>A commercial dredger that fishes on known scallop grounds within each box undertakes sampling.</p>

  <p>Global Positioning Satellite co-ordinates are not used when sampling boxes off-shore, although the boat involved with the sampling can provide the FRS Marine Laboratory with their position if necessary.</p>

  <p>Samples are collected from known scallop grounds. There may be some variation in sampling points, from trip to trip, within the same relative vicinity.</p>

  <p>Generally two samples are collected from within each box. If land bisects the box additional samples may be collected.</p>

  <p>Boxes remain closed until two algal toxin results, below that of the statutory limit, are obtained with at least one week between each result. However there are some cases where boxes remain closed although the toxin level has dropped below the statutory limit, since other algal toxins may have increased in the area thus affecting the same shellfish species.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised me that it is not known why some species appear to accumulate toxins more readily than others do. Toxins from the phytoplankton on which the molluscs feed accumulate in the animals. Once the intake of toxin producers ceases, the molluscs metabolise the toxins and eliminate them from their tissues. Scallops appear to have a much slower rate of elimination than other mussels and queens, meaning the toxins are retained for longer periods.</p>

  <p>High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is used to analyse shellfish samples for domoic acid, the chemical causing amnesic shellfish poison (ASP). The toxin is extracted from prepared samples using aqueous methanol, then partially purified and fully isolated from the purified extract by pumping through an absorbent column within the HPLC machine. Chromatographic techniques separate domoic acid from compounds such as lipids, fatty acids, amino acids etc present in the extract. Finally, the toxin is quantified and identified by ultraviolet spectrometric detection, by comparison with standard reference domoic acid. The procedure meets EU requirements and is United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) accredited. The standard deviation of domoic acid analyses undertaken in a recent inter-laboratory comparison exercise covering the UK and Ireland was &lt;12.5%. FRS Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen currently test approximately 100-150 shellfish samples per week for ASP.</p>

  <p>Samples collected as part of the routine monitoring programme are sent to the FRS Marine Laboratory Aberdeen (FRS MLA) by first class post in containers provided for the purpose. Samples arrive within two days of posting. Samples are collected by chartered fishing vessels over fairly large areas. Samples may be caught and kept aboard the boat for 2-3 days before being landed. Once landed, they are immediately collected by FRS MLA staff and transported to Aberdeen. Testing is generally initiated on the day MLA receive the sample.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised me that toxins accumulate to differing levels in the different edible parts of the scallop. Proportionate toxin levels in the gonad are likely to be considerably greater than in the white meat. Testing an amalgam of white meat and gonad mashed together will therefore lead to a lower result than the current gonad only test. As it is possible to consume only the gonad, it is the result of the gonad test which must be used to ensure the protection of public health.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) inform fisheries organisations and other interested parties when a Food and Environment Protection Act (FEPA) Order is being drafted by the Scottish Executive, following results above the statutory limit for algal toxins. This provides advanced warning of impending closures ahead of the Orders coming into force. Industry officials then communicate this information to fishermen at sea. The FSA has expanded the list of organisations and individuals to whom this information is communicated directly, but industry has also been asked to make suggestions on how communication links might be improved. Updates are also available via the agency&#8217;s telephone hotline and website.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency aim to place a Food and Environment Protection Act (FEPA) Order as quickly as possible to ensure public safety. To help minimise delay, a draft Order is prepared by the Scottish Executive Solicitor&#8217;s Office Legal Service while ministerial clearance for the Order is sought. Communications between parties involved in the making of FEPA Orders has been improved through more efficient use of email and fax, though ways of making further improvements continue to be investigated. Some improvements have also been possible with regard to the statutory process, which help avoid the potential problems of FEPA Orders expiring during parliamentary recess.</p>

Food and Environment Protection Act Orders (closures and revocations) are completed as quickly as possible. Meetings with officials and visits to the Fisheries Research Services Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen, have been arranged for industry representatives, and a comparative test between products from a commercial processor and the Marine Laboratory has been carried out to allow consideration of claims from industry that toxicity may be reduced by processing.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised me that amnesic shellfish poisoning is caused by phytoplanktonic algae creating blooms which are fed upon by bivalve molluscs such as scallops. The growth of these causative organisms is cyclic, therefore the poisoning also tends to be cyclical. However, given the relatively short period over which monitoring for ASP has been carried out, there is insufficient evidence from which to derive specific seasonal trends in the occurrence of amnesic shellfish poisoning.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised me that the possible introduction of a tiered system of scallop testing and processing is likely to require a very robust enforcement regime in order to continue to ensure public safety. Enforcement controls, whilst being flexible enough to take account of local circumstances, will continue to be comparable across the UK. Advice is being taken on the suitability of existing statutory provisions for any tiered system. Should a new Scottish Statutory Instrument be necessary, the Food Standards Agency will ensure that there will be full and timely consultation.</p>

  <p>Applications to the UK Government to be exempted from the provisions of the Competition Act 1998 may be made by any public authorities for which the Scottish Executive is responsible. No such application has been made in the case of the water authorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not believe that an exemption for the water authorities is necessary, as, within the right framework of legislation, competition will work to the benefit of the authorities&#8217; customers by delivering innovation, greater efficiency and improved services. Its policy therefore is to ensure that the authorities are able to compete effectively, while providing through the planned Water Services Bill a framework that safeguards public health, the environment and social objectives.</p>

  <p>The grading of the Scottish Executive secondees working in the Scottish Parliament are set out below. The ranking is from most senior (C2) to most junior (A3). The list does not include the Directors. The terms and conditions of service of the Directors (with the exception of the Director of the Holyrood Project) have not yet been agreed and the individuals are, therefore, still subject to the transitional arrangements for the provision of staff from the former Scottish Office. This situation will be resolved in the context of the current grading, structure, efficiency and pay review for all Corporate Body staff.</p>
