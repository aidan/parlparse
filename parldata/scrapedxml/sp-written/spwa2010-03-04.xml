  <p>The level of kinship care payments are the responsibility of local authorities. The Scottish Government recognises progress so far on delivering kinship care payments as making a major and satisfactory contribution to the concordat commitment. The Scottish Government is committed to working with local authorities to ensure that kinship carers receive the support they need.</p>

  <p>A commitment to treat kinship carers of looked after children on an equivalent basis to foster carers is set out in the concordat between the Scottish Government and Local Government. Regulation 33 of the Looked After Children (Scotland) Regulations 2009 creates the framework for local authorities to pay foster care and kinship care allowances. Local authorities are best placed to decide how to achieve the commitment in the context of local needs and priorities and taking account of the carer&rsquo;s overall financial circumstances, which can be affected by the payment of a kinship care allowance.</p>

  <p>Guidance to local authorities on the regulations will be published during 2010 to replace earlier interim guidance. Neither of these have the aim of setting the level of allowances for either foster care or kinship care.</p>

  <p>Discussions between the Scottish Government and the UK Government resulted in recognition of the issue facing Kinship Carers in the recently published <em>Support for All: the Families and Relationships Green Paper</em> (Cm 7787), presented to House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families on 20 January 2010. This includes a proposal to &quot;explore with stakeholders the difficulties experienced by family and friends carers and how to help them to access the support they need&quot; (paragraph 6.6).</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers welcome this and intend to make use of this opportunity to ensure that kinship carers receive the support they need.</p>

  <p>The end of the reciprocal health agreements with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, which were entered into many years before devolution, is primarily a matter for the UK Government.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government officials have, however, had discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Health about the decisions to end the agreements and what this means for Scotland.</p>

  <p>In April 2009 I was approached by Edward Teare, the Minister for Health and Social Security in the Manx Government, about the possibility of entering into a health agreement with the Isle of Man. At that time I said that I would be interested to learn more of this proposal, with the understanding that any treatment would be on the basis of need for which arose during a visit to the Isle of Man or Scotland, and that no exchange of public funds could take place. The Manx Government has not been in touch since then.</p>

  <p>I have considered the implications for Scotland and, given the limited impact, have concluded that there is no compelling reason to make representations to the UK Government about the continuation of the reciprocal health arrangements.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether reciprocal health arrangements are in place between home and host countries, people should always make appropriate medical insurance arrangements before they travel overseas.</p>

  <p>Under Scottish homelessness legislation, a person who is vulnerable as a result of having been discharged from any part of the regular armed forces should be treated as in priority need. The 2012 target will mean that all those considered unintentionally homeless, not just those also in priority need, will have the right to settled accommodation. The current housing bill contains an amendment to the homelessness legislation which will enable ex service personnel to form a local connection through employment or residence in the area. Existing legislation prevents this happening.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has undertaken a range of activities to support the development of capacity of social care providers.</p>

  <p>An example in the third sector is the investment of &pound;4 million over 2009-11 to charities from local, regional and national play organisations, through the Go Play programme, which is being managed and administered by Inspiring Scotland. The aims of the programme are to help the play sector in Scotland grow and offer increased opportunities for play to children aged five to 13 years as well as tackling health inequalities through play, outdoor play and physical activity. Inspiring Scotland will bring in additional resources to build the capacity of the play sector through pro bono support from the private sector. It will also work with organisations to build their funding in the longer term from a variety of sources including local authorities, trusts and foundations and engagement with the broader philanthropic world.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also awards grants annually to a range of voluntary organisations that contribute to the delivery of our priorities for community care. Over &pound;3 million has been awarded for 2010-11 and many of the grants awarded will contribute to the capacity of the voluntary social care providers concerned. A further &pound;2 million has been awarded for 2010-11 to the voluntary sector for training.</p>

  <p>Social care provision is often delivered jointly across health and local authorities involving a range of service providers. Working with stakeholders, the Community Care Outcomes Framework was developed in answer to calls from local partnerships who wanted an outcome-focussed approach to monitoring and improving joint performance in community care. By focussing on six complementary themes, the framework emphasises improving whole system performance across the broad spectrum of community care services. Midlothian Community Care Partnership has been funded to develop an independent Scottish Community Care Benchmarking Network, using the Framework to scrutinise and compare local performance. All Community Care Partnerships are choosing to use some or all of the Community Care Outcomes Framework so that they can understand their own performance better, and compare it with relevant benchmarking partners in order to identify opportunities for improvement.</p>

  <p>To help improve the capacity to meet the needs and expectations of the Scottish public, and also contribute to improved health and social care outcomes for people using services, an Integrated Resource Framework (IRF) is being developed by the Scottish Government, NHSScotland and COSLA. This seeks to shift the balance of care and improve outcomes for people by working in a more integrated way within the NHS and across health and social care. Through identifying what resources are currently being spent and where, and whether or not this could be improved, local partners will be better placed to arrange the optimum configuration of future health and adult social care.</p>

  <p>A joint capacity building programme is being developed by the Scottish Government and the Improvement Service to assist and support Community Planning Partnerships in delivering the local outcomes in SOAs, with a particular focus on achieving a shift towards early intervention and prevention in the delivery of public services. This programme will build on existing approaches, tools and techniques.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also supports building capacity of providers in more indirect ways. For example, in June 2008 the National Care Standards Awareness Raising Campaign was launched. The campaign focuses on making older people aware of the Standards and how they are used. It fulfilled the commitment in the <em>All Our Futures: Planning for a Scotland with an Ageing Population</em>. The campaign included TV and radio ads and a touring theatre production explaining the importance of the Standards which visited care homes and day centres. The final phase is running now and is aimed at people who receive care in their own homes and the care services that provide their care. Although not directly targeted at social care providers&rsquo; capacity, it should contribute indirectly to them improving the quality of service they provide.</p>

  <p>Similarly the establishment of the Multi-Agency Resource Service, the Scottish Child Care and Protection Network and the National Coordinator for Child Protection Committees increase the resources, skills and experience available to service providers and practitioners as do the wide range of activities to develop a confident, competent and valued workforce.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s continuing focus on outcomes through the concordat, single outcome agreements and national policies, contribute to the culture change required to realise the ambitions of the Changing Lives report. Working with key stakeholders and partners, we continue to develop and embed tools and approaches which support a confident, competent and valued workforce and the personalisation of services to improve outcomes for individuals, families and communities. This includes supporting the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) work with employers to embed the Continuous Learning Framework which focuses on four key areas including the organisational capabilities which describe the culture and conditions in the workplace that enable social service workers to be the best they can be; a self-evaluation guide from the Social Work Inspection Agency focussing on the achievement of outcomes for people who use services, carers and the wider community; driving forward the leadership agenda through collaboration with the SSSC and four Social Services Learning Networks; supporting the Association of Directors of Social Work to take forward the key aspirations of the Changing Lives report, especially in relation to what is needed to deliver personalised support and services and also supporting work they are doing with Local Practitioners Fora.</p>

  <p>In response to concerns about the sustainability and fairness of current and future care for older people in the face of financial and demographic pressures, a major work programme &ndash; Reshaping Care for Older People &ndash; is being taken forward in partnership with NHSScotland and COSLA through the Ministerial Strategic Group on Health and Community Care.</p>

  <p>The programme aspires to develop practical ideas for change that are sufficiently radical to meet the changing needs of Scotland&rsquo;s population by enabling people to stay at home or in a homely setting, with maximum independence, for as long as possible. A key aim is to ensure that service providers can respond effectively to future demand for services, and this work will have far-reaching and important implications for the workforce as a whole and for those who design, deliver and manage these services. An Integrated Resource Framework is also being developed and tested across four sites in Scotland, from which evidence is being gathered about how resources can be used most effectively across health and social care.</p>

  <p>So far the programme has focussed on discussion with colleagues with a professional and clinical interest in delivering services for older people. As part of a wider engagement process and to further analyse and develop these proposals, the programme will from March 2010 until the summer seek views from the public and from a wider range of stakeholders including patients, service users and service providers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) has been invited by Glasgow City Council, North, South and East Ayrshire Councils, West Lothian Council, Edinburgh and Midlothian Council and North Lanarkshire Council to support the development and delivery of their residual waste treatment projects.</p>

  <p>For Glasgow, the North, East and South Ayrshire collaborative project and the Edinburgh and Midlothian collaborative project, SFT has been invited to sit on the project board and to work alongside the Council&rsquo;s project teams. Together these projects deal with more than a quarter of Scotland&rsquo;s residual waste.</p>

  <p>For West Lothian Council, SFT has been invited to undertake independent peer reviews at key milestones during procurement as well as being a centre of expertise resource for the project team.</p>

  <p>For North Lanarkshire Council, discussions are at an early stage to determine how best the SFT can support the Council&rsquo;s project team.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above, SFT is also undertaking a number of actions in partnership with COSLA, SOLACE and the Scottish Government. With COSLA, SFT is working on a data collection exercise to enable the public and private sector to have a clearer picture as to the individual waste infrastructure plans of each of the 32 local authorities to meet both landfill diversion and recycling targets. With SOLACE, SFT has been asked to facilitate future discussions as to how best those local authorities, not currently in procurement, could deliver their future waste infrastructure requirements.</p>

  <p>SFT has also initiated, as part of the development of its centre of expertise role, a waste procurement forum to share and disseminate best practice and lessons learnt and set up a training session for local authority waste officers on commercial issues relating to residual waste projects.</p>
