  <p>We are discussing plans for accessibility improvements at Haymarket Station with Network Rail and First ScotRail and hope to agree plans shortly for taking forward accessibility works at the station. In addition, the City of Edinburgh Council has received funding from the Executive to look at wider options for development at the station, including better disabled access.</p>

  <p>The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 does not place specific duties on the Home Office or on contractors who may be involved in the operation of Home Office facilities. The act places certain duties on local authorities relative to the provision of services to safeguard and promote the welfare for children in their area who are in need, except where disapplied by UK legislation.</p>

  <p>The First Minister has stated that Scottish children&rsquo;s services should be involved in advance of removals of asylum seeker children with families and this is being taken forward as part of on-going work on the protocol.</p>

  <p>All meat, imported into the EU, must come from an approved country and establishment to ensure that the food safety, hygiene standards and animal welfare standards are compatible with those in the EU. The European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) undertakes inspections of the authorities of countries outwith the EU to check their standards.</p>

  <p>Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 laying down the rules for prevention, control and eradication of certain TSEs came into force in 2001. It requires that meat imported into the EU be accompanied by a health certificate declaring that the product is free from Specified Risk Material (SRM) and mechanically recovered meat and that the method of slaughter used prevents contamination from SRM. Imports of meet from designated BSE-free countries are exempt from this requirement.</p>

  <p>In the EU, all intra-community trade has been subject to a permanent feed ban since 1 September 2003. It prohibits the feeding of processed animal protein to livestock kept for the production of food.</p>

  <p>It is my understanding that what NHS Ayrshire and Arran are consulting on is not the centralisation but the localisation of unscheduled care services, with a full accident and emergency service at Crosshouse Hospital supported by a network of five community casualty facilities across the region.</p>

  <p>As to the advice offered, it is for NHS boards to plan and deliver services that best meet the needs of local people, subject to national frameworks and guidance.</p>

  <p>In all cases of proposed significant service change, NHS boards are expected to adhere to the guidance set out by the Executive on public engagement and consultation. This guidance - NHS Health Department Letter 42 (2002) - is available in full in the publications section of the NHS Scottish Health On the Web internet site.</p>

  <p>An article in <em>The Lancet</em> last month stated that cholesterol reducing statins may be useful in delaying or preventing the onset of dementia. I am also aware of the research (published by Dr. Thomas D. Rea et al at the University of Washington in July 2005 in the Archives of Neurology) which did not find sufficient evidence that statin use reduced the risk of dementia. The abstract of this research can be found at <a href="http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/62/7/1047" target="_blank">http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/62/7/1047</a> .</p>

  <p>High cholesterol is one of the key risk factors for chronic heart disease (CHD). Statins are widely used to reduce cholesterol for patients who are at particularly high risk of developing heart disease. Evidence based guidelines on lipids and the primary prevention of CHD were issued by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network in September 1999.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is responsible for dealing with sewage sludge; local authorities have a similar responsibility for municipal waste. In both cases, the Scottish Executive supports recovery and recycling where this can be done satisfactorily.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water and, where relevant, contractors acting on its behalf, are responsible for the disposal of sewage sludge.</p>

  <p>I understand that Scottish Water is in the process of updating its sludge strategy, and that it intends to consult on a strategic environmental assessment of it shortly.</p>
