  <p>There is no national alcohol misuse database. While some health boards do collect information about the level of alcohol misuse in their area, this information varies from board to board and is not collated nationally.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why lighting was active on Kincardine Bridge in daylight on the afternoon of 10 September 2001; on what dates and for what reason any similar situation has arisen since AMEY Highways Ltd took over the maintenance contract from April 2001, and why the bridge&#8217;s &quot;magic eye&quot; system was not operational.</p>

  <p>Following recent repairs to electrical equipment on Kincardine Bridge, the road lighting was subject to extensive testing between 4 and 17 September 2001 to check the performance of the system. During this period the &quot;magic eye&quot; was de-activated and the lighting was on 24 hours a day. The tests confirmed that the system is operating satisfactorily and the &quot;magic eye&quot; has been re-activated.</p>

  <p>In April 1999, the classroom assistants working group, established by the Scottish Office, issued implementation guidance to local authorities and schools. In addition the working group recommended that a national qualification be developed. The Scottish Office commissioned the Scottish Qualifications Authority to develop a professional development award (PDA) for classroom assistants. SEED participated in a LGNTO group that has recently completed the development of occupational standards for teaching/classroom assistants, from which an SVQ is being developed for classroom assistants.</p>

  <p>SEED are taking forward work identified in <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21<sup>st</sup></em> <em>Century</em> to look at the career progression of support staff, including classroom assistants which will also consider training requirements of support staff.</p>

  <p>On 16 May the National Exams Co-ordinator asked Directors of Education to release existing markers from school to mark additional scripts for a number of subjects where there was a marker shortfall. The allocation of scripts to each marker depended on the subject concerned and on the number of markers recruited.</p>

  <p>I refer to my response to S1W-18720 on the allocation of additional scripts. Markers carried out additional marking either in their own time or, where schools were willing to release them, in school time.

  <p>Specific arrangements for the release of teachers from schools to carry out marking are a matter for the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and I will ask the Chair to write to you with a more detailed response to your query.</p>

  <p>I refer to my responses to questions S1W-17820 and S1W-17821 on the marking of additional scripts. Where teachers were released by their centres to mark examination scripts, SQA met the cost incurred by the centres involved.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how the cost of recruiting supply teachers to cover for teachers absent from school to mark additional examination scripts compares with the cost of paying teachers the agreed rate per script, plus a small gratuity.</p>

  <p>The rate at which teachers are paid to mark examination scripts varies by subject and therefore a direct comparison with the costs of supply cover is difficult. The basis on which markers are paid, including the variation in script rates, is currently being reviewed by a group led by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s response to the committee&#8217;s report was sent to its Convener on 27 August, after lengthy consideration.</p>

  <p>The report recognised that the tax-varying proposals being put forward to address the higher cost of fuel in rural areas are reserved to the UK Government. It also acknowledged that the Executive has already put into place many measures which will help to mitigate the effects of higher rural fuel prices. We have:</p>

  <p>increased the Rural Transport Fund to &#163;18 million over three years, funding some 380 new and improved public transport services;</p>

  <p>used the Rural Petrol Station Grant scheme to fund structural improvements at 24 vital rural petrol stations;</p>

  <p>increased funding in Scotland for the Powershift Liquefied Petroleum Gas vehicle conversion scheme by &#163;900,000 over the next three years, and</p>

  <p>introduced, with the UK Government and Shell UK, an initiative to deliver 23 new LPG outlets in rural areas.</p>

  <p>We will continue to press Scotland&#8217;s interests on taxation, as on other reserved matters, through the Scotland Office and through direct contacts with UK ministers. We will also continue to develop effective measures of direct benefit to rural communities, and remain open to imaginative and innovative proposals.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Manufacturing Steering Group last met on 31 March 2000. The work of the group led to the establishment of the Manufacturing Image Group in June 2000 and the development of a number of initiatives as set out in <em>Created in Scotland &#8211; the Way Forward for Scottish Manufacturing in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</em> . A key initiative has been our campaign to counter the prejudice and misconceptions which discourage many young people from considering employment opportunities in this sector. The campaign takes the form of locally held roadshows. It has recently been agreed to extend the pilot to Ayrshire, Glasgow and Angus this year.</p>

  <p>Other initiatives in <em>Created in Scotland</em> in the field of skills, financial assistance and advice are being taken forward by the Scottish Executive and the Enterprise Networks. For example, approximately 18,000 people are currently in training as part of the modern apprenticeships programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold information on the average age of staff employed by local authorities under each of the departmental headings used in the Joint Staffing Watch Survey. However, information on age is held for teachers employed by local authorities. The Scottish Executive carries out a periodic census of teachers working in schools during a given week in September. Individual teachers provide a range of data, including their date of birth, which allows average age to be computed. Information on the average age of publicly funded <strong> </strong> school <strong> </strong> teachers is given in Table 3, page 3 of <em>Teachers in Scotland: September 1998</em> published by the Scottish Executive in 2000, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 16320).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive aims to respond positively to any vocational placement requests it receives, from students or educational establishments. The Executive actively promotes student placements within its core departments and its agencies, and encourages managers to identify suitable places and projects wherever possible. NDPB participation is a matter for those organisations to consider.</p>

  <p>The Traffic Commissioner is responsible for ensuring that local bus services are operated under the terms of the Transport Act 1985 and associated regulations. In addition, the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 provides powers for local authorities to make Quality Partnership schemes, or with the approval of Scottish ministers, Quality Contract schemes and the Executive would consider any such application timeously.</p>

  <p>The Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 provides for a quality contract to come into operation not earlier than six months from the date the contract was let, or an earlier date if that is specified in the proposed quality contract scheme. A proposed quality contract requires the approval of Scottish ministers before it can be implemented, and I would consider any such application timeously. The overall timescale for progressing a quality contract proposal, assuming that ministerial approval is forthcoming, is a matter within the control of the local authority concerned.</p>

  <p>No. The Executive has already brought forward new powers under the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 which enable local authorities to make quality contract schemes. As my answer to S1W-17794 makes clear, the timescale for progressing a quality contract proposal is a matter within the control of the local authority concerned, subject to ministerial approval.</p>

  <p>I understand that the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) hope to publish their rail freight strategy for Scotland later this year. In April, the Scottish Executive commissioned consultants to carry out a study to take a strategic view of the potential for developing sustainable freight movements across the whole of Scotland. The outcome of this study will assist in the forthcoming discussions we are to have with the SRA to develop that strategy.</p>

  <p>The development of the proposed Aberdeen western peripheral route is being taken forward by Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire Councils in the context of their planned Modern Transport System. As part of its support for that system, the Scottish Executive is extending the Central Scotland Transport Model (now the Transport Model for Scotland) to the north-east. This will provide reliable and up to date transport data vital to the assessment of major transport projects. In light of this investment, it would be premature to make a decision on the Aberdeen western peripheral route before the Transport Model for Scotland is functional.</p>

  <p>Formal responsibility for the civilian staff at the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) rests with Strathclyde joint police board. While the decisions in respect of the four suspended officers will be for the joint board to take and to justify, the joint board will continue to work closely with the SCRO Executive Committee in deciding whether there are or are not grounds in this case for initiating formal disciplinary procedures.</p>

  <p>Ministers are reimbursed for expenditure incurred in the course of their official duties. Reimbursement is made in accordance with standard Civil Service procedures. These costs are set out in the following table. Other costs such as travel, both within the UK and abroad, are paid direct to suppliers by the Scottish Executive &#8211; these costs are excluded from the figures given. The figures also exclude costs reimbursed to ministers when public transport has been used instead of the Government Car Service for home to office travel.</p>

  <p>Aggregated public sector procurement of telecommunications will be tested initially in two pathfinder areas. Our aim is that, by guaranteeing a substantial volume of public sector demand, telecommunications companies are also encouraged to increase supply of higher bandwidth commercial services to the benefit of rural businesses. However, provision of services will be a commercial matter for the telecoms providers according to demand. The Executive recognises, however, that there may be benefit in steps to stimulate private sector demand. We will be working with the enterprise agencies and with DTI to develop measures to stimulate demand.</p>

  <p>Aggregated procurement is a new approach which we are testing first in pathfinder areas. The procurement process is likely to be lengthy, and contracts will have to be fulfilled, before any formal evaluation and consideration of wider deployment can proceed. However, in the meantime, this will not preclude local authorities in other areas considering the potential benefits of a similar approach themselves. We will be keeping local authorities informed, via COSLA, of the progress of the project.</p>

  <p>Local loop unbundling (LLU) can benefit the economy by being one of the delivery mechanisms for broadband access. LLU allows operators to offer &quot;always on&quot; higher speed services such as ADSL directly to business and residential customers in competition with BT&#8217;s services. It also allows operators to offer wholesale ADSL access to service providers in competition with BT&#8217;s wholesale products. Competition helps to reduce prices and increase choice for broadband access, the availability of which is seen as key to the development of the &quot;e-economy&quot;. Oversight of local loop unbundling is an aspect of telecommunications regulation and is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>LLU is only one of a number of delivery mechanisms for broadband. Cable modems, satellite, fixed wireless and 3G mobile can all offer broadband services with some having a wider geographic reach than current DSL technology. Services using some of these delivery mechanisms are now available while others are due to be rolled out in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s broadband strategy, <em>Connecting Scotland: our broadband future</em> aims to stimulate providers to offer a wider range of higher bandwidth services to business and individuals.</p>
