  <p>*Subject to outcome of public local inquiry.</p>

  <p>**Total may not add due to roundings.</p>

  <p>Additional investment in transport which will support the Commonwealth Games will be: Scotrail franchise support, Edinburgh to Glasgow rail improvements project and Glasgow to Paisley main line and Central station improvements. We shall work with partners SPT and Glasgow City Council to develop and deliver an integrated ticketing system for the games. We shall enhance public transport through the station improvements mentioned above which, in turn, complement our commitment and that of others to ensuring the successful delivery of a refurbished Dalmarnock station. Finally, while regrettable, the cancellation of Glasgow Airport Rail Link is enabling us to move forward the initial works for Fastlink.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s citizens have benefited from the equivalent of an autism strategy from 2002 until the present. This has delivered improved diagnosis and assessment, extensive awareness raising and training, development of innovative services and education resources and a programme of national and international research.</p>

  <p>The focus of our work has now shifted to ensuring the needs of people on the autism spectrum are addressed through other policies and legislation, whilst not neglecting specialist needs as they arise.</p>

  <p>As noted in the answer to question S3W-13539 on 4 June 2009, the Scottish Government did not make a submission to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) prior to the issue of the OFT information note. OFT later confirmed that, in order to maintain strict confidentiality it did not disclose the emerging findings of its investigation of alleged anti-competitive practices in the construction industry, or the timing of their release, with any other public body prior to the publication of the <em>Statement of Objections</em> on 17 April 2008.</p>

  <p>The OFT has also confirmed that as the investigation related to infringements which took place in England, it did not seek or obtain a detailed representation from the Scottish Government prior to the issue of the decision on 22 September 2009.</p>

  <p>The government&rsquo;s intention in the 1997 Order is that deceased tenants and their executors, and deceased owners and their executors, should both have exemption if they meet the relevant criteria. We are not aware that this is not the case. If the member can provide details of where the Order is not working as had been intended, I would be happy to investigate further.</p>

  <p>The Council Tax (Exempt Dwellings) (Scotland) Order 1997 sets out the circumstances when a dwelling is exempt from council tax. The exemption provided for deceased owners and their executors is intended to apply equally to deceased tenants and their executors.</p>

  <p>As deceased tenants and their executors, and deceased owners and their executors should already have exemption under the 1997 Order, we currently have no plans to revise the Order.</p>

  <p>Procurement Scotland was officially launched in March 2008, with the task of developing and implementing procurement strategies for national Category A commodities on behalf of all Scottish public bodies. It was established as part of the Public Procurement Reform Programme and in response to the <em>Review of Public Sector Procurement in Scotland </em> report, which was published in March 2006.</p>

  <p>The establishment of Procurement Scotland as a new division in the Scottish Government Scottish Procurement Directorate began in July 2007. Therefore, information on the number of staff, budget and running costs is only available from financial year 2007-08. Details are given in the following table:</p>

  <p>The provision of food and drink trolley services on trains is not part of the specification for services contracted in the franchise agreement and is a commercial matter for ScotRail. The Scottish Government does not therefore subsidise food and drink trolley services on rail journeys running north and west out of Inverness.</p>

  <p>The number of voluntary organisations in Scotland, which by definition will use volunteers in some capacity, can not be identified with accuracy. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) has estimated there may be about 45,000 and the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator has over 23,800 charities on its register. However, neither of these figures will include the huge number of informal local groups who come together to pursue a common interest.</p>

  <p>The essence of volunteering is that people just do it, often outside any formal setting or organisation, and without any requirement to register. Consequently, there can be no precise quantification of the numbers.</p>

  <p>Research by Volunteer Development Scotland suggests that the number of volunteers in Scotland lies in the range 1.3 to 2 million. The Scottish Household Survey also collects some information about rates of volunteering.</p>
