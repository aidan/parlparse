  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what actions are proposed for those locations identified as failing to meet the European standard for bathing waters to ensure that they meet the standard in future, broken down by location and indicating the cost and timescale for each action.</p>

  <p>Three designated bathing waters failed to meet the mandatory standard of the Bathing Water Directive (76/160/EEC) during 2005, the most recent season for which figures are complete. These were at Eyemouth, Nairn (East) and Stonehaven.</p>

  <p>It is the duty of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to monitor every bathing water, and to produce an annual report of its findings. SEPA also investigate the reasons for any failures in compliance, also reporting on these in its publication. The 2005 report, which covers the three failures, is available on the SEPA website at: <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/pdf/publications/bathingwaters/2005/bathing_waters_2005.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sepa.org.uk/pdf/publications/bathingwaters/2005/bathing_waters_2005.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>SEPA also produce individual Pollution Reduction Plans for every bathing water. These outline the potential threats to compliance and set out actions that SEPA, working with stakeholders such as Scottish Water, believe are necessary to achieve compliance.</p>

  <p>The Pollution Reduction Plans for the three bathing waters can be found on SEPA&rsquo;s website at:</p>

  <p>Eyemouth <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/pdf/data/bathingwaters/improve/9334.PDF" target="_blank">http://www.sepa.org.uk/pdf/data/bathingwaters/improve/9334.PDF</a>.</p>

  <p>Nairn (East) <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/pdf/data/bathingwaters/improve/206178.PDF" target="_blank">http://www.sepa.org.uk/pdf/data/bathingwaters/improve/206178.PDF</a>.</p>

  <p>Stonehaven <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/pdf/data/bathingwaters/improve/233617.PDF" target="_blank">http://www.sepa.org.uk/pdf/data/bathingwaters/improve/233617.PDF</a>.</p>

  <p>Bathing waters can be at risk of failure from both point and diffuse sources of pollution. At Eyemouth investigations are continuing into the likely causes of the failure and therefore costs and actions cannot be detailed at this time. At Stonehaven, Scottish Water are to invest &pound;10 million to help meet compliance with the Directive&rsquo;s standards and it is hoped that the new facilities will be in place ahead of the 2008 bathing waters season. At Nairn (East), whilst it would appear a technical failure may have led to an instance of poor water quality, it is also likely that diffuse pollution controls will be important for maintaining water quality in the future. At present the Scottish Executive is working with the farming sector to develop measures to reduce the risks of diffuse pollution.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress is being made in connection with a prioritisation scheme for applications for funding for flood alleviation schemes; when a draft scheme will be available; to what extent relevant parties have been, and will be, consulted on the scheme, and what criteria will be used for the purpose of prioritisation of applications.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-06-30.S2W-26858.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80011" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0630.htm#3">

  <p>With increasing demands on resources in the future, there may be a need for prioritisation of grant funding to local authorities for flood prevention schemes. This issue has been discussed at the Flooding Issues Advisory Committee (FIAC) Alleviation Sub-Committee, and has resulted in a paper, FIAC2006(1), which can be viewed on the FIAC website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1223/0023586.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1223/0023586.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>However, there are at present no plans to introduce such a prioritisation system, as the schemes currently being brought forward by local authorities do not exceed the existing budget of &pound;89 million for the period 2005-08. Of course, should circumstances change in the future, we would consult relevant parties on any criteria which might be under consideration for prioritisation of funding.</p>

  <p>In addition the Executive supports the UK wide Flooding Risk Management Research Consortium, which employs many university-based researchers and has the specific objective of developing and training the next generation of flood risk management professionals through their involvement in and exposure to the consortium&rsquo;s research.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also established a Flood Risk Management Service, which is provided by Scotland Northern Ireland Forum for Environment Research (SNIFFER). The website <a href="http://www.sniffer.org.uk/rise/" target="_blank">http://www.sniffer.org.uk/rise/</a> contains full details and has a research programme that involves the Executive, local authorities, Scottish Water, SEPA, Scottish Environment Link and others as appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Flooding Issues Advisory Committee (FIAC) provides a forum for a wide-range of stakeholders to share experiences and expertise on flood related issues. The work of FIAC, its Sub-Committees and full membership can be found at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Environment/Water/Flooding/16919/FIAC" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Environment/Water/Flooding/16919/FIAC</a> .</p>

  <p>In addition, Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 7 states that each local authority should convene a Flood Liaison and Advice Group (FLAG) or combine with other local authorities to do so, possibly on a catchment basis. The purpose of a FLAG is to act as a forum for the key public and private interests to share knowledge and offer advice on flooding issues. More information on FLAGs, and organisations normally represented, can be found in Planning Advice Note (PAN) 69 at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/08/19805/41600" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/08/19805/41600</a>.</p>

  <p>The Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland (SCOTS) Group on Flooding is another such forum whose remit is to share knowledge and experience and to provide guidance to Scottish local authorities with regard to best practice in terms of issues related to flooding and water legislation. The Executive and most Scottish local authorities are represented at this group.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) Flooding Task Group was established to consider the issues of flood prevention, flood incidents and coast protection. The group liaised with other bodies such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), Scottish Water, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the Executive on flooding issues.</p>

The SFGS is now, however, under review, in preparation for the introduction of the new Rural Development Plan next year. Details of the review can be seen on the Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) web pages at <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/scotland" target="_blank">www.forestry,gov.uk/scotland</a> .</p>

  <p>The intention had been to close the SFGS in August to allow development of the new grants, but FCS had to close it in April because the value of applications received was significantly in excess of the funding available. The FCS has, however, discussed with the Confederation of Forest Industries (ConFor) which categories of applications should be given priority for processing. The FCS has written to applicants giving them full details.</p>

  <p>Applications which will be given priority include those which are associated with ministerial commitments aimed at encouraging activity in particular policy areas. FCS will therefore look to approve schemes in the Locational Premium areas and those which form part of the Woods In and Around Towns Challenge Fund. Other examples are applications involving short rotation coppice, restocking associated with a long-term forest plan, and community/partnership participation.</p>

  <p>To help to support the record level of forestry activity, we have provided record levels of funding for the next two years - &pound;26 million and &pound;28 million respectively.</p>

The agency maintained its market share among historic attractions. This year the agency is aiming for a 9% increase in income, on the back of a 4% increase in visitor numbers. This is ambitious, but would bring HS back onto the track laid out in its corporate plan.</td>

  <p>No instances of procurement irregularity have occurred at the Scottish Court Service Headquarters since 2004.</p>

  <p>Since the agency was established in 1995 there have only been two allegations of procurement irregularities in the SCS. Both occurred in 2003. The first in relation to procurement of IT equipment would have resulted in disciplinary action but the middle manager concerned resigned from the agency. The second in relation to the property department was the subject of an audit by Scottish Executive auditors who found no evidence of impropriety to substantiate the allegations.</p>
