  <p>Sam Galbraith attended the Environment Council meeting on 8 March as part of the UK delegation along with the DETR Environment Minister Michael Meacher. This was the first Environment Council under the Swedish Presidency. It was held in Brussels under the chairmanship of the Swedish Environment Minister, Mr Kjell Larrson.</p>

  <p>At the council, there was lively a policy debate &#8211; open to the public - on the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which was proposed by the Commission in January. When agreed by the council and European Parliament this will set out the EU&#8217;s environmental priorities for the next ten years with four priority areas for action - climate change, nature and biodiversity, environment and health and sustainable management of natural resources and waste. The negotiations on this issue will proceed throughout the remainder of the Swedish Presidency with the aim of achieving a Common Position at the June Council.</p>

  <p>There was an exchange of views on the Commission&#8217;s Communication on Bathing Water policy. On this the council adopted conclusions which are favourable to the UK, particularly in their insistence on the need for the Commission to undertake a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits before proposing a revised directive.</p>

  <p>There was also a policy debate on the Commission&#8217;s recently adopted White Paper on an EU chemicals strategy. The aims of the strategy are to maintain a high level of protection of human health and the environment, to raise the confidence of the public in chemicals management and to ensure compliance with the regulations of the internal market. On this the UK supported the Commission&#8217;s White Paper but stressed the need to identify and phase out chemicals that pose an unacceptable risk. The UK also advocated improved public access to information and the need to minimise animal testing.</p>

  <p>A Common Position was also reached on a proposal for a<i> </i>directive on emissions from motorcycles. This will provide better air quality while at the same time protecting the particular interests of small UK motorbike manufacturers.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, council Conclusions on Climate Change, and on Preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Rio+10) were agreed. On Climate Change, the council reaffirmed the EU&#8217;s commitment to reaching agreement on the Kyoto Protocol at the resumed COP6. On the World Summit, the UK strongly supported the Commission&#8217;s plans for preparing for the Summit, which are in tune with our own plans for stakeholder involvement that Mr Galbraith announced in the Scottish Parliament on 28 February.</p>

  <p>Finally, we reviewed progress on a range of issues. The Commission and Presidency updated council on progress on an EU Sustainable Development Strategy, and the Commission presented their Green Paper on Integrated Product Policy, which seeks to address the environmental impact of products at all stages of their life-cycle. The Presidency also reported on progress on several environmental directives on which they aim to make substantial progress and which will fall to the Scottish Executive to implement. These include a revised Directive on Access to Environmental Information, the proposed Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, and a Decision establishing a list of priority substances discharged into the aquatic environment. We shall of course be fully involved in developing the UK line on these and other environmental issues during the weeks and months ahead.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency advises that all imported meat must conform to the same European hygiene standards as UK production. In accordance with European Single Market rules, imports from other member states are not checked on import but the EU Food and Veterinary Office make inspection visits in all member states to ensure compliance with single market rules.</p>

  <p>Third country imports all come from plants approved by the European Commission. Officials in Border Inspection Posts check all consignments from non-EU countries. These checks ensure that all imported meat has been produced to at least the same standards as domestic produce.</p>

  <p>The agency has requested that food authorities step up checks on imports following recent breaches of EU BSE controls detected in consignments of meat from some member states and imports are currently being checked by either Meat Hygiene Service or local authority officers in the UK.</p>

  <p>I am fully aware of the effect that the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease is having on the tourism industry. I have arranged to get regular reports about the position in every part of Scotland and I have met with individual businesses to find out the problems at first hand.</p>

  <p>I have asked visitscotland to prepare a recovery plan for the tourism industry. This will include launching the postponed &#163;2 million spring campaign as soon as it is sensible to do so. Once the outbreak is over, the British Tourist Authority will pull out all the stops to promote Britain abroad.</p>

  <p>In addition, Ross Finnie is chairing a group with representatives from the Enterprise Networks, visitscotland and local authorities to examine the impact these problems are having on the wider rural economy, in which, of course, the tourism industry figures largely.</p>

  <p>This is, of course, a UK problem and I am in regular contact with ministerial colleagues to ensure that action is co-ordinated. I will be hosting a tourism summit in the near future.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-13366 by Susan Deacon on 28 February 2001, what charge out rate is applied by the Central Legal Office of the NHS in Scotland in determining the charges to be paid by health boards and NHS Trusts for the legal services which the office provides to them.</p>

  <p>The Central Legal Office (CLO) provides its services on a competitive basis with the private sector. Whilst charging rates vary to reflect the complexity of the work, disclosure of the rates is contrary to CLO&#8217;s commercial interests.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office is consulting widely among children&#8217;s welfare organisations, local authorities, health professionals, retail organisations, voluntary organisations and the police, in order to inform the Lord Advocate&#8217;s review of prosecution policy in relation to test purchasing of age restricted goods by children in Scotland. Good progress is being made in this consultation. The helpful and constructive responses received thus far represent a wide cross section of opinion as to the appropriateness and desirability of basing criminal proceedings on test purchasing by children. All of these responses will be taken into account by the Lord Advocate when he carries out his review shortly.</p>

  <p>The Lord Advocate has written recently to the Convenor of the All Party Group on Tobacco with further details of the review.</p>

  <p>Work is under way to establish by 2003 Electronic Patient Records <strong> </strong> (EPRs) which will contain the detailed record of care of an individual patient in primary and secondary care organisations. Separately work is in hand to pilot by 2002 Electronic Health Records (EHRs) <strong> </strong> which <strong> </strong> will contain summarised information on important health events throughout a patient&#8217;s life. An important part of the work currently under way is to establish protocols for access to these records by health care professionals and patients. However, in planning for such developments, security and confidentiality of patients&#8217; information, safeguarding patients&#8217; rights, is paramount. Such records will be established on secure private networks to ensure patient confidentiality where access can be strictly controlled.</p>

  <p>At a strategic level, the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department already encourages research projects to have a multidisciplinary involvement. The CSO publication <i><strong>Research Strategy for the</strong></i> <strong> <i>National Health Service in Scotland</i></strong> , published in July 1998, identifies the promotion of a multidisciplinary approach to health services research as one of the prime objectives in its overall aim of improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of health services and health care. A copy of the Research Strategy is in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>This multidisciplinary approach is reflected in CSO funding streams. Having an appropriate multidisciplinary mix is one of the 10 dimensions of assessment by which R&amp;D Support Fund awards are allocated and annually reviewed. Similarly, the majority of research projects funded directly by CSO also have multidisciplinary research teams.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have a formal strategy on research into brain development, brain functions and learning. However, it is generally recognised that developments in research related to the human brain have an important contribution to raising awareness among teachers, educational researchers and teacher educators of the factors which affect successful learning and teaching in the classroom.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department spends approximately &#163;40 million per year on medical research. Of this, &#163;30 million is allocated from the R&amp;D Support Fund budget to NHS providers for research activities and related infrastructure costs. Table 1 details the allocation for the last three financial years for each NHS provider. Awards made to Trusts prior to 1 April 1999 have been allocated to their successor Trusts in the interests of comparability with later years.</p>

  <p>In addition, CSO provides approximately &#163;2.8 million of funding annually for seven research units. Table 2 details the allocation to each unit for the last three financial years. CSO also awards a significant number of research grants to individual researchers which are administered by their respective research institution. Total expenditure in any financial year in respect of such grants is approximately &#163;5.5 million. Details of the grants awarded in the last three financial years were provided in my answer to question S1W-13052.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the CSO research budget largely consists of a significant number of relatively small amounts. Summary information on payments made to the wide range organisations and individuals involved is not readily available.</p>

  <p>A wide range of conditions are captured by the term neuropsychiatric disease, including Huntington&#8217;s Disease, head injury, dementia of cardiovascular origin and senile dementia among many others. The responses and contributions to care and prevention are equally wide-ranging and condition specific.</p>

  <p>We will continue to work with health boards and local authorities to devise and implement approaches to care and prevention that not only respond to the needs of different conditions but that also relate to individually assessed needs and inform our prevention measures.</p>

  <p>Ministerial engagements are given wide publicity: the Scottish Executive Media and Communications Group issues operational notes in advance of them taking place. However, such engagements may be subject to cancellation at any time for a range of reasons and diary records are, therefore, neither comprehensive nor accurate.</p>

  <p>Details of ministerial meetings are internal matters for the Scottish Executive. In the course of a working week, ministers attend and chair a wide range of meetings, some of which are planned and programmed well in advance while others, such as the need to be in Parliament, are arranged at short notice.</p>

  <p>Information on drug costs is provided routinely in a number of reports including Scottish Prescribing Analysis (SPA) and financial schedules. These relate to British National Formulary chapters and sub-sections. Information relating to the last two financial years is given in the table &quot;Information on Prescribing Cost and Items&quot; published by the Common Services Agency, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 12055).</p>

  <p>However, there are relatively few drugs that link specifically to an illness or disease. Therefore such information is not available.</p>

  <p>The National Diet Action Co-ordinator post is due to be advertised within the next two to three weeks. The Co-ordinator will champion the need for improvement in Scotland&#8217;s diet; supporting the key players with an influence over diet, such as primary producers, manufacturers, retailers and the catering sector, to increase their contribution towards the implementation of the Scottish Diet Action Plan. This will complement the work of the Scottish Community Diet Project, which has a specific focus on low income communities.</p>
