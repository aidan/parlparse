  <p>The Scottish Government announced proposals for six new golden eagle special protection areas on 1 December. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) will commence consultation on the proposals (on behalf of the Scottish Government) on 13 January. Further information is available on the SNH website via the following web address:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.snh.org.uk/strategy/GE_consult01.asp" target="_blank">http://www.snh.org.uk/strategy/GE_consult01.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government works with land management, conservation and law enforcement organisations through PAW Scotland to improve the investigation and enforcement of wildlife crime, while at the same time increasing awareness and educating the public. Persecution of raptor species is one of six UK Wildlife Crime Priorities and in Scotland the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland lead for Wildlife and Environmental Crime has committed to leading an action plan for this priority with full support of PAW Scotland and the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>Scottish National Heritage (SNH) published a conservation framework for golden eagles in July 2008. This sets out an analysis of three national surveys carried out in 1982, 1992 and 2003 across the natural heritage zones of Scotland. On the basis of that report, the populations were considered to be in an unfavourable condition in the following areas: North West seaboard, Peatlands of Caithness and Sutherland, Northern, Western and Central Highlands, Cairngorms Massif, North East Glens, Lochaber, Breadalbane and East Argyll, Western and Southern Uplands and the Border Hills.</p>

  <p>A variety of factors was considered to account for these unfavourable populations, notably a shortage of live prey due to heavy deer and sheep grazing pressure in the north and western parts of the eagle range (given as the principal reason in five of the regions above) and persecution in some eastern and southern areas (given as the principal reason for five regions). Monitoring of the different ranges continues under the auspices of the Scottish Raptor Monitoring Scheme and a fourth national survey is planned for 2013.</p>

  <p>National surveys of hen harriers have been carried out in 1988, 1989, 1998 and 2004, with a further survey planned for 2010.</p>

  <p>The current population is estimated to be 630 pairs. Scottish National Heritage (SNH) holds data for hen harrier and other raptors at the regional level of natural heritage zones (NHZ&rsquo;s) rather than for local authority areas.

  <p>The Scottish Government has not had any such discussions directly with local authorities. This is a matter for local authorities themselves to determine.

  <p>Under the European Fisheries Fund, aid is available toward the control and eradication of diseases in aquaculture as well as measures to improve fish and shellfish health and welfare. The scheme is discretionary and competitive and projects must be able to demonstrate the benefits public assistance will deliver in competition with wider applications under the fund.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards publish reports on their websites using the HAI reporting template introduced in January 2009. The content and substance of each report varies by board but, as a minimum, all NHS boards publish Clostridium difficile and Staphylococcus aureaus Bacteraemia data by month and by hospital.</p>

  <p>A short-life working group has been established by NHS Scotland to review the structure and presentation of the HAIRT and to consider what changes are necessary in order to make the information, as presented, more consistent across NHS boards and easier to understand. This group will report the outcomes of its finding in the New Year. I expect their recommendations to be adopted and implemented in full by all NHS boards. It is anticipated that the revised mandatory template will be rolled out from March 2010.</p>

  <p>As part of the exploratory work by the Scottish Futures Trust, the local authorities listed below were approached informally regarding the development of a National Housing Trust. This was to seek their initial views in order to gauge whether or not there was likely to be local authority interest and whether a viable business case could be made for the model. Local authorities were selected on the basis of falling into one or more of four broad categories:</p>

  <p>Councils where there was likely to be demand for mid-market rent housing;</p>

  <p>Councils facing particular challenges in meeting their homelessness targets;</p>

  <p>Councils who had already expressed an interest in this type of innovative model, and</p>

  <p>Other Councils suggested by housing officials working in that region.</p>

  <p>The local authorities marked with an asterisk below expressed interest in looking at the housing trust model in more detail. Two of the 26 councils initially contacted did not provide any response. Most others who did not express any interest did not provide detailed reasons, but noted that they did not feel the model would be suitable in their area. Where councils did provide reasons these focussed on: there being little or no suitable mothballed private housing sites in their area; mid-market rent housing not being a priority for their council or concerns about the need to borrow funds from the Public Works Loan Board.</p>

  <p>COSLA has since been consulting all Scottish councils to confirm which councils wish to be involved in further discussions on the housing trust proposals.</p>

  <p>Aberdeen*<br /> Aberdeenshire*<br /> Angus*<br /> City of Edinburgh*<br /> Clackmannanshire<br /> Dumfries and Galloway<br /> Dundee City*<br /> East Dunbartonshire<br /> East Lothian*<br /> East Renfrewshire*<br /> Eilean Siar<br /> Falkirk*<br /> Fife*<br /> Glasgow*<br /> Highland*<br /> Midlothian*<br /> Moray*<br /> North Lanarkshire*<br /> Orkney Islands<br /> Perth and Kinross*<br /> Renfrewshire*<br /> Scottish Borders<br /> Shetland Islands<br /> South Lanarkshire*<br /> Stirling*<br /> West Lothian.</p>

  <p>The meetings held with stakeholders (such as COSLA, local authorities, the Scottish Futures Trust, lenders, developers, housing associations, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and insolvency practitioners) to discuss proposals for a housing trust model were held in confidence and in some cases discussed information of a commercially sensitive nature. The Scottish Government has provided the same public information to all stakeholders and to Parliament by publishing background information on the proposals (Bib. number 49829 and 49830 in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre). Provision of information around stakeholders exploring the housing trust model could impact on their willingness to engage in future discussions or to become involved in the model. It might also negatively affect the value for taxpayers&rsquo; money which could be achieved through open public procurement.</p>

  <p>The review of the role of the senior charge nurse (SCN) was completed in 2008, with the key aim of creating a modern role which maximised the SCNs contribution to delivering safe and effective care. <em>Leading Better Care</em> , launched in June 2008, established a national role framework for SCNs working in hospital settings across NHS Scotland. The framework for the role includes four core responsibilities:</p>

  <p>Ensuring safe and effective clinical practice (including responsibilities for tackling healthcare associated infection),</p>

  <p>Enhancing the patient experience,</p>

  <p>Managing and developing the performance of the team and</p>

  <p>Contributing to the delivery of the organisation&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

  <p>The national progress reporting process is demonstrating that <em>Leading Better Care</em> is providing NHS Scotland with SCNs who are visible, approachable and empowered clinical leaders, who are being supported in fulfilling their role as guardians of care quality and clinical standards. SCNs also have a key role in implementing clinical quality indicators (CQIs) for nursing and midwifery which cover food, fluid and nutrition, falls, pressure ulcer prevention and in monitoring of infections within their clinical area &ndash; a key element of Scotland&rsquo;s patient safety programme.</p>

  <p><em>Leading Better Care</em> set out the aim that the framework for SCNs and the CQIs should be fully implemented within NHS boards by December 2010.</p>
