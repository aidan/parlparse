  <p>I recently wrote to Don Touhig MP, Under Secretary of State for Defence and Minister for Veterans to express concerns at the proposal to close the Met Office&rsquo;s weather centre in Aberdeen and ask him to take account of the success and expertise of the Aberdeen Office and its unique geographical position when final decisions are taken on the future of the Met Office structure. I have asked to be kept informed of any significant developments and my officials are also maintaining close contact with their MoD counterparts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not currently have any specific measures to recruit dentists from Greece, Portugal, Germany, Spain or India as responsibility for recruitment is a matter for NHS boards and independent dental practitioners who own dental practices.</p>

  <p>There is a general understanding that some boards and indeed some dental practitioners have advertised vacancies and recruited from abroad. Candidates from the EU would be entitled to apply for posts that they are qualified for but specific information is not held centrally by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>There has been a high-level of interest from Indian dentists wishing to work in Scotland. However, before being considered fit to practice in the UK by the General Dental Council, applicants from outwith the EU are required to sit an English language proficiency exam and a clinical competence exam known as the IQE (International Qualifying Exam) and this process can be quite lengthy. This latter issue is reserved and the General Dental Council and the Department of <br /> Health (England) are ensuring that the process is as efficient as possible.</p>

  <p>The appointment of salaried dentists is a matter for NHS boards. The most up-to-date information on appointments is not held centrally but will be available from NHS boards. The number of salaried dentist posts approved by Scottish ministers prior to 1 April 2005 is in answer to question S2W-17734, answered on 8 July 2005.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-9099 by Mr Jim Wallace on 30 June 2004, how many people worked in the (a) public sector and (b) private sector, broken down by industry, in 2004.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-07-29.S2W-17703.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80115" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0729.htm#4">

  <p>Further to question S2W-9099, table 1 contains the equivalent data for 2004. However, it should be noted that the Office for National Statistics (ONS), who carry out the Labour Force Survey (LFS), acknowledge that the level of public sector employment in the LFS is inflated as the survey is based on self reported answers.</p>

  <p>Since S2W-9099 was answered the Scottish Executive has developed a more accurate measure of public sector employment based on administrative data and surveys. This was recently published in &quot;Public Sector Employment in Scotland: Quarter 1 2005&quot;. In Q1 2005 the number of people working in the public sector was 572,900. Subtracting this from total employment in Scotland, as given by the Labour Force Survey (LFS), gives an estimate for the number of people working in the private sector for the same period as 1,860,100. It is not possible to break down these estimates by industry nor provide comparable aggregate data for 2004.</p>

  <p>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the official source for employment estimates.</p>

  <p>LFS estimates are currently reported in seasonal quarters (spring, summer, autumn, winter). The spring quarter runs from March to May, summer quarter from June to August, autumn quarter from September to November and winter from December to February. Prior to 1992 the LFS was only carried out in the spring quarter.</p>

  <p>Table 1 reports the level of manufacturing employment in Scotland for all the quarters that are available between 1984 and 2005. The latest data are for spring 2005.</p>

  <p>These estimates have not been seasonally adjusted thus year on year comparisons should only be made within quarters i.e. comparing spring 1984 with spring 2004 will give the best estimate of the change in the manufacturing employment level between 1984 and 2004, comparing Spring 1984 with Summer 2004 will not due to seasonality.</p>

  <p>The Expert Group on Infertility Services in Scotland (EAGISS) set out recommendations for national criteria for NHS-funded infertility treatment. One of these recommendations was that the female partner should be aged less than 38 at the time of treatment. NHS boards were asked to implement EAGISS criteria bearing in mind local and national priorities. In a recent review conducted by the Executive, NHS Argyll and Clyde informed us that they provide treatment for NHS-funded infertility treatment up to the age of 40, but that they would not accept referrals for patients over the age of 35. We are aware that NHS Argyll and Clyde is in the process of reviewing their policy and that they anticipate making changes to reflect current waiting times and national guidance.</p>
