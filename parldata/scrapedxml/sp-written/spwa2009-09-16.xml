  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has contributed, or plans to contribute, to the debate on aspects of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s debate on <em>Shaping the Future of Care Together</em> with regard to possible changes to benefits received by claimants in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have not been included in, or invited to contribute to discussions about the options for change to the benefit system which may flow from the UK Government&rsquo;s green paper. Scottish Government officials attended a meeting at a very early stage of the work in November 2007 which was also attended by officials from several UK Departments, including the <em>Department for Work and Pensions</em> . At that meeting it was clear that the social care debate in England might include a reform of the GB benefit system. Unfortunately, despite efforts to do so, we have not however been consulted on possible options for change to funding of care.</p>

  <p>We are of course aware of the impact which the options for reform of the English social care system outlined in the green paper may have on Scotland through a concurrent reform to GB-wide disability benefits. Accordingly, we have written to the Secretary of State for Health highlighting our concerns that, in reforming disability benefits to meet objectives for reform of social care in England, our objectives and ambitions for reshaping social care delivery in Scotland may be restricted.</p>

  <p>We have therefore requested an early and detailed explanation of any proposed revision to Disability Benefits, and a commitment from the UK Government to give full consideration to the need to take into account the impact on policies and services which are the responsibility of the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>A formal response to the UK green paper is currently being prepared.</p>

  <p>At this point in time we can only monitor the number of people in Scotland who receive disability related benefits. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s current debate on <em>Shaping the Future of Care</em> has not yet made any specific proposals about how these benefits might change.</p>

  <p>As set out in the Government Economic Strategy we are focussed on giving greater priority to achieving more balanced growth across Scotland, in order to reduce regional disparities. As part of this we are ensuring a more strategic approach to the growth of Scotland&rsquo;s cities, towns and rural areas across transport, planning, housing and economic development.</p>

  <p>Our actions include: working to help address demographic challenges; taking forward the Climate Change agenda; introducing the Scotland Rural Development Programme; implementing the national developments and spatial strategy set out in the second National Planning Framework and delivering planning reform; implementing Scotland&rsquo;s biodiversity strategy; working to improve access and participation in cultural activities, and we will shortly be publishing a consultation on the Energy Efficiency Action Plan. We are also focusing government and the wider public sector around our national outcomes, including those on the environmental impacts of consumption and production; the built and natural environment, and realising our full economic potential.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>Procurators fiscal are trained to consider the possibility of medical conditions playing a role in the commission of offences. Training is also provided to procurators fiscal on the legal criteria for all special defences such as insanity, insanity at the time of the crime, automatism, diminished responsibility and the leading of expert evidence. Significance of medical conditions may be examined in the context of a trial or examination of the facts during which expert evidence is presented to establish whether a defence can be established, for example, on the basis that an accused was suffering a seizure at the time or was in a post-ictal state.</p>

  <p>The proposal to replace quotas for certain fish stocks and replace them with an annual allowance of days at sea was first raised in the European Commission&rsquo;s green paper on Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. Commissioner Borg again raised the proposal in a recent address to the European Parliament Fisheries Committee.</p>

  <p>The proposal would mean a radical shift in the way that fisheries are managed. An effort-only system might help to reduce discarding of fish, but would also require supporting technical conservation measures.</p>

  <p>In formulating its response to the European Commission&rsquo;s green paper on CFP reform the Scottish Government will consider the relative merits of different forms of fisheries management, including their likely impact on the operations of the fishing fleet and on the conservation of fish stocks.</p>

  <p>The proposal for an effort only system is part of a wide range of changes to fisheries policies within the European Commission&rsquo;s Green Paper on Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. We are discussing these matters with stakeholders in a series of bilateral meetings and wider stakeholder workshops. These discussions will help us develop a Scottish Government response to the European Commission&rsquo;s consultation on CFP reform, including the proposal for an effort-only system. The consultation closes at the end of 2009.</p>

  <p>We are working closely with the UK Government to develop a UK position. Officials have also met counterparts from the Commission and other member states to explore Green Paper proposals for the future management of EU fisheries.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is not formally monitoring the impact on any specific service or set of services provided by local authorities. The concordat and the introduction of SOAs &ndash; together with the removal of ring-fenced funding - were designed to substantially enhance local decision-making on the design, delivery and funding of all services provided by local authorities within Community Planning Partnerships.</p>

  <p>In reaching agreement with CPPs on the SOA, The Scottish Government requires evidence that local outcomes reflect an area&rsquo;s strategic priorities and that they are capable of being linked to one or more of the National Outcomes.</p>

  <p>We also offer support and advice to enable local authorities and other partners to consider the strategic priorities across the range of community care areas to inform use of resources and service redesign, in order to improve outcomes for people who use services, and their carers.</p>

  <p>We have also commissioned research on how the third sector is responding to the new opportunities and challenges arising from their new relationship with the public sector; this research was commissioned with the engagement of the third sector and public sector partners.</p>

  <p>I am keen to have as much information about this case in the public domain as possible. I met the Chairman and Chief Executive of the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission last week and continue to have productive discussions with them about the possibility of them disclosing information which they hold. Options include an Order under section 194K(1)(f) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 which would remove one of the limitations on the release of such information.

  <p>The proper place for references by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission to be dealt with is the Appeal Court. The Scottish Ministers have some powers under the Inquiries Act 2005 to establish an inquiry, but the powers of such an inquiry would be limited. As I said on 20 August, the questions to be asked and answered are beyond the jurisdiction of Scots law and the restricted remit of the Scottish Government. If a further inquiry were felt to be appropriate then it should be initiated by those with the required power and authority. The Scottish Government would be happy to fully co-operate in such an inquiry.</p>

  <p>Schools Renewables Development Officers (SRDOs) are continuing to work with Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) to ensure that the educational implications and benefits of the package of measures announced by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning on 5 January are effectively integrated into Curriculum for Excellence. For example, the SRDOs are working with individual authorities and schools on twinning exercises between schools in order to expand pupils&rsquo; knowledge outwith their own school. Where possible, this will be supported and documented on the LTS website.</p>

  <p>The Curriculum for Excellence experience and outcomes were launched in April and will ensure that sustainable development education is integrated into all areas of the curriculum. This will support our aims of developing young people as responsible global citizens with knowledge and understanding of the world and Scotland&rsquo;s place in it and who are better able to evaluate complex environmental, scientific and technological issues.</p>

  <p>School Renewables Development Officers have helped a number of local authorities process applications for funding from the <strong>Low Carbon Buildings Programme, which has recently been extended to 2011, </strong> for renewable generation in schools. Authorities can also apply for funding from the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme, which can provide funding towards the eligible capital costs of installing renewable energy generation plant both in schools and in other buildings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is not formally monitoring the effects of the introduction of single outcome agreements (SOAs) on specific services provided by local authorities as part of local partnerships.</p>

  <p>We are confident that the effects of the concordat and SOAs will have a positive impact on mental health services, and work being undertaken on social care mental health benchmarking will give a clearer benchmark and more comparative information.</p>

  <p>The concordat and SOAs deliberately enhanced and greatly liberated local decision-making reflecting local knowledge of needs, priorities and demographics. SOAs set out strategic priorities for local areas - including tackling health inequalities; it is for each Community Planning Partnership (CPPs) to derive its local outcomes which should be drawn from an integrated profile of the social, economic and environmental conditions of the area concerned. In reaching agreement with CPPs on the SOA, we look for evidence that local outcomes reflect an area&rsquo;s strategic priorities and that they are capable of being linked to one or more of the National Outcomes.</p>

  <p>We also offer support and advice to enable local authorities and other partners to consider the strategic priorities across the range of community care areas to inform use of resources and service redesign, in order to improve outcomes for people who use services, and their carers.</p>

  <p>We have also commissioned research on how the third sector is responding to the new opportunities and challenges arising from their new relationship with the public sector; this research was commissioned with the engagement of the third sector and public sector partners.</p>

  <p>There were 125 applicants for the 2008-09 preference waiver payment scheme in the primary sector and 182 in the secondary sector.</p>

  <p>Information is not held centrally about the local authority area in which each applicant lives.
