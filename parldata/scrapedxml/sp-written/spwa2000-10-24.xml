  <p>The Executive will be happy to provide, so far as possible, whatever help the research team may seek.</p>

  <p>The study will not provide information on the number of children under the age of 10 who have been diagnosed with autism since 1980.</p>

  <p>The researchers will, however, study whether autistic children have a history of other conditions or medical problems, for example, problems during birth. They will examine whether viral infections in the womb or soon after birth appear to play a role in producing autism. Representative samples of health records will be drawn from over two million people registered with 300 general practices across the UK. The research is a case-controlled study comparing matched samples of autistic and non-autistic children and will consider causal factors rather than incidence.</p>

  <p>Cancer is one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland. We have pledged to tackle the root causes of ill health and work over the next 10 years to promote healthier living and reduce the incidence of cancer by 20% in the under 75&#8217;s. Our strategy is set out in <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> and in <i>The Programme for</i> <i>Government</i> .</p>

  <p>We have made clear our continuing commitment to the Scottish breast and cervical screening programmes, a pilot programme of colorectal screening, the introduction of Managed Clinical Networks underpinned by robust programmes of audit and quality assurance, the development and monitoring of standards through the Clinical Standards Board and the establishment of one-stop clinics to reduce waiting times for cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p>

  <p>I am determined to face the challenges posed by cancer and in August I announced a &pound;16 million capital investment programme for imaging equipment to provide faster, better diagnosis and faster, better treatment for people with cancer.</p>

  <p>The draft standards drawn up by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland are currently being reviewed following recent pilot visits to a number of NHS Trust throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>In undertaking its accreditation assessments of services against the agreed standards, CSBS relies on sources of evidence clearly set out in the published standards themselves. Responsibility for such evidence rests in the main with NHS Trusts who are not only expected to be able to provide evidence of the standards to CSBS but also to continuously self assess their services against the standards.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s programme designed to improve the health of Scots and specifically to reduce cancer morbidity in the under 75&#8217;s by one fifth in the next ten years is set out in the White Paper <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> . A broad raft of initiatives designed to tackle deprivation and social justice is already underway.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cancer Group has also provided &pound;50,000 for specific research projects, one on deprivation and cancer being conducted by the University of Glasgow Department of Public Health Medicine and one by the University of Edinburgh looking at the link between ethnicity, smoking and cancer.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the New Opportunities Fund Healthy Living Centre initiative is also investing &pound;34.5 million in three centres across Scotland aimed at tackling health inequalities of those who live in Scotland&#8217;s most disadvantaged areas.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office cancer programme currently provides funding for 12 cancer projects at a total cost of &pound;1,520,651, the results of which are expected to provide further insight into cancer in general and therefore likely to be of benefit in cancer aetiology as well as cancer care.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-10-24.S1W-10168.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80172" speakername="Mr John Home Robertson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1024.htm#10168">

  <p>The climate change levy aims to encourage energy efficiency by all industries to help meet the UK&#8217;s target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The direct financial impact of the levy on the forestry industry has not been assessed because information on energy consumption by the industry is not held centrally. However, some sectors of the industry that are classed as energy intensive have either agreed energy efficiency targets which enable them to obtain an 80% discount on the levy, or are still negotiating to agree such targets. All sectors will be eligible to apply for enhanced capital allowances on energy saving investments.</p>

  <p>Whilst the UK&#8217;s priority is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the activities of the forestry industry do, of course, create an important carbon sink through the sequestration of carbon by trees and its storage in wood products.</p>

  <p>The Creative Industries Cluster Plan, developed by Scottish Enterprise in conjunction with the sector, identifies key strategic objectives which will be developed over the next three to five years. It also anticipates the timescales and resources which will be required to meet these objectives.</p>

  <p>One of these key strategic objectives is the enhancement and development of the skills and talent base. Scottish Enterprise is now working with educationalists and skills training providers to identify key projects which sit within the framework of that overall objective. This is an area which is seen as a sustainable medium to long-term intervention on the part of SE and its cluster partners. The initial research carried out with the industries and educationalists and skills providers identified the provision of opportunities to learn from peers both in the UK and overseas as a priority. Any projects developed in the skill/training field will be put forward for approval in the context of SE&#8217;s annual planning cycle.</p>

  <p>In relation to commercialisation funding, the Creative Industries Cluster is eligible to apply for assistance to the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Proof of Concept fund, which has been established to facilitate the commercialisation of innovative ideas. Scottish Enterprise will also, within the cluster context, seek to build relationships between innovators and the private sector as appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency advises Ministers in relation to Scottish Regulations safeguarding the food chain, including the requirement to remove the spinal cord in sheep as Specified Risk Material.</p>

  <p>Policy on housing benefit is a reserved matter which is the responsibility of DSS.</p>

  <p>CoSLA wrote to the DSS in April about the implications for a possible stock transfer in Glasgow of the requirement, in certain circumstances, to refer rent increases to the Rent Officer. DSS explained that, as rent levels before and after stock transfer would most likely remain below that of relevant property in the private rented sector, it is very unlikely that tenants would be disadvantaged.</p>

  <p>The following tables give the information requested for UK graduates (Table 1) and Scottish graduates (Table 2). The information has been provided by the Medical Careers Research Group (MCRG) at the University of Oxford. MCRG ask all those who graduate from UK medical schools about their employment history, providing a long-term picture of medical careers. They do not survey graduates every year. The most recent four years for which data are available are the graduates of 1996, 1993, 1988 and 1983.</p>

  <p>State of the art linear accelerators and treatment planning computers for the delivery of radiotherapy in Scotland&#8217;s five cancer centres are being provided through a phased programme, agreed in consultation with Cancer Centre Directors. &pound;13.2 million from the Executive&#8217;s modernisation fund has been provided to fund this strategic programme.</p>

  <p>In June this year, I announced the first round of equipment purchases totalling &pound;5.8 million. This includes additional equipment for the Beatson Oncology Centre at the Western Infirmary.</p>

  <p>Additionally as a result of a separate procurement exercise the Beatson Oncology Centre will shortly begin the commissioning phase of a further three linear accelerators costing &pound;2.2 million, to be sited in specialised buildings at Gartnavel Hospital. The total cost of this project is almost &pound;10 million.</p>
