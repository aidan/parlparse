  <p>We are currently consulting on draft regulations and orders which should be laid before the Parliament later this year. These are required to implement the remainder of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 and, in particular, the pre-emptive right to buy for eligible tenants and general partners within a limited partnership that is the tenant.</p>

  <p>This secondary legislation covers a number of detailed but important issues &ndash; such as how farms are to be valued where more than one tenant on an estate wishes to exercise a right to buy, and how the right to buy should apply to general partners where the tenant is a limited partnership &ndash; which required careful consideration with key stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Subject to the will of Parliament I hope to be able to bring part 2 of the act into force towards the turn of the year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive actively supports the international promotion of Scottish arts and culture, working through its cultural non-departmental public bodies. In 2003, significant financial support was given to help showcase Scotland&rsquo;s living cultural traditions in a major programme within the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, and the Executive also contributed funding to the first independent presentation of Scotland&rsquo;s contemporary visual arts, <em>Zenomap</em> , at the Venice Biennale. In partnership with the Lighthouse Scottish Architecture has been promoted abroad at a number of international events, including Venice&rsquo;s Architecture Biennale. The successful &quot;Scotland In&quot; events, along with a rolling programme of international promotions undertaken by the Executive with a range of partners, serve to showcase the uniqueness and high quality of this country&rsquo;s cultural output. Where our co-operation agreements include cultural objectives, they provide a framework for exchanging good practice and encouraging international partnerships. Recognising the importance of this area and building upon successful joint initiatives, the Scottish Arts Council and The British Council Scotland have recently appointed a Head of International Art who will deliver a strategy for promoting Scotland&rsquo;s arts abroad.</p>

  <p>Education authorities have to operate within the legislative framework of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc. Act 2000.</p>

  <p>The 1980 act requires them to secure adequate and efficient provision of school education for their area and this includes provision for special educational needs. In fulfilling that duty, it has been prescribed that schools must be open for at least 190 days. The 2000 act gives every school age child the right to be provided with school education and that education provided to a child or young person must be directed towards developing the child to their fullest potential.</p>

  <p>There is no specific requirement in the framework to provide year-round education. It is for local authorities to determine how they discharge their statutory responsibilities and, in particular, the nature, extent and timing of the provision they make for the special educational needs of an individual child.</p>

  <p>The Children (Scotland) Act 1995, The Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc. Act 2000 are all part of the legislative framework that a local authority has to operate within.</p>

  <p>The 1995 act places duties upon the local authority with respect to children who are in need. The 1980 act places duties upon the local authority as education authority with respect to children in their area who have pronounced, specific or complex special educational needs and who require continuing review and to open and maintain a record of needs.</p>

  <p>The way the different acts interplay and apply to individual children will depend upon the facts and circumstances of that child. However, statutory guidance on the 1995 act expects that whenever a range of services are provided by the local authority that there is co-ordination and communication between the service providers.</p>

This will take place over 2005-06 with some preliminary work starting later this year. It is a matter for the professional judgement of HMIE to determine how they conduct inspections.

  <p>Assessments for special educational needs carried out by educational psychologists are based on the needs of the child. The <em>Manual of Good Practice</em> for all staff and professionals involved with children and young people with special educational needs; <em>Effective Provision for Special Educational Needs (EPSEN); Circular 4/96: Children and Young People with SEN - Assessment and Recording; </em> and <em> The Parents&rsquo; Guide to Special Educational Needs </em> all provide guidelines and information on assessment for such needs.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for local authorities to determine that assessments for special educational needs are carried out appropriately.

  <p>In the later stages of secondary education, arrangements documents for National Qualifications courses in English emphasise the need to develop oral communication skills through, for example, presenting information and opinions and discussion of issues and texts.</p>

  <p>Debating is one of a number of ways of providing such opportunities. Ultimately, it is for local authorities and schools to decide on how to best meet the needs of their pupils.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to question S2W-10843 answered on 4 October 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search" target="_blank">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/search_wa</a> .</p>

  <p>If a parent believes that an education authority is failing to discharge any of its duties under education legislation then they can make a complaint to Scottish ministers in terms of section 70 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. If Scottish ministers are satisfied that the education authority has failed to discharge any statutory duty relating to education then they may make an order declaring them to be in default in respect of that duty and requiring them, before a date stated in the order, to discharge that duty.</p>

  <p>If there is an allegation of negligent performance of any duties, whether common law or statutory, then recourse would be through the courts.</p>

  <p>This information is not currently available. Arrangements are in place with the Executive&rsquo;s delivery partners to collect management information on the Educational Maintenance Allowance (EMA) national rollout. Provisional information on the number of students in each local authority area in receipt of EMA payments between August 2004 and January 2005 will be available in the spring of 2005. More complete information on the numbers of EMA recipients, amounts paid in both weekly payments and bonus payments as well as characteristics of EMA students will be published for the full academic year 2004-05 in the autumn of 2005.

  <p>1. Sourced from the Medical and Dental Workforce Census and the GMC register.</p>

  <p>2. Information is not available on the number of doctors successfully completing PRHO posts.</p>

  <p>3. Although St Andrews University offers medical courses, these provide pre-clinical qualifications only. The clinical component of medical courses undertaken by students at St Andrews is taken at the University of Manchester. For this reason St Andrews is not included in the table.</p>

  <p>Information is only available on those doctors who continue to work within NHSScotland. There are a number of different reasons for leaving between PRHO and SHO posts including career breaks, maternity leave, and taking up posts outwith Scotland either within the United Kingdom or overseas.</p>

  <p>The introduction of Foundation Programmes in August 2005 under <em>Modernising Medical Careers</em> should offer the opportunity to improve the quality of training and retention of doctors in training.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. These statistics are derived from data collected on discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals (SMR01) in Scotland.</p>

  <p>2. The linked data set required for this analysis contain linked SMR01 and Registrar General's death records. All patient records including deaths for each patient are linked together using &quot;probability matching&quot;. The &quot;probability matching&quot; algorithm uses all available identifying information (name, date of birth, postcode, hospital patient reference number etc.) to link the records.</p>

  <p>3. Up to six diagnoses (one principal, five secondary) are recorded on the SMR01 and up to four diagnosis (one principal, three secondary) are recorded on RG death records. All diagnostic positions were used for this analysis. The following codes were used from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) to define whooping cough:</p>

  <p>ICD9 033</p>

  <p>ICD10 A37</p>

  <p>4. In this analysis, a baby is defined as any patient under the age of 12 months.</p>

  <p>5. Death figures relate to the number of babies hospitalised for whooping cough who subsequently died as a result of this condition.</p>

  <p>6. Data for the calendar year 2003 are considered to be provisional.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to commemorate the inauguration of King Robert I. However, I would wish to consider this significant anniversary in the context of those planned for 2005 and 2007. We are currently working with a range of partners including Stirling Council, VisitScotland and Historic Scotland etc to develop an appropriate programme of events to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the death of William Wallace which will fall in August 2005. We are also looking to replicate the scale and type of events for the Union of the Crowns Anniversary in 2003 for the Union of the Parliaments Anniversary which will fall in 2007.</p>

  <p>Ministers will decide shortly on the actual launch date for the new Individual Learning Account scheme, (ILA Scotland).</p>

  <p>Following a nationwide series of information seminars for learning providers held in May, over one hundred learning providers have applied to become registered ILA Scotland providers, of which the majority have now been approved. A number of courses have been accepted as ILA Scotland &quot;eligible learning&quot;.</p>

  <p>In deciding on the appropriate timing for launching ILA Scotland, ministers will consider a number of factors, including readiness of the systems and processes for delivering the scheme, ensuring that there is a good range of courses on offer to potential ILA-funded learners, and being satisfied that the providers and intermediary bodies who will be crucial to the success of the scheme are well-prepared, so that the scheme is as effective as possible for its target audience.</p>

  <p>13% of all cases received by procurators fiscal were marked &quot;no proceedings&quot; between April 2003 and March 2004. 64% of the cases marked &quot;no proceedings&quot; were marked in this way because:</p>

  <p>there was insufficient admissible evidence (24% of the cases marked &quot;no proceedings&quot;);</p>

  <p>the suspected offence was trivial (27% of the cases marked &quot;no proceedings&quot;), or</p>

  <p>there was a delay in reporting the case by the police or other reporting agency (14% of the cases marked &quot;no proceedings&quot;).</p>

  <p>Twenty procurator fiscal&rsquo;s offices marked more than 13% of their cases &quot;no proceedings&quot; during this time. In total, these offices marked 18% of cases &quot;no proceedings&quot;. 61% of the cases marked &quot;no proceedings&quot; were marked in this way because:</p>

  <p>there was insufficient admissible evidence (24% of the cases marked &quot;no proceedings&quot;);</p>

  <p>the suspected offence was trivial (25% of the cases marked &quot;no proceedings&quot;), or</p>

  <p>there was a delay in reporting the cases by the police or other reporting agency (12% of the cases marked &quot;no proceedings&quot;).</p>

  <p>These figures show that the 20 procurator fiscal&rsquo;s offices were applying the same consistent marking standards to cases as other offices. Any variations in the number of cases marked &quot;no proceedings&quot; reflect the variation in the pattern of offending in different parts of the country and differences in the way in which police forces report very minor offences.</p>

  <p>There is continuing and very close co-operation between Area Procurators Fiscal and Chief Constables to ensure that very minor offences or unsuitable cases are not reported unnecessarily.</p>

  <p>Under European Union legislation on freedom of movement, doctors, dentists, nurses responsible for general care, pharmacists and midwives who are European Economic Association (EEA) nationals are entitled to automatic recognition. The freedom of movement laws prevent health regulatory bodies (for example, the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council) from language testing EEA nationals. However, employers are responsible for ensuring that the staff they employ have the competence and linguistic ability to carry out their duties of care.</p>

  <p>Any doctor undertaking work in Scotland, or the rest of the United Kingdom, must be registered with the General Medical Council. Information on registration and employment requirements is made available to interested doctors from the EU. It is an essential component of the recruitment process by NHS Scotland boards to ensure that EU doctors have a full and complete induction process which would embrace NHS protocols and administrative requirements. The Scottish Executive is currently reviewing procedures for recruiting doctors from the EU and will be advising NHS Scotland accordingly. Various initiatives being undertaken under our fresh talent policy to encourage people from outside Scotland to come here to live, work and study, such as our Relocation Advisory Service to be launched in October, could potentially help doctors from other EU countries interested in moving to Scotland.</p>

  <p>Using estimated average energy requirements the DRV can be converted to grams of total fat per day. For example, for a four to six-year-old girl, with an average energy requirement of 6.46MJ/day this equates to 58g total fat per day.

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s Diversity Strategy, launched in November 2000, set demanding targets for the recruitment of under-represented groups, including staff from a minority ethnic background. Progress towards these targets is set out in the table.</p>

  <p>The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) repealed parts of the Disabled Persons (employment) Act (NI) 1945. This means that there is no longer a register of disabled people.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive asks applicants to self-declare whether they have a disability and this information is recorded. The table below sets out the number of applicants applying for vacancies in the Scottish Executive since 1999 who have self-declared a disability, broken down by grade and also expressed as a percentage of the total number of applicants.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>An evaluation of the STOP programme, which was accredited by a Panel of independent experts in September 2001, is currently being undertaken by Analytical Services of the Scottish Prison Service. The results will be available in 2005 and will be published as part of the SPS <em>Occasional Paper</em> <em>Series</em>, copies of which are lodged in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working closely with employers, the Scottish Social Services Council and others to ensure we have a competent and confident workforce.</p>

  <p>A fast track scheme has been introduced which will enable 450 non-social work graduates to be qualified in less than two years, half the time it usually takes to complete a social work degree.</p>

  <p>&pound;3 million has been made available over three financial years to voluntary organisations which offer care services to train their staff. An additional &pound;9 million has also been made available over three financial years to local authorities for additional investment in training.</p>
