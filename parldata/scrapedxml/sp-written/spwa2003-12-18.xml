  <p>The Executive is committed to tackling child poverty and is making progress in doing so.</p>

  <p>The best route out of poverty is through work. The Executive will continue to invest in policies that support employment opportunity for all and increase household income through programmes like education maintenance allowances, which will be rolled out nationally from 2004-05, Modern Apprenticeships and Training for Work.</p>

  <p>I recently announced the allocations of the &#163;20 million Working for Families Fund, which will help those in the most disadvantaged areas by providing affordable, flexible child care to enable parents to enter training or employment.</p>

  <p>There are other examples of Executive initiatives which help tackle child poverty. For example, funding for Sure Start Scotland, which supports vulnerable children and families throughout Scotland, has been significantly increased and will rise to &#163;50 million in 2006.</p>

  <p>A decision on the future accommodation requirements of VisitScotland has now been reached. Following an extensive option appraisal of the 10 potential areas shortlisted as possible locations for the VisitScotland headquarters office, the majority of VisitScotland posts will move to a new location within the Edinburgh area.</p>

  <p>Ministers are agreed that any other decision would be too disruptive given the major restructuring which has taken place at VisitScotland and the need to maintain the momentum of recovery from the difficulties of 2001.</p>

  <p>However some functions of VisitScotland currently based in Edinburgh will be identified for relocation in due course, following the forthcoming report of the ad hoc ministerial group on tourism. VisitScotland will also work within the job academy arrangements being developed by Edinburgh City Council and Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothians for getting people who are economically inactive back into the labour market.</p>

  <p>Scottish development international (SDI) is charged with attracting inward investment projects to Scotland. SDI is pursuing a number of major inward investment projects including several in the online services sector. Due to considerations of commercial confidentiality, it is normal procedure neither to confirm nor deny whether talks are under way with any specific company about inward investment location decisions.</p>

  <p>Premature disclosure of company plans for new operations before location decisions are finalised can lead to loss of competitive advantage, and for publicly quoted companies there are often regulatory issues to be considered in advance of making announcements of significant changes to operations.</p>

  <p>However, I can confirm that Amazon is clearly recognised as a major e-business player and has been the subject of selling efforts by SDI and its predecessor body for several years.</p>

  <p>The percentage of Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s budget spent on management and administration was 18.8% in 2000-01, 17.3% in 2001-02 and 30.3% in 2002-03. The increase in 2002-03 was due to the integration of Careers Scotland into the enterprise networks and the costs associated with provision of its services.</p>

  <p>For 2003-04, the estimated expenditure for management and administration is &#163;83 million, as stated in Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s operating plan for this year, but excluding the costs of Careers Scotland, which are estimated at &#163;43 million. The figure of &#163;43 million includes expenditure previously classified as programme expenditure, since it is now recognised that Careers Scotland activity is for the most part, staff based.</p>

  <p>For 2004-05 and 2005-06, the administration budget figures are &#163;92 million in each year, as contained in the Scottish Executive publication <em>Draft Budget 2004-05</em>. These figures are provisional until firmed up as part of Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s operating plan process for each of the year&#8217;s concerned. They again exclude the costs of Careers Scotland. However, budget publications next year will see the estimates for Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s administration budget adjusted to include Careers Scotland costs.</p>

  <p>It should also be remembered that in addition to Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s administration budget including core and support staff costs for the entire network, it also includes costs of permanent staff employed in delivering business activity.</p>

  <p>Negotiations in the intergovernmental conference (IGC) were a matter for the UK Government. The Scottish Executive, however, worked closely with the UK Government from the outset of the Convention on the Future of Europe and throughout the IGC to ensure that Scottish interests were taken into account. Scottish Executive ministers and officials raised Scottish interests in writing and at meetings with the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive in particular sought to ensure that the draft treaty language on the principle of subsidiarity and the role of regional governments was supported throughout the IGC. In addition, in the case of proposals to extend qualified majority voting or to extend competences of the EU, the Scottish Executive worked to ensure that any proposed changes to current procedures were in the best interests of the Scottish people. The Scottish Executive also contributed to the UK white paper on the British Government&#8217;s Approach to the IGC.</p>

  <p>Regional selective assistance (RSA) is a demand-led scheme rather than planned expenditure. Demand is generally determined by prevailing economic conditions and by the progress made by individual firms in implementing grant-assisted projects. The RSA budget is based on forecast expenditure arising both from existing commitments and the expected future flow of new investment projects.</p>

  <p>The law already allows for offenders to be given time to pay, for payment by instalments, for deductions from benefits and for civil diligence, as ways of encouraging payment and enforcing payment of fines.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive has made supervised attendance orders (SAOs) available to courts across Scotland to deal with fine defaulters. These disposals offer a credible alternative to custody for fine defaulters.</p>

  <p>Two pilots are under development to explore an extension to the use of SAOs. The first will prescribe pilot courts to order an SAO as the appropriate disposal in cases of fine default, effectively removing from the court the option of imposing a custodial sentence. The second will empower certain courts to impose SAOs as a disposal of first instance (i.e. instead of a fine) where the court considers that the offender is unlikely to be able to pay a fine.</p>

  <p>The Review of Summary Justice has considered fines and their enforcement as part of its wider consideration of the operation of the summary criminal justice system.</p>

Cases are regularly brought before the courts and are charged as indecent assault and sodomy, such charges emphasising the non-consensual nature of the offence. As with the crime of common law rape of a woman, a case heard in the High Court with a male victim can attract a term of life imprisonment.</p>

  <p>There are numerous variables that can affect travel time, such as transport links, population density, weather and rurality. These factors will affect different parts of Scotland, in different ways, at different times and as such the setting of maximum times and distance is not appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Executive, in line with the recommendations of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services, recognises that it is more important to plan in advance where a woman should deliver. This will take into account previous and current pregnancy, medical history, locally available services, likely outcomes and transport arrangements, including travel time to a specialist unit. This assessment would continue throughout a woman&#8217;s labour.</p>

  <p>Improved ante-natal identification of potential abnormalities in a baby and the effective use of the risk criteria means that transfers can be planned and emergency transports minimised.</p>

There is also a three-year newborn hearing screening pilot in Highland and Western Isles NHS boards which is due to be completed in March 2004. The remaining boards are in the process of developing business cases and taking forward the arrangements to support the introduction of newborn hearing screening, which is expected to be in place by April 2005.

  <p>It is standard practice within the Scottish Executive to consult interested parties on major policy initiatives and our consultation papers appear on the Executive website. We do not, however, generally seek views on individual documents.</p>

  <p>Using experienced production houses, the Executive makes every effort to ensure that its publications are designed to take full account of their intended readership. Our aim is to make documents as user friendly as possible in terms of style, readability and accessibility. We subscribe to the Plain English Campaign and we try to ensure that, where appropriate, documents are available in a variety of formats, such as large print, braille and audio, and minority languages.</p>

  <p>Boosting tourism in the Borders is a matter for VisitScotland and the Scottish Borders Tourist Board. They have developed a range of initiatives aimed at increasing the volume and value of tourism to the Borders area. There is clear evidence that tourism in the Borders area has increased as a result of the initiatives and strategies that have been put in place. In 2002 there were 560,000 visits made to the area with a value of &#163;91 million; this compares with 440,000 and &#163;49 million respectively in 1999.</p>
