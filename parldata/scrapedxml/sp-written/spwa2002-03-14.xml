  <p>The Future Office System (FOS) is intended to enable case marking and summary processing work to be carried out almost entirely electronically. The software programmes will permit standardisation of procedures, thereby increasing consistency, reducing the potential for errors and producing high quality case documentation. FOS should provide better management information, faster processing of initial court documentation, speedier notification of decisions to our criminal justice partners and reductions in administrative effort.</p>

  <p>I am able to announce today that the Scottish Executive has approved the release of a GM oilseed rape crop at a further three sites in Scotland this spring. Releases of this crop have only been permitted because of the explicit advice of our expert advisory bodies that the crop can be grown on these sites in safety, both for the people living near the trial sites and for the wider environment. If there was any evidence to suggest that the crop posed a threat to human health or the environment, I would not be prepared to permit the releases on these sites.</p>

  <p>The three sites (two in Aberdeenshire and one in Fife) will join 12 other Scottish sites which have grown GM oilseed rape as part of the farm scale evaluation programme, although the crop has been grown for research purposes in the UK for a decade. This is the third and final year of plantings under the evaluation programme, after which the results will be evaluated and will help inform decisions on whether these crops have a commercial future in this country. The agreement which the Executive has with the industry to permit these trials to take place means that there will be no commercial growing of GM in this country at least until the trials are completed.</p>

  <p>Our published target for renewable energy is 18% by 2010. But in the light of the recommendation of the recent PIU report on energy policy that the UK should adopt a target of 20% by 2020, we intend to consider how we might work towards a figure of 30% in Scotland by 2020. Any revision to our target would be made only after a full process of consultation with all interested parties on the many issues that a higher target would raise.</p>
