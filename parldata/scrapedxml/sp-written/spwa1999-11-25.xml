  <p>Printed information material is regularly made available in minority languages, Braille, large print and audiotape. The most recent was the Social Justice Strategy published on 22 November. The availability of minority languages and other formats is publicised on the cover of the English version. Wider publicity for consultation documents is generally generated through ministerial media launches rather than through paid publicity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive adheres to the Disability Discrimination Act Code of Practice and all our material is printed in a minimum of 12 point. All consultation and strategy publications are placed on the Scottish Executive web site as a matter of course. Departments are also advised to consider other ways of consulting with ethnic groups such as through face-to-face discussions.</p>

  <p>In response to a question yesterday, I made available to Parliament the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Carers&#8217; Strategy for Scotland, a package of measures aimed at supporting the many informal carers in our communities who look after friends or relatives who are frail, sick, disabled or vulnerable. The Strategy contains a commitment to draw up legislative proposals at an early date that will enable carers to have their needs met more directly than can be done at present. In doing so, we will ensure that carers aged under 16 will be entitled to an assessment of their care needs and will be able to receive support in their own right.</p>

  <p>The Strategy is scheduled for debate today.</p>

  <p>The erection of telecommunications masts require planning permission except where they qualify for permitted development rights under Class 67 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992.</p>

  <p>In December 1998, the then Scottish Office Planning Minister, Calum MacDonald MP, announced a number of measures on telecommunications, which included increasing the degree of control over telecommunications development permitted by the aforementioned Order. Those measures included:</p>

  <p>prior approval procedures for the siting and appearance of telecommunications masts;</p>

  <p>increased controls over telecommunications development in Sites of Special Scientific Interest;</p>

  <p>clarification that planning permission is required to extend the height of an existing mast beyond 15 metres;</p>

  <p>good practice guidance for operators and planning authorities; and</p>

  <p>advice on the use of planning agreements to encourage mast sharing.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of the Greater Glasgow Health Board Report and of public concerns about the health of communities living close to this landfill site. I understand that the report established no causal links between ill health and Paterson&#8217;s landfill. The Greater Glasgow Health Board Report may be obtained on request from the Board. The UK Government and the Scottish Executive are funding a study into possible health effects in populations living in the vicinity of landfill sites. It is anticipated that the results of this study will be available by the middle of 2000.</p>

  <p>The total increase in the Scottish Budget for 1999-2000, which I announced on 6 October was &pound;317 million. This includes the increase in provision for the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The source of the increase was the take-up of underspends from 1998-99, under the end-year flexibility arrangements, of &pound;312 million and net transfers between the Scottish Executive and other UK Departments of &pound;5 million.</p>

  <p>The figure quoted for 1998-99 is an estimated outturn figure. Actual outturn figures for 1998-99 will not be confirmed until the Appropriation Accounts for that year have been approved and published by the Comptroller and Auditor General. This normally takes place in February following the end of the financial year.</p>

  <p>In October 1998, The Scottish Office invited Government Procurement Card (GPC) service proposals from the banks included in a UK framework arrangement. The banks in question were Barclays Bank, Midland Bank, National Westminster Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank. Following rigorous evaluation, Barclays Bank was selected. Neither the Bank of Scotland nor Clydesdale Bank participated in the UK framework arrangement; I understand that this is because they do not at present provide corporate procurement card services. A subsequent pilot exercise confirmed that the service was satisfactory, and the scheme has now been made available to the entire Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Royal Edinburgh Hospital provides highly specialised care and treatment for people with a range of problems related to mental illness and learning disabilities. The replacement forensic psychiatry unit currently being developed at the hospital will continue to provide care and treatment for people with severe mental illness which has brought them into contact with the criminal justice system: the aim is to provide a better therapeutic environment for the care of these patients in a building which has appropriate physical security.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the most appropriate care for individual patients is best made by clinicians and staff involved in the treatment of the individual. The assessment and admission of patients to the facility being developed at the hospital is therefore a clinical matter. I understand, however, that the Lothian Primary Care NHS Trust consulted locally about the new unit and its role prior to its development.</p>

  <p>Whilst each of the former Tayside Trusts achieved financial balance in 1998-99, this required the utilisation of non-recurring funds to support their year-end position. Non-recurring funds were received from Tayside Health Board and from proceeds from the sale of surplus assets. By their very nature, non-recurring funds are not available in the current year, although the corresponding expenditure can be ongoing, leaving the University Trust exposed to a potential gap.</p>

  <p>The impact on Tayside University Hospitals NHS Trust of the loss of non-recurring funds is attributable to the former Trusts as follows:-</p>

</table></p>

  <p>In addition to these pressures, a shortfall in cash releasing savings during 1998-99 has contributed a further &pound;2 million to current projected difficulties. These amounts cannot be attributed to specific Trusts but rather they reflect issues with services across Tayside.</p>

  <p>The Trust and Tayside Health Board are working jointly on measures to remedy the position. In the current financial year, the Scottish Executive has committed over &pound;388 million to Tayside, 4.25% more than last year. I look to the Trust and Health Board to ensure that a financial balance is achieved over the year as a whole, and that service developments as identified in the Tayside Health Improvement Plan are delivered.</p>

  <p>We will continue to monitor the situation.</p>

  <p>Where appropriate, palliative care should be an integral part of the care patients receive in hospital. In order to ensure the highest quality of care is available, each Health Board has developed a palliative care strategy and, to date, 31 hospitals in Scotland have set up either specialist palliative care teams or palliative care support nurses.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland is currently considering how it might improve standard setting for a range of conditions, including cancer. It has embarked on a consultation process involving GPs, hospital clinicians and other professions to try to establish clear standards for care of the major cancers in Scotland. As part of that exercise, it will consider standards of palliative care.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive Health Department is encouraging the development of a Managed Clinical Network in palliative care, with particular reference to pain relief, and has also provided &pound;7,000 towards the cost of distributing over 30,000 copies of a booklet on <i>The Relief of Pain and Related Symptoms: The Role of Drug Therapy</i> produced by the Scottish Partnership Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care as an aid for general practitioners, hospital doctors and other members of the hospital care team.</p>

  <p>The Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food recognises the importance of campylobacter as a public health issue, given that it is the commonest cause of gastro-intestinal infection in the UK. The Committee also shares the general view that the main priority is further research to identify a more discriminatory typing scheme, by which is meant one yielding information of value in clinical and public health terms.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has vetoed plans to allow wheelchair access to the High Kirk of St Giles, which had previously been approved by City of Edinburgh Council and, if so, how it now proposes to address the situation of one of Scotland&#8217;s most important religious buildings having no wheelchair access.</p>

  <p>Following a public local inquiry, the Scottish Ministers accepted the Reporter&#8217;s recommendation that a planning application for wheelchair access to the High Kirk of St Giles be refused. This decision was intimated in the Scottish Executive Development Department&#8217;s letter of 10 September 1999. It is open to the applicants to come forward with acceptable alternative proposals for wheelchair access.</p>

  <p>Significantly, Disability Scotland, which aims to be the national voice of the disabled movement in Scotland, are also in favour of an alternative point of access. In their view, alternative means of providing access for disabled people, most notably at the north door, would be reasonable access and would also provide a sociably acceptable, independent point of access into the cathedral, as well as being more acceptable in planning terms.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to amend the planning system following consideration of the responses to the consultation paper <i>Land Use Planning under a Scottish Parliament</i> .</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-11-25.S1W-2768.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa1125.htm#657">

  <p>It is clear from the responses to the consultation paper on <i>Land Use Planning under a Scottish Parliament</i> that while there is no major public outcry for massive change to the main elements of the planning system, there is equally no room for complacency about the effectiveness of the system. The overwhelming conclusion I draw is that priority should be given to make the system work better than it does at present.</p>

  <p>The main criticisms are that it is too slow, too bureaucratic and too negative. Those views were aired in the responses to the consultation paper and have come from a number of other quarters in recent months. In particular, from the construction industry, the retail sector and the financial sector in the Pathfinders to Parliament report where the need for greater vision in planning and speeding up planning decisions was strongly highlighted. Some of the criticisms are justified and we need to address them.</p>

  <p>The basic components of the system are in place but they need to work more efficiently and effectively. I should make it clear that, while I do not intend to disturb the arrangements for structure and local plans, that does not mean that I will turn a deaf ear to credible alternative proposals. But they must go beyond aims and aspirations. They must command widespread support and they must be workable.</p>

  <p>We need to change the perception of planning and the performance of the system and I propose to address this. As Planning Minister I intend to play my part in ensuring that the Scottish Executive plays a full part in re-energising the planning system</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a key responsibility too. So do others, including the private sector and the key agencies who need to be more active in the process at an early stage. It seems to me that the development industry uses up too much energy opposing policies in development plans rather than constructively contributing to policy development at an early stage to ensure that policies are right first time. I urge the private sector and local authorities to work in partnership to create long-term development frameworks. It is a process in which local communities should also be fully involved. We need to work together.</p>

  <p>I want planning to be positive. I want it to be seen as a service and activity that is recognised as much for its enabling role as for its regulatory function. It needs to earn that recognition by demonstrating not just Best Value but added value.</p>

  <p>I am today announcing new measures at the annual conference of the Scottish branch of the Royal Town Planning Institute. I have placed copies of my speech in SPICe but the following is a summary of the main changes I am introducing:</p>

  <p>new arrangements for preparing National Planning Policy Guidelines (NPPGs), to ensure more openness, transparency and inclusion. As part of the new approach, we will announce our intention to prepare or revise NPPGs in advance.</p>

  <p>our immediate priority is to start by revising NPPG1 on the planning system and NPPG6 on renewable</p>

  <p>energy;</p>

  <p>action to reduce the 12 month target for Scottish Ministers to approve structure plans;</p>

  <p>the need for clearer long-term vision in structure plans;</p>

  <p>that I am looking at introducing timetables for local and structure plan preparation etc;</p>

  <p>that the focus of the Planning Audit Unit&#8217;s work with councils will move to development planning;</p>

  <p>the production, jointly with COSLA, of a training manual and code of conduct for councillors; and</p>

  <p>our intention to prepare an &quot;easy read&quot; guide to the planning system.</p>

  <p>I believe that these measures when taken together will, over time, help to make the system work better. I look to others, however, to play their part as well. I will be keeping a close eye on developments and will act if I do not see appropriate improvements.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will list all Scottish legislation and UK legislation as it effects Scotland, both primary and secondary, which has already been amended or will require amendment as a result of the coming into force of the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order (SI 1999/1126); when such amendments, if any, were made and when it proposes to make any future amendments, and what assessment it has made of the implications of such amendments.</p>

  <p>Some UK legislation was amended to take account of the creation by the Scotland Act 1998 of the Scottish zone of British fishery limits, the boundary of which zone is defined by the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 (SI 1999/1126). The purpose of the amendments was to ensure that certain Ministerial functions transferred to the Scottish Ministers so far as exercisable in relation to the Scottish zone and to make provision consequential on the transfer of those functions.</p>

  <p>Legislation affecting food safety, sea fishing and marine pollution have all been amended to take account of the Scottish zone. This legislation is set out in detail in two Orders: The Scotland Act 1998 (Modifications of Functions) Order 1999 (SI 1999/1756), and The Scotland Act 1998 (Consequential Modifications) (No.2) Order 1999 (SI 1999/1820).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive intends to deliver a sustainable, effective and integrated transport system. We support in principle cost-effective measures to reduce road congestion, encourage greater use of rail transport and improve inter-modal links.</p>

  <p>I understand Railtrack is currently working with Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive to assess three options for providing a rail link from Glasgow Airport to Paisley and central Glasgow.</p>

  <p>When Sarah Boyack announced the conclusions of the Strategic Roads Review, she indicated that the M74 Northern Extension would be promoted by the City of Glasgow and South Lanarkshire Councils. It is for these Councils to develop proposals for the procurement and funding of the scheme.</p>
