  <p>The chief officers of the community justice authorities (CJAs) have been represented on the project group which has been overseeing the revision of the National Objectives and Standards which provide the operational framework for criminal justice social work services, including community service orders.</p>

  <p>The CJAs, along with a range of other interested parties, were consulted in August 2008 on the final draft of the revised high level Standards, which include reference to early commencement of orders and speed of completion. The CJAs supported the revised standards.</p>

  <p>A recent debate in the Scottish Parliament called for the lowering of the drink drive limit and the introduction of powers for the police to conduct random breath testing. We have written to the UK Government in support of these measures and will continue to press for a change to the relevant legislation. We firmly believe that these measures will help to tackle the problem of drinking and driving.</p>

  <p>Currently, legislation set by the UK Government includes more severe penalties for repeat offenders and we are considering, as part of the forthcoming road safety strategy, what further actions may be appropriate for repeat drink and drug drive offenders.</p>

  <p>Primary responsibility for setting fire cover lies with Strathclyde Joint Fire Board. Under section 45 (1) of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 ministers may make a property and facilities order in circumstances where they consider it necessary for public safety purposes. Such an order may be used to give general or specific directions to a fire and rescue authority in respect of the use of property and/or facilities. Scottish ministers would only exercise their discretionary powers to intervene if it was clear that action by them was warranted in line with the statutory tests. Ministers currently have no plans to intervene in respect of Parkhead fire station.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government established a transition fund of up to &pound;2.5 million in February 2008 to help those healthy living centres at risk of closure, due to funding shortfalls as a result of the ending of their Big Lottery funding, to maintain their activities while they sought to achieve a long term sustainable future. The transition fund is administered by health boards.</p>

  <p>Recent proposals for change to the standard Housing Association Grant (HAG) assumptions and allowances used when calculating subsidy reflect the actual performance reported by associations.</p>

  <p>The effect of changes to the HAG assumptions will vary from project to project. For schemes being approved in 2008-09, the average expected impact is a reduction in grant of around &pound;10,000. Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) can meet this, in whole or in part, from borrowing or from their own resources.</p>

  <p>These changes will enable us to approve up to 500 more houses than we would have been able to under the 2007-08 assumptions.</p>

  <p>Figures provided by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) indicate that there were 610 positive or refused breath tests during the period of the recent Festive Safety Campaign. Although this represents a welcome reduction of 23% compared with the previous year, it is clear that there are still those who are ignoring messages about drinking and driving. The figures for the recent campaign reinforce our approach which is to target drink-drive publicity particularly at male drivers, particularly those under 25 years.</p>

  <p>Scottish police forces are considering the introduction this year of new Data Enabled Breath Screening Devices, which are being provided by the UK Department for Transport (DFT). The device will provide full roadside screening which can be used as evidence in a prosecution, without the need for a further test. If accepted by ACPOS, as part of the agreement with DFT, police forces will record negative breath tests, which will provide more comprehensive information about drink-driving.</p>

  <p>The recently published Strategic Transport Projects Review has recommended 29 nationally strategic transport interventions over the next 20 years that will let us plan for the delivery of an efficient, integrated transport network fit for the 21st century.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland continually monitors the trunk road network to ensure that it is operating effectively at a local level. However, as with other parts of the network, during week day peak periods congestion can occur between the A82 and A9.</p>

  <p>Analysis within the STPR demonstrates that the A96 corridor currently carries up to 17,300 vehicles per day, whereas the A82 is only up to some 6,900 vehicles per day.</p>

  <p>Peak-time congestion is experienced on the A9, A96 and A82 routes into Inverness. During the summer, tourist traffic also results in increases in congestion.</p>

  <p>In addition to the higher levels of existing traffic, the recommended link between the A9 and A96 within the STPR recognises the significant expansion proposals to the east of the city.</p>

  <p>Charging policies for residential care are provided for in legislation. The Scottish Government publishes annual guidance for local authorities, the <em>Charging for Residential Accommodation Guidance</em> , which clearly sets out how local authorities should treat assets, capital and income when undertaking a financial assessment for the purposes of calculating charges.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to decide their charging policies for non-residential care, in keeping with local accountability. COSLA issued updated guidance on charging for non-residential care in January 2006, with the aim of promoting more consistent approaches across local authorities, and recently established a review group to look at the effectiveness of the guidance. The Scottish Government is represented on the review group.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has a range of measures in place to ensure that information on charges and financial assessments is clear and accessible, including:</p>

  <p>Publishing annually the <em>Charging for Residential Accommodation Guidance</em>. As well as setting out the charging rules, this guidance says that local authorities must ensure that the resident is given a clear explanation of how the assessment of ability to pay has been carried out;</p>

  <p>Publishing the <em>Thinking about Moving into a Care Home</em> booklet, which includes details of how a financial assessment is carried out, and</p>

  <p>Setting National Care Standards that require care services to provide information on charges and what they cover.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also in the process of establishing Care Information Scotland. That will bring together in one place all the information about community care for older people, including information on charges and financial assessment. The information service will consist of a website and helpline and will go live later this year.</p>

  <p>We have costed how much it would cost to extend YSB to independent students and this is set out in the consultation paper as option 1b. The consultation paper does not consider the option of extending the Young Student&rsquo;s Bursary scheme to (a) independent young students and (b) mature students using the scheme&rsquo;s current income thresholds. As a result, no costings have been prepared. These would be prepared in due course if the Scottish Government decided to examine those options in more detail, based on the responses we receive to the consultation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-19181 by Fiona Hyslop on 15 January 2009, whether the recent decision to uprate student loans by 2.6% to maintain their real-terms value required negotiations with HM Treasury due to the budgetary implications; if so, what discussions took place and what the outcomes were, and, if not, for what reasons discussions were not considered to be required.</p>

  <p>No negotiations with HM Treasury were required in the recent decision to uprate student loans by 2.6%. This is because the uprating figure of 2.6% is based on the Treasury&rsquo;s mid-May forecasts of the rise in RPI-x during the calendar years 2009 and 2010. These figures are published in the Treasury document: <em>Forecasts for the UK economy &ndash; A Comparison of Independent Forecasts</em> , which is available at <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/200805forcomp.pdf" target="_blank">www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/200805forcomp.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3O-5488 by Nicola Sturgeon on 15 January 2009, what changes to the VAT rules other than the reduction of the standard rate will affect NHS Grampian.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-01-26.S3W-19881.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0126.htm#18">

  <p>In common with all of NHSScotland, NHS Grampian will be affected by changes to be made to the rules by which NHS bodies can reclaim VAT charged in respect of agency staff working within NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>The rules were previously changed for 2008-09 to remove the ability for NHS bodies to reclaim VAT on agency fees for medical staff. This is being further restricted in that NHS bodies will no longer be able to reclaim VAT on any other agency staff except for nursing from 2009-10. These restrictions may have a more significant impact with the additional change in respect of the removal from 1 April 2009 of a concession granted by HMRC that currently allows employment businesses to exclude the wages element from the calculation of VAT on the charges they make.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what sanctions will apply if it does not incorporate the EU waste framework directive of 20 October 2008 into national legislation within two years of its publication.</p>

  <p>Immediately, none. In order to apply sanctions the European Commission would have to obtain first a judgment from the European Court of Justice in Article 226 proceedings that the revised Waste Framework Directive had not been properly applied in Scots law, and only subsequently obtain a judgment in Article 228 proceedings that a financial penalty should be applied.</p>

  <p>The penalty the European Court of Justice may apply at the conclusion of Article 228 proceedings is, within various parameters, a matter for that Court, but may consist of either a lump sum or a daily fine until compliance is achieved, or both.</p>
