  <p>In April 2008, the Scottish Government and COSLA made a joint commitment to community empowerment, which culminated in the launch of the Community Empowerment Action Plan earlier this year.</p>

  <p>A Scottish Government Community Council Working Group (CCWG) was invited to identify expanded roles and responsibilities for community councils. They found that many, in discussion and agreement with their local authority, already undertook a variety of roles and responsibilities, including directing a portion of local spend, for example - arranging minor repairs of certain local authority amenities, control of common good funds and community hall management/maintenance. However, in order for this to be more widespread, the capacity of community councils would require strengthening.</p>

  <p>As part of their remit, and to address the development of capacity, the CCWG produced a <em>Model Scheme of Establishment of Community Councils </em>and <em>Code of Conduct for Community Councillors</em>. Adoption of these documents is key to the building of capacity as they will help to establish greater consistency of operational arrangements and a culture of accountability.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also funding a series of Community Council Pilot Projects. In partnership with COSLA and the Association of Scottish Community Councils (ASCC), we have developed to date three out of six and another three are in train. The pilots will focus on budget management, potential asset management and community council elections.</p>

  <p>Along with our key partners therefore, we are continuing to raise the profile and effectiveness of community councils throughout Scotland to enable them to build their capacity and to allow them to engage as key participants in local decision making and delivery.</p>

  <p>The First Minister&rsquo;s quote referred to &quot;short-selling spivs and speculators&quot;. From July through to September 2008, short-selling on HBOS shares was taking place at a higher than normal volume. It was also clear that this practice was giving rise to disorderly markets and the fact that regulators across the world took action to prevent further abuse at that time is evidence of this. For example, in the UK, the Financial Services Authority introduced a ban on short-selling shares in financial institutions on the 18 September 2008, with other countries following suit shortly afterwards.</p>

  <p>It is the view of the Scottish Government that the report does not seek to establish a new quango, with all its associated costs.</p>

  <p>Instead, we are committed to reviewing the range of existing activities within the Scottish Government and its partners to improve the safety of those most at risk. We will also look to move forward work already started on a more effective multi-agency approach to fire safety.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following the flooding in the north east on 1 November 2009, whether it shares the concerns expressed by the Fire Brigades Union in a press release on 2 November 2009 that firefighters were working waist deep in water without the specialist training required to undertake that task safely.</p>

  <p>All fire and rescue services have a statutory duty to respond to major flooding incidents and the Scottish Government has made over &pound;1.3 million of funding available to support the purchase of related equipment and training. The Scottish Government would therefore be concerned if any firefighter was asked to perform a role without the right training.</p>

  <p>While the provision of training and resourcing is primarily the responsibility of each fire and rescue service, additional support and guidance is also provided by the Scottish Fire Services College and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Advisory Unit.</p>

  <p>In this instance, we encourage the Fire Brigades Union to present their evidence directly to the relevant fire and rescue service, with a view to reaching resolution at a local level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Gaelic language plan was approved in principal by B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig on the 25 August. The b&ograve;rd have asked for some clarity on a few points and work is ongoing to address these issues. During the consultation period on the draft plan a total of 48 responses were received. These were, in the main, greatly supportive of the work that was being undertaken by the Scottish Government and other public bodies on behalf of Gaelic. These respondents were pleased with the lay-out, contents and the general level of commitment expressed across the main areas of the Gaelic plan relating to corporate identity, communications, publications and staffing. All responses were analysed separately by officials from the Analysis and Evaluation Support Unit and are available at:</p>

  <p>In addition, the analysis and copies of the responses from those consultees who wished their responses to be made public are available at the Scottish Government Library, Saughton House, Broomhouse Drive, Edinburgh. There were a number of consultation suggestions accepted which strengthened the Gaelic plan, highlighted work that was ongoing across Directorates that had not been included previously and also tightened the language in parts to focus on delivery and timescales. Once the Scottish Government Gaelic language plan has been finalised and approved by B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig it will be available on our website.</p>

  <p>NHS Grampian has provided adult respiratory ECMO treatment on seven occasions over the last seven years at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.

  <p>Prior to November 2007, this treatment was only possible with the direct clinical support of the Leicester team, who either travelled up to treat patients onsite, or provided ongoing clinical support and advice from a distance.</p>

  <p>Since then, a number of staff have been trained by Leicester in the provision of adult respiratory ECMO treatment, therefore there is no longer a requirement for Leicester clinicians to provide support onsite. However, all referrals for ECMO continue to require discussion and agreement with Leicester clinicians, and any provision of ECMO treatment must be undertaken only with the ongoing clinical advice and support from Leicester throughout.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the concerns of consumers who feel disadvantaged by courier surcharges. However, given that the market for courier services is a free market and not regulated by government, there is no locus for or basis on which Scottish ministers could intervene.</p>

  <p>The issue of surcharging by couriers for deliveries in remote areas was considered by the Public Petitions Committee at the end of last year and the Scottish Government was invited to comment. The Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism replied on behalf of the Scottish Government on 5 January 2009 (PE 1211 refers).</p>

  <p>Post offices and postal services are reserved to the UK Government under Schedule 5 Section C11 of the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s position remains that we want to secure a sustainable postal service for Scotland that serves the needs of all our communities. This position is reflected in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to the Independent Review of the UK Postal Services Market:</p>

  <p>Increased support for micro-hydro is available under the renewables obligation. Since April 2009, hydro schemes with a capacity of less than 50kW now receive two Renewable Obligations Certificates (ROCs) per megawatt hour.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Scottish Rural Development Programme provides capital support to farmers to install renewable energy systems, including hydro-electric schemes. The programme also provides capital support to farmers who wish to diversify into renewable energy generation.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has also formed a micro-hydro sub-group of the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland. The sub-group met for the first time on 19 October and will work to address the opportunities and barriers facing the sector.</p>

  <p>Under the Water Framework Directive provisions, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is required to strike the right balance between supporting hydropower development and protecting the water environment and other users. As part of the implementation of the Directive, the Water Environment and Water Service (Scotland) Act 2003 introduced the Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations (CAR). These regulations require that any developer of a hydropower scheme obtain prior authorisation from SEPA for a CAR license to allow for water abstraction.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government understands the concerns of teachers who may have allegations of misconduct made against them. However, other than very limited exceptions for children and vulnerable witnesses, Scotland has an open system of court proceedings. The identity of an accused person only formally enters the public domain upon an appearance at court. Any moves to introduce further reporting restrictions would have repercussions beyond the teaching profession and would require very careful consideration.</p>
