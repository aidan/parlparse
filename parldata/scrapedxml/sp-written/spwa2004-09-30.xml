  <p>Largs main beach is not a designated bathing water under the Bathing Waters Directive (76/160/EEC) and there is no statutory requirement for it to meet the standards of that directive.</p>

  <p>Diffuse pollution and overflows from the sewage system, both resulting from the severely wet summer, contributed to the situation at Largs main this season. Enforcing compliance with discharge consents are operational matters for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>Subject to planning approval, Scottish Water is developing plans for a &pound;10.8 million project to build a new secondary level waste water treatment works and associated pipe works and storm storage capacity to cater for Largs.</p>

  <p>The Executive is funding several pilot projects on retrofitting of sustainable urban drainage, installation of ponds or wetlands on farms, co-digestion of slurry with sewage sludge to produce biogas and on farm-scale biogas or composting to help identify how diffuse pollution might be further reduced.</p>

  <p>Local authority social work departments and a range of other bodies, for instance schools and GP practices, have a key role to play in identifying young carers, and helping them to access support as children in need. In addition to our Carers Strategy, other health and social care policies are also benefiting young carers. For example, our development of a framework on child and adolescent mental health and work to support children in families affected by drug misuse. It is our intention to work with key stakeholders to look at improving the support and protection available to this particularly vulnerable group.</p>

  <p>The general law is that a spouse can be compelled to give evidence for the defence.</p>

  <p>A spouse is a compellable witness for the prosecution only where an accused spouse is charged with an offence against the other spouse. In all other circumstances, a spouse cannot be compelled to give evidence. The history of this law recognises the special nature of marriage and the public interest in respecting and sustaining the privacy of the relationship between spouses.</p>

  <p>Our proposal for a modern licensing system recognises the need for communities to have a voice.</p>

  <p>We will do this by widening the range of people who can object to individual licences; by ensuring boards must consult local communities in developing their policies on over provision, and by introducing local forums to improve dialogue between licensing boards and local communities.</p>

  <p>As far as the requirements of planning legislation are concerned, a planning authority must process a planning application in which they have an interest as they would any other. In addition, the <em>Town and Country Planning (Notification of Applications)</em> <em>(Scotland) Direction 1997</em> , as amended, includes requirements on planning authorities to notify certain planning applications in which they have an interest to the Scottish ministers before they grant planning permission.</p>

  <p>These notification requirements apply where any planning authority proposes to grant planning permission for development to be located on land wholly or partly in their ownership or in which they have an interest, and the proposed development does not accord with the adopted or approved local plan for the area or has been the subject of a substantial body of objections.</p>

  <p>Notification allows the Scottish ministers to consider whether there are any planning issues which would warrant call in of the application for their determination.</p>

  <p>The key low-income results, above, are for 60% of both the relative and absolute median thresholds. Estimates on the full range of income thresholds and explanation of how these estimates are calculated are published in <em>Households Below Average Income, 1994-95 &ndash; 2002-03</em>, copies of which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32212).</p>

  <p>The relative low-income measure compares against the median in the same year. The absolute measure compares against the median in the baseline year of 1996-97. Both areas are uprated to remove the effects of inflation.</p>

  <p>The figures are estimates based on a sample survey and are therefore subject to sampling variation. As such, small percentage changes are not significant when considered on a year-on-year basis; identification of trends should be based on several years of data.</p>

  <p>We intend to introduce the bill in the current session. The bill creates new offences connected with the grooming of children and strengthens the legal framework for dealing with sex offenders and those thought to pose a risk to children and the public in general. These measures will be implemented when the bill receives Royal Assent, which we hope to achieve in the spring of 2005.</p>

  <p>Sportscotland is committed to achieving equality of opportunity in employment and eliminating discrimination in all its forms including discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, age, disability, sexuality, religious belief, political belief, trade union activity, responsibility for dependants, employment status or HIV status. This policy is applied in relation to its current and future workforce.</p>

  <p>A total of 89 applications were received. It was disappointing that only six (7%) of these were from women. Each of the applications was carefully considered by <strong></strong>sportscotland and the recruitment agency used for this appointment, Thomson Partners, against the criteria set out in the person specification included in the application pack issued to all applicants. These criteria included experience of directing and managing sizeable organisations; strong capability at a strategic level; evidence of the development of effective partnerships; a strong affinity with sport, and strong intellectual and interpersonal skills. This resulted in eight applicants being shortlisted for interview, of which none was a woman.</p>

  <p>There are no plans for a national publicity campaign. However, 12 to 18-year-olds are encouraged through the Dialogue Youth project to voluntarily take up the offer of a combined local authority/Young Scot card. Supporting materials underline to young people the value of these PASS accredited cards in providing proof of age when purchasing age restricted goods. Retailers are also encouraged to adopt a &quot;no proof, no sale&quot; approach to age-restricted sales.</p>

  <p>The SPCB commissioned external consultants to research the potential of the new building for use for events. As a result, the SPCB has appointed a fixed-term staff member to develop procedures, co-ordinate events and monitor the demands and expectations of all of those wishing to hold events at Holyrood. The SPCB approved an interim Events Policy in June 2004. This places a moratorium on all non-business related events until December 2004 and on all large events until Easter 2005. A report will be produced for the SPCB in December 2004 to review the first few months of running events and this will make recommendations for future ways of working, including the use of parliamentary facilities during recess.</p>
