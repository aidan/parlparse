  <p>The factors relevant to a Procurator Fiscal&rsquo;s assessment of the public interest are described in the <em>Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Prosecution Code</em> , at Section 6 (page 8) &quot;Public Interest Considerations&quot;. A copy of the Code is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 37201).</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland should take account of advice and evidence from NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and ensure that recommended drugs and treatment are made available to meet clinical need.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland has recently commissioned the Health Economics Research Unit to assess the impact of three health technology assessments, one of which is troponin testing. Work is under way and a report is expected in December.</p>

  <p>The table produced for this analysis is too large to be included in this response and has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37171). For this analysis, the amount of discount was converted to 2004 prices on the basis of changes in the retail price index between the purchase date and 2004. Figures are in thousands of pounds.</p>

  <p>No. The Scottish Executive will, however, aim to maximise the potential business, tourism, sporting and cultural benefits to Scotland which will arise from London hosting the Olympics; and will monitor and evaluate the economic impacts on Scotland of such an important event.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive was an official sponsor of the Homeless World Cup, contributing &pound;30,000 towards the cost of hosting the tournament and hosting the opening reception at Meadowbank Stadium on 19 July. The Executive also provided resources for the tournament&rsquo;s media centre and was represented on the steering group of sponsorship partners. I also participated in the media launch of the tournament in February and the opening reception, closing ceremony and attended several matches, as did a number of my officials.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it intends to issue any revised guidlines on the location and role of on-shore wind farms in the context of its renewable energy policies.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-08-08.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0808.htm#7">

  <p>The Executive has commenced a review of <em>National Planning Policy Guideline 6: Renewable Energy. </em> This review, which will be underpinned by strategic environmental assessment, will consider the need for a national spatial framework and/or regional targets for on-shore wind farms. It is hoped to issue revised policies for public consultation early in 2006.</p>

  <p>The role of on-shore wind farms in contributing to the Executive&rsquo;s renewable energy targets was one of a number of issues considered by the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland (FREDS) in <em>Realising the 2020 Target - Future Generation Group Report 2005,</em> a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 36765). FREDS confirmed that the development of onshore wind has an important role to play in providing the economic justification for the development of Scotland&rsquo;s grid, which in turn could also substantially benefit other renewable technologies which will come on stream over a longer time. The Executive has accepted the findings of this report.</p>
