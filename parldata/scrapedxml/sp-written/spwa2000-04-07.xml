  <p>The Digital Scotland Task Force is due to report to the Ministerial Committee on Digital Scotland in the first half of May. The task force was asked to give advice on actions to ensure that Scotland obtains and retains maximum economic and social advantage from digital technologies, and I expect that it will make recommendations to support this advice. The Executive&#8217;s intention is to consult publicly on the task force report as soon as possible after it is finalised.</p>

  <p>The organisation and structure of school library services are matters for the individual local authorities. We recognise the contribution school librarians can make to the delivery of the education service in a number of ways, including their skills in the area of information technology. School librarians in Scotland are being offered training in the use of information and communications technology as part of a &pound;23 million programme supported by the New Opportunities Fund, a National Lottery distribution body.</p>

  <p>I am very conscious of the concerns which arise when, more often than not as a result of severe weather conditions, escapes occur from fish farms.</p>

  <p>A small group, chaired by the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department, and involving representatives of wild fish interests and the aquaculture industry has been reviewing the matter and I shall be issuing today its report for public comment. The report stresses the importance of preventative measures, of improving reporting arrangements, and of having in place mechanisms for recapturing the escaped fish where this is deemed appropriate.</p>

  <p>The growing of GM crops is highly regulated at European level. It is for Scottish Ministers to decide whether or not to grant consents for Scottish trials, including farm scale evaluations, of genetically modified (GM) crops. We do so upon the advice of our independent scientific advisers and the only ground for refusal is that we have sound scientific reason for so refusing.</p>

  <p>Refusal to grant deliberate release consent would be illegal under governing European and domestic law unless such refusal was, as stated above, based on sound scientific evidence.</p>

  <p>The Steering Group, which has been co-chaired by Councillor James Coleman and myself, has now finalised a framework within which tenants and others can be fully engaged in developing a housing transfer proposal in Glasgow. Arrangements are being made for the framework document to be sent to SPICe.</p>

  <p>The framework lays the foundations for tenant-led change to create better homes and stronger communities, tackle the council&#8217;s housing debt burden and attract private finance of &pound;1,000 million to secure new investment and create jobs. Tenants will have a key role to play in all the structures set out in the framework, which will enable a transfer proposal to be developed as part of Glasgow&#8217;s wider regeneration. The framework promotes local community empowerment, control and ownership.</p>

  <p>A range of partners, including the council, its tenants and staff, Scottish Homes, and the existing housing associations and tenant management co-ops in the city, will now build on the framework. Provided a transfer proposal meets value for money criteria, is affordable and is supported by tenants in a ballot, the Executive is committed to servicing the council&#8217;s residual housing debt burden after transfer.</p>

  <p>As a result of the finalisation of the framework document, I am pleased that the First Minister has authorised the release of an additional &pound;2.3 million of New Housing Partnerships funding to enable the next phases of work to commence.</p>
