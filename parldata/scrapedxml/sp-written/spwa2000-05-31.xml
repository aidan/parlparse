  <p>The Executive has no immediate plans to introduce changes to the laws relating to bankruptcy in Scotland. However, it is still considering the outcome of consultation carried out by the Scottish Office in July 1997 and September 1998 on detailed aspects of the law of personal bankruptcy. In addition, research will shortly be commissioned on the impact of bankruptcy on sole traders and small businesses. Together these studies may in due course lead to legislative proposals.</p>

  <p>I refer you to my answer of 11 February 2000 about Scottish Executive support for Neighbourhood Watch and other initiatives. Many of the major crime prevention initiatives undertaken by the Scottish Executive are evaluated for their effectiveness. However, some benefits are indirect and others may take several years to feed through to making a direct impact on other parts of the criminal justice system.</p>

  <p>Education authorities were requested to provide returns on numbers of exclusions from the beginning of the 1998-99 school session. That is, therefore, the only year for which we currently have figures.</p>

  <p>Across the Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire areas, temporary exclusions in primary schools, across all stages, averaged 11 half days for each 100 pupils. Temporary exclusions in secondary schools, across all stages except S6, averaged 71 half days for each 100 pupils. The numbers of pupils removed from the register (permanent exclusions) across the same areas totalled three in primary schools and 28 in secondary schools.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will investigate the activities of Scottish National Heritage (SNH) regarding the proposed designation of Sites of Special Scientific Interest on Berneray, with particular regard to the duties of SNH to take into account under the National Heritage (Scotland) Act 1991 the interests of communities and social and economic development.</p>

  <p>No. The designation of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) is the responsibility of SNH, which has a statutory duty under section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to notify land which, in its opinion, is of special scientific interest.</p>

  <p>Under the 1991 Act, in exercising its functions, SNH has a duty to take &quot;such account as may be <i>appropriate</i>&quot; of the interests of local communities and the need for social and economic development. However, where SNH is notifying an area of land as an SSSI and the scientific case for that land has been established, it is appropriate that SNH take no account of other factors.</p>

  <p>I am currently considering what future changes to the SSSI system may be desirable to ensure that we secure the protection of the natural heritage in a way which is effective and which takes account of communities&#8217; views.</p>

  <p>Further to my answer of 23 February, I am today announcing the allocation of &pound;5.26 million to Edinburgh for the immediate provision of interim direct access facilities for people who are presently sleeping rough in Edinburgh, for the development of a new reception and direct access facility, for the provision of services for rough sleepers who have complex health and addiction support needs and (as announced in February) to continue funding current RSI projects.</p>

  <p>I have also allocated funds to Glasgow to allow for all currently funded RSI projects to continue until March 2001 with provision for their further extension, in the light of a developing strategy for Glasgow; to move people out of hostels into supported accommodation and to improve services in the hostels as recommended by the Glasgow Review Team. I am awarding &pound;10 million to Glasgow of which &pound;5 million is for immediately identified needs, with a further &pound;3 million reserved to fund proposals arising from the outcome of the current review being carried out into street homelessness in Glasgow. In addition I am making a further &pound;2 million available to be used to provide added impetus to the work of the Glasgow Review Team in this financial year. I plan to make a further announcement about resources to tackle the problems of rough sleeping on Thursday 1 June.</p>

The general objectives of the policy are unchanged and so we have not canvassed further views from organisations or individuals.

  <p>I have received many views in relation to our proposals for a single social tenancy incorporating a modernised right to buy. I am aware of the position of Partick Housing Association and will consider how their particular circumstances can be reflected in our final proposals to be announced early in the summer.</p>

  <p>No; we prefer the flexibility of existing Scots common law <strong> </strong> to a rigid statutory formula. This allows each case to be assessed on its individual merits. It also recognises that the charge of attempted murder is appropriate to deal with attacks where, had the victim died, the offence would have been murder. This may be relevant where an infant has been shaken to its injury, but it is for the Lord Advocate to determine when in an individual case such charges are warranted.</p>

  <p>RSG is one element of aggregate external finance (AEF), the total central government grant available to local authorities. AEF allocations will increase for 1999-2000 and 2000-01 from &pound;5,331.557 million to &pound;5,344.734 million, also in real terms.</p>

  <p>RSG is the balancing factor that makes up each council&#8217;s share of AEF after specific grants and non-domestic rate income have been allocated. Non-domestic rate income is forecast to increase by up to &pound;190 million in 2000-01 causing a corresponding drop in RSG. Revenue support grant (RSG) for these two years, expressed in real terms using the March 2000 GDP Deflators with base year 1998-99, is therefore &pound;3,443.140 million and &pound;3,252.191 million respectively. Such savings in RSG will remain in the Departmental Expenditure Limit as a provision to cover requirements for additional RSG arising from the impact of NDR appeals, and for other adjustments.</p>

  <p>Five-year projections by local authority area are not held centrally. In both Scotland and England the rate poundage for 2000-01 was set with a view to maintaining the total tax take in real terms. A paper showing how the Scottish Executive calculated the rate poundage and poundage comparisons between Scotland and England is available from SPICe. Comparable properties, north and south of the border, starting from the same position, which experience the average uplift at revaluation, should pay the same. Any variations will be due to either sectoral or local conditions.</p>

  <p>This is a commercial venture and its success will be dependent upon demand for the service. Before NETCo can proceed it will have to secure the appropriate parliamentary powers and permissions.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive officials met with representatives of NETCo on 10 April to discuss this project. NETCo has emphasised that the project&#8217;s initial phase would not require public funding.</p>

The external finance limits (EFLs) for the relevant years were set out in written answers S1W-1902 and S1W-3565. EFLs are set in the light of both the overall public expenditure situation and the need to avoid an excessive build up of debt that would fall on future generations.</p>

  <p>The typesetting cost for introducing the new Scottish Parliament logo was &pound;120. There are no incremental costs in printing the new logo, as the cost is the same as the printing of the original design.</p>

  <p>In line with the SPCB decision that there should be no wastage of materials, MSPs and Parliament staff have been asked to use up existing stocks of stationery and other materials before ordering fresh supplies which incorporate the logo, and this is being monitored within the Parliament estate.<br /></p>
