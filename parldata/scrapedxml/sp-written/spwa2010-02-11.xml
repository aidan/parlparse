  <p>May I say first that the Scottish Government welcomed Lord Emslie&rsquo;s decision in January, which rejected all the petitioners&rsquo; substantive arguments. We regret that they are challenging it.</p>

  <p>I understand that the Inner House has recognised the importance of this case and made special effort to expedite it, for which I am grateful. It will hear the appeal during July and issue a decision thereafter. Hopefully that is where it will end. However, the possibility of further appeal cannot be ignored. If an appeal were to reach the European Court of Human Rights, the timescale would be measured in years rather than months.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government values the role played by foster carers to improve the life chances for children and young people in the care system. It is for local authorities to consider whether there are sufficient foster carers in their area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is supporting local authorities by working closely with, and funding activities through, The Fostering Network which support the recruitment and retention of foster carers.</p>

  <p>In particular we have, since October 2008, been funding a project which aims to build on the good practice already in place between fostering services. The project&rsquo;s current phase of work is intended to develop joint working and sharing of resources between authorities, particularly in relation to the recruitment, assessment, training and support for foster carers.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government is determined to build on the huge success of Homecoming Scotland 2009 and to continue supporting the tourism sector through this period of economic recovery.</p>

  <p>That is why the Minister for Culture and External Affairs and I have brought together a Short Life Ministerial Task Force of key officials from Scotland&rsquo;s cultural, tourism and enterprise organisations that is looking at co-ordinated approach to promoting Scotland and advise on how best to build on the success of Homecoming Scotland 2009. The group is also considering what can be done now to sustain the momentum built up during 2009.</p>

  <p>In addition to the work being undertaken by the task force, the events calendar for Scotland in 2010 is already packed with inspirational and exciting events and festivals taking place throughout the country and our national events agency, EventScotland, continues to work with the industry to create a world-class portfolio of events.</p>

  <p>Already we have seen the success of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Hogmanay celebrations, the Great Edinburgh International Cross Country and Winter Run and indoor athletics with the Aviva International Match in Glasgow. Other events taking place this year include: Glasgow&rsquo;s International Comedy Festival and its critically acclaimed festival of visual arts; Edinburgh&rsquo;s festivals which includes the greatest of military tattoos; Ayrshire&rsquo;s &lsquo;Burns and a&rsquo; That&rsquo; Festival which will ensure Robert Burns remains a focus of celebration in 2010; The Open Championship, staged at Turnberry last year, will be played at St Andrews this year and will herald in a fantastic summer of golf which includes the return of the Ladies Scottish Open and the Senior Open Championship; five world championships - climbing, archery, duathlon, sailing and trial motor biking &ndash; are being staged in Scotland, and the Rally of Scotland returns this year to Perthshire and Stirlingshire.</p>

  <p>This information is not collected centrally. Local authorities may, through contract specifications, insist on seatbelts being fitted to vehicles used for dedicated school transport. However, there is no requirement in law for all buses to be fitted with seatbelts. Legislation relating to the fitting of seatbelts on buses is reserved to the UK Parliament. When the current UK legislation relating to seatbelts on buses was introduced in the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2001, buses specifically designed for urban use with standing passengers were excluded.</p>

  <p>Our ambition is to have renewable generation in every school as we believe that will help contribute towards the challenging emissions reduction targets which are required by the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. The joint Scottish Government and COSLA school estate strategy, <em>Building Better Schools: Investing in Scotland&rsquo;s Future,</em> sets out nine guiding principles for the school estate. The sixth of these is that schools should be &quot;greener&quot;, more sustainable and environmentally efficient.</p>

  <p>The Schools Renewables Development Officers, who are funded by the Scottish Government, are continuing to help local authorities secure funding from the extended Low Carbon Buildings Programme and the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme, both of which provide funding towards the eligible capital costs of installing renewable energy generations plant in schools and other buildings.</p>

  <p>There are a growing number of world leading examples of sustainable schools which have opened since May 2007, including Acharacle Primary School in Highland, which has very low energy requirements due to its highly innovative design and Inverclyde Academy, which is provided with up to 20% of its electricity from a 50kw wind turbine, one of the largest in any school in the UK.</p>

  <p>This government firmly believes it is important that our young people have the opportunity to take part in swimming.

The biggest ever single investment by sportscotland in a Scottish governing body of sport.</p>

  <p>We have also provided Scottish Swimming with<strong> </strong>additional funding of &pound;100,000 over two years to 2011 to support the appointment of two Healthy Living Managers to implement and deliver a healthy living strategy.</p>

  <p>Since 2007 this government through sportscotland have invested over &pound;8.4 million in swimming facilities. Our recent announcement of &pound;5.5 million for the development of swimming pools and facilities in Fife and Tayside and our &pound;5 million commitment towards a new 50m pool in Aberdeen, demonstrates this government&rsquo;s commitment to increase participation in this sport.</p>
