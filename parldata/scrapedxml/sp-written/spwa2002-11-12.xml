  <p>The reduction of class sizes in primary 1 to primary 3 is underpinned by the Education (Lower Primary Class Sizes) (Scotland) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/1080).

  <p>The design of the Scottish School Leavers Survey (SSLS) was changed in 1996 in order to provide better data on the transition of young people from the end of compulsory education to the labour market. A contract was placed in that year to establish cohorts of young people which were then surveyed at different stages as they made this transition. As part of this programme, surveys of 19-year-olds, the group who would have been involved in sitting Higher grade examinations, were carried out in 1999 and again in 2001. The results of these surveys will be published over the next few months. When these surveys are published, the survey data will be placed in the ESRC Data Archive for access by researchers wishing to conduct further analysis.</p>

  <p>Further modifications to the design of SSLS are being made at present to ensure that it continues to meet changing information needs. Tenders for further surveys will be invited shortly. It is anticipated new cohorts of young people will be established from those who completed compulsory education in 2002 and 2005.</p>

A city-wide children&#8217;s A&amp;E service will also continue to be provided at Yorkhill Hospital. Each of these elements will be built into the Major Incident Plan.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including emissions of CO <sub>2</sub> .</p>

  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are widely recognised as the main contributor to climate change. The UK strategy for tackling emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO<sub>2</sub>, is the <i>UK Climate Change Programme</i> of which the Executive's <i>Scottish Climate Change Programme</i> forms a part. The Executive is working in partnership with the UK Government to deliver greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by the Kyoto Protocol and in moving toward the domestic goal of a 20% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2010.</p>

  <p>Whilst recent reforms to encourage the use of less polluting vehicles support our environmental objectives, Vehicle Excise Duty is a matter reserved to the UK Government. Any publicity on this is therefore a matter for the Department for Transport.</p>

  <p>This year&#8217;s Spending Review required all departments to prepare statements on the way in which their programmes and spending plans contribute to the achievement of the Executive&#8217;s commitments to sustainable development outlined in <i>Meeting the Needs&hellip; Priorities, Actions and Targets for Sustainable Development in Scotland</i> . These statements will be published shortly. We will build on this work by ensuring that we do examine all of our activities to ensure that they contribute to sustainable development.</p>

  <p>The European Directive 2001/42/EC, on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (commonly known as the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive (SEA)) is due to be implemented by 21 July 2004. The Executive is fully committed to this and work is in hand. As part of this, the Executive has commissioned consultants to develop and trial a SEA methodology and to draft advice for implementing the directive for structure and local plans. They have been asked to identify SEA principles and environmental objectives/criteria that should form the basis of SEA for plans and programmes, other than structure and local plans, which come within the scope of the directive. We expect that the results will be available next summer. The Executive is also setting up a national database of SEAs (including environmental appraisals, etc) for current structure and local plans and a library of examples.</p>

  <p>In my statement of 22 August, I did not say that a majority of the scallop industry supported our proposals for scallop conservation. I said that a majority of the industry supported our proposals. That reflected the fact that our consultation exercises were addressed to the Scottish fishing industry as a whole, not just to scallop fishermen, and that the responses showed the Scottish fishing industry as a whole to be supportive of our proposals.</p>

  <p>I stand by this interpretation of the responses to our consultation exercises, and by the need for additional conservation measures. However, what has since become clear is the strength of opposition from parts of the scallop sector in particular. That is something on which I am reflecting in my continuing discussions with the Rural Development Committee.</p>

  <p>The question of withdrawal symptoms associated with Seroxat is a safety issue concerning a licensed medicinal product and therefore falls within the UK-wide remit of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA). The agency, with advice as required from the Committee on the Safety of Medicines, maintains constant vigilance over the safe use of all medicines licensed for use in the UK, and keeps under continuous review the safety data available to it from a large number of sources worldwide.</p>

  <p>The possibility of symptoms associated with the discontinuation of Seroxat is already identified in the approved advice to prescribers, along with recommendations on how to minimise them. Were any new and valid concerns to emerge the MCA would take prompt and appropriate action. The Executive does not, therefore, intend to ask the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) to review the issue.</p>

  <p>Information about the criteria and process for selection of topics to undergo Health Technology Assessment by the HTBS can be found on their website <a href="http://www.htbs.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.htbs.co.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Neither the crofting community right to buy in general nor a crofting community body&#8217;s right to buy salmon fishings is an absolute right to buy. Conditions apply regarding the eligibility of a crofting community body and an eligible crofting community body can exercise the right to buy only where ministers are satisfied that their acquisition of the property would be, for instance, compatible with the sustainable development of the land and in the public interest. There are also very tight constraints on when the right to buy salmon fishings can be exercised. We also believe that the creation of the crofting community right to buy salmon fishings should not impact upon the value of these fishings.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-11-12.S1W-30748.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1112.htm#18">

  <p>The Executive believes its opposition to an absolute right to buy for tenants is entirely consistent with its support for the proposed crofting community right to buy in Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill. The crofting community right to buy is not an absolute right to buy. It is conditional on a range of criteria being met and can be exercised by a crofting community body only when ministers consider that the acquisition of the property would be in the public interest.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, I stated in my previous answer that blight on the property would arise from the creation of the absolute right to buy for tenants because it would materially affect the private right of a landowner to determine how long they owned, used and obtained income from that holding. The crofting community right to buy is being introduced against a background where the value of crofting land is usually substantially lower than that of agricultural land and the rights of a crofting landlord to use, manage and peacefully own croft land are already subject to strict statutory controls to protect the crofting status of the land.</p>

  <p>There is general concern about the lack of medicines licensed specifically for use in children. It is a widely held view that it is unethical for children not to have access to medicines of the same standards of safety, quality and efficacy as the rest of the population. Until comparatively recently, perceived ethical concerns and practical difficulties created problems in conducting trials in children which has prevented the development of medicines for them.</p>

  <p>In the UK there is extensive prescribing &quot;off-label&quot; of medicines for children i.e. outside the terms of the licence. Off-label prescribing occurs where the clinician believes it is justified and is a matter for clinical judgement, informed by specialist guidance produced by and available to the profession. A doctor may therefore prescribe a medicine for a child that is licensed only for adults.</p>

  <p>A number of measures have been taken at national level within the existing legal framework. The MCA has developed a strategy to improve the availability of medicines licensed for use in the treatment of children and in 2000, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) &#8211; an independent expert advisory body &#8211; established an expert working group to take this issue forward.</p>

  <p>The European Commission has also recognised the need to address this issue and a consultation exercise on their draft proposals was completed in April 2002. The UK gave broad support to the proposals, which combined incentives to the industry with regulatory requirements, and draft European legislation is expected to emerge shortly.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA). The following information has been provided by the MCA:</p>

  <p>Anti-psychotics</p>

  <p>The following &quot;typical&quot; anti-psychotics are authorised for the treatment of psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia and autism) in children: chlorpromazine, haloperidol, levomepromazine/methotrimeprazine, pericyazine and trifluoperazine. For these older drugs, the dosage recommendations are mainly based on long established use in clinical practice. Another well-established anti-psychotic, prochlorperazine, is authorised for use in children in nausea and vomiting only. None of the newer &quot;atypical&quot; anti-psychotics is authorised for use in children.</p>

  <p>Anti-depressants</p>

  <p>Currently, no medicines are authorised for the treatment of children and adolescents with depression.</p>

  <p>Two of the newer selective serotonin uptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressants, fluvoxamine and sertraline, have been authorised for use in children suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and the dosage recommendations are based on clinical trial data. These data are held on file by the marketing authorisation holder and the competent authority.</p>

  <p>Three of the older tricyclic anti-depressants, amitriptyline, imipramine and nortriptyline, are authorised for use in children with nocturnal enuresis (bed-wetting). For these long-established medicines, dosage recommendations are mainly based on prescribers&#8217; experience in marketed use, rather than the robust clinical trial data that would now be required for the licensing of new medicines.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Information on waiting times for out-patient appointments with a consultant is collected centrally at specialty level only.</p>

  <p>A UK-wide risk-sharing scheme for the treatment of eligible patients with multiple sclerosis enables beta interferon and glatiramer acetate to be prescribed on the NHS to patients who meet criteria set out by the Association of British Neurologists. Patients&#8217; eligibility for treatment will depend on the clinical judgement of the specialist neurologists concerned.</p>

  <p>Full details of the scheme are explained in Health Department Letter (2002) 6, a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 20653). The guidance recognised that it may take 18 months or longer for treatment to be initiated for all eligible patients.</p>

  <p>The drop-out rate of student nurses is currently 22.4%.</p>

  <p>There are a number of reasons why student nurses leave their course and we are taking a number of steps to address attrition including improving financial support - the Nursing and Midwifery Student Bursary has increased by 21% since 1998 - and developing proposals for distance learning and flexible access to courses to make sure that as many of our gifted students as possible complete their training and go on to work in NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>We do not intend to re-introduce a salary system for student nurses to replace the current student nurse bursary. Following a major review of nurse training in 1992, it was agreed that student nurses and midwives should no longer be regarded as employees but that they should have full student status like all other health profession students.</p>

  <p>Information on Kilmarnock is held by Premier Prison Services which has contractual responsibility for this matter. The SPS does not monitor the number of reportable accidents notified by Premier Prison Services to HSE. The SPS Controller at HM Prison Kilmarnock does however have access to any relevant information should a prisoner be injured.</p>

The only information which cannot meaningfully be supplied is a distinction between young offenders in adult prisons and those in Young Offender Institutions. This is because many young offenders will pass through an adult prison on their way to reception in a Young Offenders Institution or may be transferred to a Young Offenders Institution after reception in an adult prison. As Young Offenders Institutions and adult prisons are all penal establishments in the Scottish Prison Service, this distinction is not relevant to the consideration of the need for secure accommodation.</p>

  <p>Poverty cannot be measured by a single indicator. The Social Justice Annual Report contains 29 milestones which describe different aspects of poverty and social exclusion. Low income is one part of the picture.</p>

  <p>The headline measure of low income is conventionally defined to be household income below 60% of the GB median after housing costs, but it is also important to consider additional indicators based on a range of thresholds of mean and median income to gain a fuller picture.</p>

  <p>Data on low income households are only available on an annual basis. The following tables 1 and 2 detail the proportion of households with relative<sup>1</sup> low income below a range of thresholds and cover the years since 1996-97. Tables 3 and 4 provide the same information but based on thresholds of absolute<sup>4</sup> low income. All figures are based on a sample survey, and as such are subject to sampling variation. Care should therefore be taken in their interpretation.</p>

  <p>1. Thresholds are measured against the GB mean or median for the relevant year.</p>

  <p>2. Before Housing Costs.</p>

  <p>3. After Housing Costs.</p>

  <p>4. Thresholds are measured against the GB mean or median for 1996-97 uprated to remove the effects of inflation.</p>

  <p>We are currently unable to provide estimates of the numbers of low income households due to methodological problems with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) data source from which they are derived. We have been working with DWP to revise their methodology and we hope to be able to provide estimates of numbers as well as proportions in the near future. The new methodology may lead to revisions to previously published figures. Such differences are, however, likely to be very small and should not alter any of the general trends. As part of an on-going programme to improve data quality, there will be further revisions to this data series when full results of the 2001 Census of Population become available.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any monitoring arrangements are in place to ensure that public money committed to purchase private sector goods or services is not committed to any organisation operating a tax avoidance policy by establishing accounts in offshore tax havens and, if not, whether it will investigate establishing such an arrangement to ensure that only firms that properly pay taxation within the UK benefit from public money used to purchase goods or services on behalf of the taxpayer.</p>

  <p>No monitoring arrangements are in place in respect of tax avoidance schemes. However, organisations bidding for Scottish Executive contracts are expected to have met their legal obligations in respect of taxation and it is standard practice that they are asked to disclose any convictions.</p>

  <p>European public procurement rules provide for certain circumstances when companies can be excluded from competing for public sector business, such as failure to pay taxes in accordance with UK (or other relevant) legislation. However, it does not allow for exclusion of companies on the basis that they pay their taxes in another country. To exclude a company on these grounds would be unlawful. Generally, companies are required to pay taxes in the country of their incorporation. In the case of partnerships, partners are required to pay taxes in the country in which they are domiciled.</p>

  <p>The Active Communities Initiative, the Millennium Volunteers programme and the network of Volunteer Centres each promote and facilitate volunteering that is arranged and delivered by organisations. They provide generic support on behalf of all organisations working with volunteers. Accordingly, any organisation, including youth organisations with adult volunteers, is free to approach the Scottish Executive or their local volunteer centre to explore how best to take forward the recruitment, training and retention of volunteers. If proposals for a specific project or initiative emerge, Scottish Executive funding might be possible, provided normal grant scheme eligibility criteria are met and resources are available.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The filters proposed for the treatment plant at Milngavie are dual media with sand and anthracite. It is estimated that about 1% to 5% of the anthracite will be lost with the backwash water every year and this will therefore require topping up on an annual basis.

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body will list, for each works package under the Holyrood project where no performance bond was obtained, (a) the name of the company awarded the contract, (b) details of the work involved, (c) the total value of the contract as awarded and (d) whether there was any other form of protection other than a performance bond required from the party awarded the contract such as a parent company guarantee; if so, whether it will detail what protection was to be obtained and whether it was obtained and, where no form of protection was required, on what basis that decision was reached.</p>

  <p>My answer to question S1W-30170 on 16 October 2002, explained that negotiations on trade contracts for the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood are carried out on a commercially confidential basis, and that it would not be appropriate to name publicly those contractors who have yet to provide a performance bond. The same principle applies to all contractors and I am therefore unable to list those contractors, or provide any of the associated information requested, on this occasion.</p>

  <p>The total cost of publishing and printing the English version of the <i>Scottish Parliament Annual Report 2001 to 2002 </i> was &#163;19,226. This represents a significant saving of &#163;11,600 over last year's costs, achieved by retaining the same design format and layout as last year and bringing more of the work in house. The number of reports published was 2,500.</p>

  <p>Distribution was increased this year and included all secondary schools as well as partner public libraries, international contacts and interested organisations throughout Scotland. We trust that MSPs will make their copies available in their constituency offices thereby increasing public availability to the document. The final cost of distribution is being calculated but is expected to be &#163;2,500.</p>
