  <p>We have no plans to establish such a fund for Scotland, but trade unions have long made a valuable contribution to workplace learning in Scotland which we intend to build on. This has been helpful in the development of key lifelong learning initiatives such as the Scottish University for Industry. We shall meet the STUC to explore how trade unions in Scotland might provide further support for workplace learning.</p>

  <p>On 4 October 1999, an audit of staff, commissioned by Highlands and Islands Enterprise, at Barmac&#8217;s Nigg and Ardersier yards showed that there were 4,254 staff on site of whom approximately 2,400 were employed by sub-contractors. Employment at Lewis Offshore has averaged about 250 over the last three years.</p>

  <p>Barmac has announced that it plans to retain around 400 staff for the time being. Lewis Offshore, which is currently in receivership, will be operated on a care and maintenance basis with a small number of staff. The audit estimates that these reductions will lead to the loss of approximately 770 jobs in supply businesses.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive set of response measures is being put in place to place redundant employees in new jobs and assist with skills development, following the recently announced reduction in the workforce employed by Barmac.</p>

  <p>On-site information centres are being opened at both Ardersier and Nigg to provide easy-access, first-stop advice on employment, skills development and other issues for employees. A comprehensive information pack, giving advice, contact numbers etc, is being provided for on-site workers and for all those who have already left employment.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise are setting up a database (HIE-OPS) of people affected by the rundown of the oil fabrication industry in the HIE area and are working with local labour placement specialists based in the Highlands and Islands to place as many individuals from the list as is practicable.</p>

  <p>HIE are also working with Barmac management to help identify opportunities for activity in the yards when confidence returns to the market, and are actively engaged in efforts to encourage new inward investment and employment to the area, and to diversify further the Highlands economy so that it can continue to compete vigorously in future markets.</p>

  <p>As with all HIE Schemes, applicants will be expected to contribute. The balance of contribution will be determined by EU State Aid rules, the attractiveness of the project, and the amount of public sector support needed for the project to proceed. The effects of ISA will be relevant to the third of these considerations. My announcement made clear that the requirement for matching funding, through an industry-wide levy, envisaged in the earlier Government Scheme would not apply.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the scheme is to help fish and shellfish farmers affected by ISA to become re-established at their previous level of trading. The concentration of aid at this end of the production cycle is seen as the best way of helping smolt and other suppliers to recover business lost through the disease controls. It is however open to such suppliers to seek assistance through other discretionary HIE programmes.</p>

  <p>I refer Mr Lochhead to previous answers given to him on this matter (24 June and 3 November). It would have been inappropriate for the Scottish Executive to introduce a safety scheme while consideration was being given by the UK Government to re-instatement of the previous arrangements. Following confirmation in November 1999 that the UK Government will not re-introduce the UK-wide scheme, the Executive has acted promptly to propose Scottish measures.</p>

  <p>In any event, resources for the FIFG programme ending 31 December 1999 are fully committed in Scotland and would not have been available to support a safety scheme.</p>

  <p>Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for each Member State are set each year by the Council of Ministers. The figures for 1999 appear in the <i>Official Journal of the European Commission</i> , L13, volume 42, of 18 January 1999.</p>

  <p>TACs for the United Kingdom are allocated to Producer Organisations (POs) and other groups of fishermen, and POs are responsible for managing quotas on behalf of their members. Some vessels in Scottish POs are registered elsewhere in the UK, and some in other POs are registered in Scotland. Information on how POs manage quota during the year is not held centrally and therefore it is not possible to specify the proportion of TACs allocated to Scottish registered and owned vessels.</p>

  <p>However, landings of all species by Scottish registered vessels in 1998 amounted to 73% by weight and nearly 63% by value of landings by all UK vessels in that year. Further details are available in <i>Scottish Sea Fisheries Statistics, 1998.</i></p>

  <p>The study suggests that patients with coronary heart disease in the most severe deprivation categories waited about three weeks longer for routine cardiac surgery than did patients in the most affluent category. The main reason quoted was that those in the most affluent category were more likely to be classified as urgent cases.</p>

  <p>One of our key aims in the <i>Programme for Government</i> is to eliminate inequalities of treatment. The Coronary Heart Disease Task Force has been investigating the management of patients on the cardiac surgery waiting list. It has devised a common referral letter and a standard approach to the categorisation of those patients, based on clinical factors. Implementation of these initiatives, together with the establishment of a national waiting time for this priority area, will help ensure that time the key determinant for priority of treatment is clinical need.</p>

  <p>1.<sup> </sup>Self/GP referral appointments include appointments whereby the GP has referred the woman and where the woman has referred herself.</p>

  <p>2. Data are presented by financial year (1 April to 31 March).</p>

  <p>3. All SBSP screening centres cover more than one health board and, in some cases, have joint responsibility for screening a health board. To achieve the most efficient use of resources, particularly when screening is by mobile units, health boards are not necessarily screened evenly throughout the three year period. Owing to the arrangements made for screening in certain remote and rural areas, including the use of mobile screening units, it is not possible to provide data on an annual basis. Data is available for only one year out of every three.</p>

  <p>Criminal complaints against the police are independently investigated by the procurator fiscal. Police authorities and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary have important roles to play in providing independent oversight of the complaints system. In addition, the Scottish Executive has accepted the recommendation of the Macpherson Report to consider what steps can and should be taken to ensure that serious complaints against police officers are independently investigated. The Inspectorate is now carrying out a thematic inspection on the way complaints are handled, which is due to report next April. The Executive will then consider the way forward for police complaints in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to making public appointments in Scotland more representative of Scottish society as a whole.</p>

  <p>That is why the forthcoming consultation exercise on modernising the public appointments system, announced by Mr Jack McConnell last month, will explore what more can be done to encourage women, disabled people and people from ethnic minorities to apply for public appointments.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper will also seek views as to whether the targets inherited from the Scottish Office for achieving greater representation of women and ethnic minorities in public appointments are relevant.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the recently formed Equality Unit is working closely with the Public Appointments Unit to take forward work on gender, race and disability to ensure that equal opportunities is an integral part of the appointments process.</p>

  <p>I have already discussed the Petitions with the National Farmers&#8217; Union of Scotland. They are aware that it is difficult to resolve some of the matters highlighted, but I have undertaken to look seriously at the issues and, where appropriate, also to raise the issues with my Ministerial counterparts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>There is likely to be a small increase in the Department&#8217;s staff over the next 12 months, mainly to handle the more complex support regime being introduced by the European Union under Agenda 2000, but the precise numbers involved are not yet clear.</p>

  <p>In the light of the SACTRA report, officials are considering how local economic impact assessments could be improved. The Executive is currently developing guidance to assist with the multi-modal corridor studies which I announced following the Strategic Roads Review, and this will include advice on how to treat local economic impacts. We will work with local authorities and other interested parties to ensure that the guidance is equally useful to them. It is anticipated that a first draft of the guidance will be produced in mid-2000, and a consultation period will follow.</p>

  <p>Video conferencing facilities at the Parliament have been used by Members and staff to connect to a number of academic establishments, to Scottish Executive sites, and as part of an international link-up in conjunction with the United Nations AIDS conference held last year.</p>

  <p>The Parliament&#8217;s Education Service also used the facility on the 22 June 1999 for a &quot;video surgery&quot; between the Deputy First Minister and a group of pupils from Kirkwall Grammar School, Orkney. The Education Service hopes to develop this aspect of its work in the future, particularly with remote schools.</p>

  <p>Promotion of video conferencing facilities has been limited. We plan to address this in the near future and could use global e-mails plus possibly enlist the help of WHISP.</p>

  <p>No, but the SPCB is keen to ensure the most efficient and effective use of available resources and would encourage members always to consider use of video conferencing facilities as an alternative to travel. Parliament staff will shortly issue further guidance on use of the Parliament&#8217;s own facilities. <br /></p>
