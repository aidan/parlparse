  <p>Reducing harmful drinking by children and young people is one of the key priorities of the <em>Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems</em> published in 2002. The plan sets out a range of actions in relation to school and community based education and the promotion of positive alternatives. It also includes actions to ensure children affected by alcohol problems have access to appropriate services, and new resources for parents to help them to discuss alcohol issues with their children.</p>

  <p>The Executive will shortly be publishing an update to this Plan, setting out further actions.</p>

  <p>Executive action in relation to young adults has focused on encouraging them to take responsibility for their behaviour when drunk and to think more about the negative effects of this behaviour. Action includes a television advertising campaign and a high profile press and poster campaign, and supporting NHS Health Scotland and Alcohol Focus Scotland in providing information and advice.</p>

  <p>A breakdown of funding to tackle drinking by children and young adults is not available. Scottish Executive spend specifically on alcohol will amount to &pound;11.9 million in 2005-06. Alcohol misuse is also targeted through other joint drugs/alcohol activities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-20285 by Mr Andy Kerr on 10 November 2005, why NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is awaiting the final recommendation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in relation to its consultation document, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease &ndash; donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine, when NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is responsible for making recommendations in respect of the use of these drugs within the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) has published comments on all NICE appraisals since May 2001. It does not re-assess the evidence used by NICE to avoid duplication of effort and to ensure public resources are used effectively and efficiently. NHS QIS considers possible differences in the application of appraisals for Scotland based on four criteria:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Principles and values of NHSScotland<br />
              Epidemiology (frequency, distribution and stage at presentation)<br />
              Structure and provision of services in Scotland</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Other implications for NHSScotland, including rural issues, predicted uptake or existing advice from the Scottish Medicines Consortium.</p>

  <p>NHS QIS involves a small number of experts in this process, and this has allowed it to make decisions about the validity of NICE appraisals for Scotland prior to the publication of the appraisal by NICE. Consequently it issues its comments to NHS board chief executives on the same day as NICE publishes its appraisal (usually on the fourth Wednesday of each month).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-20285 by Mr Andy Kerr on 10 November 2005, why the Scottish Medicines Consortium does not recommend that Memantine (Exiba&reg;) is used to treat moderately severe to severe Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and whether this indicates that the drug is used to treat milder cases of Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-12-12.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1212.htm#3">

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) reviewed memantine (Ebixa) in July 2003 and did not recommend it for use within NHS Scotland. Its advice was that, although this is currently the only agent licensed for use in moderately severe to severe Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, the magnitude of the effect is extremely small. Compared with placebo it is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of deterioration in global, functional and cognitive scales. On the evidence presented, the associated gains appear to be marginal relative to the overall costs.</p>

  <p>The company subsequently made a resubmission to SMC for assessment and in December 2003 SMC did not recommend it for use. The economic case submitted by the manufacturer did not suggest that use of this drug would be cost effective relative to standard practice in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The licensed indication submitted for review was for the treatment of patients with moderately severe to severe Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and SMC therefore commented on this indication only.</p>

  <p>*Information provided by the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 provides the front door for primary care medical attention when doctors&rsquo; surgeries are closed and is sensitive to the specific needs of patients in remote and rural areas and problems such as travelling long distances to reach a primary care emergency centre out of hours. If an NHS 24 nurse adviser assesses that a patient requires medical attention out of hours they can access information about what services are available, and where, and will refer accordingly. The patient&rsquo;s care is then transferred to the local NHS board who will ensure that appropriate treatment is provided.</p>

  <p>The Executive wrote to all Scottish local authorities on 4 October 2005 inviting them to develop appropriate language plans for the communities they serve. The letter drew attention to national policy in respect of service provision for speakers and users of languages other than English and explained that people living in Scotland who do not speak English as a first language have the same rights to access public sector services as English speakers.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland disseminated copies of <em>Providing Information to Refugees: a</em> <em>Good Practice Checklist</em> which provides information for local authorities to use when preparing welcome packs for refugees. The checklist aims to ensure that refugees get information they need on housing, welfare benefits, education, work, healthcare, legal aid and how to deal with racial harassment.

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Executive provides core funding to the Scottish Refugee Council for the purpose of, amongst other things, providing information to asylum seekers and refugees. The Scottish Refugee Council&rsquo;s community development team supports the Framework for Dialogue initiative to give local refugee groups the chance to build bridges with host communities and other refugee groups</p>

  <p>The recommendations in the Public Health Institute of Scotland&rsquo;s <em> Autistic Spectrum</em> <em>Disorders: Needs Assessment Report</em> are primarily for local health, education and social work agencies who are responsible for the delivery of services for those who need them, and for determining the allocation of resources. The recommendations are in five key areas: standards and monitoring; matching resources to need; training; research, and diagnosis and assessment. The work of the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Reference Group continues to focus on priorities within these areas for delivering better services for individuals and their families. Details of the group&rsquo;s work are available on the Scottish Executive website at the following link: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/VAUnit/ASD" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/VAUnit/ASD</a> .</p>

  <p>A progress report due for publication in February will provide full details of progress towards implementation of the recommendations to date. It will also identify priorities for further action at national and local level.</p>

  <p>Monitoring of multi-agency services for people with ASD will be delivered through joint inspections of learning disability services; Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education inspections, and the work of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. The Scottish Executive also monitors individual projects that it funds. The Needs Assessment Report does not set out a timescale for implementation.</p>

  <p>Multidisciplinary colorectal cancer teams require appropriately trained surgeons, clinical oncologists, medical oncologists, pharmacists, therapy radiographers, radiation physicists as well as nurses and a variety of discipline specific and generic training courses are available.</p>

  <p>One example is the new development and training programme to provide a further 25 non-medical endoscopists. Medical endoscopists also receive enhanced &quot;Training the trainers&quot; training as part of this programme.</p>

  <p>There are also a number of courses leading to the award of specialist practitioner qualification that would be available to nurses specialising in colorectal cancer, such as degree and master level courses in cancer nursing, and in gastro-intestinal nursing.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what success it has had in achieving reductions in the levels of street crime in (a) Scotland and (b) the (i) West Dunbartonshire and (ii) East Dunbartonshire local authority area since 1999 and what targets it set for such reductions in this period.</p>

  <p>Neither the recorded crime nor the court proceedings statistics held centrally contain information which would enable figures to be provided at the level of detail requested.</p>

  <p>The Executive has targets in place to reduce the number of recorded incidents of serious violent crime and to increase the detection rate, both of which are to be achieved by March 2006. The latest statistics show that non-sexual crimes of violence across Scotland decreased by 3% between 2003-04 and 2004-05. Within this category, recorded robberies decreased by 10% - the lowest level since 1980.</p>

  <p>The rates liability for all businesses, including new ones, is determined by the Scottish Assessors, and is usually based on an estimate of the annual rent which a subject would command on the open market. New business start-ups do not receive any specific rates reductions, although, there are a wide range of rate reliefs available to all qualifying businesses, including new ones. We have no current plans to introduce a rates reduction for new business start-ups in the next spending review.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Certain community business initiatives are able to access the Futurebuilders Scotland fund where they are part of the social economy and meet the Futurebuilders Scotland eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>Financial support for community business initiatives is also available through Leader+(Scotland), a European Community Initiative designed to encourage new ideas and support in sustainable rural development.</p>
<p>Support for businesses generally is primarily an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Scottish Enterprise provides support and advice through the Business Gateway, while in the Highlands and Islands area, the ten local enterprise companies act as the access point. This includes advice on the sources of financial support available.</p>

  <p>The Extended Impact Assessment concluded that the proposed levy on plastic bags would achieve net environmental benefits in five out of eight environmental indicators. It also concluded, however, that there would an increase in the amount of waste arising in Scotland. A summary of the Extended Impact Assessment can be found on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/08/1993102/31039" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/08/1993102/31039</a> .</p>

  <p>For capital expenditure, local authorities have been free to set their capital budgets for flood alleviation measures within the overall prudential regime since 1 April 2004. Before then, local authorities had considerable flexibility in setting their flood alleviation budget within their overall section 94 consent allocations. In addition, there were specific allocations made for major confirmed flood prevention schemes for the period up to 2003-04, the details of which were set out in the answer to question S2W-3642 on 20 November 2003.</p>

  <p>I have been advised by the Food Standards Agency Scotland that the use of aspartame in diet sodas is controlled in the UK by the Sweeteners in Food Regulations 1995 (as amended). These regulations list sweeteners permitted for use, the foodstuff categories in which they are permitted to be used, the maximum usable dose levels allowed and specify the labelling requirements for the sale of tabletop sweeteners.</p>

  <p>In relation to diet sodas the above regulations specify that &quot;aspartame is permitted in water-based flavoured drinks, energy-reduced or with no added sugar up to the maximum usable dose of 600mg/l&quot;. However, most soft drinks use aspartame in combination with other sweeteners and so the actual level used is normally considerably lower.</p>

  <p>The planning and provision of local NHS services is a matter for individual NHS boards, providing they are in line with national guidance and frameworks. The National Framework for Service Change concluded that there needs to be a shift towards preventative medicine and I have made it clear in <em>Delivering for Health</em> that I want to see NHS boards expanding the range of preventative services in the community to free capacity in the acute sector. The outcome of the Coatbridge pilot is currently being evaluated by NHS Lanarkshire. There are indications that investment in this service has the potential to reduce demand on orthopaedic and other acute hospital services and would therefore represent a better use of available resources. The outcome and wider implementation of the pilot will be considered by NHS Lanarkshire early next year.</p>

  <p>There is no &quot;signing up&quot; involved in the Healthyliving Campaign. The Healthyliving Campaign is a public health information campaign using a multi-media, multi-component approach to communicate information, and positive messages about healthy eating and physical activity. The strategy is one of motivating individuals to choose healthy eating options and increase their physical activity levels through the core proposition of &quot;Choose change, choose healthyliving&quot;. Strategic partnerships for delivery of healthier eating or physical activity also use healthyliving branding to connect the communications campaign with the delivery of services which support individuals to make those healthy choices a reality.</p>

  <p>In the school environment health is one part of ministers&rsquo; vision for the children and young people of Scotland. Activities to improve children&rsquo;s health is embedded in the concept of health promoting schools and all schools are working towards being health promoting schools by 2007. Examples of health promoting activities in schools include <em>Hungry for Success</em>, which is our whole school approach to school meals, and the Active Schools programme.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to change the way that the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) operates. If changes were considered then key stakeholders would be involved.</p>

  <p>We expect SMC to issue its advice following receipt of the manufacturer&rsquo;s evidence as soon as possible after the launch of a product or, on occasion, before the launch. If subsequent advice were issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) based on more up-to-date evidence we would expect NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHSQIS) to decide whether that should supersede the SMC advice.

  <p>Information on average weight of children in each of the last five years is not available centrally for all local authority areas, and is only available for specific age groups. Available information is presented in two tables which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 38335 and 38334).</p>

  <p>Table 1 gives the average (median) weight (kg&rsquo;s) for children receiving a 39 to 42 month pre-school review (three to three and a half years) by local authority area and year of birth 1997 to 2001.</p>

  <p>Table 2 gives the average (median) weight (kg&rsquo;s) for children receiving a P1 review (four to five years), P7 (11 to 12yrs) and S3 (14 to 15yrs) by local authority area and school year 2000-01 to 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Information about patient consultations with specialists relating to being overweight is not available.</p>

  <p>The exact number of children under 16 consulting their general practice for matters involving being overweight in Scotland is not available centrally. However, national estimates of the numbers of children consulting for being overweight can be given, based on the number of patients seen for the condition in general practices participating in PTI (practice team information). PTI data are obtained from a sample of Scottish general practices. The number of participating practices is too small to allow estimates for local authority areas. Additionally, for this condition, the numbers in the sample are too small to allow a break down by age and so the estimates are shown by gender only.</p>

  <p>Note: 1. Estimates have been rounded to the nearest 50.</p>

  <p>Many overweight children may not consult their general practice about their weight problem. Some patients may also visit the General Practice for a condition related to their weight without overweight itself being recorded.</p>

  <p>The 2003 Scottish Health Survey reported that among children under 16 years of age, 34.6% of boys and 30.0% of girls were overweight or obese. These figures can be found at the website: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/17861/HealthSurvey2003" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/17861/HealthSurvey2003</a>.</p>

  <p>Data does not exist in the form requested for a number of reasons. This information was held, until about 1991, in regional transfusion centres (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness) and not pooled, and SNBTS does not have the records for these years. Estimates can be made based on the results of tests when these became available. These rely on the incidence of infections in the community (number of new cases), the prevalence (total number of cases) and the &quot;window period&quot; of the test. This window period is that time from a person becoming infected until the test is positive. Information on the number of transmissions in relation to each of the type of hepatitis is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>No data is available for the period prior to 1978 on hepatitis A. Transfusion-transmitted hepatitis A is extremely rare with only two cases reported in the UK over the past 20 years.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Tests for hepatitis B were only available from 1971. Transfusion- transmitted hepatitis B infection was quite common prior to the introduction of donor HBsAg screening around 1971, following which the reported number of cases fell to around five cases per annum for Scotland. Since 1991, this has dropped further and current UK residual risk is around 1:500,000 donations. For non-A non-B hepatitis &ndash;shown to be hepatitis C from around 1990-transfusion-associated hepatitis would only be a proportion of the actual rate of infection in recipients. It has been estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 people were infected in the United Kingdom in the 10 years prior to 1991, equating to between 700 and 1500 in Scotland, or some 70-150 each year. The current residual risk of hepatitis C is now estimated to be around one in 10 million donations and at this rate it could be expected that Scotland would experience one hepatitis C transmission every 40 years.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>The SBSA is presently carrying out a review of standards on the access and use of buildings, including dwellings, and the review focuses on the need to provide dwellings that can accommodate the needs of all occupants, older people amongst them. The aim is to ensure that new dwellings better meet the varying needs of both occupants and visitors and are of a form that will enable future adaptation to suit the changing needs of occupants over the years.</p>
<p>The Building Standards Advisory Committee working party carrying out the review includes members from the architectural profession, the Disability Rights Commission, local authority building standards, private house builders and the Building Research Establishment.</p>
<p>Discussions on the issues of accessibility and use of buildings are in progress with a range of other key stakeholders, including: The Joseph Rowntree Foundation; Scottish Disability Equality Forum; Royal National Institute for the Blind; Royal National Institute for the Deaf; Homes for Scotland, and Ownership Options. It is anticipated that other interested parties will become involved prior to public consultation on proposed changes in March 2006.</p>

  <p>Section 94 capital consents were abolished on 31 March 2004. From 2004-05, following the introduction of a new prudential regime (for local authority capital finance), local authorities have the flexibility to determine their own programmes for capital investment. These programmes are supported centrally by a combination of specific capital grants, and loan charges up to a specified level of new borrowing each year. In addition to this councils may, in accordance with the Prudential Code, undertake self-supported borrowing as long as it is prudent, affordable and sustainable.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, which is a part of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, has published a good practice clinical guideline on the Management of Osteoporosis which includes advice for clinicians on the use of DEXA scanning in the diagnosis of the condition. The choice, purchase and replacement of medical equipment such as DEXA scanners is a matter for boards working with manufacturers of equipment, but the Executive has provided additional funding of &pound;125 million over three years to help boards obtain more new and replacement medical equipment. Because these are matters for NHS boards, the Executive has not issued specific guidance to the NHS about the replacement of DEXA scanners nor has it considered specifically the effectiveness of mobile scanners &ndash; although we understand a number of boards use them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) advises NHSScotland on the clinical and cost effectiveness of all new medicines, formulations and indications at, or as soon as possible after, the time of launch of a medicine. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) appraisals (multiple technology appraisals) are conducted over a longer period of time, have access to more evidence beyond that which was available at the time of launch of a medicine, and are able to undertake more detailed appraisal of a medicine. Consequently the SMC process and the NICE multiple technology appraisal process should be seen as complementary processes rather than as alternatives.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) provides the secretariat and other inputs, such as health economics, to the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC). SMC, however, is an autonomous body constituted by the Area Drug and Therapeutics Committees (ADTCs) of NHS boards in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) reviewed Pimecrolimus cream (Elidel&#210; ) in July 2004, and did not recommend it for use. SMC advice was:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pimecrolimus cream is the first topical immunomodulator licensed for the treatment of signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. There is no evidence that it has clinical advantage in terms of efficacy or safety when compared with the alternative treatments, which include mild-to-moderately potent topical corticosteroids. The economic case for using this preparation is unproven.&quot;</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance to the NHS in England and Wales on the use of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus for atopic eczema in August 2004 which allowed use of use of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus for atopic eczema in defined circumstances.

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) validated the NICE appraisal and advised that</p>

  <p>&quot;NHSScotland should take account of NICE appraisals in its planning, funding and provision of services to ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet clinical need. NHS QIS noted the differences between SMC advice and the NICE appraisal.&quot;</p>

  <p>I conducted the Annual Review of NHS Western Isles in Stornoway on 12 September 2005 where I received the personal assurances of the chair in relation to financial balance and governance. In my letter closing the review I said:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p> &quot;I would like to congratulate NHS Western Isles on a good performance in 2004-05. You are meeting your performance targets and patients receive a good service. However, it is imperative that this good work is under-pinned by solid foundations in finance and staff governance. You know how disappointed I am that your accounts were qualified last year but I welcome your assurances that strengthening of your financial management is your top priority &ndash; I saw evidence that action is well in hand.</p>
<p>I was concerned at the negative attitude and language I heard in the Partnership Forum, which was in stark contrast to the, admittedly anecdotal, comments I heard from staff and patients as I made my visits. I place high importance on good partnership working, which must come from all sides, and I urge members of the Forum to consider what they each can do to deliver good working relations within the board, which are essential to good healthcare.</p>
<p>You have a board which has grown in strength over the last year and I know that this has taken a lot of hard work from all concerned. Board members should be proud of the progress made and I should be pleased if you would convey to them and all staff my appreciation and encouragement.&quot;</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>It is now for the board to deliver on the assurances given and for all concerned to work for the best interests of patient care in the Western Isles.</p>

  <p>An additional 14 full-time equivalent nurses will be required to assess and follow up individuals who test positive prior to onward referral for further investigation (colonoscopy). Nurses carrying out these assessments will require additional training but will not require to be a clinical nurse specialist. The provision of this training will be the responsibility of each individual health board as part of general planning for implementation of the Bowel Screening Programme. Advice on the nature of the training required will be provided by representatives from the Bowel Screening Centre.</p>

  <p>We are investing in the expansion of the endoscopy workforce in Scotland. Up to 25 non-medical endoscopists, some of whom will be specialist nurses or nurse practitioners, will commence a one year training course from January 2006 at Glasgow Caledonian University. This is an on-going bi-yearly course running in January and September. Once qualified, they will form part of the general endoscopy workforce rather than working exclusively with screen positive individuals. As at January 2005 there were 39 non-medical endoscopists working in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to increase the number of bowel cancer nurse specialists to care for individuals ultimately diagnosed with bowel cancer. During the Bowel Cancer Screening Pilot, which has been operating in Fife, Grampian and Tayside since 2000, there has been no requirement to increase the number of bowel cancer nurse specialists as existing teams have been able to absorb the additional workload.</p>

  <p>The free fruit scheme aims to introduce pupils to the taste of different fruits at an early age, and targeting the first two years of primary education with free fruit three times per week was felt to be the best way of achieving this.

  <p>The Executive does not have any plans to extend the provision of free fruit at present. However, as the First Minister announced in September 2005, the Executive will be consulting on a range of measures relating to health promotion, nutrition and schools, and this will allow an opportunity for people to comment on the outcome of the scheme.</p>

  <p>In addition to the free fruit scheme, the Hungry for Success nutrient specifications state that school menus should provide a choice of at least two vegetables and two fruits, in addition to fruit juice every day and throughout the lunch service.

<p>The contract does not require the contractor to employ registered mental nurses but does commit the contractor to having &quot;nursing staff with mental nursing skills and qualifications.</p>
<p>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-17042 on 17 June 2005. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The SPS also have a controller team based in the establishment whose role is to keep under review the running of the prison.</p>

  <p>A Scottish criminal court has jurisdiction, at common law, over aircraft within or flying over Scotland. Section 92 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 also makes provision for the application of the criminal law to aircraft. In terms of that legislation, where an act or omission takes place on board a British-controlled aircraft, which is in flight elsewhere than in or over the United Kingdom and that act or omission would constitute an offence if it took place in the UK, or in a part of the UK, that shall constitute an offence under the law in force in the UK or in part of the UK.</p>

  <p>This provision also applies to non British-controlled aircraft if the next landing of the aircraft is in the United Kingdom and the act or omission would also constitute an offence if it had taken place in the country in which the aircraft is registered.</p>

  <p>The control of flights in and out of Scotland is a reserved matter. The Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation entitles foreign civil aircraft to make technical stops, for example for refuelling, without requiring the permission of the state it stops in.</p>

  <p>If the police have a specific basis to believe that an offence is being committed against the person of an individual on board an aircraft and which endangers the safety of that person they may board the craft and investigate the circumstances in the same way as they may enter any premises in order to prevent an offence of violence continuing.</p>

  <p>The UK incorporated the UN Convention against Torture into UK law by the enactment of section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The Lord Advocate has not issued any guidance to the police on the investigation of torture.</p>

  <p>If the police have evidence that such crimes are being committed by persons physically present in Scotland they will be responsible for conducting an investigation. It would then be for the Procurator Fiscal to decide whether or not to bring proceedings.</p>

  <p>Torture, an attempt to commit torture, or conspiracy to commit torture are crimes punishable under Scots law at common law or under section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 by imprisonment for a maximum period of life imprisonment. Where evidence exists to support allegations that such crimes have been committed within Scottish jurisdiction, or that torture has been committed elsewhere by or at the instigation of a public official, the police will be responsible for conducting appropriate investigations and reporting such cases to the Procurator Fiscal.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Castlemilk Youth Complex is an independent organisation, and therefore the Scottish Executive does not hold comprehensive information about its funding streams. However, the Scottish Office Urban Programme provided funding for the cost of the building works when the Complex was established in 1994.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>The Scottish Executive makes provision for a range of funds that are targeted to help close the opportunity gap across Scotland, and lend support to community projects like the Castlemilk Youth Projects. The actual nature and method of the response may of course vary depending on the local circumstances. For Aberdeen City, aside from the local authority&rsquo;s mainstream programmes, the main funds currently available are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Community Regeneration Fund (CRF) - Aberdeen</p>
<p>The funding from the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Community Regeneration Fund is specifically targeted at the most deprived areas of the city - supporting services and projects which improve people&rsquo;s lives and the places they live. </p>
<p>For the period between 2005-06 and 2007-08 the Scottish Executive has allocated &pound;3.726 million through the Community Regeneration Fund to the Aberdeen City. This fund is managed by Aberdeen City&rsquo;s Community Planning Partnership (The Aberdeen City Alliance), and its key investment priorities are set out in their Regeneration Outcome Agreement which the Minister for Communities approved on 2 September 2005. This fund provides the partnership with the scope to allocate resources to a broad range of community supported projects, including where considered appropriate, projects like the one at Castlemilk, that are tailored to help and support the needs of our young people within their communities.</p>
<p>Wider Role - Aberdeen</p>
<p>A fund managed, supported and allocated by Communities Scotland area teams around the country. The funds are only available to registered social landlords or to voluntary organisations that are specifically supporting registered social landlords&rsquo; wider role activity.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The Communities Scotland Aberdeen office currently has an annual allocation of around &pound;0.6 million. Since 1998 Communities Scotland has provided financial support to the value of &pound;1.3 million to the Aberdeen Foyer, - through their sponsoring registered social landlord Grampian Housing Association.</p>

  <p>The Aberdeen Foyer is a successful local charitable organisation working with young people to prevent and alleviate youth homelessness and unemployment. In addition, they provide accommodation and access to wide range of educational, training, employment and community health services for young people. This project is now in its tenth year and has a turnover of close on &pound;3.5 million This year Communities Scotland is providing around &pound;0.29 million to help support five of the Aberdeen Foyer projects.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland have also given financial support to help the Torry Youth Caf&eacute; to expand their services for the young people in the Torry area of Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>In addition they are providing partnership investment funding alongside Aberdeen City Council and Scottish Enterprise Grampian to support the three Opportunity Gateway Houses in Aberdeen, and they place significant emphasis on the need to support and develop the younger people within our communities.</p>
