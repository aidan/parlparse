  <p>The funding of local alcohol addiction services operated by voluntary and charitable organisations is a matter for the health board and local authority.</p>

  <p>We are presently consulting on the development of a national Plan of Action on alcohol misuse, and expect to publish our plan at the end of this year. The plan will cover the whole spectrum of services that address alcohol problems: these should be flexible and responsive and delivered to a good standard. In keeping with <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i>', we envisage the voluntary sector playing a key role in influencing change and meeting needs, and we welcome the Salvation Army's continuing interest in offering social care services to those in need.</p>

  <p>Such plans have been proposed and rejected as any Government contribution would be tantamount to compensation. We have, however, secured and implemented an amendment to EC fish health legislation to allow fish to be withdrawn from infected farms at a rate determined by the level of disease present. It is our hope that the withdrawal scheme will enable compulsory slaughter to be an insurable risk and to this end my officials have had meetings with insurance industry representatives.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive published a report entitled <i>A Focus on</i> <i>Quality</i> in December 2000 which details the initiatives aimed at improving the quality of health care provided in Scotland, and the roles of the various organisations involved in clinical effectiveness activities in Scotland. These organisations include the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland, the Health Technology Board for Scotland, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and the Clinical Resource and Audit Group. Copies of the report were placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Following a commitment in <i>Our National Health</i>, further work is under way to map out the relationships between these national organisations, with a view to achieving better integration and co-ordination of all relevant bodies with an interest in clinical quality. The Chief Medical Officer is leading this work.</p>

  <p>As a result of a further commitment in <i>Our National Health</i>, the Chief Medical Officer asked Professor David Lawson to work with the Health Technology Board for Scotland and with local area drug and therapeutic committees on further steps to remove inequities in prescribing practice across Scotland. As a result of this, discussions are ongoing about local area drug and therapeutic committees working together as a Scottish Medicines Consortium.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to make hospital-acquired infection (HAI) a notifiable disease within the generally accepted use of the term under the Public Health (Notification of Infectious diseases) (Scotland) Regulations 1988. We are undertaking a comprehensive review of public health legislation in Scotland which is considering the system of notification of infections. But a HAI is an indication of where the patient acquired the illness rather than a specific medical condition. There are also considerable clinical uncertainties about the degree to which a HAI may contribute to death and in addition there can be uncertainties about the source of infections.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-06-05.20.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80132" speakername="Jackie Baillie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0605.htm#b7">

  <p>We consider that a forum of this sort is unnecessary, since local authorities have already established an HMO Benchmarking Group in which they can discuss problems and best practice relating to mandatory licensing of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs). Executive officials and the voluntary sector have established contacts with this group.</p>

  <p>The licensing structures set up by local authorities were informed by the guidance on the mandatory licensing of HMOs published by the Executive in September 2000. This guidance, which is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. no. 13706), was based partly on examples of best practice and it includes Benchmark Standards for safe, good quality accommodation, as well as information on tenancy management standards. However, under the provisions of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, it is the responsibility of each local authority to set reasonable licensing conditions.</p>

  <p>Under the 1982 Act it is also the responsibility of each local authority to set licensing fees for its area at a level sufficient to meet the expenses of the local authority in exercising its licensing functions under the Act. Details of fee levels are among the information currently being obtained from local authorities on the revised HMO licensing monitoring return.</p>

  <p>We have no substantive evidence that landlords are selling properties or evading licensing because of the level of fees. Information on any such trends, and on the impact of licence fees on landlords and tenants, will be sought in the course of a review of the first year of mandatory licensing of HMOs, which the Executive will be carrying out later this year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-13952 by Susan Deacon on 21 March 2201, in what ways access to the secure private networks on which individuals&#8217; medical records will be held will be controlled, with particular reference to the security of smartcard access to such networks.</p>

  <p>Access to NHSScotland secure private networks is permitted only to authorised users. Authority to access is given under an auditable Code of Connection which operates under strict criteria to protect the integrity of NHSScotland networks and information systems. Access by unauthorised parties to NHS networks is prevented by firewall facilities which screen attempted accesses to the network and reject those that are not authorised. Authorised users who gain access to the network cannot then obtain access to any information system without satisfying the access protocols for the individual information system and this would include systems containing individuals&#8217; medical records. Smartcards are not used in any way to access NHSScotland secure networks.</p>

  <p>It is for individual health boards and NHS Trusts to determine the level of funding required for investment in the improvement of facilities for clinical research, and the need for new dedicated facilities, from within available resources.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department does, however, play a major role in supporting the research conducted in such facilities through its &pound;31 million R&amp;D Support Fund. For example, approaching &pound;500,000 additional funding has been offered in the current financial year to the Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust to support the research being conducted in its Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility.</p>

  <p>The GCS provides or arranges car transport for the Scottish Ministers, Ministers of UK Government Departments when in Scotland, officials and visiting dignitaries. The same vehicle may be used to transport several different individuals on any given day. It is not therefore possible to identify separately the fuel costs for journeys made by Scottish Ministers.</p>

  <p>Since 1 August 2000 all GCS cars have been dual fuel which enables them to be run, whenever possible, on liquid petroleum gas (lpg) instead of unleaded petrol. Lpg is a cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative to unleaded petrol.</p>

  <p>When demand exceeds available GCS capacity, private hire cars and drivers are engaged from companies with which the GCS has standing arrangements. The cost of fuel is not separately identified within the cost of private hire cars.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-12809 by Susan Deacon on 7 February 2001, in what way degree nursing students, as distinct from diploma nursing students, receive significantly more financial support than students studying other disciplines.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-06-05.31.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0605.htm#b16">

  <p>Honours Degree student nurses receive assistance towards their living costs by way of a means-tested NHS bursary (which does not need to be repaid) and a non-means-tested student loan, in roughly equal proportions.</p>

  <p>Students studying other disciplines in Scotland get living cost support mainly through a (partly) means-tested loan, although students under 25 may be eligible for a new non-repayable Young Students' Bursary in the forthcoming academic session.</p>

  <p>Both types of students have their fees paid and may be eligible to apply for supplementary allowances which do not have to be repaid. However, nursing degree students will not be liable for the &pound;2,000 Graduate Endowment which other students starting their studies this year will have to pay on completion of their course.</p>

  <p>As a means test is involved to some extent for both sets of students, each individual's circumstances will dictate how much assistance they receive. However, because the NHS Bursary does not have to be repaid, nursing degree students are likely to have less debt in the form of student loan than their counterparts in other undergraduate disciplines.</p>

  <p>The main waste material within the Scottish Executive is waste paper. In addition to the items set out above, we also recycle the power packs from emergency lighting in Victoria Quay, but figures are not available for this. We have plans to introduce battery segregation and are investigating the possibility of recycling other plastics.</p>

  <p>In the year to March 2001, we recycled 38% of our waste, exceeding the target of 25% waste recycling for that year. Our revised target for recycling is to achieve 50% recycled waste by March 2002.</p>

  <p>* Figures for each year are not comparable because of a change in waste contractor between 1999-2000 and 2000-01 which resulted in a new and more appropriate way to measure waste and recycling.</p>

  <p>The draft Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill, as prepared by the Scottish Law Commission, does contain provisions applicable to shared equity sheltered housing. As it stands, the Bill would provide a power for a majority of the owners to dismiss a manager appointed by a developer after a period of 10 years (or after the sale of the last unit, whichever is the first) and for burdens requiring maintenance of common facilities to be enforced by a majority of owners. The details of these provisions are subject to the consultation exercise for the draft Bill, which was announced in the answer to question S1W-15380 on 1 May 2001.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is pursuing a wide-ranging programme of action to help meet the diverse needs of women travellers across Scotland. The Executive in particular plans to publish later this year a checklist to identify and address these needs for the use of central government, local authorities and transport operators in designing and implementing policies, programmes and services.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">why the central Scotland traffic model has not been applied to the proposal for an Aberdeen bypass until now, how much it will cost to apply the model to this proposal and how much of this cost it will meet.</a></p>

  <p>The area covered by the Central Scotland Transport Model has been extended gradually and since 1997 has covered from Dundee to Ayrshire. It is now intended to extend the area to Aberdeen and its environs. The extension of the model is a major exercise. The most practical and economical way to carry this out is in conjunction with other planned enhancements. This will form part of the re-tendering of the contract to maintain the model. The re-tendering is due to be completed by September.</p>

  <p>To extend the model to Aberdeen requires extensive data collection in Aberdeen and its environs, followed by an extension of the structure of the model, and finally a calibration and validation exercise for the extended model. Data collection will be carried out this month and in October.</p>

  <p>I announced during my visit to Aberdeen on 14 March that the cost of this to the Executive would be around &pound;0.5 million and work since then has confirmed that figure.</p>
