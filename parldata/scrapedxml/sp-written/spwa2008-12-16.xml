  <p>The success of the national team often energises the public and could potentially act as a catalyst for individuals to be involved with the game or renew a participatory interest.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not held any discussions with the Scottish Football Association regarding the rules determining entitlement to play for the national team and their application.</p>

  <p>We continue to urge all NHS boards, including NHS Lothian, to make progress to achieve the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland clinical standard that 70% of all patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of stroke are admitted to a stroke unit within 24 hours of presentation at hospital. NHS boards are expected to work with their stroke Managed Clinical Network on meeting this and the other stroke service standards.</p>

  <p>In October, NHS board chief executives were asked to provide details of the action they are taking to address issues such as this where the stroke audit identified the need for improvement. The replies will be assessed by the National Advisory Committee on Stroke.</p>

  <p>Promoting Scotland as a place to live, learn and invest complements Scotland&rsquo;s role as a responsible nation. The Scottish Government will continue to ensure that, through the work of Scottish Development International and the building of strong business and education aspects to major overseas ministerial visits, a strong economic dimension is a key part of its overseas international activities. Visits on these terms to North America, China, Norway and Russia have already been undertaken. During that same period, the Scottish Government has announced increased funds for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s International Development Policy published in May 2008, which sets out how Scotland will play its part in alleviating global poverty.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing&rsquo;s statements on 11 September 2008 that a buy-out of the PFI contract for car parking at Ninewells Hospital &quot;would cost tens of millions of pounds&quot; ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 10734 and 10736) and subsequent notification in a letter dated 12 November 2008 to Marlyn Glen MSP that this estimated cost emerged in a telephone conversation between her officials and representatives of NHS Tayside, for what reason the cabinet secretary is unable to provide a copy of the written record of the telephone conversation, as stated in a letter to Marlyn Glen dated 18 November 2008.</p>

  <p>The written record of the conversation contained officials&rsquo; initial assessment of the potential negotiating position of the PFI provider. It would undermine NHS Tayside&rsquo;s negotiating position if that figure was in the public domain and therefore it is not in the public interest to release it.</p>

  <p>Since my previous answer further progress has been made and at the end of November the number waiting for arrears had come down to 5,534.</p>

  <p>To put this into context, the effective date of introduction of Agenda for Change was 1 October 2004. When the current administration took office in May 2007, 124,381 staff had been assimilated and 59% of these had been assessed for arrears with these paid where appropriate. By the end of November 2008, the number assimilated had increased to 175,004 and the percentage who had received payment of arrears had been increased to 93%.</p>

  <p>Boards are currently working hard to try to have all substantive staff assimilated by the end of the year. Thereafter, I would expect boards to ensure payment of arrears are processed as early as possible in the new year. Progress will be monitored on a monthly basis.</p>

  <p>Valuation reports prepared by the Government Actuarial Department (GAD) for the Scottish Teachers&rsquo; Superannuation Scheme for the period 2001 to 2005 and for the NHS Superannuation Scheme for Scotland for the period 1999 to 2004 have been laid before the Scottish Parliament today. Copies have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 47169 &ndash;NHS and 47170 - STSS).</p>

  <p>The report on the NHS scheme concluded that a reduction in the employer contribution rate from 14% to 13.5% was appropriate from 1 April 2009.</p>

  <p>The report on the teachers&rsquo; scheme concluded that an increase in the employer contribution rate from 13.5% to 14.9% was required from 1 April 2009. This is mainly as a result of increased longevity and an increase in the ill-health and early retirement numbers beyond previous actuarial assumptions.</p>

  <p>Both valuations take account of recent changes to schemes which increase the pension age for new public servants from 60 to 65 and other miscellaneous changes to the benefits provided to members.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to ensure that information on offenders&rsquo; learning difficulties is provided (a) to the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) on admission to and (b) by the SPS to community services on discharge from custody.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-12-16.S3W-18591.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1216.htm#12">

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Social Enquiry Reports and Trial Judge Reports may make reference to learning difficulty/disability issues. The SPS receive both reports and will follow up this information providing the prisoner consents to information being requested from their GP or other community based providers. Additionally, the SPS relies on prisoners self disclosing diagnosis of learning difficulty.</p>

  <p>Where a prisoner is subject to post-release supervision community service providers are involved in the multi-agency Integrated Case Management (ICM) Community Integration Planning (CIP) process. The involvement of community service providers to this planning process facilitates two way communications of relevant information regarding learning difficulties/disabilities between the community and the SPS, including post release information.</p>

  <p>In addition discharge summaries are sent to the GP&rsquo;s where prisoner&rsquo;s GP information is known and the prisoner wishes such information to be shared. In specific cases of extreme learning difficulty/disability which could affect the prisoner&rsquo;s return to the community, a Care Programme Approach as used by the NHS may be initiated prior to the prisoner&rsquo;s release from prison.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>All convicted prisoners receive an initial Core Screen interview as part of the Integrated Case Management (ICM) process within 72 hours of admission. This process can highlight specific needs including learning difficulties but relies on self disclosure by the prisoner. The initial Core Screening interview forms the start of the process which can lead to referrals to specialist service providers including education and health care within the prison.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Core Screen interview convicted prisoners also complete a literacy alerting tool which can establish if a prisoner has potential literacy learning needs, this may also highlight potential learning difficulties.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the SPS Health Care Standard 1, all prisoners have a physical, mental health, and addictions screening on admission to custody. There is no specific health care screening tool in place to identify learning difficulties.</p>
