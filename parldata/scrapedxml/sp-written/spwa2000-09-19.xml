  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>An application for scheduled monument consent in respect of emergency stabilisation works to the north-west curtain wall of Caisteal Tioram was received on 27 April. Consent was granted on 19 May, subject to conditions, and it is understood that the works have now been carried out.</p>

  <p>An earlier application for scheduled monument consent for the conservation of Caisteal Tioram, which includes the consolidation of the curtain wall and the consolidation and re-roofing of the standing buildings, was received on 23 February 1999. On 30 April 1999 the applicants were informed that the Secretary of State (now Scottish Ministers) was minded to refuse consent for this restoration. The applicants have exercised their right to ask for a hearing, which will take the form of a public local inquiry. The Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit is now making arrangements for the inquiry.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The above figures relate to routine appointments only.</p>

  <p>Routine screening appointments cover women who have been invited, by the screening programme, to attend a standard appointment. This usually occurs once every three years.</p>

  <p>I have commissioned a task group to look at the detail of extending the upper age of routine invitation for breast screening and to prepare an implementation plan. I expect the group&#8217;s plan to include advice on a number of issues including timescale and mobile and static screening unit requirements. I look forward to receiving the group&#8217;s plan by spring 2001.</p>

  <p>As part of the additional &pound;26 million health promotion fund which I announced on 20 August the breast screening service will receive &pound;160,000 this year for film viewing and x-ray equipment which will be required to assist with the future development of the programme.</p>

  <p>The information is not available centrally in the format requested.</p>

  <p>Cancer is one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) have developed core principles for all cancer services and tumour specific standards for breast (and colorectal, lung and gynaecological) cancer.</p>

  <p>Pilot assessment of these standards (including breast cancer) has been completed, with formal reviews due to commence later this year. The CSBS will publish reports on their assessments.

  <p>Cancer is one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cancer Group leads and directs Scotland&#8217;s cancer strategy. A broad range of initiatives is being pursued with the aim of providing the best quality care possible for everyone with cancer. For example;</p>

  <p>Cancer Managed Clinical Networks, peer reviewing patient outcomes and sharing good practice, to ensure access to best care possible regardless of where patients live.</p>

  <p>Underpinning these networks are systems of prospective clinical audit, ensuring clinicians have access to the information they require to continuously assess and improve the care provided.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland has developed generic and tumour specific standards for all cancer services. Pilot assessments have recently been carried out, and full assessments will commence later this year. These standards are evidence based, founded as they are on the SIGN Guideline for Breast Cancer.</p>

  <p>Under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, the child&#8217;s interests are paramount. A case currently before the Inner House of the Court of Session challenges various aspects of the Children&#8217;s Hearing System and will help determine the system&#8217;s compatibility with the Convention.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued a guidance leaflet in July to all panel members and other interested parties. Children&#8217;s Panel Training Organisers have run a number of training courses and more are planned. Practice Guidance established by Children&#8217;s Panel Chairmen and the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration is being reviewed and will be sent to all panel members before 2 October. The Scottish Executive Circular on Children&#8217;s Hearings which advises on, among other things, procedural matters in respect of the recruitment of panel members has been also been reviewed and will be issued shortly.</p>

  <p>Children and their relevant persons involved in the hearings system may be entitled to advice and assistance under legal aid. The Children&#8217;s Hearing itself is a non-adversarial forum to discuss what is best for the child. The precise status of a hearing and whether there is an entitlement under the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights to legal aid for representation is one aspect of the case currently before the Court of Session. The Scottish Executive is challenging the case and will await the judgment before reviewing arrangements for legal aid.</p>

  <p>Ten regulations, with Regulatory Impact Assessments covering the impact on business, have been introduced since 1 July 1999. No RIA&#8217;s have been prepared with respect to the removal of regulations. A meaningful assessment of the cost to business is not available since in many instances information about specific cost implications has not proven possible to obtain.

  <p>The attached note provides a summary of the responses to the consultation on <i>Investing in You</i> .</p>

  <p>SUMMARY OF CONSULTATION RESPONSES ON <i>INVESTING IN YOU</i></p>

  <p>When the Annual Expenditure Report, <i>Investing in You</i>, was published in April 2000, the Scottish Executive invited members of the public to respond with their views on the proposed budget for 2001-02. The result of that consultation is set out below. The Minister for Finance also visited four areas of Scotland to meet with an invited audience and hear their views on the proposed budget. The questions asked and the broad themes that emerged are also set out.</p>

  <p><u>Written submissions</u></p>

  <p>172 letters, postcards or e-mails were received during the consultation period. Of these, 134 (79%) were from members of the public. (Of these, 23 identified themselves as farmers, five as students, one as a general practitioner, one as a vet and one as an academic.) Seventeen responses were received from charities, societies and pressure groups, nine from public bodies, four from professional bodies, three from trade unions and two each from community councils and trade or representative bodies. Two responses were also received from members of the Scottish Parliament, one of which covered a petition from constituents.</p>

  <p>A small number of responses (mostly from organisations) made comments on the layout and presentation of the consultation document. The vast majority, however, made comments about areas where additional expenditure should be devoted. Many of these were from a particular perspective and there appear to be four distinct campaigns for additional spending. There was no support for reduced spending.</p>

  <p>In addition to a submission from Shelter (Scotland), we also received 26 postcards distributed by that organisation. In addition to the petition on behalf of improving roads in South Lanarkshire submitted a local MSP, a number of members of the public from Lanarkshire also wrote in support of additional road spending. Some 31 people, predominantly farmers and cattle societies, wrote in support of additional expenditure for biological and agricultural research in Scotland and predominantly for the Moredun Research Institute. Finally, we received a number of e-mails from university students in favour of better student support. In total, around 122 of the letters or communications were specific about areas that required additional spending.</p>

  <p>The 10 most popular groups (including apparent campaigns mentioned above) that received support for additional public spending were:</p>

  <p>The remaining responses included support for law and order, local government services, nursery nurses and parental care, victim support, the voluntary sector, small businesses, reduced water charges, reduced council tax, improving civic participation and assistance for Belarussian children.</p>

  <p>The summary attempts to encapsulate the main responses that were contained in the correspondence. Many people, in addition to their particular point expressed a continuing support for investment in health and education.</p>

  <p><u>Feedback from awaydays</u></p>

  <p>The audiences for the awaydays were an invited group of local representatives including Councillors, and council officials, those from the communities, voluntary sector activists, the farming and fishing industries, enterprise and business, education, trades unions, the health services and social work.</p>

  <p>The following issues were raised consistently by a number of questioners across all four venues.</p>

  <p><u>Issues raised at awaydays</u></p>

  <p>Local government funding - difficulties for rural areas in general and for services such as fire in particular.</p>

  <p>Older people - importance of social work and properly funding care in the community.</p>

  <p>Voluntary sector - must ensure it is properly supported because of value added to public services.</p>

  <p>Transport - critical to economy, so must give more priority to roads and public transport.</p>

  <p>Drugs - much increase profile of drugs problems, also fund rehabilitation, increased policing essential.</p>

  <p>Health - NHS funding should be increased to improve services.</p>

  <p>Education - support frontline services, reduce ring fencing, when responding to McCrone.</p>

  <p>Rural affairs - ensure modulation doesn&#8217;t cut farm incomes, representations for farmers on National Park Boards, new fishing vessels.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the farm-scale evaluation programme is precisely to determine the environmental implications of growing GM crops under tightly controlled and closely monitored conditions. Consent was granted for this site to participate in the trial programme following safety assurances from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) that the crop does not pose a threat to public health or environmental safety.</p>

  <p>Separation distances have been put in place around the trial crop to minimise the possibility of cross-pollination with other related species. These distances are increased between the respective GM crop and a certified organic crop of oilseed rape. There is no safety or scientific justification for an organic farmer losing his organic status as a result of a farm-scale trial in the vicinity.</p>

  <p>The programme of farm-scale evaluations, including the site at Munlochy, is important and scientifically rigorous research that will provide information to evaluate any long-term effects of growing GM crops under normal agricultural conditions.</p>

  <p>To ensure that the data collected through these evaluations is representative of UK agricultural conditions an independent Scientific Steering Committee selected sites with a wide range of geographical, ecological and agricultural conditions. By selecting the Munlochy site, the committee (which includes members from the RSPB and the natural heritage agencies) has ensured that the distinctive ecology of the area is included within the research programme. As winter oilseed rape is widely grown in the north of Scotland, the site will provide valuable data on the possible impact on biodiversity, whether positive or negative, of growing a GM variety on a commercial scale in this region.</p>

  <p>The scientific information obtained from the Munlochy trial, together with data from the UK evaluation programme, will enable informed views to be reached before decisions are taken on possible wider commercial use.</p>

  <p>SCIMAC (the Supply Chain Initiative on Modified Agricultural Crops) took responsibility for liaising with farmers to locate potential sites. The independent Scientific Steering Committee, which oversees the programme of farm-scale evaluations, then selected, from those put forward by SCIMAC, farms to be included the UK winter programme. Their selection included the farm near Munlochy.</p>

  <p>Following that initial selection, the decision, by the Scottish Executive, to grant consent for the Munlochy site was taken after consultation with the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE), the Food Standards Agency, the Health and Safety Executive, the natural heritage agencies including Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency (SASA).</p>

  <p>Although the legislation under which this application was submitted does not require a formal public consultation process the public was notified of the proposed site by a Scottish Executive press announcement on 3 August and a statutory notice placed in the local press on 7 August.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers have met representatives of the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland once since 1 June 1999. I met the board on 22 November 1999 when the following issues were discussed:</p>

  <p>the importance of the built heritage in educational services;</p>

  <p>the contribution of the built heritage to regeneration, particularly of rural areas;</p>

  <p>the long-term future of the local authority archaeology service in Scotland;</p>

  <p>resources available to support the built heritage, and</p>

  <p>the National Cultural Strategy.</p>

  <p>That meeting was mentioned in paragraph 2 of the board&#8217;s annual report for 1999 which was laid before the Scottish Parliament by the Scottish Ministers in May 2000. I have arranged to meet representatives of the board again on 4 October 2000 to discuss their annual report for 1999.</p>

  <p>The enabling legislation received Royal Assent on 9 August. The next steps in setting up our first Scottish National Parks are those set out in sections 1-3 of the Act. I am pleased to announce that today I am setting that process in motion by publishing National Park proposals, under section 2(1) of the Act, for National Parks in Loch Lomond and the Trossachs and in the Cairngorms, and asking for a public consultation on these proposals.</p>

  <p>I have decided to ask Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) to act as a reporter, under the terms of section 3 of the Act, and to carry out consultations on both proposals. They have previous experience of consultative work on National Parks, leading to their advice to Government in 1999. This required extensive consultation with a wide range of organisations and individuals, and using a range of mechanisms involving both written documents and public meetings. The Requirements I am today issuing, directing them to undertake this work, set out clearly the particular requirements that a number of MSPs raised during the passage of the Bill, including that statutory consultees must receive copies of the consultation documents, that the consultation should be conducted in a participatory way, and that SNH must develop and report on the basis of objective criteria and methodology. Further details are given in the Requirement documents themselves. I am placing copies of these and the proposals in the Parliament&#8217;s Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Consultees can expect to hear from SNH shortly as they take forward the consultation.</p>

  <p>I have asked SNH to provide written reports to me, on the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs proposal by 15 March 2001, and on the Cairngorms proposal by 9 July 2001. Both reports will be published, and laid before the Scottish Parliament. After that, I will consider the case for bringing forward a consultation draft of a designation order in each case.</p>

  <p>Depending on the outcome of these consultations, I would hope that the first National Park in Loch Lomond and the Trossachs could be established on 1 April 2002, and the second in the Cairngorms by 1 January 2003.</p>

  <p>The extent of new financial support for the textile industry since the Scottish Textile Forum was established on 12 June 2000 depends on the demand from industry to initiate new projects eligible for support, rather than the availability of funds. A variety of projects, including those to support exports, training, marketing, innovation and e-commerce are currently being developed by the Enterprise Network and the textile industry, but it is too early to report on how many of these will proceed and how much public support they will attract.</p>

  <p>None, Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) has only been available to companies in the Scottish Borders since July this year, when the new Assisted Areas map was announced. The new map covers much of Hawick, Galashiels and Kelso, where a number of textiles companies are located. Under the RSA scheme, grants are typically paid in instalments linked to implementation of projects across a number of years. Accordingly, while discussions about RSA have recently taken place with several such firms, no grant has yet been paid out.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, a public body would not publicise the sum of money set aside for contingency before or during a major capital project in order to protect its negotiating position. This is in line with standard public procurement guidance and my answer to question S1W-233 is consistent with that position. However, in the context of the debate surrounding the project in March this year the SPCB took the view that it was of paramount importance to publish the Spencely report in full and thereby put all available financial information before Parliament at a time when the future of the Holyrood Project was being considered.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Procurement Manual states that <i>&quot;</i> openness and accessibility must be promoted except where the disclosure of commercially sensitive information would be likely to cause significant damage to the legitimate commercial interests of a supplier or tenderer or of the Scottish Parliament.&quot; <i> </i> and at paragraph 2.30 that &quot;the <i> </i> protection of private and sensitive third party information will be strictly observed.&quot; <i>. </i> The Procurement Manual is based on guidance from EC Procurement Directives which advise that, &quot;certain information on (a) contract may, in certain cases, not be published where release of such information would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private, or might prejudice fair competition between contractors.&quot; HM Treasury Procurement Guidance states that &quot;information provided by tenderers should be regarded and treated as confidential&quot; and that <i>&quot;</i> price and other details must not be revealed in a way that enables the information to be seen as applying to an offer from a particular firm&quot;. <i> </i> All Parliament tenders are issued and submitted on a commercially confidential basis, and disclosure would also therefore be in breach of the individual tender agreements.</p>

  <p>The SPCB and the HPG recognise that there is a balance to be struck between the principles of openness and accountability and the need to safeguard against prejudicing the commercial interests of both client and contractor. Having considered this matter carefully, we remain of the view that the value of individual contracts relating to the Holyrood project should not be made publicly available while the possibility remains of similar packages being tendered. In due course, and with the consent of the relevant contractors, it may become appropriate to release information of this nature.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, <a name="QuestionText"> further to the answer to question S1W-579 by the Presiding Officer on 3 August 1999, whether that answer was based on advice from the Holyrood project team; whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) now accepts, following the Spencely Report&#8217;s use of benchmarking, that it is a recognised technique for achieving best value in construction procurement to produce comparable construction costs; whether the SPCB now has access to the information requested in question S1W-579 and what use it expects to make of bench-marking during the remainder of the implementation period for the Holyrood project.</a></p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body remains of the opinion that to compare the construction costs of recent major public works projects in Scotland such as schools, museums, hospitals, courts, offices etc with a Parliament building would be inadvisable. Spencely&#8217;s &quot;rough and ready&quot; comparisons of &quot;fit out&quot; and different building usage areas were indicative and fit for the purpose of his report. Indeed, he makes it clear that he had difficulty finding &quot;comparable equivalents&quot; for two of the three examples used. The SPCB and the Holyrood Progress Group are of the view that to commission a full exercise to obtain and collate such information - which is not readily available - would be time consuming, expensive and unlikely to lead to any meaningful conclusions. My answer to question S1W-579 on 3 August 1999 took full account of advice from Scottish Parliament officials including the Holyrood Project Team.</p>
