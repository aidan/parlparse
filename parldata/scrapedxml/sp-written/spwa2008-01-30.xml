  <p>The Scottish Government has a range of statutory measures in place to support the control of notifiable diseases. In addition, it works in close partnership with stakeholder organisations to promote proactive approaches to non notifiable diseases.</p>

  <p>Animal Health and Welfare Management Programmes have been an important element in the promotion of animal health and welfare in Scotland. They are, however, only one element in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s work to promote good practice and raise standards. Individual animal keepers remain the best placed to promote good animal health and welfare.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to working to get animal health and welfare management programmes restored to the Scotland Rural Development Programme for future years. In the meantime, those producers who have already signed up to the scheme will continue to be supported throughout their five year commitment.</p>

  <p>Yes. As part of the commitment to reinstate the animal health and welfare scheme, I am writing to Mariann Fischer Boel to highlight the importance the Scottish Government places in this measures and obtain greater clarity on the Commission&rsquo;s issues.</p>

  <p>The registration service in Scotland is delivered by the 32 local authorities who are responsible for employing registration staff. Registrars are trained to perform a number of duties such as civil marriage ceremonies and civil partnership registrations. The necessary training is provided by the local authorities in accordance with guidance on the law and practice of registration issued by the General Register Office for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Yes. Local authorities have the discretion to reduce or retain the council tax discount on second homes and long-term empty properties to between 10% and 50%. The additional income is retained locally and routed through registered social landlords for the provision of new-build affordable social housing to meet locally determined priorities.</p>

  <p>The crime of Manslaughter exists under English law and in other jurisdictions but is not a crime known to the law of Scotland. The nearest similar crime under Scots Law is that of Culpable Homicide. Figures for culpable homicide have therefore been used in this answer.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-01-30.S3W-8716.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0130.htm#6">

  <p>Information on the incidence (diagnosis of new cases) of diabetes is not held centrally. This is because data on the date of diagnosis is still largely incomplete and unreliable in diabetes registers. There are, however, some specific research studies that have reported on the incidence of diabetes using research registers. For example, the Scottish Study Group for the Care of diabetes in the young reported on the incidence of type 1 diabetes in children (Rangasami JJ, Greenwood DC, McSporran B, Smail PJ, Patterson CC, Waugh NR. Rising incidence of type 1 diabetes in Scottish children, 1984-93. The Scottish Study Group for the Care of Young Diabetics. Arch.Dis.Child 1997;77:210-3). As far as we are aware, these studies have not included information on ethnicity.</p>

  <p>Information on the prevalence (number of cases of diabetes in the population at a particular point in time) of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in each NHS board area is available from the annual Scottish Diabetes Survey. This survey includes data from primary and secondary care and is currently the most comprehensive source of information on diabetes in Scotland. The survey was first published in 2001. The most recent report (for 2005) is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.diabetesinscotland.org/diabetes/MaintainPages/pdfFiles/SDS2005.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.diabetesinscotland.org/diabetes/MaintainPages/pdfFiles/SDS2005.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Information about ethnic differences in diabetes prevalence is not currently available at a national level. In the 2005 Scottish Diabetes Survey, data about ethnicity was only available for around a quarter of all patients. This would not give reliable breakdowns by ethnic group. The Diabetes Action Plan (Scottish Government, 2006) set a target that all areas should have a record of ethnicity for over 80% of patients on the register by the end of 2008.</p>

  <p>However, A report by the National Resource Centre for Ethnic Minority Health (NRCEMH) describes the prevalence of diabetes among ethnic minority groups in Glasgow and reports that diabetes prevalence was particularly high among Pakistani people see:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.nrcemh.nhsscotland.com/pdfs/Full Diabetes Report.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.nrcemh.nhsscotland.com/pdfs/Full%20Diabetes%20Report.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Also, a study of diabetes among ethnic minorities in Tayside NHS Board area found that the prevalence of diabetes among South Asians was almost twice as high as that in the non-South Asian population see:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Health Observatory (ScotPHO) website (<a href="http://www.scotpho.org.uk" target="_blank">www.scotpho.org.uk</a>) provides a guide to further sources of information on diabetes in Scotland, under the Health, Wellbeing and Disease tab at <a href="http://www.scotpho.org.uk/home/Healthwell-beinganddisease/Diabetes/diabetes_keypoints.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotpho.org.uk/home/Healthwell-beinganddisease/Diabetes/diabetes_keypoints.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>The extension of the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005, to cover doctors, nurses and midwives whenever they are on duty, fulfilled a manifesto commitment. Although no additional consultation was undertaken, the arguments of different stakeholders have been well rehearsed when the act was originally debated in Parliament in 2005.</p>

  <p>The deal secured at the EU December Council was good for Scotland&rsquo;s fishing industry and good for Scotland&rsquo;s marine environment. It was also positive for all other parts of the UK, and I was pleased with the positive collaborative working, particularly with my ministerial colleague from Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>The UK line would have been less persuasive and less well articulated, and the deal less beneficial for the UK fishing industry as a whole, without the effective, informed input of the Scottish Government. If Scotland had a seat at the Brussels negotiating table, that input would be even more influential, both during the autumn negotiations and, critically, in shaping the debate throughout the year. There would also be better negotiating processes, with a more transparent, systematic and proactive approach to preparing the negotiations in close and open collaboration with stakeholders across the UK.</p>

  <p>There is little to be gained by speculating on what specific outcomes might have been different. A key strength of the preparations undertaken by the Scottish Government was the intensive engagement with the fishing industry. From this it was clear that there should have been earlier acceptance across the UK of the merits of the approach behind Scotland&rsquo;s Conservation Credits Scheme. I am delighted that the benefits of our approach have now been fully recognised by the UK Government and the English fishing industry as a better way to bring about reductions in cod mortality. Had this position been adopted earlier, an even more persuasive and transparent message could have been sent out to the European Commission and other member states about the UK&rsquo;s position.</p>

  <p>Local connection is not a statutory criterion for social housing allocation in Scotland. Social landlords are required by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 to admit anyone over 16 to their housing list who lives in their area or has one of a list of reasons for wanting to move to the area. Guidance on the 2001 act makes clear that applicants for housing should not be debarred because they have no local connection with an area, although local connection might be a factor in determining priority.</p>

  <p>Scottish homelessness legislation allows local connection to be taken into account in determining which local authority has a duty towards a homeless household. The Homelessness (Scotland) Act 2003 introduced powers for Scottish ministers to modify the relevant provisions. The Scottish Government will discuss the exercise of these powers with local authorities, following concerns raised during a consultation exercise carried out by the previous administration and also during the Homelessness 2012 Support Project sponsored by the Association of Local Authority Chief Housing Officers and the Scottish Government.</p>

We will continue to work with all sectors of the industry to help better understand the various potential issues surrounding EID of sheep within the Scottish context.

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to work with all agricultural industry stakeholders through the joint Government/industry working group on electronic identification (EID). The industry stakeholders provided their time and resource to earlier trials which formed part of the UK Evidence Report. We urged the Commission to take account of the report in seeking a delay for the introduction of EID on 1 January 2008 as laid out in EU Council Regulation 21/2004. The Commission recommended that the introduction of EID be delayed until 31 December 2009 and we believe that was because of the extensive lobbying and representations by both the Scottish Government and industry stakeholders. The Scottish Government will continue to work with industry stakeholders and the Commission to find a workable and affordable EID system for the industry taking account of the unique stratified nature of the Scottish sheep movement system.</p>

  <p>Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources to this area, the specific amounts allocated to local government for Early Years and Childcare Workforce Development from 2003 to 2007 were as follows:</p>
