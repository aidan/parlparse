  <p>The Scottish Airports and Air Services study report has now been submitted to the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Scottish Executive. The findings from this study, from the other United Kingdom regional studies and from the UK Regional Air Services Co-ordination Study will be taken forward in consultation papers to be published later this year. In Scotland the consultation paper will be issued by the Scottish Executive in conjunction with DETR and will be laid before the Scottish Parliament; copies will be made available to the Transport and Environment Committee. The Executive will take account of the responses to the consultation exercise, including any from the Scottish Parliament and its committee, before formulating any response to the UK Government. Any representations by the Executive which deal with matters reserved to the UK Parliament will require to be made in confidence in the same way as representations received by the Scottish Executive would be treated.</p>

  <p>Cancer is one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland. As noted in my reply to question S1W-3216 (also from Mr Harding), workforce planning is an integral part of the planning cycle for the NHS in Scotland. To provide continuity of care for patients, specialist medical staffing is monitored annually to ensure appropriate numbers of doctors undertake higher specialist training in each specialty to be eligible for consultant posts becoming vacant.</p>

  <p>This year&#8217;s annual joint review by the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education has agreed that the number of Specialist Registrar posts in medical and clinical oncology should increase by five and seven respectively, bringing the totals to 17 and 23.</p>

  <p>Later this year results will be available from the exercise commissioned by the Scottish Cancer Group to model predictive trends in cancer incidence over the next 10 years. It is envisaged that this will inform future service and workforce planning.</p>

  <p>As was made clear in the debate on 17 May, the concept of Managed Clinical Networks has the potential to bring about significant improvements in services for those with epilepsy. The Scottish Executive Health Department has therefore been encouraging clinicians and the voluntary sector to develop the idea of such networks.</p>

  <p>Our <i>Programme for Government</i> sets out our commitment to ensuring that access to health services must be determined by need and not by place of residence.</p>

  <p>We are taking that forward in a number of ways. We are setting up the Health Technology Board for Scotland to ensure that effective new treatments can move swiftly into mainstream NHS use across Scotland as a whole. Implemented against a background of clinical governance, this single source of advice should help eliminate so-called &quot;post-code prescribing&quot;.</p>

  <p>The work of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme provides clinicians across Scotland with authoritative advice on specific topics. The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland&#8217;s emphasis on national agreement of clinical standards for specific conditions is a further way of encouraging uniform provision of high quality health care across Scotland.</p>

  <p>In primary care, the Local Health Care Co-operatives (LHCC) Best Practice Group provides a vehicle for looking at access to primary care. Many LHCCs have already undertaken needs assessments for their localities, often in conjunction with the public health departments of their local health board. This enables them to find local answers to local problems, making sure health care resources are targeted on those who need a particular service or treatment.</p>

  <p>In the acute sector, there is an important role for Managed Clinical Networks in promoting access to services, as locally as possible where that can be done without compromising patient safety. The system of designating certain services on a national basis helps ensure patients have access to highly complex but low volume procedures regardless of where in Scotland they happen to live.</p>

  <p><i>The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme</i> report was issued to health boards on the basis that it provided valuable advice and evidence relevant to the prevention, detection and management of osteoporosis.

  <p>There are no formal structures at the national level to monitor and evaluate programmes to reduce the incidence of falls amongst those with low bone density. There are, however, a number of local projects aimed at reducing falls amongst those most at risk. Responsibility for monitoring and evaluating such projects rests at the local level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme report was issued to health boards on the basis that it provided valuable advice and evidence relevant to the prevention, detection and management of osteoporosis. It is the responsibility of individual health boards to decide what action is required in their area, taking into account all available advice on the subject of osteoporosis and the needs of the local population.</p>

  <p>The press release was referring to differences between Scotland and England in methods of surveillance of the incidence of patients consulting general practitioners about &quot;flu-like symptoms&quot;.</p>

  <p>When a patient consults a general practitioner it cannot be determined immediately whether the &quot;flu-like symptoms&quot; are due to influenza or some other cause and it takes time for confirmatory tests to be carried out. Nevertheless, such consultations are counted in order to provide an immediate picture from week to week, so as to determine as early as possible whether numbers of cases are growing.</p>

  <p>The surveillance scheme co-ordinated by the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health counts &quot;consultation for &lsquo;flu-like illness&quot; whereas the English scheme counts &quot;first consultation for &lsquo;flu-like illness&quot;. Despite this difference, reporting rates are classified using similar criteria. Because they are categorised in the same way in Scotland and England, influenza rates can legitimately be compared.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not intend to commission a supplementary report on the potential impact on tourism of reopening the Borders railway. This issue was addressed in the full Borders railway feasibility study which concluded that full reinstatement of the line beyond central Borders would incur very high additional capital costs in return for capturing little additional demand. When analysing the impact on tourism of reopening the line, the report did not rule out the possible southerly extension of the line as a tourist attraction.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive intends the Glasgow Southern Orbital and the M77 from Fenwick to Malletsheugh to be procured as a single Public/Private Partnership should East Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire Councils be successful in obtaining the necessary statutory powers to construct the Glasgow Southern Orbital at the public inquiry.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the reason is for the 43% increase in water charges for Band D customers in 2000-01 by North of Scotland Water Authority, and whether the increase is consistent with the Minister for Transport and the Environment&#8217;s announcement that the overall revenue increase for the authority for that period would be 35%.</p>

  <p>When the authority was set up in 1996, it inherited a range of water and wastewater charges from the various councils. It has gradually moved to harmonise charges throughout its area. With the new charges for 2000-01, this process is now complete for domestic customers. In addition there has been some rebalancing of charges from non-domestic to domestic customers to reflect actual costs. Taken together, these factors have meant that charges for some groups of customers have risen by more than 35% to bring them into line with the rest of the area. Charges for some other groups have risen by less than 35%.</p>

  <p>This approach is entirely consistent with a requirement for a total revenue increase from all customers of no more than 35%, needed to meet very significant investment needs of the authority.</p>
