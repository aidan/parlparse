  <p>Young people's drinking is increasing. In the latest survey 23% of 13-year-olds and 46% of 15-year-olds reported that they had drunk alcohol in the previous week. This upward trend is very worrying and reducing harmful drinking by children and young people is one of the key priorities of the Plan for Action on alcohol problems.</p>

  <p>There are currently no targets for reducing binge drinking and alcohol-related deaths.</p>

  <p>Subject to national priorities and Health Department guidance, it is for NHS boards to assess the needs of their local populations, including those who suffer from chronic liver failure, and to allocate their considerable resources to provide services to meet those needs. The Health Department has, however, been in discussion with relevant Scottish clinicians and the voluntary sector about the development of regional Managed Clinical Networks (MCNs) for the treatment of patients with hepatitis C. In the near future I expect the clinicians to submit an application to the department for funding to initiate the establishment of such MCNs.</p>

  <p>The Executive currently provides &#163;8.1 million to NHS boards across Scotland to assist them in their work to prevent the spread of all bloodborne viruses, including hepatitis C.</p>

  <p>On 4 July last year, the Health Department staged a conference to highlight and discuss the long-term issues around care and service delivery for those affected by hepatitis C. At the conference, a new hepatitis C information pack for professionals and a leaflet for patients was launched. This information provides helpful and accurate advice on hepatitis C and clarifies certain issues, which are often misunderstood.</p>

  <p>As is made clear in Appendix 3 to Health Department Letter (2002) 69 <i>Promoting the Development of Managed Clinical Networks in NHSScotland</i> , lead clinicians of managed clinical networks are ultimately accountable to the chief executive of the organisation which employs them. Each network must have a protocol in place dealing with this and other clinical governance arrangements.</p>

  <p>GPs do not usually refer patients directly to a chiropractor, although there may be some local arrangements in place for NHS referral. GPs can advise patients about seeing a chiropractor, and provide information about registered practitioners, after discussion about the management options of their condition. It is for the patient to decide whether they wish to pay for chiropractic treatment or be referred, for example, to physiotherapy services.</p>

  <p>Information on chiropractors employed by the NHS is not held centrally.</p>
