  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive on what dates it has spoken with (a) retailers and (b) COSLA regarding the (i) proposed powers to enable local licensing boards to raise the minimum age limit for off-trade sales to 21 and (ii) possibility of introducing community alcohol partnership schemes similar to that trialled at St Neots in Cambridgeshire and what these discussions included.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government ministers and officials have had a number of meetings with individual retailers and representative bodies on all aspects of the Alcohol Framework both during the consultation phase and since the Alcohol Bill has been published. In particular, the Scottish Government has held quarterly meetings with the Scottish Government Alcohol Industry Partnership (SGAIP) of which the Scottish Retail Consortium and the Scottish Grocers Federation are members.</p>

  <p>These meetings have provided an opportunity to discuss the Alcohol Framework and Bill, including the proposal to require licensing boards to consider raising the age of off-sales purchases to 21. In relation to community based projects, the SGAIP is a partner in the Fife Alcohol Pilot Partnership (FAPP) which is piloting a multi-component approach to community interventions and progress reports on FAPP are a standing item on the SGAIP agenda. As part of the scoping phase of the FAPP, SGAIP Members, including the Scottish Retail Consortium, visited the pilot project in St Neots on 20 November 2008 and reported back to the SGAIP on their findings on 28 November 2008.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government ministers and officials have also had a number of meetings with COSLA representatives during the development of the Alcohol Framework and Bill, including the Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Minister for Public Health attending the COSLA leaders and chief executives meeting on 30 January 2009. COSLA have welcomed the flexibility which the provisions on raising the age of off-sales purchases to 21, contained in the bill, provide to local licensing boards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recently consulted on policy proposals developed by the Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO) Working Group for the implementation of the SCIO. In light of the responses received and views expressed at consultation events, we will develop draft SCIO regulations, built on the policy foundations of the SCIO Working Group&rsquo;s preferred model. These will be tested in the public arena during a shorter, targeted consultation exercise later in the year, before the provisions are finalised for laying in Parliament.</p>

  <p>Working closely with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) we are currently considering options for a phased implementation of the SCIO, to allow OSCR time to develop the systems necessary to discharge its new regulatory responsibilities. This may mean that the SCIO becomes available for use by certain types of charity, such as unincorporated associations, prior to others, such as existing charitable companies, where the conversion process will be different.</p>

  <p>Under current plans, we do not anticipate that the SCIO will be introduced before the end of 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) is a strategic partner of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Third Sector Division, working with government across a number of policy areas. SCVO meets regularly with officials from the Scottish Government and has also met with ministers, often as part of a wider group of third sector partners.</p>

  <p>SCVO was represented on the short-life Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisations (SCIOs) Working Group, which was set up to advise ministers on designing a regime for SCIOs that is cost-effective, as straightforward as possible and tailored to the needs of charities in Scotland. The final meeting of the SCIOs Working Group was held on 16 March 2010, at which SCVO was represented.</p>

  <p>We look forward to continuing to work closely with SCVO and other third sector partners on the development of regulations necessary to implement the SCIO provisions under the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>

  <p>The diabetic retinopathy screening programme in NHS Tayside has robust processes in place to ensure that all people who are eligible for diabetic retinopathy screening are offered regular appointments.</p>

  <p>Invitations to attend for diabetic retinopathy screening were sent out to 17,355 people during the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 in NHS Tayside. The number of invitations issued is higher than the number of people eligible for screening, due to people who did not attend appointments being invited again and to the fact that some people with diabetes require to be screened more than once a year.</p>

  <p>Twelve thousand, eight hundred and ninety-four people aged 12 and over with diabetes in NHS Tayside who were eligible for diabetic retinopathy screening were screened during the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010. This represents 83% of those eligible. The NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) standard is that 80% of people who are eligible are screened within each twelve month period.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The three categories of crime listed include knives, but could refer to other weapons.</p>

  <p>2. The information held centrally cannot be broken down further than local authority area.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-32120 on 15 March 2010 which gives the number crimes of handling an offensive weapon recorded by the eight police forces in Scotland, in each of the last five years. This shows that since 2006-07 the number of such crimes recorded has fallen by 11% across Scotland, and by 15.5% in the Lothian and Borders police force area.</p>

  <p>All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>3. The recording of aggravators has improved over time therefore caution is needed when comparing changes over time. 2004-05 is the first year where it has been considered that the use and recording of bail aggravator codes from the Scottish Government Court Proceedings Database has been of sufficient coverage to be used.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Maritime Museum has made it clear that it needs a solution to the problem of removing the City of Adelaide from its current location within this calendar year. That is the key timeframe within which we are working. The consultants appointed by Historic Scotland to investigate all the available options are working to the agreed deadline of 31 May 2010 for delivery of their report to Historic Scotland. I therefore hope to announce the outcome of this work in the summer.</p>

  <p>Uptake statistics by five years of age are only available from 2006 onwards. In Scotland uptake rates have historically been reported by one, two and six years of age. In 2006, Scottish uptake rates of MMR vaccination by five years of age began to be reported, in line with other parts of the UK. Table 8 in the workbook in the above website shows the trend in uptake by six years with data going back to 1996.</p>

  <p>There is no formal obligation for Deer Management Groups to report on their activities. However, in 2005 DCS reviewed the extent of collaborative deer management in all Deer Management Groups. This showed that just over half of Deer Management Groups either had or were developing a deer management plan. The remainder did not intend to develop plans. Since then, the work of the Deer Commission for Scotland with Deer Management Groups suggests that there has been a slight increase in management plans, although a full review has not been carried out since 2005.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question to S3W-33450 on 11 May 2010. The Deer Commission for Scotland review of collaborative deer management in 2005 found that just over 10% of deer management groups had a formalised process for setting and monitoring cull targets, with the remainder setting cull targets on an informal basis or independently on an individual basis. Since then, the work of the Deer Commission for Scotland with Deer Management Groups does not suggest that this percentage has changed significantly, although a full review has not been carried out since 2005.</p>

  <p>The Deer Commission for Scotland encourages all Deer Management Groups to develop a Deer Management Plan. However, participation in Deer Management Groups is voluntary and it is a matter for the members of the group to determine how to conduct their activities.</p>

  <p>90% of features which could be affected by deer are in favourable condition, or are recovering, with the necessary management measures in place, so that the land will, given time, reach favourable condition. For the remainder, relevant agencies, such as Deer Commission for Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Commission Scotland, are working closely with Deer Management Groups, estates and owners so as to get the features into favourable condition. There are currently nine control agreements, made under section 7 of the Deer (Scotland) Act 1996, in place or under negotiation.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to say how many deer died as a result of the winter weather, although the Deer Commission for Scotland continues to monitor the situation and have requested further information from occupiers on winter mortality with this year&rsquo;s cull returns in order to better understand the impact of the 2009-10 winter on deer populations.</p>
