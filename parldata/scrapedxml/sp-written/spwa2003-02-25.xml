  <p>In July 2001, &#163;24 million additional resources for child care were allocated through the child poverty package over 2001-04. The money was allocated as follows:</p>

  <p>&#163;8.5 million was made available for child care grants for lone parents in full-time higher education to pay for child care. This grant is administered through the Students Awards Agency for Scotland. Figures for the 2001-02 allocation are not available, as payments were manual and not automated. The number of students receiving the &#163;1,000 grant in 2002-03 is as follows:</p>

  <p>Argyll and Bute Council - 13</p>

  <p>West Dunbartonshire Council - 30</p>

  <p>&#163;7.5 million was made available to further education colleges throughout Scotland to widen child care provision, based on locally identified needs. Responsibility for administering this money lies with the Scottish Further Education Funding Council. Information on awards made by this body is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>&#163;8 million was made available to local authorities to help stabilise and sustain out-of-school care projects, especially in disadvantaged areas. The money was allocated over a three-year period as &#163;2 million in 2001-02, &#163;3 million in 2002-03 and &#163;3 million in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Of this, Argyll and Bute council was allocated &#163;31,400 in 2001-02 and &#163;47,500 in 2002-03 and 2003-04.</p>

  <p>West Dunbartonshire Council was allocated &#163;22,800 in 2001-02 and &#163;34,100 in 2002-03 and 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Allocation of this money within each local authority area is a matter for the individual council as they have responsibility for the allocation of funds at a local level. The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Based on the principles outlined in <i>Smart, Successful Scotland</i> , Scottish Enterprise identified a need to stimulate the emergence of more high-growth technology companies in Scotland. This required the commissioning of research to develop intellectual property based upon industry-led assessment of future market opportunities. This would, in turn, be diffused into new and existing companies. Having looked at various international approaches to this problem, and with consultation within Scotland and around the world, Scottish Enterprise developed the Intermediary Technology Institute model based upon international best practice, tailored to suit the circumstances in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for cod stocks in the North Sea and west of Scotland imply a reduction in fishing mortality of 65%. In negotiation, it was agreed that a proportion of this should be underpinned by permanent reductions in fishing effort (decommissioning), and a proportion by temporary reductions in fishing effort (days at sea restrictions). In management terms, it is such fishing effort that is the best proxy for fishing mortality, the latter being the product of the former.</p>

  <p>On average, the 15 days per month limits imply a reduction in UK fishing effort on cod of 25%; the 2001-02 decommissioning schemes imply a reduction in UK fishing effort on cod of around 10%, and other measures (such as Scottish mesh size changes) might also reasonably be expected to deliver some reduction in fishing mortality.</p>

  <p>We negotiated on the basis of such assumptions and concluded that further decommissioning schemes in the UK should aim to remove an additional 15 to 20% of UK fishing effort on cod to ensure reasonable consistency with the 65% reduction in fishing mortality implied by the agreed TACs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any reduction in fishing effort in the white fish sector has arisen due to the cancellation, sale or transferring of licences outwith the recent decommissioning scheme in each of the last three years and, if so, what the size of such a reduction has been in each year.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-02-25.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0225.htm#6">

  <p>It is certainly the case that a number of white fish licences have been used, and more are expected to be used, to licence incoming pelagic vessels. This will have the effect of reducing licensed white fish capacity and could lead to reductions in white fish fishing effort.</p>

  <p>It is extremely difficult to track the effects of these and other licence transactions: an exercise to do so would take some time and resources and could only be undertaken at likely disproportionate cost. However, work done previously to inform discussions in the joint industry/Departmental Working Group on fishing vessel licensing suggested that over 1998 and 1999, in licence transactions involving over 10 metre vessels, the average increase in effort of vessels new to the fleet (measured in GT days) was 34%. This was offset to some extent by a 10% drop in the fishing effort of donor licence vessels, following re-licensing.</p>

  <p>The effects on fishing mortality of such transactions will also depend, amongst other things, on the efficiency of the vessels concerned, including as a result of technological gains. Overall, it seems unlikely that licence transactions have resulted in a real reduction in fishing effort in the white fish sector.</p>

  <p>Gas safety is a reserved matter. Transco is responsible for running the gas emergency service under its licence conditions. This service is provided free of charge, at point of delivery, and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week all year round. The Health and Safety Executive monitors Transco&#146;s overall safety performance.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and the emergency services are primarily concerned with consequence management. As part of their emergency planning responsibilities, local authorities are required to have in place arrangements to deal with the consequences of major gas leaks. Their response and that of the emergency services would reflect the expert advice of the pipeline operator.</p>

  <p>Current monitoring of the Rough Sleepers Initiative target involves a three-stage assessment, which is repeated annually. Full details of the methodology being employed are contained in the reply given to question S1W-18044 on 11 September 2001.</p>

  <p>The report of the full three-stage assessment of the incidence of rough sleeping in Scotland in 2002-03 is now available. I am placing copies in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26601).</p>

  <p>In summary the report indicates that during the October 2002 study period of 14 days, 404 people reported sleeping rough at least once. This compares to 500 people in the May 2001 study period. An assessment of available accommodation showed that on a targeted night during the October study period, when 80 people reported they had slept rough, 164 bed spaces were available across Scotland.</p>

  <p>But tackling rough sleeping is about more than providing access to accommodation. The Rough Sleepers Initiative has recognised the very complex needs of many people who find themselves sleeping rough, by funding targeted health care, social support, drug and alcohol services, one-stop assessment centres, day centres, outreach services and supported accommodation. It will never be possible to stop people sleeping rough. What the Executive has done is to ensure the provision of a network of services and support so that those who find themselves on the streets can quickly connect with the help and support they need.</p>

  <p>The information contained in the report will be used to assist local authorities in the development and delivery of their homelessness strategies, and in particular in achieving a more effective match between services and people sleeping rough.</p>
