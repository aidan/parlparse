  <p>The Scottish pig industry has received &pound;4.75 million of financial support from the UK Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme. The terms of the scheme, agreed with the European Commission in January 2001, prohibit further assistance to the sector for a period of 10 years.</p>

  <p>Product sourcing policies are a matter for the supermarkets. The Executive encourages retailers to continue to offer consumers the option of purchasing Scottish pork products.</p>

  <p>I constantly stress, to supermarkets and to others in the supply chain, the importance of healthy trading relationships, with good communication and co-operation throughout the supply chain. Product sourcing decisions are, however, a matter for the supermarkets themselves.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*Figures for 2002-03 are derived from data collated as part of an earlier survey conducted by the Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland (CIHS). This survey collected data across calendar years, whereas later surveys have related to financial years. In order to construct a historical series, the CIHS data for 2002-03 was reallocated into the financial years on the assumption that ASBO activity was constant within the calendar years concerned. Due to rounding, the data for individual local authorities does not sum to the total shown for the year.</p>

  <p>**The power to apply for ASBOs was extended to Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) on 27 June 2003, so data for 2003-04 is the first set to include RSL returns. ASBOs granted at the request of RSLs have been included within the figures for the most relevant local authority area.</p>

  <p>As noted in my answer to question S2W-21547, there were 15 vacancies in the Scottish Executive, excluding the Crofters Commission, in Inverness in 2003-04 and 2004-05. Of those, nine vacancies were for posts in Band A and, therefore, no professional qualifications or experience were required. The six vacancies in Bands B and C in that period were professional posts and required qualifications, knowledge and experience specific to the posts. For example, four of the posts were in the Deer Commission for Scotland so required specific knowledge and experience of the deer industry and deer management. The other two posts required a professional qualification in agriculture and knowledge and experience of agriculture at the appropriate level.</p>

  <p>The data used by the transport application on the National Entitlement Card (smartcard) is handled within the ITSO technology standard environment. This is a secure encrypted environment similar to that used for credit cards. Data relating to travel will only be used to reimburse the transport operator who carried the concession holder and to provide statistics on use of the concessionary travel scheme. All this data will be processed anonymously, and within all requirements of Data Protection legislation. The application forms for the cards have a data consent request which allows data to be used for any local authority purpose.</p>

  <p>Two key contracts have been let as a result of the national concessionary travel scheme being introduced. One is for fleet equipment for transport operators and the cost of equipping the Scottish bus and ferry fleet is expected to be in the region of &pound;13 million. The second is for back office systems and data processing for Transport Scotland. The cost of this managed services contract over seven years is &pound;5.8 million (excluding communications networks).</p>

  <p>As part of the wider entitlement card initiative, there is a contract in place to supply 1.6 million transport operator accredited smartcards at the costs of 56p per card. However, these cards are multi-application and will also support a wide range of public services as well as concessionary fares. The processing cost per card (including distribution) is 80p or &pound;1.25 per card depending on the application method used.</p>

  <p>Executive officials meet with representatives from the British Dental Association (BDA) on a regular basis to take forward the implementation of the <em>Action Plan for Improving Oral Health and Modernising NHS Dental Services in Scotland</em> . I confirmed the basis for additional funding for dentists committed to treating all categories of patient on the NHS at the time of the debate on dentistry in the Parliament on 17 November 2005. The BDA does not support our requirement that all categories of patient be treated on the NHS. That principle is not negotiable.</p>

  <p>On Single Shared Assessment (SSA) generally, the Scottish Executive has issued guidance to local authorities and the NHS on implementation, and on how to assess user satisfaction with SSAs. It has also issued a common data set for assessment of older people&rsquo;s services and will extend that shortly to all community care groups. It has set up a network of managers responsible for implementation in local partnerships; is beginning to collect data on local performance on SSAs; and has invited local partnerships to demonstrate through their Local Improvement Targets how they will improve response times.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1 New clients: The information held on the Scottish Drug Misuse Database relates to <u>new</u> patients/clients. The definition of &quot;new&quot;&rsquo; is (a) the person is attending the particular service for the first time ever, or (b) the person has attended before but not within the previous six months. Thus, the statistics do not reflect the total number of drug misusers seen by services during any period.</p>

  <p>2 The first time ever that these clients have been reported to the database</p>

  <p>3 The database was established in 1995, so it was not possible to look at &quot;the last five years&quot; before 2000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Drug Misuse Database is currently being enhanced to collect information on people at key points in their care. The new data collection system is due to be launched in the summer of 2006 and once full compliance is achieved information will become available on the numbers of people re-entering treatment each year.</p>

  <p>The EU budget will not be finalised until the negotiations have been completed with the European Parliament as part of the Inter-Institutional Agreement. Moreover, some of the allocations within the budget are subject to negotiation within the United Kingdom, particularly how the UK&rsquo;s share of the Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective element of the Structural Funds will be divided between the nations and regions. Consequently, it is not possible at this stage to calculate the impact of the EU budget on the Scottish Assigned Budget.</p>

  <p>Scottish programmes have made full use of resources allocated over successive funding rounds by awarding all grant available to projects. In 2000-06, new financial spend targets were introduced by the EU, which have meant that the full sum of any one year&rsquo;s allocations to programmes must be spent within two years of the allocation year or risk automatic de-commitment (referred to as &quot;N+2&quot;). Scottish programmes have met all their N+2 targets apart from under the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme, where lack of spend by project beneficiaries led to automatic de-commitment of European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund monies in 2003 and Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance monies in 2004.</p>

  <p>In the 2004 Spending Review the gross operating budget for the agency was increased by &pound;2.195 million (to &pound;19.499 million) and &pound;4.318 million (to &pound;21.622 million) in 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively. The 2006-07 Budget approved by the Parliament for gross agency operating costs is increased by a further &pound;1.641 million, to &pound;21.140 million. These increases reflect the need to meet the cost of additional Regulating Orders and other inshore regulation enforcement burdens. In manpower terms this will involve employing an additional 36 staff for shore based enforcement and crewing of an additional inshore fisheries protection vessel. The strategy will be kept under review as policy on inshore fisheries develops, including if any further Regulating Order proposals come forward.</p>

  <p>No specific guidance in respect of patient travel times and distances to access consultant-led hospital-based accident and emergency services has been issued.

  <p>The Kerr Report, <em>Building a Health Service: Fit for Future</em>, also suggests that approximately 70% of the cases currently seen in consultant-led &quot;Accident and Emergency&quot; units could be treated in nurse or paramedic led Community Casualty Units. <em>Delivering for Heath </em>therefore suggests that care for the majority of unscheduled cases should be maintained or expanded at the local level through the development of these units.</p>

  <p>The Transport (Scotland) Act 2005 provides for the establishment of regional transport partnerships and the drawing up of a comprehensive transport strategy in each region. NHS boards were informed in July 2005 that they would be consulted by the new regional transport partnerships to ensure that regional transport strategies address access to health care facilities. Boards were also advised that they should, as far as possible, act consistently with the regional transport strategies applying in their area.</p>

  <p>Also when a proposal for a service change is to be submitted to me for approval, I expect the impact of the proposed change on the travel arrangements of patients, carers, visitors and staff to have been fully assessed and addressed. We are currently working with the Scottish Health Council to finalise a review of the draft interim guidance on <em>Informing, Engaging and Consulting</em> <em>the Public in Developing Health and Community Care Services </em>and this will include a specific requirement that NHS boards should conduct a travel impact assessment whenever a significant service change or development is proposed.</p>

  <p>No specific research on misdiagnosis has been carried out.</p>

  <p><em>Fit for the Future</em>, the report of the group led by Professor David Kerr, recommended remodelling NHSScotland to provide people with the right care in the right setting. This meant establishing a tier of locally provided assessment and treatment services such as minor injury clinics. This would allow the majority of people currently accessing accident and emergency services to be treated closer to home and faster than at present, whilst freeing specialist accident and emergency resources for those who really need them. This model requires good triage services to ensure that GPs, NHS24 and the Scottish Ambulance Service refer people to the right level of care, and to ensure that patients who self refer incorrectly are identified quickly and taken to the right setting. NHS boards have risk management and clinical governance arrangements to provide assurance that diagnosis and treatment are of consistently high quality.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland regulates all of Scotland&rsquo;s social housing; this includes the inspection of the landlord services and services to homeless people provided by local authorities. We do this within a framework of performance standards that have been agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. We use this framework to help ensure that landlords deliver good housing and related services for the benefit of current tenants and future tenants and homeless people. Communities Scotland&rsquo;s aim is to promote quality and good practice, and to act as a catalyst to help landlords improve their performance in the areas that will have most impact.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provided investment of &pound;1.2 billion in housing support services over three years in the spending review 2004 to support vulnerable people from the Supporting People programme. A further &pound;50 million per annum is provided over the same period to prevent and alleviate homelessness. All of these resources go to local authorities who in turn make funding available to voluntary sector and private providers of housing services to vulnerable adults. Local authorities are free to add to these resources from other budgets such as social work.</p>

  <p>The circumstances of each case are unique and each must be considered independently in isolation. Scottish ministers have determined that Mr Campbell and Mr Steele are entitled to statutory compensation for a miscarriage of justice as provided for in the Criminal Justice Act 1988.</p>

  <p>Section 133 of the 1988 act requires that an Assessor is appointed to make a determination of the amount of compensation to be paid. Under section 133(4) of the 1988 act the determination of the amount of the award is entirely for the Assessor. Scottish ministers have no power to vary that determination</p>

  <p>There are no figures available. Whilst the ombudsman is empowered to investigate the handling of complaints by the Law Society of Scotland she cannot investigate the original complaint or overturn the decision by the professional body.

  <p>The Home Office and Scottish Executive have worked constructively together on a range of initiatives regarding Fresh Talent, the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s wide ranging initiative aimed at attracting bright, talented and hard-working individuals to come and live, work and study in Scotland. Fresh Talent has a number of different strands, some related to immigration which is a reserved matter and dealt with by the Home Office. On these strands the Executive continues to work closely and productively with the Home Office on facilitating some of the administrative procedures for those who want to live and work in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Notable successes in this area include the launch last June of the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme which gives international students graduating from a Scottish university or college the opportunity to stay on and work for up to two years without requiring a work permit. The Scottish Executive and the Home Office have also worked together on a range of measures within the new system for managed migration that was announced by the Home Secretary on 7 March when he launched <em>A Points-Based System: Making Migration Work for Britain (</em>available on the Home Office website). These new specific Scottish flexibilities will build on the Fresh Talent initiative and help to attract and, crucially, retain the skills and talent to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Scottish economy and society.</p>

  <p>There have been no discussions on devolving immigration to the Scottish Parliament. I am confident that the best way forward for Scotland is to work in conjunction with the Home Office to achieve solutions that meet Scottish needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is looking at a number of initiatives to encourage people to move to Scotland. This includes the Fresh Talent Initiative, which is a wide ranging initiative aimed at attracting bright, talented and hard-working individuals to come and live, work and study in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We are also undertaking specific activity to help address demands in our public services. Last year Lewis Macdonald, Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care announced that dentists from Poland were being recruited from Poland to work in the NHS in Scotland. The first such eleven dentists arrived in Scotland in January and will provide treatment for around 20,000 patients in Argyll and Clyde, Forth Valley and Fife. Further dentists from Poland are due to arrive in a further two phases later this year. In addition, the on-going teacher recruitment campaign continues to attract teachers and their families to our shores. There has been a significant increase in the number of highly qualified teachers from outwith Scotland who have registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. Figures indicate a rise of over 40% since 2004.</p>

  <p>The First Minister launched a new Diaspora Strategy and hosted two events for Diaspora in Toronto and Guelph whilst in Canada in October 2005. The strategy aims to encourage the diaspora&rsquo;s active participation and engagement in promoting Scotland as a great country to visit, live, learn, work, do business and invest, as well as considering returning to Scotland themselves.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is involved with individuals and groups around the world through networks such as Global Friends of Scotland and Global Scots. These groups are provided with information about contemporary Scotland which enables them to promote Scotland and further Scottish interests internationally. We use websites such as <a href="http://www.scotlandistheplace.com" target="_blank">www.scotlandistheplace.com</a>, <a href="http://www.friendsofscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.friendsofscotland.gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.globalscot.com/public/index.aspx" target="_blank">www.globalscot.com/public/index.aspx</a> to communicate, in a cost effective manner, key messages about modern, dynamic Scotland being a great place to visit, live, learn, work, do business and invest in.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently working on production of an e-magazine which will assist our engagement with our worldwide diaspora, and encourage individuals and groups within that body to actively participate in promoting modern Scotland as the best small country in the world.</p>

  <p>Ministerial visits overseas are also used to promote positive messages about modern Scotland and, where possible, events for a diaspora and expatriate audience are included in the programme. Events such as the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne are being used by the Executive to enable ministers to meet a diaspora audience.</p>

  <p>1. Originally awarded &pound;2.4 million in 2004, following award in principle of &pound;2 million in 2002.</p>

  <p>2. Originally awarded &pound;0.900 million in 1999.</p>

  <p>3. Originally awarded &pound;6.093 million in 2001.</p>

  <p>4. Originally awarded &pound;1.125 million in 2002.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also provided separate awards to the four voluntary regional transport partnerships, the unaffiliated local authorities and Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority in financial years 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 for public transport projects. Decisions about which projects to fund were a matter for the partnerships and authorities, but the terms and conditions of grant did allow for improvements and enhancements to the local bus network.</p>

  <p>The seven new statutory regional transport partnerships will be given funding of &pound;35 million in both financial years 2006-07 and 2007-08 for regionally strategic transport projects, which again may be used towards further bus related measures.</p>

Implementing that action plan will ensure we have a world class fingerprint service, with independent oversight, scientific excellence and transparent adherence to standards.</p>

  <p>Mr Andy Kerr: The Executive will regularly review progress on the implementation of the strategy.</p>

  <p>In addition, all NHS boards will submit an annual report on progress against the actions outlined in both their Local Interagency Sexual Health Strategies and their Clinical Services Plans. These will be reported to the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee. The Executive will then produce an annual progress report. The first annual progress report is scheduled for the summer.</p>

  <p>The Executive will complement these annual reports with a comprehensive five year review.</p>

  <p>A decision about whether to designate an area as a dispersal zone is for the police in consultation with the local authority and local people. Dispersal Orders are intended to give respite to people whose lives have been blighted by serious, persistent and serious antisocial behaviour.</p>

  <p>All public transportation vehicles are classed as no-smoking premises under the new law. A &quot;public transportation vehicle&quot; under the law means any vehicle available to the public as a means of transportation and specifically includes a taxi and a private hire car. Therefore, from 26 March 2006 smoking will not be permitted at any time in a taxi. The law will apply regardless of whether or not there are passengers in the taxi.</p>

  <p>In the School Estate Strategy <em>Building our Future: Scotland&rsquo;s School Estate, </em> published in 2003, both the Executive and COSLA agreed on the importance of all the facilities in new and refurbished schools, including sports facilities, being a community resource.

  <p>Assistance may be available to ports to improve rail infrastructure through the Freight Facilities Grant scheme where additional facilities are required to transfer freight from road to rail or water.</p>

  <p>Statutory responsibility for the network of local roads lies with individual local authorities, who have received an additional &pound;60 million in each of 2006-07 and 2007-08 for roads and bridges work. In addition, &pound;35 million in capital funding will be available in each of 2006-07 and 2007-08 to the Regional Transport Partnerships to provide support for strategic regional and local road and public transport projects.</p>

  <p>None as we are not aware of any such proposal. I understand that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, which is responsible for the enforcement of waste legislation in Scotland, does not consider field stones to be waste unless they are actually disposed of to landfill.</p>

  <p>We do not hold information centrally about these schemes. Whilst not specifically endorsing &quot;employment quota schemes&quot;, the Executive has funded a number of supported employment pilots, delivered by Careers Scotland. These have been targeted at young people not in education, employment and training, of which care leavers are an important sub-group. Following a positive evaluation (April 2005), the supported employment approach is currently being mainstreamed across Careers Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am aware of the excellent work carried out by the Youthstart employment initiative in South Lanarkshire. It was previously a successful New Futures Fund (NFF) project that South Lanarkshire Council agreed to fund from April 2005. Although the Executive has not evaluated this project, Scottish Enterprise commissioned an independent evaluation NFF that was completed in April 2005. I remain committed to mainstreaming the employability model successfully developed through NFF.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently developing a strategy to reduce the proportion of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) in Scotland. The strategy will be published shortly and will build on the findings of the NEET workstream report which was published in August 2005.</p>
