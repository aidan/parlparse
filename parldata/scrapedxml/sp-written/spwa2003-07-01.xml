  <p>The Executive is preparing an information campaign on positive parenting and alternatives to physical punishment which will be launched to coincide with the commencement of section 51 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 in the autumn. This will also inform parents about changes in the law.</p>

  <p>The campaign, whose budget has yet to be finalised, is being developed in partnership with voluntary sector and other relevant stakeholders and will be closely linked to the Executive&#146;s other major supportive programmes for parents and children.</p>

  <p>The pilot drugs courts in Glasgow and Fife will run for an initial period of two years and are subject to independent evaluations, comprising a six-month process evaluation, a two-year outcome evaluation with a final report a year later. The process evaluation on the Glasgow drugs court was published in November 2002 and the process evaluation for the Fife drugs court will be published within the next two months. The outcome evaluation of Glasgow drugs court will be available early in 2004 with a final report (including the results of a reconviction study) to be submitted in January 2005 and the reports for Fife about one year later.</p>

  <p><em>A</em> <em>Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> made clear that the Executive would set up a judicially led sentencing commission to review sentencing and make recommendations on:</p>

  <p>the use of bail and remand;</p>

  <p>the basis on which fines are determined;</p>

  <p>the effectiveness of sentences in reducing re-offending;</p>

  <p>the scope to improve consistency of sentencing, and</p>

  <p>the arrangements for early release from prison, and supervision of short-term prisoners on their release.</p>

  <p>Each local authority receives an allocation through Grant Aided Expenditure to assist with its residential care costs. Local arrangements should be in place to manage the use of secure accommodation in line with social work budgets. The assessment criteria for new proposals considered the need to minimise both capital costs and fee level while providing for high quality services which meet the needs of young people and communities.</p>

  <p>The distribution of national lottery funds is a matter for the Lottery Distribution Bodies: Scottish Arts Council, Scottish Screen, <strong></strong> sportscotland, New Opportunities Fund, Community Fund, Heritage Lottery Fund and Millennium Commission. The information requested is not held centrally by the Executive.</p>

  <p>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport maintains a database of national lottery awards on their website which sets out the total awarded to each constituency area and each local authority area for each lottery good cause.</p>

  <p>The Police Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) Review working group completed its initial reassessment of the proposals put forward by independent consultants in September 2002. On the basis of this analysis, the group recommended, as an interim step, that additional funding should be made available to four police forces (Grampian Police, Fife Constabulary, Central Scotland Police and Northern Constabulary) in each of 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06. The Executive accepted these initial recommendations. As a result, for example, the GAE for Grampian Police in 2005-06 has been increased by &#163;2.5 million. However, the group also concluded that a number of aspects needed further work before it could reach a final recommendation and this further work is now being undertaken with a view to completion by March 2004.</p>
