  <p>The Scottish child health programme includes routine checks to detect any health problems and to ensure that children get any care or treatment they need as soon as possible, including immunisations. Up until school entry, information and advice on a range of health promotion topics should be provided such as weaning, nutrition, child development, safety and dental health. Most of the core programme is undertaken by health visitors/public health nurses, however some of contacts listed above are undertaken by other health professionals.</p>

  <p>The long-term average rate of carbon accumulation by woodland is estimated to be in the order of two to three tonnes of carbon per hectare per year. On this basis, average amounts of carbon sequestered over one, five, 10 and 25 years by one hectare would be approximately (a) two to three tonnes, (b) 10 to 15 tonnes, (c) 20 to 30 tonnes and (d) 50 to 75 tonnes respectively.

  <p>In principle, restoration and re-instatement of peatlands may be ultimately beneficial in terms of carbon sequestration. However, uncertainty exists on the time taken for such sites to change from initial sources of methane, to become sinks of carbon dioxide. Given this uncertainty we will be seeking further evidence to allow us and our stakeholders to develop the best approach to this issue.</p>

  <p>No. I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-3243 on 5 September 2007. There is existing legislation allowing local authorities and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency within the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Waste (Scotland) Regulations 2005 respectively to take action against those causing a nuisance through garden bonfires.</p>

  <p>Although the Scottish Government are commencing new Statutory Nuisance provisions on 26 January 2009, which includes future proofing powers and Fixed Penalty Notice powers, we have not included additional controls on bonfires as there is existing legislative controls available. A local authority could also implement a by-law if there were persistent problems caused by this issue in their area.</p>

  <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong><strong>If a decision is taken, following the consultation, that leasing of forest land and cutting rights should take place, the additional capital received will depend upon such factors as the terms of the lease, costs associated with leasing, and the lessee&rsquo;s expectations of future market conditions. Subject to these factors, it could be in the range &pound;150 to 200 million. The timing of payments will depend upon securing legal powers to allow leasing, the time taken to prepare and agree any leases and decisions about whether or not to receive payment in instalments. No receipts are expected before 2010-11.</strong></p>

  <p>Woodland has the ability to absorb CO <sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, converting some of it to wood. The maximum potential carbon stock held in the biomass or woody element of mature woodland in this country is estimated to be around 250 tonnes of carbon per hectare after about 80 years. Less carbon is sequestered if woodland is managed on shorter rotations.</p>

  <p>Mandatory surveillance on the total number of cases of Clostridium difficile reported by NHS board was introduced in September 2006. This information is collected by Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and is published in quarterly reports on their website. The second annual report of the mandatory <em>National Surveillance Programme</em> was published on Wednesday, 14 January 2009.</p>

  <p>The Surveillance Programme is retrospective (i.e. three months in arrears) and so the latest annual report provides data up to the third quarter of 2008 only (July-September 2008). Information for the period October to December 2008 will not be published by HPS until it&rsquo;s next quarterly report in April 2009. The web link to the latest annual report is <a href="http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/ewr/article.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/ewr/article.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>From January 2009 all NHS boards are required to complete a healthcare associated infection (HAI) reporting template with information on infection rates by hospital and specialty in all health board areas. The outcome of the analysis of all cases must be published and reported at bi-monthly board meetings. The member will therefore be able to access &quot;real time&quot; Clostridium difficile data from the NHS board&rsquo;s website from this point forward.</p>

  <p>3. The figures in the tables relate to direct measures that were affected by Summary Justice Reform &ndash; i.e. fiscal fines, compensation offers and combined offers of fiscal fines and compensation. They exclude all other types of direct measure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is providing an extra &pound;4.19 million to local authorities &ndash; on top of the overall settlement &ndash; to enable local authorities to deliver in full by 2010-11 the commitment in the concordat to progress towards delivering 10,000 extra respite weeks per annum. This additional funding will be provided to local authorities in 2009-10 and 2010-11.</p>

  <p>The allocations for 2009-10, broken down by authority, are provided in the following table. The allocations for 2010-11 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>The whole 2009-10 local government finance settlement is provisional until the Parliament approves both the overall 2009-10 Scottish Budget Bill and the Local Government Finance Order 2009.</p>

  <p>Schedule 1 of the Budget (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill shows that accruing resources estimated at &pound;256,000 will be available for use by Scottish ministers through their Rural Affairs and the Environment portfolio from the sale of land, buildings and equipment, and the sale of holdings to existing tenants.

  <p>It is not possible at this stage to identify the individual assets or land that will be sold in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>We do not envisage that the current economic climate will impair the level of receipts anticipated.</p>

  <p>The SFT Chair, Sir Angus Grossart and staff working within SFT are actively engaged in meeting public bodies and the private sector to explain further their aims, including how SFT can assist in delivering increased value from the &pound;35 billion of infrastructure investment set out in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure Investment Plan (IIP) published in March 2008. The SFT will work to improve the prospects for efficient and timely delivery of projects across the scope of the IIP. The SFT will produce a business plan in the spring of this year.</p>

  <p>As already announced, the early focus of hub development and resources is on two pathfinder areas in the south-east and the north of Scotland. Each pathfinder is receiving expert advisory and structural support from the SFT and the Scottish Government is providing financial backing of about &pound;1.4 million for each pathfinder during the development stages and an additional &pound;30 million of capital provision to fund hub facilities throughout Scotland. The pathfinders will seek private sector development partners through a procurement process during 2009.</p>

  <p>The information sought is set out in the following table. The data relates to campaigns that fall under the remit of the Scottish Government Marketing Unit. Information for individual portfolios/directorates is not available.</p>

  <p>The figure for 2008-09 covers the nine-month period up to 31 December 2009. The figure will increase before the end of the financial year. All figures quoted are inclusive of VAT.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government uses public relations agencies from the approved supplier roster as part of integrated marketing strategies designed to inform the public about government policies and legislation, and to effect attitudinal and behavioural change related to campaign topics such as drink driving, health improvement, and climate change.</p>

  <p>The work undertaken by these agencies is specific to the government&rsquo;s marketing campaigns and is not to be confused with the work of the in-house communications teams, whose roles include being official spokespeople for Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has an arrangement in place with Capital Credit Union. This allows any member of Scottish Government staff to join the union and:</p>

  <p>Make payments direct from salary &ndash; with deductions from &pound;1 per week with no upper limit</p>

  <p>Receive a dividend on balances of &pound;1 upward</p>

  <p>Have access to loans with competitive interest rates</p>

  <p>Receive free life insurance on both savings and loans.</p>

  <p>No administration fees are charged on the operation of the account or deductions from salary.</p>

  <p>Capital Credit Union is the only organisation that the Scottish Government has an official arrangement with. However, under TUPE arrangements several members of staff have transferred into the organisation who are members of other credit unions. In these circumstances the Scottish Government has provided the facility for these staff to continue making payments to their existing schemes through payroll.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government estimates that, based on current trends being maintained in the future, it will be 2020-21 when we reach the point of new loans issued matching annual repayments. Estimates of repayments and loans issued can and do vary year-on-year due a number of factors, such as, for example, graduate wage levels and projections of the student population. As a result the projections provided should be viewed as indicative only.</p>

  <p>Table 1 illustrates expected loan issues and repayments until 2020-21:</p>

  <p>Support for measures benefitting rare and/or endangered species and in particular for conservation actions relating to the 32 species listed for priority action in the Species Action Framework for Scotland is one of the recognised priorities in the regional assessments of &quot;Rural Priorities&quot; for rural development contracts. Regions are also able to identify and prioritise actions relating to those species of particular importance to their region. To date, the regional priority theme <em>Viable populations of rare and/or endangered species</em> has supported 32 cases for funding with total funding of &pound;1,241,826.17 and funding of &pound;1,597,749 has been approved for corncrake options.</p>
