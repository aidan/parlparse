  <p>Fiona Hyslop (the then Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning) met with the Minister of State (then Liam Byrne) on 11 October 2007 in London. She continued to raise the concern of the detention of children in written correspondence with Liam Byrne between August 2007 and June 2008. The First Minister reaffirmed this opposition in written correspondence to the Home Secretary (initially Jacqui Smith and subsequently Alan Johnston) from December 2007 to May 2008. Michael Russell (the then Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution) met with the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration, Phil Woolas, on 9 November 2009 in London and subsequently wrote to Mr Woolas on 20 November 2009.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government officials have bi-monthly meetings and informal contact with officials from the UK Border Agency to discuss the support available to asylum seeking children during their stay in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Since 2002 the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) has operated a system of priority based dispatch. The principles of priority-based dispatch are that calls should receive a speed and type of response that is appropriate to their clinical condition, and that the dispatching of response resources should therefore be prioritised on the basis of information received from callers. The processes that support the operation of this system have remained largely unchanged since they were introduced.</p>

  <p>Paramedic response units (formally referred to as rapid response vehicles or fast response vehicles) have been a feature of the service&rsquo;s response to emergency calls since 2002 when priority-based dispatch was introduced in Scotland. As a rule, where the service sends a paramedic response unit (PRU) it will automatically be backed up by a traditional accident and emergency ambulance. This back up resource can be stood down should the first paramedic on scene consider that it is not required.</p>

  <p>Since late 2007, paramedic response units have been deployed to all categories of call, previously they had only been sent to category A calls. Since that time, and only for a small number of clinically appropriate conditions, the paramedic response unit is not automatically backed up. Should the first paramedic on scene require it, they can request a back up crew.</p>

  <p>Any revisions to the way the service operates are, and will continue to be, subject to close clinical scrutiny by Scottish Ambulance Service clinical and staff governance structures.</p>

  <p>Ambulance response times are continually monitored by the Scottish Ambulance Service at all levels of the organisation, including regular performance reporting to the SAS board.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service recruits and trains to allow for traditional accident and emergency ambulances to be staffed by a paramedic and a technician. In circumstances where this is not possible, due for example to sickness absence, the emergence medical dispatch centre (EMDC) will endeavour to provide paramedic support by sending a backup paramedic response unit to appropriate cases or by providing professional advice or support from the paramedic advisor in the EMDC.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment has been made of the independent review of Scotland&rsquo;s water rescue capability by Paddy Tomkins and when the recommendations will be implemented.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-04-23.S3W-33178.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80306" speakername="Fergus Ewing" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0423.htm#7">

  <p>In his report, Paddy Tomkins concluded that the current multi-agency approach to water rescue in Scotland is robust and recommended that there is no requirement for new legislation or wholesale change to current arrangements. However, he did indicate that there is scope for making more effective use of the resources currently held by responder agencies as well as those held by the private and voluntary sectors.</p>

  <p>Before making any decisions on how to proceed, I was keen to hear members&rsquo; views of the findings of the independent review. During the Scottish Government debate held in the Parliament on 21 January, I was pleased at the level of support which the review and its recommendations received from members. In responding to the issues raised by members, I was happy to announce the establishment of a stakeholder group to take the work forward.</p>

  <p>The first meeting of the stakeholder group has been arranged for 2 June and invitations have been issued to a range of key stakeholders, including workforce representatives, in line with the commitment I made during the debate. It will be the responsibility of this group to consider the recommendations with a view to ensuring an effective and proportionate water rescue capability across Scotland.</p>

  <p>SNH has advised that there are 442 pairs of breeding golden eagles in Scotland (based on the most recent national survey). Whilst breeding pairs generally remain in their established territories, sub-adults range extensively and there is no reliable estimate for this component of the population.</p>

  <p>At present, SPAs classified for the species support 53 pairs of eagles (11.9% of the Scottish breeding population). The proposed SPAs support an additional 72 pairs (16.3% of the Scottish breeding population).</p>

  <p>It is estimated that the additional revenue cost of extending the Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) pilot to all ferry routes on the Clyde and the Argyll islands is in the range of &pound;10 million to &pound;14 million per annum.</p>

  <p>The &pound;10 million figure assumes an increase in patronage, and hence increased fares revenue, equivalent to the impact currently being experienced on the RET pilot routes.</p>

  <p>The &pound;14 million figure assumes that there is no additional patronage effects as a consequence of lower RET fares.</p>

  <p>These figures are based on an analysis of the following routes &ndash; Oban to Craignure; Fishnish to Lochaline; Fionnphort to Iona; Tarbert Loch Fyne to Portavadie; Kennacraig to Islay; Tayinloan to Gigha; Wemyss Bay to Rothesay; Colintraive to Rhubodach; Ardrossan to Brodick; Claonaig to Lochranza; Largs to Cumbrae Slip, and Gourock to Dunoon.</p>

  <p>The &pound;0.928 million outturn efficiency for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in 2008-09 was achieved by the following:</p>

  <p>1 - Absorption of New Duty Work by Current staff</p>

  <p>Total Savings Achieved: &pound;709,000.</p>

  <p>By implementing more efficient working practices and re-engineering service delivery SEPA has been able to maintain its FTE staff and service quality rather than increase. This, along with maintained service provision, delivers efficiency savings from the non filling of vacant posts.</p>

  <p>2 - Property: Establishment of Training Suite at SEPA offices, Perth</p>

  <p>Total Savings Achieved: &pound;18,000.</p>

  <p>The construction of a training suite at SEPA, Whitefriars, Perth saved &pound;18,000 per year compared to the costs of external venue hire. These costs are net of any additional costs at Perth in providing in house training and development sessions.</p>

  <p>3 - Recruitment Costs</p>

  <p>Total Savings Achieved: &pound;20,000.</p>

  <p>Management of recruitment through reduced advertising costs. This was achieved by designing fewer, smaller recruitment advertisements within newspaper adverts, increasing the use of SEPA&rsquo;s website and renegotiating placement fees with recruitment agencies</p>

  <p>4 - Procurement Savings</p>

  <p>Total Savings Achieved: &pound;100,000.</p>

  <p>SEPA migrated its Wide Area Network onto the Police national Network Contract 3 generating efficiencies of &pound;100,000 in SEPA.</p>

  <p>5 - Shared Services</p>

  <p>Total Savings Achieved: &pound;81,000.</p>

  <p>SEPA entered shared office accommodation with The Loch Lomond &amp; Trossachs National Park in Balloch, saving &pound;81,000 pa when compared to leasing commercial accommodation.</p>

  <p>The original assessment of the wider economic benefits arising from the introduction of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) project (Roger Tym and Partners &ndash; Assessment of Wider Economic Benefits &ndash; June 2005, commissioned by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport) reported the potential for:</p>

  <p>650 jobs over a 10 year period (or 65 jobs per annum) within Glasgow, and</p>

  <p>through development opportunities within Paisley town centre, of an office market, 675-700 jobs over a three to four year period.</p>

  <p>These figures were on the basis of employment growth forecasts for the affected local authority areas in the period 2003&ndash;11 and with the introduction of GARL passenger services in 2009.</p>

  <p>It is reasonable to expect that the completion of the Paisley Corridor Improvements project and the introduction of resultant passenger services on the Ayrshire and Inverclyde routes will have a beneficial impact on the local economy and therefore opportunities for employment.</p>

  <p>The actual wording in the submission to Ministers by officials in Transport Scotland, dated 1 May 2009, reads as follows at page 2, paragraph 10 it states inter alia:</p>

  <p>&quot;Costs</p>

  <p>10. The cost profile for the Branch Line project is attached at Annex A. To date around &pound;40m has been spent on preparatory and advance works. The cost of the work on the main line is contractually committed through the CP4 Determination and is financed through the RAB.&quot;</p>

  <p>To clarify therefore the cost incurred to date, as at 1 May 2009, of &quot;around &pound;40m&quot; refers to the Glasgow Airport Rail Link / Paisley Corridor Improvements (GARL/PCR) project in totality and is not the cost associated with the branch line element of the GARL project.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is developing a National Musculoskeletal Programme to improve the delivery of musculoskeletal and chronic pain services. A national programme board, chaired by an NHS board chief executive, is being established to drive implementation.</p>

  <p>We have also highlighted to the Scottish Society for Rheumatology the benefits of a managed clinical network (MCN) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as this would help promote multi-disciplinary working and develop standards of care. MCNs require an evidence base, and SIGN Guideline 48 on RA provides this. They are also required to participate in audit, and CARA would satisfy this core principle. We have also highlighted the benefits of an MCN approach to Arthritis Care Scotland, the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance and the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, since the voluntary sector must be involved in all MCN developments.</p>

  <p>This work is being undertaken in the context of our Long Term Conditions Action Plan, issued as CEL 23 (2009) on 16 June 2009, which forms a key part of our new Quality Strategy. The Action Plan sets out a shared vision: that throughout Scotland, those with long term conditions and those who support them feel valued, confident and able to enjoy full and positive lives. Robust reporting arrangements have been put in place to enable monitoring of implementation of the Action Plan by the geographical and special NHS boards</p>

  <p>In light of this ongoing work, we do not believe there is any need for a ministerial statement.</p>

  <p>A National Audit Office Report on services for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), published on 15 July 2009, suggests that RA costs the UK economy an estimated &pound;1.8 billion a year as a result of sick leave and work-related disability.</p>

  <p>Funding has been provided through the Delivery Framework for Adult Rehabilitation for a national lead to support the rollout of the National Musculoskeletal Programme. It is developing integrated multi-disciplinary teams to: improve access to diagnosis and treatment; reduce waiting times; enable self management, and, where appropriate, facilitate early return to work and avoid long-term absence and long-term dependency on social security benefits.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives provides a wide range of support to employers in order to promote health and wellbeing in the working age population. As part of the Health Works Strategy, we will emphasise in the &quot;Scottish Offer&quot; the importance of the role health services can play in achieving patients&rsquo; employment goals.</p>

  <p>The Chief Dental Officer was provided with information regarding community dentistry provision in the Clyde area during visits to the dental clinics in the Alexandria area in April 2008 following initial discussions with the Director of Oral Health within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.

  <p>The joint consultation on whether and, if so, how, to regulate practitioners of herbalism, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine (a devolved area in Scotland), was issued on behalf of all four UK countries by the Department of Health in England. In view of the large number of responses, additional resource for the work on the consultation analysis was sought from a private consultancy. Purely quantitative or qualitative analysis has proved difficult, due to the volume of responses and the number and complexity of the consultation questions. In addition, some replies proved ambiguous and difficult to classify. The response to the consultation will take into account the quality of the responses and the evidence base supporting respondents&rsquo; arguments.</p>

  <p>The prime aim of regulation is to protect the public. Decisions informed by the consultation analysis will be taken by ministers in all four UK countries against that background and bearing in mind the need for a proportionate, risk-based approach which considers the full &quot;menu&quot; of regulatory alternatives recommended in the report of the UK Extending Professional Regulation Working Group. I will also be taking into account any particularly Scottish issues that have arisen from the consultation, and the potential future effect on employment and businesses.</p>

  <p>Until 2009, NHS Grampian had a two year Staff Nurse Development Programme which they used as a pathway for newly qualified nurses entering employment.</p>

  <p>Following discussions at Robert Gordon University&rsquo;s annual review meetings in 2008 and 2009, at which NHS Grampian were present, my officials reflected concerns they had received from newly qualified nurses about the two year programme. NHS Grampian were urged to consider a different approach. As a result, NHS Grampian has now adopted a one year pathway based on the national Flying Start NHS Programme.</p>

A decision as to whether the application for an order contains a plan or project must be made on a case-by-case basis, guided by both the facts and circumstances of the application and precedent such as the Waddenzee case.</p>

  <p>ScotRail as the employer and operator of the service are of the view that trains already operate with Driver and Ticket Examiner and the new Airdrie to Bathgate section would naturally extend this operation.

The authority is the body responsible for regulating the private security industry across the UK, and must be satisfied that a company and its directors meet its &quot;fit and proper&quot; organisation/person tests before conferring Approved Contractor Status on a company. We have communicated this across the wider public sector in Scotland with a view to encouraging other public bodies to adopt this policy.</p>

  <p>Under the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006, a company can be excluded from bidding for public contracts if it, or those controlling it, have been convicted of offences including conspiracy, bribery, fraud, money laundering, have been convicted of committing a criminal offence relating to the conduct of its business or profession and have committed an act of grave misconduct in the course of its business or profession.</p>

  <p>Information on the extent of each of the proposed Special Protection Areas (pSPA) is available on the Scottish Natural Heritage website via the following web address:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.snh.org.uk/strategy/GE_consult05.asp#" target="_blank">http://www.snh.org.uk/strategy/GE_consult05.asp#</a>.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage has identified the following land use interests in (or in the vicinity of) the pSPAs: agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, nature conservation, recreation, renewable energy, tourism and transport. Additional land use interests may become apparent as a result of consultation on the proposals.</p>
