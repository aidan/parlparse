<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-05-17.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0517.htm#2398">

  <p>I apologise for the delay in replying to this question; this was due to an administrative error.</p>

  <p>At the time of discussions with French officials regarding exports of British beef to France, Scottish Ministers and their officials were at all times in regular contact with their opposite numbers in Whitehall. They were actively involved in determining the UK response to the French ban and participated in the relevant discussions in Brussels. When consulted the Scottish Executive at all times expressed full support for the approach taken by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government.</p>

  <p>As the member will be aware, the discussions failed to resolve the problem, and the French Government maintained their ban on British beef. A prosecution case against the French Government for failure to implement the relevant Commission Decisions is now with the European Court of Justice.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-05-17.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0517.htm#5621">

  <p>Cancer is one of the three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland. Waiting times for investigation and treatment are a high priority within the Scottish Cancer Group&#8217;s work programme.</p>

  <p>Initial treatment for lung cancer can take place in either an outpatient or inpatient setting. Centrally available information does not identify cases where treatment starts in an outpatient setting.</p>

  <p>Information on the time between a patient being placed on the waiting list for treatment for lung cancer and their admission to hospital is available centrally, and the median waiting time for the five main cancer centres, in the year to 31 December 1999, is given in the table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently working with the NHS in Scotland to establish national, maximum waiting times, to be delivered by March 2001, in the clinical priorities of cancer, heart disease and mental health.</p>

  <p>As of 1 April 2000 the maximum fees that local authorities are able to charge residential care homes for the registration and inspection services they provide have been increased significantly. This should help authorities narrow the gap between income and cost. Fee levels, and the possibility of further increases, will be kept under review.</p>

  <p>Local authorities can also use GAE for social work services to help provide registration and inspection services. GAE has risen to over &pound;1.1 billion for 2000-01, which represents a &pound;43 million (4%) increase on 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>Subject to parliamentary approval, the establishment of the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care in 2001 will mean statutory responsibility for the registration and inspection of residential care homes will pass from local authorities to the Commission.</p>

  <p>Under our Strategy for Carers in Scotland we are supporting carers through a wide-ranging set of measures. &pound;10 million has been earmarked under the strategy in 2000-01 for carers services, including respite. We expect this to lead to increased services for carers. At least a similar amount will be earmarked in 2001-02. From 1 April the NHS Helpline has been extended to provide advice to carers. A leaflet and associated media campaign was launched on 28 April to inform carers of the strategy and the helpline as sources of advice and assistance. A legislation working group has been set up involving carers&#8217; organisations to consider what legislative changes are required to help carers. In 2001-02 we will continue to ensure the strategy is being implemented and will build on it, if necessary. I recognise that the strategy has implications for voluntary sector organisations representing carers and I am considering the issue of support for this sector.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of the report. There are some longstanding recruitment difficulties within the construction industry which will clearly take time to rectify. Young people are able to train in the construction industry through the Scottish Executive&#8217;s youth training programme, Skillseekers, which includes Modern Apprenticeships. Most Skillseekers are employed while training and Local Enterprise Companies make a contribution to the cost of training.</p>

  <p>The Ythan Nitrate Vulnerable Zone has been designated on the basis of criteria set out at Annex IA(3) of the EC Nitrates Directive(91/676/EEC) i.e. that the estuary is eutrophic, or in the near future may become eutrophic.</p>

  <p>During its 1997 review of eutrophic waters the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) concluded that the Ythan estuary met three of the criteria for eutrophication set out in guidance issued by the Scottish Office to regulatory authorities on assessing the eutrophic status of estuaries and coastal waters. These included changes in macrophyte growth, changes in fauna, and elevated nitrate concentrations in the river.</p>

  <p>SEPA also supported the conclusion of its predecessor body, the North East River Purification Board, that agriculture is the main source of nitrate pollution in the Ythan catchment. In these circumstances Article 3 of the Directive requires all known areas of land which drain into the estuary to be designated as an NVZ.</p>

  <p>Additional evidence of high levels of nitrate in the surface waters of the Ythan catchment was reported by SEPA in its 1999 Surface Water Monitoring Report.</p>

  <p>SEPA measures the concentration of nitrate in the Ythan estuary beneath the A975 Bridge at Newburgh. Because the location is tidal, the water sampled varies in salinity - sometimes it is predominantly freshwater, sometimes it is predominantly sea water - and therefore in nitrate concentration. In 1999 concentrations of nitrate in the samples collected from the Bridge at Newburgh ranged from 1.2 to 38.0 mg/l.</p>

  <p>SEPA is continuing to measure nitrate concentrations at all of the above locations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department is currently funding one project in this area. The aim is to develop a protocol for identifying UK <i>Enteromorpha</i> species and to identify those species occurring in the Ythan estuary. The research is also investigating how these species respond to different growing conditions in the laboratory, and will relate this information to why <i>Enteromorpha</i> has become a problem in the Ythan estuary. The work is being carried out jointly by the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh and the University of Dundee and is scheduled to be completed by February 2001.</p>

  <p>Under the Scottish Executive code of practice on access to information, there is a presumption to make reports available to the public when the research is complete. I will arrange for a copy of the final report of this project to be sent to you when it becomes available.</p>

  <p>All departments of the Scottish Executive have systems in place to monitor performance against targets for all letters due for a ministerial reply. This includes letters from MSPs. Departments also report performance formally through a parliamentary answer.</p>

  <p>To help improve response times, the Executive is improving and standardising the recording, monitoring and workflow systems used to handle ministerial correspondence. The introduction of a new corporate system will enable central scanning, logging and allocation of all ministerial correspondence and will produce management information not readily available at present. This will include information on cases in progress and those overdue. Reports on the handling of MSPs&#8217; correspondence will be available. The introduction of the new system is due to be completed by the end of June 2000.</p>

  <p>Work on this important issue is being taken forward by a UK-level working group on authentication and security, under the Cabinet Office. The Scottish Executive has been involved in, and supports, the work of this group. The draft framework policy guidelines developed by this group are published on the IAG Champions website (www.iagchampions.gov.uk). The Scottish Executive intends to adopt the approach set out in the guidelines, using whichever methods of authentication are appropriate to the type of transaction being delivered, the customer group concerned and the chosen method of electronic delivery. This will include digital signatures where appropriate.</p>

As an executive agency, Forest Enterprise is subject to review every five years &#8211; part of the process of continuous improvement of Government services promised in the <i>Modernising Government</i> White Paper of March 1999. Forest Enterprise was established as an executive agency on 1 April 1996 and its review has now started. Stage 1 is concerned with getting the organisation right for Scotland as well as for the rest of Britain, and its conclusions will be reported to me and the Forestry Ministers for England and Wales in July. Stage 2, which is concerned with improving the agency&#8217;s performance, will be completed in December.</p>

  <p>The review will include wide-ranging consultation with Forest Enterprise&#8217;s customers, visitors and other interested parties, who are invited to contact the Secretary to the Forestry Commissioners, at 231 Corstorphine Road, Edinburgh EH12 7AT or to visit the Forestry Commission website at <strong><a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fereview" target="_blank">www.forestry.gov.uk/fereview.</a></strong></p>

  <p>One of the main messages of the National Waste Strategy: Scotland is that we need to reconsider, as individuals, how we deal with waste. We must try to apply the waste hierarchy wherever appropriate to reduce, reuse and recycle. Farmers, as producers of waste, will be expected to apply this principle.</p>

  <p>We are committed to bringing non-natural agricultural wastes (pesticide containers, plastics etc.) into the controlled waste management regime. This may result in farmers having to acquire a licence from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for the handling of these wastes.</p>

  <p>The strategy also identifies agricultural waste as a priority waste stream. This means that it is one of a number of wastes which will be the focus of a research project by SEPA. The research will provide information on the quantities of waste being produced, the treatment or disposal facilities available and the potential for development of alternative methods of treatment. SEPA plans to have completed all the priority waste projects by 2003.</p>

  <p>The original provision of 135 car parking spaces for the Parliament building was influenced primarily by security considerations which recommended a secure space for each MSP, and also by building regulations which requires a proportionate number of spaces to be provided for the disabled, in this case six spaces. Following a survey of MSP&#8217;s, and after weighing up both security and environmental considerations the SPCB decided that the number could sensibly be reduced to 65 while still retaining six spaces for the disabled. This decision was reported to MSPs in SPCB Report No. 3 of December 1999.</p>

  <p>The computerised random selection of questions for Question Time takes place on Wednesday each week, as soon as possible after 2pm. The Visual Basic random number generator (a function of the programming language that underpins the Word template) utilises a variable derived from the current date to create and assign a random number to each question in turn. The questions are then sorted in ascending order of their attached random number. On average between 50 and 60 questions are lodged each week for Question Time, so each question has approximately a 50% chance of being selected. First Minister&#8217;s questions are not of course selected by this method. <br /></p>
