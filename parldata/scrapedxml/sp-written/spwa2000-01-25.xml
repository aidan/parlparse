  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what access it has to papers of the previous administration and whether that access differs from the practice followed when there is a change of administration of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-01-25.S1W-3497.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80201" speakername="Mr Jack McConnell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0125.htm#3497">

  <p>When there is a change of Administration of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government in the United Kingdom, there is a long established convention that a new Administration does not normally have access to papers of a previous Administration of a different political complexion. The convention covers, in particular, Ministers&#8217; own deliberations and the advice given to them by officials, other than written advice from the Law Officers and those papers which were published or put in the public domain by the predecessor Administration.</p>

  <p>In applying the convention to the devolved administration in Scotland any information contained in administrative and departmental records belonging to a Minister of the Crown or a UK Government Department is treated as if it were contained in papers of a previous Administration of a different political complexion. This convention, therefore, qualifies the right conferred upon the Scottish Ministers by Article 10(2)(b) of the Transfer of Property (Scottish Ministers) Order 1999 (SI 1999/1104) to have access to certain administrative and departmental records belonging to a Minister of the Crown or a UK Government Department. In practice this means, in particular, that Scottish Ministers do not normally have access to advice given to Scottish Office Ministers or to the deliberations of those Ministers in papers dated before 1 July 1999, unless they have been published. Written opinions of the UK Law Officers which date from before 1 July 1999 may be made available.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-97 by Sarah Boyack on 30 June 1999, what targets it has set for recycling aggregates; what action it has taken to ensure that adopted Structure Plans have identified 10-year supplies of aggregates, and what it plans to do to ensure that an adequate supply of aggregates is available in local authority areas where sufficient local supplies of aggregates have not been identified.</p>

  <p>As my answer of 30 June indicated, research is currently being undertaken to gather information on recycling activity to inform consideration of the need for future targets. Structure Plans are examined at various stages by the Scottish Executive to ensure they are consistent with national planning policy. The Scottish Ministers can modify Structure Plans that are considered to be significantly out of accord with national policy. In some instances, joint working between planning authorities may be necessary to ensure adequate reserves are available.</p>

  <p>The attached table indicates those local authorities in Scotland which gave discretionary rates relief and the amounts granted in 1998-99, the first year of operation of the scheme. There are eight local authorities where no mandatory relief is given under the scheme as they have no eligible shops.</p>

  <p>Under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970, the Natural Environment Research Council is required to provide Scottish Ministers with scientific advice on matters related to the management of seal populations. In practice this advice is provided on an annual basis. I have just received the 1999 report and I will be considering its contents very carefully. I will ensure that a copy of this report is placed with SPICe.</p>

  <p>A range of individual research projects are underway to investigate different aspects of interactions between seals and fish, for example, seals and salmon on the River Conon and the feeding habits of seals in Lochs Shieldaig and Torridon.</p>

  <p>The Conservation of Seals Act 1970 already permits the shooting of seals, provided that an appropriately licensed firearm is used, during the open seasons; and limited shooting under licence during the close seasons for the prevention of damage to fisheries. Current policy recognises that control of seal predation on fisheries is best handled at the local level.</p>

  <p>The review of the Common Fisheries Policy is due to be completed by 2002. The first round of consultations between the European Commission, member states and the fishing industry was completed last year. We expect to see the Commission&#8217;s response to this exercise shortly at which time we will review developments with the industry. We are in broad agreement with the priorities expressed by the industry, which include a greater regional dimension to the CFP, and the maintenance of six and 12 mile coastal water limits and the principle of relative stability. Other issues, such as reduction in discarding of catches and the integration of environmental factors within fisheries policies, will also feature within the CFP review.</p>

  <p>Satellite monitoring arrangements apply to fishing vessels over 24 metres in overall length and are intended to supplement existing control measures.</p>

  <p>As yet experience has to be gained of the practical operation of satellite monitoring. However, the Community has amended the rules for the Shetland Box so that satellite position reports may be accepted as fulfilling the obligations on masters of vessels over 24 metres to notify entry into and exit from the Box.</p>

  <p>The implications of satellite monitoring arrangements have also been considered as part of a recent review of pelagic management arrangements undertaken by a joint industry/Fisheries Departments working group. The group's report recommended, and we have agreed, some consequential changes to the arrangements for the exchange and uplift of pelagic licences. A copy of the report has been placed in SPICe for information. The Fisheries Departments will be writing to pelagic interests shortly setting out detailed guidance on the new arrangements.</p>

  <p>Training in diagnostic skills is a fundamental part of medical undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing education.

  <p>It is not Scottish Executive policy to publish ministerial diaries although we would be happy to give details of any specific visit. The intention is always to give MSPs and MPs notice of any ministerial engagements in their constituency.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether inland waterways freight facilities grant (IWFFG) is treated as a separate budget allocation from the freight facilities grant, whether executive devolution exists in the administration of IWFFG, whether the Scottish Executive has control of the criteria by which awards of IWFFG are made, and, if so, what use has been made to date of IWFFG in Scotland, what applications are currently being considered, and whether an offer of grant will be made to facilitate timber movements from Argyll to Ayr harbour.</p>

  <p>Freight Facilities Grant (FFG) for inland waterways is drawn from the same budget allocation available for railway projects. This amounts to &pound;18.3 million for the three years between 1999-2000 and 2001-02. Inland waterways are a devolved matter and the Scottish Ministers have responsibility for the administration of FFG for inland waterways by applying criteria common to the FFG scheme as a whole.</p>

  <p>To date there have been no awards of FFG for inland waterways. Several proposals are under consideration, including a number dealing with the movement of timber. However, because of commercial sensitivities, it would be inappropriate to give further details.<br /></p>
