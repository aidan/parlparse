  <p>On 2 June 2006, the UK Government hosted the eighth British-Irish Council (BIC) Summit in London, attended by myself and Mr Ross Finnie MSP, Minister for Environment and Rural Development. The focus of the summit was the Environment on which the UK Government takes the lead in the council.</p>

  <p>The council recognised that, as well as mitigating future emissions, BIC Members must also look at how to adapt to the impacts of unavoidable climate change. Ministers availed of the opportunity to share experience and exchange knowledge in order to improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change and to develop appropriate adaptation strategies.</p>

  <p>The council recognised the importance of scientific knowledge in developing effective strategies to prepare for the impacts of climate change. The council agreed to look at ways in which Governments, Agencies and researchers across the British-Irish Council region can work together to improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change.</p>

  <p>The council agreed on a number of further areas where the BIC could usefully examine the impacts of climate change. These include impacts on the marine environment, the increased likelihood of extreme weather events, implications for energy and transport infrastructure, and the potential effects on the economies of BIC Members. The council agreed on a number of proposals for work going forward including participation in the Marine Climate Change Partnership, the sharing of best practice, participation in a workshop on the development of adaptation strategies, and the establishment of a working group on indicators of climate change impacts and adaptation.</p>

  <p>As with previous summits, the meeting also received progress reports and agreed a plan for future work on the other subjects being taken forward by council members. These are drugs; environment; knowledge economy; minority and lesser-used languages; tourism; transport, and social inclusion.</p>

  <p>At this summit, Scottish ministers proposed a new priority work area for the BIC - Demography. The council agreed that demographic issues, such as attitudes to ageing and migration strategies, present significant challenges for BIC Member Administrations and that there is much to be gained from sharing experience, information and approaches to them.</p>

  <p>The council approved the proposal to adopt Demography as a new work area, to be led by Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am placing a copy of the <em>Communiqu&eacute;</em> issued by the British-Irish Council after the summit meeting in London in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39921).</p>

  <p>There are no centrally held statistics describing the characteristics of victims of crime across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Data from the Scottish Crime Survey (SCS), however, can give some insight into the prevalence of crime victimisation amongst young people.

  <p>The Dental Workforce Planning report published by the Scottish Executive in 2000 shows that the range of graduate numbers for full cohorts in Edinburgh over the period 1990-93 was 34 to 45. In the final full year of training, 45 students graduated from the school. This represents a potential annual average training capacity of 38 graduates per year lost as a result of closure.</p>

  <p>The total intake of UK dental students in Scotland reduced from 151 in 1989-90 to 120 in 1996-97. This represents a loss of 31 places available to dental students in Scotland due to the review of dental student numbers and the closure of Edinburgh Dental School.

  <p>Fatal accident inquiries (FAI) are concerned with the circumstances of a wide range of sudden and unexpected deaths. It is the responsibility of the Procurator Fiscal to initiate a FAI and to inform the family of the deceased of this course of action. Thereafter Victim Information and Advice (VIA) will usually make contact with the family and keep it informed of the progress of the inquiry and its outcome.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-26793 on 20 June 2006 which provides more detail on the role of VIA in relation to its work with the families of a deceased whose death is the subject of a FAI.</p>

  <p>More general support for families of deceased persons whose deaths are considered by FAIs is available from a range of organisations depending on the nature and circumstances of the death of the family member. Depending on the circumstances of the death VIA will attempt to identify an appropriate agency that can provide relevant assistance and support and recommend it to the family.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made no detailed assessment of the impact of fuel prices alone on the rural economy. Nevertheless, we are aware that the Rural Scotland Price Survey showed that in 2003 fuel prices in some rural areas were 13% higher than in urban Scotland. There is also a greater dependency on car transport for many in rural Scotland, reflected in rates of 80% of employed adults in accessible rural areas and 77% in remote rural areas making their usual journey to work by car, compared with 65% for Scotland as a whole (Scottish Household Survey (2004). Ministers will continue to monitor the situation and make representations to the UK Government as they consider appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Executive plans to continue to use the Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) to monitor fuel poverty in Scotland. This report is produced annually and can be used to model the impact of fuel price rises. Modelling based on figures from the 2002 SHCS estimated that every 5% increase in fuel prices could result in another 30,000 fuel poor households if incomes remain unchanged.</p>

  <p>The information requested has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39934) and covers allocations for the main funding programmes targeted specifically at eradicating deprivation since 1999, namely the Social Inclusion Partnership and Better Neighbourhood Services Fund programmes and their successor Community Regeneration Fund; the Working for Families Fund, and funding recently allocated to tackle the problems of financial inclusion worklessness and young people not in education, employment or training (NEET).</p>

  <p>It should be noted that these specific allocations represent a small proportion of the total funding which has an impact on deprivation, particularly the core budgets of local government and the health service. Currently, adjustments for deprivation in terms of Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) to local government are made to 25 GAE sub-services linked to a total of &pound;2 billion out of a total GAE of &pound;9 billion. Similarly, the vast majority (75%) of health resources are allocated using the Arbuthnott formula, which includes an adjustment for deprivation levels.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s May 2005 submission to the Finance Committee&rsquo;s Cross-cutting Inquiry into Deprivation Expenditure (provided details of other funding streams which take account of deprivation but also have other purposes.

<p>No, unless in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>No specific guidance has been issued on the management of women prisoners who are in labour. Only around two women a year give birth while in custody and the last birth was subject to close liaison between Reliance and healthcare staff. This helps ensure that ethical standards are met. A risk assessment is done in each case and it is a matter for Reliance to then determine the appropriate escort arrangements. This has resulted in the prisoner being handcuffed while in labour. The company have recently reviewed their approach and subject to a risk assessment, Reliance no longer handcuff prisoners while in hospitalised labour and handcuffs are not put on the prisoner until after bonding with the baby has taken place.</p>

  <p>Under current arrangements, if such a request were to be received, the decision would be made by the Deputy Chief Constable of Tayside Police who has lead responsibility within the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland for DNA. Responsibility for the DNA database is expected to move to the Scottish Police Services Authority from April 2007.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-25544 by Cathy Jamieson on 13 June 2006, what specifically is meant by the statement that the fingerprint officers involved in the court presentation of fingerprint evidence in the Marion Ross murder case &quot;are employed in the checking and auditing of processes and procedures, and in general supervisory duties within the Glasgow Fingerprint Bureau.&quot;</p>

  <p>Specifically, the fingerprint officers involved in the court presentation of fingerprint evidence in the Marion Ross murder case carry out internal auditing of processes as requested by the Quality Manager and quality check documentation already approved to go to court. This includes checking that all required processes have been adhered to for case work; that all information on the status of cases is entered on to the office management system, and that proposed changes to local work instruction do not adversely affect other processes and procedures. They do not check the fingerprint identifications of other officers and are not providing fingerprint evidence in court.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made available to East and West Dunbartonshire Councils since 1999, the provision shown in the following table for local roads.</p>

  <p>The allocations shown in the table include East and West Dunbartonshire&rsquo;s share of the additional funding of &pound;60 million per annum that the Executive has made available to all Scottish local authorities for improving local roads in 2006-07 and 2007-08 as part of Spending Review 2004.</p>

  <p>Although these are the allocations which the Executive provides it is for each local authority to determine its own priorities and expenditure.</p>

  <p>The establishment of the new statutory Regional Transport Partnerships through the development of their Regional Transport Strategies provides an opportunity to consider and prioritise projects and identify funding. Strathclyde Partnership for Transport will receive a total of &pound;25,227,647 per annum for the next two years for the development of transport projects in the West of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Tolls ended on the Erskine Bridge on 31 March 2006 to ease congestion in Glasgow particularly through the Clyde Tunnel and on the Clydeside Expressway, and have a beneficial impact on air quality in the city.</p>
