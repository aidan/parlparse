  <p>It is up to the individuals involved to decide on how they wish to trade. It is true that, in Scotland, most husband and wife teams will form a partnership for the purposes of claiming subsidy. However, many prefer to trade as a sole producer with only the husband or the wife becoming directly involved in the farming enterprise. This remains a business decision which the couple must take. Once that decision has been taken the business will then claim subsidies either as a partnership or a sole producer regardless of issues such as marital status.</p>

  <p>Since the introduction of livestock quotas in 1993, a system of ring fencing has been in place to protect the movement of quota away from sensitive areas. It is therefore not possible for producers taking a business decision to move from one constituent part of the UK to another to use their existing quota in a different ring-fence area, whether or not it was allocated from a National Reserve. Quota is however tradeable and producers may sell the quota they hold relating to their original ring-fence designation and purchase quota relating to their new designation. Producers who receive quota from a National Reserve, however, must use their quota to claim premium for three years following its allocation before they can sell or temporarily lease it.</p>

  <p>The suckler cow premium scheme national reserve has to be created from existing quota and is supplied by quota siphoned from quota sold on the open market. In addition to siphons of quota, the reserve normally also receives quota removed from producers who have failed to use their quota either by claiming premium or leasing it to other producers or a combination of both.</p>

  <p>The UK currently operates a 15% siphon to quota transactions, the maximum permitted under EC legislation.</p>

  <p>Many producers choose to use the services of agricultural consultants on a variety of business matters, including the claiming of EU subsidies. The Scottish Agricultural College offers a full range of such services for which they charge fees. When offering advice on business issues, including those relating to livestock quotas, the college does so purely on a commercial basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive maintains regular dialogue with the industry on key issues through the Scottish Construction Industry Group. Two key issues that have been raised at recent meetings have been taking forward <i>Rethinking Construction</i> in Scotland and industry capacity. In response to a proposal from the Scottish Construction Industry Group and key industry stakeholders, the Executive has granted funding for a secondee to a short-term project to manage and promote knowledge on best practice and <i>Rethinking Construction</i> activities throughout Scotland. To help ensure capacity within the industry, the Executive in January announced up to &#163;100,000 funding for research to help maximise employment opportunities from housing stock transfer. A report from the research is expected shortly after which the Executive will consider the findings.</p>

  <p>I announced on 20 September that I intend to revise the current system of assessment to ensure that a coherent integrated system is in operation in both primary and secondary schools. A key issue is the transition between primary and secondary school and the measures that I announced are designed to ensure an improved interface between primary and secondary school.</p>

  <p>Education authorities manage collaboration amongst associated schools&#8217; groups and there are good examples where joint planning and teaching of programmes in specific subjects has improved pupils&#8217; transition from P7 to S1. Recent revision of 5-14 guidelines, for example in Environmental Studies and Modern European Languages, should support and improve collaborative planning by identifying lines of progression more clearly.</p>

  <p>HM Inspectors of Education use published quality indicators to evaluate links between primary and secondary schools as part of school inspections. The School Improvement Framework will provide schools with information on their progress in meeting targets related to the National Priorities for education, also using quality indicators. This will allow better feedback on the learning and achievements of P7 pupils, ensuring more effective provision and support for pupils as they enter secondary school.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what year-on-year improvements in reducing the number of days lost through exclusions from school and truancy have been achieved since the target of reducing this number by a third was set.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-10-04.S1W-18339.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80201" speakername="Mr Jack McConnell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1004.htm#8">

  <p>The level of unauthorised absence in both primary and secondary schools was stable between 1997-98 and 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>It is too early to identify trends in exclusion as the annual survey of exclusions so far covers only two years. However, although the number of temporary exclusions increased slightly between 1998-99 and 1999-2000, the number of days lost has gone down as a result of a reduction in the average length of an exclusion. The number of removals from register has also increased slightly but nearly half of these have not resulted in any break in attendance.</p>

  <p>The Discipline Task Group report <i>Better Behaviour - Better Learning</i> makes recommendations which will assist local authorities in delivering year-on-year improvements in reducing exclusion and truancy. An action plan for implementation of the recommendations is being drawn up and I expect to publish it in a few weeks time.</p>

  <p>The Committee on Overseas Promotion (COP) is the formal organisation for the partnership between Invest-UK and all the national and regional inward investment agencies in the United Kingdom, including Locate in Scotland (LiS).</p>

  <p>COP has developed agreed procedures governing how the necessary degree of co-ordination, with regard to the handling of potential international mobile projects, is carried out on a day to day basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, through LiS, keeps in contact with the UK Government to discuss inward investment-related issues at the regular meetings of COP.</p>

  <p>Additionally, LiS officials maintain regular contact with Invest-UK on a number of operational issues. For example, senior LiS officials will be attending the two day COP meeting in November to discuss likely forward trends and marketing strategy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, through Scottish Trade International (STI), is committed to helping all Scottish exporters. STI&#8217;s activities have, over the past five years, been directed by &quot;The International Challenge&quot; Export Development Strategy for Scotland, with its focus on small- and medium-sized companies. During this period, the target of assisting 500 companies to export for the first time was exceeded by more than 20%. A network of 13 Export Partnerships, bringing together the Local Enterprise Company, local authorities and Chambers of Commerce, was also created across Scotland, to provide co-ordinated support to companies at a local level.</p>

  <p>In 2000-01 alone, STI worked with over 1,100 companies in Scotland and as well as helping new exporters, also helped introduce existing exporters to 567 new markets. In addition, in the same year the Scottish Enterprise Network and Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise together engaged in around 2,500 export competitiveness projects.</p>

  <p>The continuing need to ensure that companies in Scotland are able to realise the full benefits of trading in international markets is a key feature of the Global Connections Strategy launched today. This will provide a focus for future international economic development activity.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish details of any breaches by it of European environmental law currently being investigated by the European Commission and what action it is taking both in respect of any such breaches and to prevent any in future.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-10-04.S1O-3901.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1004.htm#11">

  <p>All member states of the European Union are currently the subject of investigations by the European Commission regarding breaches of European environmental law. The United Kingdom has a good record on such matters.</p>

  <p>There is one breach of European environmental law concerning Scotland where the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued a formal judgment against the UK&#8217;s implementation of the EC Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC).</p>

  <p>In this case, which is a result of the UK&#8217;s implementation of the directive in the early 1990s, the UK had taken the view that the directive applied to surface freshwaters and groundwaters only where necessary to protect drinking water sources. In the course of proceedings culminating in the ECJ judgment, the UK admitted this was incorrect and that the Directive applied to the protection of all freshwaters on the surface and underground.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive now plans to consult on new Nitrate Vulnerable Zones later this year, working closely with stakeholders at all stages of the process. This will lead to designations where appropriate.</p>

  <p>In addition there are two environmental infraction cases concerning Scotland where a notice has been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities that the cases have been referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by the European Commission. The first concerns an alleged breach of the Bathing Water Directive (76/160/EEC); and the second concerns three Waste Management Directives (the Waste Framework (75/442/EEC), Hazardous Waste (91/689/EEC), and Packaging Waste (91/62/EEC) Directives).</p>

  <p>Regarding the Bathing Water case, the Scottish Executive is committed to bringing Scotland&#8217;s 60 designated bathing beaches up to European standards. This commitment was made in the knowledge that it would involve an enormous programme of work to redress years of underinvestment in our water infrastructure. The Executive is in the middle of a programme of investment of around &#163;3.5 billion over seven years, about half of which will be spent on waste water issues. This will bring substantial improvement to the Scottish coastline.</p>

  <p>As this investment programme progresses it is bringing into focus other causes of bathing water failure. These point to the need to tackle diffuse pollution. The Scottish Executive is working with farmers and others to identify and combat non-sewage causes of pollution of bathing waters.</p>

  <p>The Waste Management case relates to the requirement to prepare waste plans. The Executive has accepted that the plans relevant to this case &#8211; prepared by the former District and Islands Councils - were not adequate. Nevertheless, the Executive believes that the <i>National Waste</i> <i>Strategy for Scotland</i>, supplemented with further detailed data on waste in Scotland which are to be published shortly by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, will meet the directives&#8217; requirements.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to the promotion of sustainable development and the protection and improvement of Scotland&#8217;s environment, and it is determined to implement its European environmental obligations properly.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes its involvement with Europe needs to be about more than just legislation, and it is committed to putting Scotland at the heart of the European movement for sustainable development. As part of this it is organising two seminars on the environment as part of Scotland Week in Brussels on 11 and 12 October.</p>

  <p>The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill will, if enacted, establish a general legal right of access to information held by Scottish public authorities. The Bill also includes necessary safeguards to protect sensitive information.</p>

  <p>Police road traffic accident reports often contain sensitive information, most notably those on accidents involving fatalities, and placing this information in the public domain may cause significant distress to, for example, victims&#8217; families. As the Bill would provide a right of access open to all, with applicants not needing to demonstrate any specific interest in the information requested, it will not normally be appropriate for police road traffic accident reports to be disclosed to the wider public under Freedom of Information. It is envisaged that public authorities will consider requests for disclosure of police road traffic accident reports under the exemption at section 34 of the Bill and, in accordance with section 2, consider whether there is a public interest in disclosure.</p>

  <p>Police road traffic accident reports may of course continue to be made available in private to those with a legitimate interest.</p>

  <p>All provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 are coming into force across the UK according to the timetables that have been set out in the legislation. There will be no delay in applying the Act to the NHS.</p>

  <p>There continues to be concerns about the impact of legislation and existing common law requirements on important NHS data processing, and equally importantly, it has become clear that the patient-centred service we wish to build requires us to build a different relationship between patients and service providers, one that gives patients more control over who sees their health records and for what reasons. No change is no longer an option but change must be carefully managed. The Health and Social Care Act 2001 provides the Secretary of State for Health with power to make specified uses of patient information a requirement in law in England and Wales. This is a largely transitional measure, intended to ensure that key activity can continue whilst changes to systems and working practices, that will permit the standards required by law, ethics and policy to be met, are made.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, we have been consulting on our own programme of change and expect the results of this consultation to be available later in the year. We are committed to ensuring that there is no disruption to essential NHS activity and have not dismissed legislation as an option.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*Age data was not collected for students on non-vocational courses until 1998-99, therefore figures for 1997-98 are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Information for the most recent year (2000-01) is not yet available. This is because the information is collected after the end of each academic year. We have therefore included figures for 1997-98 to illustrate a three-year period.</p>

  <p>No. The learning provider must obtain the Individual Learning Account (ILA) holder&#8217;s signature on an enrolment form before the course of study commences. This serves as the ILA holder&#8217;s authority for the learning provider to claim ILA monies from the holder&#8217;s account.

  <p>Following agreement between the Scottish Office and COSLA, funding of mainstream local authority criminal justice services has, since April 1999, been based on a formula approach focused on workloads and needs factors. There are no plans to change this approach.</p>

  <p>However, with effect from 2002-03 financial year, funding will in future be provided to groupings of, rather than individual, local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has today introduced the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill in the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Executive issued a draft of the Bill on 30 March and received over 80 responses to that consultation. I have today placed a copy of responses to the consultation, except those given in confidence, in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Of the 31 councils that responded, 22 were in favour of both a move to four-year terms for councils and coincident local government and Scottish Parliament elections.</p>

  <p>Many responses to the consultation commented adversely on the draft provisions to combine local government elections with an extraordinary parliamentary election held for the Scottish Parliament. Although it was expected that this power would only be used exceptionally - one possible example might be where an extraordinary election fell only a few weeks before the due date - the Executive recognises the objection of councils that, as originally drafted, the power could be used more widely. We have therefore decided to drop the general power from the Bill but retain an option where an extraordinary election runs close to a local government election. The council tax setting date of 11 March has been raised as a suitable date and seems a sensible break point.</p>

  <p>A number of councils asked whether it would be possible to trial new electoral procedures similar to those run in England and Wales for the May 2000 local government elections. Accordingly, we have amended the Bill to provide for similar pilots to be run at local government elections in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to providing better public services for the people of Scotland. Quality schemes such as Charter Mark and Investors in People have a part to play, and the Executive facilitates the exchange of best practice and promotes quality schemes through its Quality Networks. The Executive itself is an Investor in People and we encourage Scottish public service providers who wish to attain these and other externally assessed accreditations. There were 56 Scottish Charter Mark winners in 2000, up from 44 the previous year. We want to ensure that the steady increase in Scottish organisations securing these accreditations continues and we are developing programmes to raise further the profile of quality schemes within the Scottish public service.</p>

  <p>No. As I have previously indicated, the decision to close the Stirling Office was taken after careful consideration of a number of options. I reviewed the decision in the light of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and other difficulties facing the industry, and concluded that this was still the best option.</p>

  <p>As part of the drive for continuous improvement, the consultation on the Standard for Full Registration was launched last week, in partnership with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS).</p>

  <p>When introduced from August 2002, the Standard for Full Registration will serve two main purposes. It will provide:</p>

  <p>a clear and concise description of the professional qualities and capabilities teachers are expected to develop in the course of induction, and</p>

  <p>a professional standard against which reliable and consistent decisions can be made on the fitness of new teachers for full registration with the General Teaching Council for Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are working with our partners to develop a national framework for teachers&#8217; continuing professional development. The CPD framework, which will be in place from August 2003, will enable teachers to maintain and enhance their professional skills throughout the life of their teaching career and will underpin the new contractual obligation on all teachers to undertake 35 hours professional development each year, in addition to current working hours.</p>

  <p>Data on the amounts of waste, electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) disposed of are not held centrally. A recent research report commissioned by the Executive and entitled <i>The Determination of the Source, Nature, Amount and Disposal Routes of WEEE Arising in Scotland</i> , that is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 14595) estimated that some 42,000 tonnes of WEEE was produced in 2000. Much of this may have been landfilled although some will have been reused or recycled.</p>

  <p>There is no definition of what is an &quot;environmentally acceptable&quot; way in which to dispose of WEEE but the proposed EC Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment will prescribe treatment standards when it is introduced. In the meantime, it is an offence to dispose of any waste in a way that causes harm to human health or pollution of the environment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive set up an Advisory Group on Youth Crime and, following its report, accepted all the group&#8217;s recommendations. Work has begun on implementing them. In particular, this includes the allocation of &#163;20 million over three years, from April 2001, to local authorities for the development of community-based programmes to reduce offending by persistent young offenders. The Scottish Executive has consulted widely with key interests on the implementation of the report and will be circulating a strategic framework for local authority activities before the end of the year. Scottish ministers are also considering the terms of a feasibility study into pilot schemes to divert 16 and 17-year-old minor offenders away from the adult criminal justice system.</p>

  <p>Statistics on these specific areas are not currently available to track progress. In Scotland, young people under 16 who offend are dealt with by the Children&#8217;s Hearing system and those over 16 are normally prosecuted through the criminal justice system. However, recent trends from monthly statistical returns for the level of casework activity of Reporters, collected by the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration, indicate that the number of young people detained in custody by the police aged under 16 has declined in recent years.</p>

  <p>Our aim is to significantly reduce the number of young people involved in crime. The Children&#8217;s Hearing system exists in part to divert those under 16 from the court system. It is generally regarded as successful and its aims receive broad-based support. This is why the Scottish Executive is developing a scheme to test, on a pilot basis, whether the offending behaviour of a significant number of 16 and 17-year-olds could be dealt with effectively within the Children&#8217;s Hearing system. Also, earlier this year, the Scottish Executive announced a three-year &#163;20 million investment programme to enable local authorities to set up multi-agency youth crime teams and to develop community-based programmes to reduce offending among persistent young offenders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to promoting social inclusion and citizenship for all young people. &#163;20 million has been committed over the next three years to provide programmes to tackle persistent offending so that fewer young people will graduate to the adult criminal justice system. Drug use by children or their families has been identified as an important factor which affects offending behaviour. A further &#163;18 million has therefore been allocated over the next three years to tackling drugs misuse by or affecting children, young people and families through the Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund.</p>

  <p>In addition, over the next three years, some &#163;87 million will be spent on facilities and programmes for sport in schools and outdoor adventure through the New Opportunities Fund, with a particular emphasis on offering positive alternatives to youth crime and anti-social behaviour.</p>
