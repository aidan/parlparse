  <p>The culling of poultry on premises infected by avian influenza is a requirement of the EU Avian Influenza Directive. The Scottish Executive is working with the other UK administrations to make vaccination a credible option for the control of avian influenza. However, substantial scientific and operational issues still need to be resolved, and it remains unlikely at present that vaccination could be used routinely as a disease control tool. High levels of surveillance, biosecurity and rapid action, including stamping out, currently remain the most effective ways of controlling avian influenza.</p>

  <p>Sections 39 to 42 of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005, which have been commenced only for the purpose of making regulations, establish a new regime for the reorganisation of charities, enabling charities to seek approval for reorganisation from the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR), rather than having to apply to court. These provisions replace the old reorganisation provisions for most charities contained in the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)(Scotland) Act 1990, and for charities which are also educational endowments under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. As the new provisions allow charities to apply to OSCR to reorganise as opposed to the court, the new regime will be both cheaper and quicker for charities.</p>

  <p>We are currently developing regulations under sections 39, which make provision about the form and manner of applications to OSCR, and intend to consult on the new regulations later this year. We intend to commence the provisions and bring these regulations into force early next year.</p>

  <p>As with other acts of the Scottish Parliament, implementation of the Charities and Trustees Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 has been a phased process. While most sections of the act have come into force, the following sections remain to be commenced:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>(i) sections 39 to 42 which relate to the reorganisation of charities,</p>
<p>(ii) sections 49 to 64 of the act which relate to Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisations,</p>
<p>(iii) sections 84 to 92 which relate to public benevolent collections,</p>
<p>(iv) section 96 (power of a charity to participate in certain financial schemes) and</p>
<p>(v) schedule 4 paragraphs 5(b) and (c), and 11.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The sections detailed in (i) to (iii) and consequentially the amendments in (v), above, will be commenced with the introduction of secondary legislation, which is necessary to set out the detail of how these provisions will operate. We will be drafting and consulting on these secondary regulations, after which the relevant sections of the act will come into force.</p>

  <p>Section 96 will be commenced following the enactment of the UK Charities Bill, currently in Committee Stage in the House of Commons, which will allow Scottish charities to participate in Common Investment Funds.</p>

  <p>It is the general policy of the UK Government and the Scottish Executive not to import radioactive waste, except for the recovery of re-usable material, where that is the genuine prime purpose, or for treatment to ensure the future safe management of the waste, where such process would be impracticable in the country of origin. The Executive cooperates with other government departments.</p>

  <p>The Home Office has lead responsibility for the implementation of programme Cyclamen, a three year programme managed by HM Revenue and Customs with full co-operation from the Police, to introduce radiation detection equipment at ports and airports to support counter-terrorism measures.</p>

  <p>Radiation screening equipment, fixed and mobile radiation detection units, have been introduced at UK ports and Airports to routinely screen UK bound goods vehicles and passengers for the illicit importation of radioactive materials.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Health and Safety Executive has issued a Sector Information Minute which serves as guidance for the industry and its inspectors, and the British Metals Recycling Association has produced guidance and information for its members. Moreover, the major purchasers of scrap metal require the supplier to declare that the consignment is free of radioactive contamination and this has resulted in the installation of monitoring systems at various stages in the supply chain.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold figures centrally on the amount of coal imported into Scotland. However, as a part of the Scottish Energy study some estimates were made for Scottish coal imports and exports for 2002: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/01/19092748/25" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/01/19092748/25</a> .</p>

  <p>These suggest that in 2002 around 3.9 million tonnes of coal were imported into Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Office contributed &pound;3.5 million to Phase I which involved the redevelopment of the north and east stands. That work was completed in 1994. As part of the Phase II redevelopment, which involved the construction of a new south stand and improvements to the west stand, the Scottish Office contributed &pound;2 million over the three financial years from 1997-98 to 1999-2000 and the Scottish Executive contributed an additional &pound;2.75 million in 1999-2000.

  <p>No provisions were in place for the public purse to benefit from the profits of running Hampden Park. However, provisions were put in place for a specific proportionate repayment of grant in the event of Queen&rsquo;s Park Football Club Limited selling, leasing (otherwise than for football matches) or disposing any interest in Hampden Park without the prior consent of the then Secretary of State for Scotland or Scottish ministers. This provision for Phase I redevelopment lapsed in 2005 and for Phase II is in place until 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not allocate funding directly to Community Health Partnerships (CHPs).</p>

  <p>NHS boards receive a total funding allocation from the Scottish Executive which they use to implement their overall Delivery Plans. CHPs are part of NHS boards and therefore receive delegated budgets from NHS boards to plan and deliver a range of services including all primary and community based services.</p>

  <p>All approved Schemes of Establishment are available on the Scottish Executive web site(<a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/chp/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/chp/index.htm</a>) and include indicative percentages of delegated NHS board funding to CHPs for 2005- 06.</p>

  <p>Twelve NHS boards have established CHPs. The schemes of Establishment for NHS Orkney and NHS Western Isles are under discussion. Ten NHS boards devolved funding to CHPs in 2005-06. CHPs in Greater Glasgow were in shadow form in 2005-06 and there was no funding devolved to them. CHPs in NHS Lanarkshire did not become operational until 1 April 2006 and therefore no funding was funding in 2005-06.</p>

  <p>The following table sets out the percentage of Board budgets, as advised by each NHS board, devolved to their CHPs for the year ending 31 March 2006:</p>

  <p>We discussed issues related to the post office network, in particular in rural areas. Royal Mail and Post Office representatives explained the work that has been on-going to explore alternative, more sustainable means of service delivery. I made clear my view of the importance of post offices to rural communities and the need to explore various delivery models &ndash; including co-location of public or private sector services &ndash; in attempts to ensure the continuation of viable services and facilities wherever possible. It was agreed that officials should keep in touch and the Environment and Rural Development Department would seek to assist where possible towards that aim, within the limits of devolved powers.</p>

  <p>We are undertaking a Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) which will provide an opportunity to consider future strategic investment priorities for all modes of transport across the whole transport network in Scotland, including transport corridors, such as the A9 between Perth and Inverness. In addition to the Perth &ndash; Inverness corridor, being assessed through the (STPR).</p>

  <p>I recently announced the outcome of the Route Action Strategy Study between Perth and Blair Atholl which identified &pound;165 million worth of potential long-term improvement work on the southern section of the A9 and recommended that more detailed analysis on this be carried out to confirm the practicality. I have agreed to this further work being done to fully assess the implications and practicalities of dualling between Perth and Pitlochry, provision of safe overtaking opportunities and reconstruction along this important, but environmentally sensitive route.</p>
