  <p>The Executive corresponded on this subject with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) in December last year. The payment of discretionary bursaries remains a matter for each local authority. Although COSLA offered to re-issue its existing guidance on discretionary bursaries, it did not propose to strengthen it and explained that the approach to discretionary bursaries by individual councils would reflect the many competing demands being faced by them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cycle Training Scheme, overseen by the Scottish Road Safety Campaign, recommends that on-road training should be provided where possible. Police and local authority Road Safety Units are responsible for carrying out risk assessment on any roads to be used for on-road training and for decisions on whether it is appropriate to conduct on-road training in any particular case. A new resource pack for Road Safety Officers to use when training volunteer trainers, developed by the campaign, will be issued to Road Safety Units in March. It will recommend that parental consent should be obtained before any cycle training for school pupils is undertaken.</p>

  <p>None.

  <p>Emergency planning across Europe and elsewhere reflects the particular threats, risks, hazards and possibility of occurrence relative to the country in question. We already have excellent emergency planning liaison with our European neighbours, including Sweden in particular, exchanging experience and expertise with them.</p>

  <p>In making payments to over 8,000 primary care contractors each month it is inevitable that occasional errors or estimates will result in over or underpayments. Normally such items are corrected immediately following payment. Other than this there is no evidence of over or underpayments for opticians or doctors.</p>

  <p>For dentists, the recently introduced Commitment Payment is currently calculated on an estimated basis and as a result of this a number of dentists may have been temporarily over or underpaid by a small amount. Commitment payments comprise less than 2% of total payments to dentists.</p>

  <p>For pharmacists, delays resulting from the commissioning of the new computer system mean that all contractors are paid estimates, which will be more or less than the correct payment. However, all over or underpayments are currently being corrected within three months.</p>

Detailed inspection guidelines for Inspectors include guidance on how library provision will be evaluated. This guidance draws on comments made by school librarians during inspection, and on the national document <i>Taking a Closer Look at The School Library Resource Centre</i> published in 1999 by the Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum. HMI hold regular liaison meetings with key interested bodies to discuss inspection related matters, and allow issues of concern to be raised.</p>

  <p>Extensive consultations with these sectors have taken place over a number of years.</p>

  <p>During July and August 1998, the East of Scotland Water Authority (ESWA) undertook a consultation exercise covering proposals for a new approach to charging non-domestic customers. This involved the issue of a booklet to a wide range of customers and representative bodies, including the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO). They also arranged a series of public meetings throughout the ESWA area.</p>

  <p>The North of Scotland Water Authority undertook a similar exercise during the same period, taking the form of a series of public meetings and circulation of a booklet to representative bodies, again including the SCVO. In February 1999, they sent almost 1,000 letters to customers who would be impacted by the withdrawal of relief.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the then Customers Council conducted its own research at this time.</p>

  <p>In January 1999, the West of Scotland Water Authority wrote to almost 2,000 customers who would be affected by the withdrawal of reliefs from water charges.</p>

  <p>The water authorities met jointly with the SCVO on 20 January 1999, when they detailed the reasons, timescales involved and approximate financial impacts of this decision.</p>

  <p>A minister from the former Scottish Office met the SCVO in April 1999 to discuss this issue, as did Sarah Boyack in July 1999. Separately, there has also been correspondence between ministers, officials and the SCVO.</p>

  <p>Most recently, in June of last year, the water authorities jointly consulted on a review of the policy of granting reliefs from water and wastewater charges to certain organisations. This involved the sending of individual letters and questionnaires to over 11,000 organisations as well as the representative bodies.</p>

  <p>The possibility of wildfowl inhabiting the &quot;water feature&quot; pools at the Parliament buildings&#8217; public entrance has been anticipated by the landscape architects, and is a common problem to be overcome when designing water features. The Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that at the moment the intention is for an underwater pumping system to be installed to discourage any wildfowl from attempting to settle in the water, which will be extremely shallow. However, further advice will be taken at the appropriate time.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer <a name="QuestionText">how the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body will ensure that the four water features opposite the entrance to the new Parliament building at Holyrood are maintained at a clean and attractive standard and that the growth of algae and discoloration of the surrounding stonework is prevented.</a></p>

  <p>The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that it is intended for the water contained in the &quot;water-feature&quot; pools, at the Parliament buildings&#8217; public entrance, to be re-circulated on a regular basis. This process prevents water becoming stagnant and the build up of algae. Routine maintenance will also ensure that the quality of finish is maintained.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer which glazed areas of the new Parliament building at Holyrood will use security glass able to withstand external explosions or penetration from projectiles, such as rocks or bricks.</p>

  <p>Government guidelines exist which set out physical security requirements for the construction of certain &quot;politically sensitive&quot; public buildings. The guidelines include glazing specifications. The Holyrood Project Group has informed me that these have been incorporated into the design for the Parliament building complex.</p>
