  <p>There are a range of steps being taken at Scottish and UK levels.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive's Childcare Strategy aims to provide affordable, accessible, good quality childcare to meet the needs of working parents. The Executive is providing &#163;16.75 million of Childcare Strategy funding in 2002-03 and 2003-04 to local authorities which are responsible, with Childcare Partnerships, for its disbursement.</p>

  <p>Also, the Executive's Training for Work programme aims to help mothers who wish to return to work through the provision of appropriate training and structured work activity.</p>

  <p>At UK level, the New Deal for Lone Parents aims to provide lone parents, of whom over 90% are women, with the help they need to take up and remain in employment.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Employment Bill introduces improvements to existing maternity rights from April 2003 and the introduction of the new Working Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit from April 2003 will have a positive impact for many families and individuals across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Work-Life Balance campaign exists to raise awareness among employers of the benefits of implementing flexible working practices by establishing dialogue with businesses, trade unions and professional organisations to research and disseminate best practice examples in flexible working.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not given instructions to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) on this matter, and has no plans to do so.</p>

  <p>SEPA is required to follow the terms of the Radioactive Substances (Basic Safety Standards) (Scotland) Direction 2000, which lays down safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation. SEPA is currently satisfied that the monitoring programme undertaken by the UK Atomic Energy Authority on Sandside Beach meets those requirements.</p>

  <p>Graduate students are not eligible for further support if they are improving an existing advanced level qualification or have previously received bursary or SAAS (Student Awards Agency for Scotland) support. The reason for this is that it has to be recognised that there is considerable competition for support and it would be unfair if those seeking their first award failed to secure support because other second-time students had been awarded support.</p>

  <p>Students studying at further education colleges, including school leavers, who meet the means-test and residency regulations may be considered for bursary support from funds administered by individual colleges. Decisions, however, are entirely a matter for the college concerned.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when the report of the MMR expert group will be made public and when it will respond to the Public Health Institute of Scotland needs assessment report on autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-04-30.S1W-25472.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0430.htm#4">

  <p>The report of the MMR Expert Group has been published today. Copies will be placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre. The report is also available on both the Scottish Executive and the expert group websites.</p>

  <p>The Executive is grateful to the chairman and members of the expert group, for producing an excellent report, which addresses its remit in full. The report confirms that there is no proven scientific link between the MMR vaccine and autism or Crohn's disease. The Executive has no plans to change the current immunisation programme.</p>

  <p>The report describes the consequences of pursuing an alternative vaccination policy to MMR. It is clear that none of the alternatives provides comparable protection - for the population or individual children - against measles, mumps and rubella.</p>

  <p>In principle, the Executive is happy to accept all the recommendations that fall to the Scottish Executive for action. A more detailed response will, however, be prepared, and published, in due course.</p>

  <p>The expert group report cogently focuses on the need for improvements in the range and quality of services for those affected by autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), endorsing the recommendations of the Public Health Institute of Scotland (PHIS) Needs Assessment Report on ASD. The Executive recognises the importance of appropriate services to support individuals affected by autistic spectrum disorder, and their families and carers, and has today announced its response to the Needs Assessment Report that the Executive commissioned from the PHIS.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to reform and to improving services. Much work is under way. Autistic spectrum disorders are already included in <em>The same as you?,</em> the Report of the Review of Services for People With Learning Disabilities published in May 2000. Its aim is the same as the PHIS report - to ensure that services are co-ordinated and seamless. Change Funds have been provided to local authorities - &#163;36 million over the three years to 2003-04, and &#163;16 million in each year thereafter. This is for learning disability, but individuals with autistic spectrum disorders benefit too. Similarly children with ASD will benefit from the changes resulting from the consultation on <em>Assessing our children's educational needs: The Way Forward</em>, and the Changing Children's Services Fund - &#163;27 million in 2002-03 - which is focussed on the delivery of integrated health, education and care services for vulnerable and deprived children. Also, under the Innovation Grants Programme, announced yesterday, &#163;697,000 is being made available over two years to enable local authorities and voluntary agencies to work together to develop new services for children with ASD and their families.</p>

  <p>We will also work with researchers in Scotland to develop proposals for innovative, high quality research to underpin improvements in treatment and care for people with ASD.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will continue to build on that foundation and work towards the ideal described by PHIS. The Executive is focussed on delivering sustainable, long-term improvements in the range and quality of services for those affected by autistic spectrum disorders across Scotland as a whole, in partnership with local service providers and users. Further steady and lasting progress will be based on mapping work currently being carried out by the Scottish Society for Autism and the National Autistic Society. The Executive's view, consistent with PHIS, is that early priorities must include involving individuals with ASD and their families or representatives, early assessment, integrated joint planning, and a coherent approach to training and workforce development.</p>

  <p>When illegal imports of meat are detected at ports and airports, it is confiscated and destroyed by either Customs and Excise officers or the local authority.</p>

  <p>Under the current legislation, local authorities have the power to require the destruction or re-export of any product which they have reasonable grounds for believing does not comply with conditions for import from a third country. NHS boards have no powers to implement health controls when illegal imports of meat have been discovered.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures the Food Standards Agency Scotland is taking to detect infected meat imported from abroad which (a) is unsafe for human consumption and (b) could pass infection to a farm animal.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-04-30.S1W-24671.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80216" speakername="Mrs Mary Mulligan" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0430.htm#5">

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that European Union (EU) food hygiene legislation on meat for human consumption requires that all meat sold on the single market must be fit for human consumption, and free from animal diseases. It must have passed the specified health checks under veterinary supervision, and have been awarded the appropriate health mark.</p>

  <p>Meat produced within the EU may circulate freely on the single market, and is not subject to border controls. However, imports of meat from other EU states are subject to random checks by the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) at meat cutting plants, or by local authorities in meat plants under their supervision. Following problems over the presence of Specified Risk Material in contravention of BSE rules, the Food Standards Agency has instructed the MHS to inspect every single consignment of imported carcass beef.</p>

  <p>All meat imports from third countries also have to satisfy the conditions set out in EU food hygiene and import legislation. The latter includes prior notification and importation through EU authorised Border Inspection Posts (BIPs). In the BIPs, the meat is subject to a 100% check of identity and documentation, and a random physical check. The controls cover both public and animal health aspects with responsibility resting respectively with the Food Standards Agency and Agriculture Departments. Local authorities have day-to-day responsibility for enforcement of the import legislation in BIPs in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Agency officials are exploring proposals made in a report approved by the Board of the Food Standards Agency with a view to making a number of improvements to controls on imports at ports, and have already issued written guidance to authorities to ensure there is continued vigilance and checks on imported products both at the point of import and at the retail level. In addition the Food Standards Agency is taking an active role in interdepartmental initiatives led by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) aimed at co-ordinating action concerned with illegal imports of meat.</p>

  <p>Paragraph 1.3 indicates that the base assumption for all the calculations was that of a 700 place model.

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Home Office Immigration Service is responsible for refugees and asylum seekers and such matters are reserved. The answer to S1W-24469 therefore provided the information available to the SPS who, in the past, held persons awaiting deportation as a service on behalf of the Home Office. These individuals are now held in the Immigration Facility at Dungavel unless, in exceptional circumstances, Dungavel is considered unsuitable for the needs of a person awaiting deportation. Such circumstances might exist where, for example, the person is thought to pose a security risk that cannot be managed in Dungavel. In these circumstances, the person may be held by the SPS on behalf of the Immigration Service. As at 2 April no persons awaiting deportation were held in any Scottish prison and as at 16 April one person is being held at HM Prison Greenock on behalf of, and at the request of, the Immigration Service.</p>

  <p>It is possible that a refugee or an asylum seeker could, coincidentally, be held on remand in respect of a criminal charge or convicted of a criminal offence. In these circumstances, the person would be held in a Scottish prison. However, the SPS would not necessarily be aware of whether such individuals are refugees or asylum seekers as they would be held in prison custody as either remand or convicted prisoners and not because they are refugees or asylum seekers.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not have any plans to introduce a similar scheme in Scotland as it has in place a range of existing measures and policies to improve quality of life in rural Scotland by enhancing access to services.</p>

  <p>Voluntary and community groups providing key services in rural areas can already seek financial support from a range of grant schemes run by the Executive including the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund and, for transport projects, the Rural Transport Fund.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive supports a number of core services in rural areas through rates relief measures: 50% mandatory relief from non-domestic rates is available for sole general stores and post offices with rateable value less than &#163;6,000 in settlements of under 3,000 in designated rural areas. The Executive has recently announced that current mandatory rates relief measures will be extended to cover singly owned pubs and garages, sole village stores and post offices and cash-machines situated away from banks in rural areas.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to encouraging more women to apply to serve on the board of public bodies in order to reflect the social and cultural mix in the country. Our proposals for attracting a wider range of people to serve on Non-Departmental Public Bodies - including women - were published in <em>Public Bodies: Proposals for Change</em> on 21 June last year. Steps taken to encourage more women have included awareness-raising speeches, talks and presentations to women's interest groups. The new Scottish Commissioner for Public Appointments, once appointed, will have a specific remit to promote diversity in public appointments.</p>

  <p>We acknowledge that it will take some time before measures designed to generate more applications from women and other currently under-represented groups begin to bear fruit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to encouraging more women into public life, not only through public appointments, but also through participation in all aspects of public life. For example, the Women in Scotland Consultative Forum meets as a national event at which representatives of women's organisations across Scotland meet to discuss policy concerns with ministers and policymakers. The forum encourages women to have a fuller more effective involvement in policy development and provides a valuable resource for the Scottish Executive on the policies affecting women and their communities.</p>

  <p>There is no reason for VisitScotland to postpone signing the e-tourism contract. It will be a key condition of the new company's business plan that all tourism businesses have equal access to the website. The criteria for advertising on the site will also be covered by the business plan. The plan will require the agreement of both VisitScotland and the area tourist boards and therefore they will be fully involved in both access and advertising issues. Tourism businesses will also be consulted as necessary.</p>
