  <p>The EU legislation covering the Arable Area Payments Scheme requires that payments only be made on crops which are suited agriculturally and climatically for growing in the areas concerned. Existing evidence and scientific views suggest that sweet lupins are not suitable for growing in Scotland.</p>

  <p>However, my officials are beginning a round of further consultation and analysis with scientific advisers and members of the industry to evaluate the viability of newer varieties. Based upon the outcome of these discussions, the position on inclusion of sweet lupins in the scheme in Scotland will be reviewed in advance of the 2002 AAPS Scheme year.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to making Scotland a place where people are safer and feel safer. To that end we are working in partnership with the law enforcement agencies, with communities and with all who are concerned with the protection of the public. A recent example is the financial support we have given for the campaign launched in October 2000 by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland targeting violent crime.</p>

  <p>The report is being published today and is available in the Parliament Reference Centre and, shortly, on the Executive&#8217;s website.</p>

  <p>I am grateful to the review group for their thorough consideration of this important subject. It is clear that, despite considerable success in responding to the challenge of HIV over the past decade and more, the momentum of prevention activity must be maintained. The report provides an invaluable framework within which concerted action by the Scottish Executive, NHS Scotland, local authorities, voluntary organisations and other interests can be revitalised and strengthened.</p>

  <p>To assist the implementation process, the Scottish Executive is increasing funding to health boards from &#163;6.1 million to &#163;7.1 million in the current financial year and to &#163;8.1 million in subsequent years for prevention work. This substantial increase reflects the commitment given in <i>Our National Health</i> that more resources would be made available to tackle infections like HIV and hepatitis C.</p>

  <p>There is no universally accepted definition of &quot;excess winter deaths&quot;. However, when presenting data for England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics defines &quot;excess winter deaths&quot; as being the difference between the number of deaths occurring during the four months December to March and the average number of deaths during the preceding four months (August to November) and the following four months (April to July). The following table provides information for Scotland based on this definition. Detailed tables presenting similar information for parliamentary constituencies and health board areas have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 9924).</p>

We have committed funding for 42,800 additional places in further and higher education. We have scrapped tuition fees for eligible Scottish students. We have launched learndirect scotland and Individual Learning Accounts. We are helping all Scots learn today for tomorrow&#8217;s jobs.</p>

  <p>Reducing waiting times across all health specialties and at all stages of the patient&#8217;s journey is a key priority for the Scottish Executive. The Scottish Health Plan <i>Our National Health</i> reaffirmed our commitment to ensuring that the patient&#8217;s journey from GP practice to hospital treatment is better, faster and more responsive.</p>

  <p>Provisional figures for 30 September 2000 show that between 1999 and 2000 the median waiting time across Scotland as a whole for a first outpatient appointment with a neurological consultant reduced from 80 days to 63 days.</p>

  <p>Any adult can put themselves forward for consideration for public appointment whether or not they are in any form of employment, either in the public or private sector. All public appointments are governed by the principle of selection based on merit following fair, open and transparent process. An overriding factor for appointment is that there must be no conflict of interest. It is a matter for the individual employer &#8211; whether public or private &#8211; to determine policy on release of staff.</p>

  <p>I recently announced an additional &#163;17.2 million in the current financial year to assist authorities in dealing with immediate repairs, maintenance and equipment problems in schools. In addition, by 2003-04 capital allocations for local authority investment in infrastructure will have increased by nearly 40% compared with current levels. We are also providing revenue support for school Public/Private Partnership schemes with a capital value of &#163;530 million. I hope to be able to announce decisions on the allocation of a further &#163;5 million to support early development of potential school PPP projects in the near future.</p>
