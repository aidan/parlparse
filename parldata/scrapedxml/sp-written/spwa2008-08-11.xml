  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has submitted to the Scottish Government their proposed action plan to eliminate the rostered single manning of traditional accident and emergency ambulances. This is now being considered in detail by Scottish Government officials and decisions on the way forward will be reached in due course.</p>

  <p>I will, as conveyed in my statement to Parliament on 4 June, return to the Chamber after the summer recess to set out my response on this issue as well as on the other areas of work identified on that day.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports a range of measures to encourage homeowners to improve home installation to help energy conservation:</p>

  <p>We recently launched the Energy Saving Scotland advice network, which is a one stop shop for advice on a range of sustainable energy issues including energy efficiency, renewables and personal transport. Advisers engage with customers on a long term basis and provide advice and support with home installation.</p>

  <p>We will launch a new &quot;home-help&quot; service in the Autumn, which will offer more intensive and tailored face to face support to ensure households get even better advice and find home installation solutions that are right for them.</p>

  <p>We are establishing a Scottish steering group in partnership with the energy supply companies to help maximise funding and activity to Scotland through the carbon emissions reduction target. This could be worth at least &pound;80 million each year for home energy efficiency improvements and savings of &pound;62 million each year in household fuel bills.</p>

  <p>We will be introducing the Home Report in December 2008 to raise awareness of energy efficiency at the point of house sale. All house purchasers will receive a comprehensive energy report on the energy efficiency of a property before they bid as part of the Home Report. This energy report will be attached to an up to date energy performance certificate and will provide information on energy usage and costs, carbon dioxide emissions, recommendations for improvements and sources of advice and support.</p>

  <p>We are committing &pound;45 million each year over the next three years to continue to help tackle fuel poverty. We have already made thousands of Scottish homes warmer and more affordable to heat by installing energy efficiency measures through our fuel poverty programmes, the Warm Deal and central heating programme.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government will be launching a consultation on further measures to improve the energy performance of existing homes later in the year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has plans to encourage homeowners to install solar panels.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improving energy efficiency and increasing microgeneration in Scotland&rsquo;s homes. We have tripled funding for community and microgeneration allocating up to &pound;13.5 million each year over the next three years.</p>

  <p>Our domestic grants programme already supports solar thermal and, in June, we widened the programme to include solar photovoltaics.</p>

  <p>To help householders install solar panels and other microgeneration and energy saving equipment, we will be launching a new home help service in the Autumn. This service will offer one to one support to help people make the right decisions when considering installing any microgeneration technology, and assist them from the initial planning stages through to post installation support.</p>

  <p>As the member will be aware, matters relating to equality legislation are reserved to the UK Government. I welcome the European Court of Justice&rsquo;s ruling in the Coleman case and hope that this will lead to increased awareness among employers of the need to ensure that carers receive the fair treatment they deserve.</p>

  <p>Equalities legislation is reserved and the UK Government is considering the implications of the Coleman ruling. We are working closely with the UK Government on those aspects of equalities legislation which have devolved implications.</p>

  <p>Health Protection Scotland (HPS) collects information, by NHS board, on cases of c-diff and on PCR ribotyping. C-diff is identified in laboratories by testing for the presence of a toxin, and does not routinely require ribotyping. Ribotyping is currently only carried out in c-diff cases which meet certain national protocol criteria. Information on PCR ribotypes is therefore collected at a national level and is not broken down by NHS board.</p>

  <p>The information requested on c.diff cases is published quarterly by HPS at:</p>
