  <p>I expect to receive soon from the UK Government drafts of a memorandum of understanding and certain supporting concordats. These documents, which will be administrative rather than statutory agreements, are intended to set out the ground rules which will govern the working relationships between the devolved administrations and the UK Government.</p>

  <p>I will consider these drafts with my colleagues. Once we have agreed their contents with the UK Government and, where necessary, the other devolved administrations, we will present them to the Scottish Parliament for its endorsement before they come into effect.</p>

  <p>The area in question represents a very small proportion of the total area patrolled by vessels of the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. Neither is it an area of prolific fishing activity. Consequently it does not require a substantial surveillance effort from the Agency. It therefore follows that a change in the enforcement arrangements for this area will not be reflected in the level of resources of the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>No. Local authorities were issued with indicative expenditure guidelines this year. Most authorities have exercised their own discretion sensibly. Eight authorities have set budgets in excess of the guidelines, but in the case of five authorities only by a small amount. The other three authorities &ndash; Aberdeenshire, East Dunbartonshire and Perth and Kinross &ndash; have made larger increases. I met these councils with the Secretary of State for Scotland to discuss why they have made such large increases. The Secretary of State subsequently announced in the House of Commons that the authorities would not be capped, but at the meeting we did put them on warning that we will expect them to return to guideline next year. I have also asked each council to submit to me an action plan detailing what measures they intend to take to ensure that they do return to guideline next year, and they agreed to do so before the end of July.</p>

  <p>Note 1: These Special Adviser appointments are held until the end of the Scottish Cabinet; or when the First Minister ceases to be a member of the Scottish Cabinet; or in the event of a General Election to the Scottish Parliament on the day after Polling Day.</p>

  <p>The Policy Unit is based in St Andrew&rsquo;s House. All its members will be engaged in developing the strategic capacity of the Executive and working up new policies. Those who are Special Advisers in addition give political advice to Ministers.</p>

  <p>I expect to make further Special Adviser appointments in due course. I will announce shortly the arrangements which I have put in place regarding Special Advisers&rsquo; pay in Scotland.</p>
