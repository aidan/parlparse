  <p>NHS trusts are responsible for recruiting staff and making arrangements, that best respond to the assessed needs of their areas.

  <p>The Nitrates Directive requires the identification of waters affected by pollution, and which could be affected by pollution, if specified measures are not taken. It defines pollution as "the discharge, directly or indirectly, of nitrogen compounds from agricultural sources into the aquatic environment&#8230;..". The directive also requires the designation as nitrate vulnerable zones of all known areas of land which contribute to such pollution. The Scottish Executive considers that the discharge of nitrogen compounds of agricultural origin requires to be more than <em>de minimis</em> to contribute to that pollution.</p>

  <p>For our current consultation on proposals for new nitrate vulnerable zones we have taken advice from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the British Geological Survey about which areas contribute to pollution, as detailed in the answer to question S1W-24039 today.</p>

  <p>Th Scottish Executive has taken advice from the British Geological Survey and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in identifying the boundaries of the proposed Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) to ensure that only areas making a significant contribution to pollution are included. Parts of upland catchments have therefore been excluded from the proposed NVZs on this basis. The available groundwater nitrate data from upland areas are generally low. This is confirmed by Scottish Environment Protection Agency surface water nitrate data.</p>

  <p>My officials recently wrote to those farming around the proposed NVZ boundaries specifically inviting comment on the line of the boundary. We are looking closely at the proposed boundaries, in light of comments received, to ensure that no non-polluting areas are included.</p>

  <p>Section 9(2)(a) was included following representations received during the consultation on the draft Land Reform (Scotland) Bill. Since the introduction of the bill, concerns have been expressed by some that the inclusion of this provision will curtail the activities of people such as mountain guides. We have received 35 letters to this effect. Views for and against section 9 (2) (a) have been included in evidence to the Justice 2 Committee. Although in principle, we are not convinced it is appropriate to grant a business a statutory right of access to someone's land for the purpose of making a profit, we are considering the suggestions made by the Justice 2 Committee concerning possible amendment of section 9(2)(a).</p>

  <p>Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill for the first time creates clear and unambiguous rights of general access to land. In recommending the creation of rights of responsible access to land, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Access Forum highlighted the confusion that exists amongst members of the public as to where they may legally go in the countryside. It is important that all members of the public have the opportunity to enjoy our natural heritage and participate in healthy outdoor activities.</p>

  <p>The legislation has been drafted to balance the demand for greater access with the rights of those who live and work in the countryside. We are content that the provisions are proportionate and comply with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

  <p>The position of Western Isles Council in 1991, is significantly different from that in the Scottish Borders, in that Western Isles Council had acted ultra vires, in investing in BCCI and faced loses equal to around one third of its total annual budget for services. The scale of the losses suffered by Western Isles Council meant that without action being taken immediately, the delivery of basic services was under threat.</p>

  <p>The Controller of Audit's report into the Scottish Borders budget deficit in 2001-02, identified an overspend, accumulated over two years 1999-2000 and 2000-01, of &#163;3.9 million - or less than 1.5% of its total budget for all services for each year - arising from financial mismanagement.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the process is for announcing appointments to the membership of a public body, when this process was introduced and on how many occasions since its introduction the process has not been followed.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-26.S1W-20118.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80183" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0326.htm#27">

  <p>The process for announcing appointments to public bodies was introduced across the UK Government as part of the Nolan reforms in 1996 and was revised in 2001. The code published by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) requires all appointments to be announced in an appropriate way as described in the code. It has been the responsibility of each department of the Scottish Executive - previously each department of the Scottish Office - to ensure compliance with the OCPA Code in relation to appointments made to NDPBs sponsored by that department.</p>

  <p>In June 2001, the Executive announced the following plans for changes to the internal administration of the appointments process in the document <em>Public Bodies: Proposals for Change</em>: "A central unit in the Executive will in future oversee most of the standard elements of the appointments process (such as issuing information packs, acknowledging applications, convening appointments panels) in respect of most of the bodies sponsored by the Executive. The aims will be to bring a greater consistency of approach, and to make the process smoother for applicants and more efficient by maximising economies of scale<em>".</em></p>

  <p>The Executive also announced in January 2002 that, in future, the declared public activity of every member of every public body will be published in the Executive's annual report on public appointments.</p>

  <p>Detailed records of the procedure, followed in the announcement of the thousands of appointments made since 1996, are not held centrally. However, in preparation for the internal changes described above, and the publication of comprehensive details of political activity, the Executive's Public Appointments Unit has recently audited the data on political activity of current members of NDPBs. They have discovered that in most cases the correct procedures have been followed. However, I regret to say that they have discovered that in 411 individual cases, the political activity declaration was not completed and so the correct procedure for announcing these appointments was not followed. We have contacted all the individuals concerned and virtually all of them have now submitted completed political activity declaration forms. Six declarations remain outstanding. One of these individuals has been out of the country for three months and the other five have been difficult to contact.</p>

  <p>I am extremely concerned that the correct procedure for announcing appointments was not followed by officials in every case and have raised this matter with the Permanent Secretary. He has, in turn, instructed the Heads of the Executive Departments to ensure that the correct procedures are followed in every respect in future. In addition, the central Public Appointments Unit is being strengthened in line with the announcement referred to above. It will be given the task of ensuring compliance with the OCPA Code and in due course the code published by the Scottish Commissioner for Public Appointments. This Executive is completely committed to ensuring that our procedures for making public appointments are transparent and fair and that people are appointed on merit.</p>

  <p>The collection of the missing political activity declaration forms does affect the aggregate information about the political activity of appointees serving on NDPBs sponsored by the Executive, published in reply to question S1W-18802 on 19 November 2001. Until all the outstanding political activity declarations have been received, we are unable to provide final figures showing how many individuals currently in post have been politically active. Nonetheless, I wish to be as open as possible on this matter and the following table provides the breakdown of political activity as at today's date:</p>

  <p>Note:</p>

  <p>* figures as at 26 March.</p>

  <p>I shall report further progress to Parliament at the end of April. I shall also provide then a list detailing the names of each individual who has been politically active and the body on which they serve.</p>

  <p>Note 1: Eight current members of NDPBs have declined to complete political activity declarations, as they are currently entitled to do under the terms of the OCPA Code</p>

  <p>Note 2: The number of appointees and the number of appointees who have declared political activity includes 35 local authority members of NHS boards and one member who was appointed to the Scottish Ambulance Service Board <em>ex officio</em> in his capacity as local authority member nominated by COSLA. All 36 individuals are by definition politically active. Since 30 September 2001, each of the 32 Scottish local authorities has nominated an elected member to serve on its local NHS board. They are appointed by Scottish ministers <em>ex officio</em> in their capacity as elected council members.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is participating fully in the development of the Transport Direct Initiative. Transport Direct is a UK national project which aims to deliver integrated traveller information and ticketing across all modes of travel.</p>

  <p>The Transport (Scotland) Act 2001, includes provision to enable local authorities to determine what ticketing arrangements should be made available in their area, for local bus services. The guidance that was published on the bus provisions of the act, included a statement that the Executive would, when procuring transport services, encourage the development of multi-modal information provision and joint ticketing schemes</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive's consultation paper <em>Strategic Priorities for Scotland's Passenger Railways,</em> makes clear that the Scottish Executive will encourage train operators to work with providers of local bus services to issue a single ticket for bus and train travel.</p>

  <p>When procuring ferry services the Executive will encourage operators to contribute to wider efforts to develop joint ticketing schemes and to make available travel information on a multi-modal basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Strategic Rail Study, commissioned by the Scottish Executive in July 2001, is currently looking at the likely costs and benefits of potential improvements to passenger railway services, operating in central and north-east Scotland. This includes service improvements, such as reduced journey times and reliability.</p>

  <p>The connection between services at key rail interchanges is a timetabling issue and, as such, is an operational matter for the rail industry. Amendments to timetables, must be agreed at the national timetable discussions involving train operators and Railtrack.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for local consideration and agreement, as to whether council-owned refuges and supported housing schemes for victims of domestic abuse, are included as part of a council housing transfer to community ownership.

  <p>The Scottish Executive agreed to this transfer following an indication from Universities Scotland that, having consulted with its membership on this issue, it had received a positive response. In all other fields of study, comparable postgraduate awards for Scottish postgraduate students are administered through the UK Research Councils. It was expected that the move would benefit Scottish-domiciled arts and humanities students, by giving them access to a UK-wide fund, for which they were expected to compete strongly, and by ending an arrangement by which these students were uniquely excluded from UK-wide arrangements in matters such as research training programmes.</p>

  <p>Young people aged 16 to 20, on conviction, are normally detained in a Young Offenders Institution and not in an adult establishment. Those under 16 who are sentenced by a court to detention are normally held in a secure unit of a residential childcare establishment, but where this is not possible they may, exceptionally, be placed in a Young Offenders Institution.</p>

  <p>The Executive's policy is to develop robust, non-custodial disposals to give the court a realistic alternative to custody wherever possible. This is particularly important for young people, who have a high rate of recidivism from short sentences of detention.</p>

  <p>In addition, the proposed Criminal Justice Bill will pave the way for piloting arrangements to deal with 16- and 17-year-old offenders, through the children's hearings in appropriate cases. It will also enable those aged 16 to 20 who have been remanded in custody, and those who have attained the age of 14 and who have been certified by a court to be unruly or depraved, to be detained either in a prison or a Young Offenders Institution. At present, the law does not make provision for those concerned to be held in a Young Offenders Institution.</p>

  <p>The evidence provided on the skills and abilities of Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd prior to the letting of the contract for the MSP building cladding package is being assessed by Audit Scotland as part of their routine audit of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body's (SPCB) accounts and it is not appropriate to provide details until the findings of the audit report are known. Any further action by the SPCB will be considered in the light of Audit Scotland's findings.</p>
