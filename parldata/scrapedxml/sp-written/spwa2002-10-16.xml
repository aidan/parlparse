  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-25486 by Allan Wilson on 14 May 2002, what decisions it has made on how to distribute the annual allocation from HM Treasury through the aggregates levy.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-10-16.S1W-30558.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1016.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>As I indicated in my response to question S1W-24840 on 29 April 2002, the assigned budget will receive approximately &#163;3 million per year from 2002-03, as part of the allocation by the Treasury of the proceeds of the aggregates levy. This has been allocated to the environment portfolio.</p>

  <p>We have now considered a range of possible projects and have decided to allocate half of the available funding to environmental renewal in communities affected by aggregates extraction. This amounts to &#163;1.5 million in both 2002-03 and 2003-04. The funding will be made available through the Executive's Sustainable Action Fund.</p>

  <p>Bids will be invited from local communities, or bodies which can demonstrate that they are working with local communities, for projects which address the environmental effects of past or present aggregates extraction (e.g. visual impact, noise, dust, pollution, transport, loss of habitat); involve the local community, and have demonstrable social and/or economic benefit to the local community; but will not support work which is already required e.g. by statute or contractual obligations, though it may supplement this (e.g. restoration of site to higher standard than provided for by planning conditions).</p>

  <p>In the first year the Executive will administer the grants, alongside the existing Sustainable Action Grants. Fuller information on the scheme will be available at <a href="www.sustainable.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.sustainable.scotland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Distribution of the grant will be overseen by a Grants Panel, and we are inviting relevant bodies to nominate representatives to join this.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the funding will be used for a broad range of projects supporting sustainable development. Further information about these projects will be available shortly. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&#8217;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search" target="_blank">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/searchwa</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has met representatives of the NFU Scotland to discuss the recommendations in the report on the welfare of animals during transport by the EU Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Welfare. The specific recommendation on transportation of livestock by seas was discussed. No meetings have been held with the Scottish Crofters' Federation or the Islands' Councils, but we are fully aware of the concerns of the livestock industry on the Islands.</p>

  <p>The specific needs of the remote areas such as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland were raised at the recent Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting when the welfare of animals during transit was discussed in open forum. When proposals are made by the European Commission these will be discussed with crofting and farming organisations to assist Scottish Executive officials to prepare briefing for attendance at any Council working group set up to consider the proposals in detail.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not carried out an in depth assessment of the effects that implementation of the recommendation to alter the regulations governing the transport of livestock by sea would have on the livestock industry in the islands. Nevertheless we are acutely aware that the effect would be significant so the Executive has strongly registered with the European Commission and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs its concerns over any possible change to the transport of livestock regulations which would limit the transport of animals by sea to days when the wind speed was force 4 or less. Our concerns over a shortening of journey times for animals from the Highlands and Islands have also been made known.</p>

  <p>We shall reinforce this position if that recommendation is brought forward as one of the Commission proposals.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have access to various sources of advice on any link between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and an increased risk of breast cancer, including the product information for HRT and the British National Formulary.</p>

  <p>Importantly, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) monitor the safety of marketed medicines and provide advice when necessary. The MCA/CSM publish a quarterly bulletin <i>Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance</i> drawing attention to problems with medicines and providing advice on the ways medicines can be used more safely. The April 2002 (Volume 28) edition of the bulletin reviewed the risks of cancer with use of HRT. This bulletin is available on the MCA&#8217;s website <a href="www.mca.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>On 11 July 2002, the department provided NHS boards and trusts with information to help health professionals advise women on HRT who may have been concerned about the risks of this treatment following publicity about the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative (WHI) study. A copy of this information has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24544).</p>

  <p>The daily dose of methadone prescribed is a matter of clinical judgement and should be tailored to meet the needs of the individual. In particular, those who habitually have been taking methadone will be able to tolerate a much higher dose. Those who have never taken the substance, or have not taken it for some time, have much lower tolerance and may experience severe toxicity. Prescribers should take into account advice and evidence about methadone use, for example, the UK <i>Drug Misuse or Dependence &#8211; Guidelines on Clinical Management</i> (HMSO 1999), available to all doctors, include a section on the dosage regime for methadone maintenance.</p>

Since January, a further 4,000 places have been funded through the New Opportunities Fund.</p>

  <p>The Executive has provided a corrected answer which is published in the Written Answer Report on 15 January 2003: see <a href="../wa-03/wa0115.htm" target="_blank">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/official_report/wa-03/wa0115.htm</a></p>

  <p>The existing legislation relevant to flytipping is currently under review as part of the study commissioned by the Executive.</p>

  <p>Currently, the Scottish Executive provides annual core funding of &#163;234,000 to Keep Scotland Beautiful, which runs a number of anti-litter and flytipping initiatives designed to raise awareness of the problem. In addition, since the beginning of the last financial year, an extra &#163;700,000 has been allocated for anti-litter and flytipping campaigns such as the &quot;Have some pride&quot; poster campaign, which I launched in March.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive recently made &#163;95 million available to local authorities as part of the First Minister's &quot;Quality of Life&quot; initiative. Around &#163;3 million has been committed towards litter reduction schemes. Councils may choose to use some of this money to tackle flytipping.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive funded the &#163;11 million award by Department for Transport to Forth Ports plc in 2001-02 for the Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry link.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made three awards of Track Access Grant (TAG) since taking over responsibility for the scheme in December 2000. All three awards were made in the financial year 2002-03. In addition, the Scottish Executive will contribute to a further two awards of TAG made by the SRA under our working agreement for applications which have traffic flows on both sides of the border.</p>

  <p>The SRA has no powers to award TAG for traffic flows wholly within Scotland. However, since assuming responsibility for TAG in February 2001 the SRA have made four cross-border awards of TAG, including the two mentioned above made under the recent working agreement.</p>

  <p>Information regarding the destinations of graduates in higher education institutions (HEIs) is collected by HEIs, via the Higher Education Statistics Agency&#8217;s (HESA) First Destinations Survey. The First Destinations Survey (FDS) collects information on the positions of successful graduates from full-time HE courses six months after graduation, via postal and telephone survey. The data collected is checked and validated, by the HEIs in the first instance, and then HESA. The information is then passed to the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>FDS data is now subject to audit, with each UK institution currently planned to be audited over a five-year cycle. The audit process is managed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England on behalf of the Performance Indicators Steering Group. Audit involves examination of systems and a re-survey of a sample of graduates.</p>

  <p>Initial results of this process have proved encouraging with regards quality of data being collected. Subsequently, a good practice guide was put together for use in institutions:</p>

  <p>Information with regards domicile and location of employment of graduates from Scottish higher education institutions (HEIs) is collected by HEIs via the Higher Education Statistics Agency&#8217;s (HESA) First Destinations Survey (FDS). The FDS collects a range of information on the positions of successful graduates from full-time HE courses six months after graduation. The Scottish Executive receives the results of the FDS from HESA.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive receives first destination information on higher education graduates from further education colleges (FECs) from the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC), collected via their First Destination of Graduates survey. The combined information is made available annually, via the Scottish Executive National Statistics publication, <i>First Destinations of Graduates and Diplomates in Scotland</i>.</p>

  <p>Decisions regarding the use of stimulant medication in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are a matter of clinical judgement taking into account the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or their guardian/carer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 52 on ADHD provides advice about the most frequent side-effects associated with psychostimulants. The guideline recommends that the child or young person should be engaged in the therapeutic process with an understanding of their perception of their difficulties, the possibilities of treatment and their responsibility in the management of the disorder.

  <p>Figures are not held centrally on the number of people, including children, who have been prescribed methylphenidate hydrochloride (Ritalin) or other drugs for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Data collected centrally relate to the number of prescribed items and cost dispensed in the community by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors. The data is not patient-specific.</p>

  <p>In deciding whether or not to prescribe Ritalin or other drugs for ADHD, clinicians would be expected to take account of advice and guidance about these treatments. This would include the national clinical guideline on <i>Attention Deficit and Hyperkinetic Disorders in Children and Young People</i> issued by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) in June 2001, the guidance issued in October 2000 by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) on the use of methylphenidate (Ritalin and Equasym) for ADHD in childhood and the Scottish Medicines Consortium advice dated July 2002 about the methylphenidate sustained release OROS formulation Concerta XL.</p>

  <p>Through the Chief Scientist Office, the Scottish Executive is funding a preliminary study of complementary therapy for children with ADHD. Given that there are well-established mechanisms for assessing clinical research and developing evidence-based guidelines for use within the health service, it would be inappropriate for the Executive to offer assessments of individual research papers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-28795 by Mr Jim Wallace on 2 October 2002, what the names are of the five persons convicted of murder who are now on interim liberation pending an appeal against their conviction; what the details of each charge were, and whether the prosecutor expressed a view before bail was granted in each case.</p>

  <p>The names of the five appellants and details of their crimes are, like the details of all other appellants granted interim liberation, matters of public record. The information is available from the Depute Principal Clerk of Justiciary at the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>As the Lord Advocate&#8217;s Private Secretary and I indicated to you in our respective letters of 18 July and 13 August about the case of Richard Crawford, the prosecutor has no statutory right to be heard when the High Court is considering an application for bail from an appellant pending the determination of his appeal.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to note 4 on page 46 of <i>Building a Better Scotland - Spending Proposals 2003-2006: What the money buys</i> , whether the structure of the Public Transport Fund will change as a result of being included in its transport spending plans instead of in the Local Government Spending Plans.</p>

  <p>As a result of the inclusion of the Public Transport Fund (PTF) in the Executive&#8217;s transport spending plans, awards from the PTF from 1 April 2003 will be capital grants paid under section 70 of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001. To date PTF awards have taken the form of additional capital allocations made to local authorities under section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive announced in April that the current round of the PTF would be the final round as a challenge fund. Future arrangements for supporting transport authorities&#8217; capital public transport projects will be announced later in the autumn.</p>

  <p>NHS trusts are now more aware of their responsibilities when employing bank and agency nurses and have procedures in place to ensure that they are employed only when appropriate. The increased use of bank and agency nurses is indicative of the pressures in the system for nurse employment, for example, the working time directive and the creation of many new nursing/midwifery posts.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The announcement on 5 September of the Executive&#8217;s decisions on the Prison Estates Review included a statement that in seeking tenders for the new prison to be built and operated by the private sector innovative proposals to provide care and opportunities for those on remand would be sought, and that those proposals could include a role for voluntary and charitable not-for-profit organisations.</p>

  <p>So far as the actual ownership and operation of a new prison is concerned, further consideration has not identified any examples of the use of a not-for-profit trust to own and operate a new prison that can be used to assess whether it would be viable in the Scottish context. In addition, there are significant concerns as to whether such a trust could be adequately funded on a long-term basis in a way that would deliver the necessary degree of transfer of risk to the operator and so keep the new prison off the SPS&#8217;s balance sheet. However, if a serious not-for-profit proposal were submitted that could be shown to be robust and capable of delivering value for money and effective transfer of risk such a proposal would be considered.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Approved activities were introduced into targets for the SPS from the year 2002-03. The target for the current year 2002-03 is a joint one for programmes and approved activities. The approved activities element is currently set at 400.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-26897 by Mr Jim Wallace on 3 July 2002, why there has been no assessment of compliance with <i>Standards of Health Care of Prisoners</i> of medical services in prisons operated by the Scottish Prison Service since 1999.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>It was recognised that the Health Care Standards required revision to improve auditibility.</p>

  <p>The SPS has recently been in contact with the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland to identify how our standards could be improved. We are currently in the process of commissioning this piece of work. It is hoped that the revision of our standards will be completed by March 2003. I will arrange for the revised version to be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>In specified circumstances and, in particular, subject to satisfactory performance, the Commissioner for Public Appointments&#8217; Code of Practice permits re-appointments to be made without open competition. Since May 2002 all re-appointments made were subject to satisfactory performance assessment and none were therefore advertised through the Parliamentary Notification system</p>

  <p>I take the issue of anti-social behaviour on public transport very seriously. We are awaiting a report from the Scottish Business Crime Centre about crime on buses, which will make recommendations on the way forward.</p>

  <p>The Executive recently launched an action programme that identifies measures to reduce youth offending and build a safer Scotland. We are investing in community-based programmes to prevent and reduce re-offending. In addition to the &#163;25.5 million we have committed since June 2000, we will be investing a further &#163;15 million this year to implement the 10-point action plan to tackle youth crime and disorder. Youth justice investment will increase to &#163;33 million in 2005-06.</p>

  <p>A great deal of behaviour which might be classified as anti-social (including assault and vandalism) is already covered by existing law. The Executive has no plans to introduce new legislation in this area but we will continue to encourage transport operators and the police to deal with incidents of anti-social behaviour, including vandalism and assault, with the utmost seriousness.</p>

  <p>The Executive is tackling poverty through ensuring that opportunities are available for all to work where appropriate, to participate in society and to benefit from the provision of responsive public services. We are reducing the levels of poverty in Scotland through creating a fair and inclusive society, supported by the UK Government&#8217;s commitment to make work pay through the minimum wage and tax credit system, and to raise the income of pensioners.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also tackling poverty through a range of programmes, such as Sure Start Scotland, New Futures Fund, and concessionary bus fares.</p>

  <p>We remain committed to the ethos of sport for all regardless of age. <strong></strong> Sportscotland has committed significant funds to widening opportunities and its target set in 2000 of increasing the percentage of adults over 55 participating in sport from 34% to 45% by 2003 was achieved by March 2001.</p>

  <p>The recently published census figures confirm that we have an ageing population in Scotland. It is one of the issues that has been highlighted during the current review of <i>Sport 21</i> and it is one that will need to be addressed in the revised and updated national strategy for sport in Scotland to be published next year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has regular discussions with telecoms operators in Scotland on matters of common interest. The setting of individual "trigger levels" relating to the ADSL enabling of exchanges is a commercial decision for BT.

  <p>Visitscotland.com, the VisitScotland website, has been contracted out to eTourism Ltd, a joint venture company trading as visitscotland.com. Visitscotland.com is a commercial company and as such the Scottish Executive is not responsible for reporting on its performance. The information requested is therefore not held centrally and the question should be directed towards visitscotland.com.</p>
