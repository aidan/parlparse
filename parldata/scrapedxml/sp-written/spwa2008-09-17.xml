  <p>The work of the Care Commission is being considered as part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to the <em>Independent Review of Regulation Audit, Inspection and Complaints Handling of Public Services in Scotland</em> undertaken by Professor Lorne Crerar last year. It will be important to await the outcome of these considerations before taking any decisions on the basis of funding of the Care Commission.</p>

  <p>The Registrar General for Scotland and the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism have discussed informally the scope for providing improved census-type information, for instance through some form of register covering the whole population. But, as I said in reply to answer to question S3W-15894 on 3 September 2008, there are no plans to replace the census.</p>

  <p>No case studies were commissioned by the previous administration in respect of the impact of its relocation policy.

  <p>The identification of individual small units that are potential candidates for relocation under the Small Units Initiative will be an on-going process influenced by a range of factors including value for money, operational effectiveness, organisational restructuring opportunities and human resource issues.

  <p>Scottish Enterprise (SE) will be providing support for sailing infrastructure developments in Stranraer and Largs. SE continues to work with Clyde Waterfront Strategic Partnership to exploit opportunities to increase marine leisure opportunities on the Clyde. Further information on these projects can be found at <a href="http://www.clydewaterfront.com" target="_blank">www.clydewaterfront.com</a></p>

  <p>The marine leisure sector is recognised by Highlands and Islands Enterprise as a growth sector and a product development opportunity in line with the tourism framework for change strategy. Future plans include a European project to develop sailing between Ireland and the west coast of Scotland, 12 projects, mainly infrastructure, for Argyll and Lochaber, work by Scottish Development International to attract appropriate inward investment and a study to identify the opportunities for marina destination infrastructure developments within Scotland.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland will continue to market Scotland&rsquo;s sailing product through marketing and PR activity such as their dedicated website, http://sail.visitscotland.com/, the production of a sailing brochure, specific advertising campaigns, and promotion of sailing events.</p>

  <p>Overall funding to local government is increasing by 13.1% over 2008-11. The responsibility for allocating funds for specific projects rests with the councils. All funding allocations are decided on a needs-based formula which was agreed with COSLA.</p>

  <p>Along with increasing funding to local authorities and through our joint concordat between national and local government we have also considerably reduced the level of ring fencing around funding streams, stepping back from micro-managing local authorities and giving them more freedom and flexibility in allocating their resources as they best see fit, including road ditches, and on keeping culverts, drain and ditches clear in order to reduce the risk of flooding.</p>

  <p>A critical issue in the surveillance of Clostridium difficile cases is in identifying when the number of cases in any one ward breaches an agreed control level in a defined period of time, which would indicate the need for an outbreak control team to be established. Until May 2008 and including the period between January to April 2008 when there was a peak in the new Clostridium difficile cases at the hospital, although daily monitoring of Clostridium difficile prevalence was in place, there was no agreed upper levels to alert local staff of an excess of new cases over a period.</p>

  <p>The amount of Housing Investment varies across Scotland from year-to-year depending on a number of circumstances including land availability, opportunities to meet identified need and carry-forward commitments from previous years. The initial allocation to Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) for 2008-09 is &pound;64 million less than was allocated in 2007-08.

  <p>The Care Commission inspects care services against the requirements of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the Act), its associated regulations, and taking account of the national care standards.</p>

  <p>The commission takes a proportionate approach to inspection depending on the risk determined by its regulatory support assessment score, its knowledge of care service compliance, regulatory history and complaints activity.</p>

  <p>The commission does not routinely inspect care services against every national care standard at every inspection. However, the standards provide the basis for the commission&rsquo;s new grading scheme which is based on a number of quality statements within four quality themes. The quality statements are based on the national care standards. This in turn means that if care services are not complying with the national care standards then they will receive a lower grade.</p>

  <p>The commission has a wide range of powers available to it under the Act, and uses these in a proportionate and incremental way to encourage continuous improvement in care services. Making recommendations represents one of the ways in which the Care Commission can do that.</p>

  <p>Recommendations can be made based on the quality statements and the national care standards. Recommendations are not subject to formal legal enforcement action in themselves and therefore do not necessarily result in any follow up action and would not usually require a timescale. It would, however, be open to the Care Commission to follow this up at a subsequent inspection. The commission can also go on to place requirements on a service, which would constitute formal enforcement action if the circumstances dictated.</p>

  <p>Under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001, the Care Commission has a wide range of enforcement powers at its disposal if a care service fails to provide the quality of care which is expected. These powers include: making recommendations on a service during inspection; placing conditions on the registration of a service, and applying to the sheriff for an emergency cancellation of a service&rsquo;s registration.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission regulates to improve care services, aiming to raise the standards of care. It will use its statutory powers in a proportionate to deliver that aim. Care services can be closed for a number of reasons. Regulatory decisions under the act, including a decision to close a care service, are an operational matter for the Care Commission.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of care providers closed down as a result of non compliance with National Care Standards following an inspection by the Care Commission is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The most significant and welcome change in services for people with learning disabilities since publication of <em>The same as you?</em> has been the move for many people from institutional settings to community based support services.</p>

  <p>Annual returns have been submitted from all areas on implementation of <em>The same as you?,</em> which demonstrate the increase in tenancies, personal life plans, local area coordination and alternative day opportunities. The 2007 return can be accessed on the Scottish Government website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/03/20154612/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/03/20154612/0</a>.</p>

  <p>There is a requirement for local authorities to produce single outcome agreements and deliver services in line with those agreements. The Scottish Government expects these to outline positive outcomes for all people in receipt of services including those with learning disability.</p>

  <p>Guidance has been issued with regards to some specific services to inform delivery of these outcomes. This includes national guidance on the implementation of local area coordination, one of the key recommendations of <em>The same as you? </em></p>

  <p>Funding has also been allocated this year for a national post to coordinate development of this role across Scotland. In addition, the Scottish Government is currently revising guidance for Community Health Partnerships on learning disability and autism spectrum disorders.</p>

  <p>Guidance has also been issued on implementation of the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007, which relates to all adults &quot;at risk&quot;, for the purposes of the act and comes into force on 29 October.</p>

  <p>Two further documents have been issued as part of the work to take forward the Changing Lives recommendations. These are a &quot;Shared Understanding of Personalisation&quot; paper to raise awareness and promote reflection on current practice against the definition and understanding of what personalisation means, and &quot;Principles &amp; Standards of Citizen Leadership&quot;. The documents can be found at <a href="http://www.socialworkscotland.org.uk/resources/private/Personalisation.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.socialworkscotland.org.uk/resources/private/Personalisation.pdf</a> and:</p>

  <p>The Social Work Inspection Agency (SWIA) and its partners published the report, <em>Multi-agency Inspection of Services for People with Learning Disabilities in Ayrshire</em> , in March 2007. This was the first multi-agency inspection of its type in Scotland. In July 2008, SWIA and its partners carried out a follow-up Ayrshire inspection, to find out if the recommendations in the report had been implemented.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have approved further multi-agency inspections of services for people with learning disabilities. SWIA and its partners will use a self-assessment model to carry out these inspections.</p>

  <p>The extent to which people are able to take personal responsibility for the organisation and procurement of their individual care is dependent on the individual case and local circumstances. A range of options are available to adults with learning disabilities in terms of how they wish to receive their care. Self-directed support is one means by which adults with learning disabilities can increase the flexibility, choice and control over their care to enable them to live more independently. The flexibility achieved is such that even those with the most complex and multiple needs can have self-directed support, using the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 to safeguard their interests. Alternatively, individuals can have a mixed package where they direct some of their support but also have some support organised and procured for them, including day opportunities.</p>

  <p>More generally, work is being done through Changing Lives to raise awareness and understanding of local authorities of personalisation and the need to work with users and carers to design and deliver services to meet their individual needs.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information in this table has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>3. The charges referred to at (e) were not included as separate charges in any court proceedings or other action, but action was taken in relation to other charges against the accused.</p>

  <p>4. The table reflects the position at 9 September 2008.</p>
