  <p>This review will consider all the options for the future of the careers service. The independently chaired committee is expected to report by the middle of 2000.</p>

  <p>All releases for experimental purposes are subjected to specific risk management procedures under the regulatory arrangements designed to reduce the likelihood of spread of the GM plants or pollen from the test site. The independent statutory Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) undertakes detailed environmental risk assessments, on a case by case basis and they advise the Scottish Executive on whether or not a consent should be granted and what conditions should apply. If there was concern that harm might be done to the environment, neighbouring crops or the wider biodiversity then the advice would be against release and the consent would not be granted.</p>

  <p>On 22 September I announced a package of measures designed to accelerate progress in reducing junior doctors' hours and improving existing working conditions in line with the New Deal targets and standards. The key elements of the package include;</p>

  <p>a new quality incentive scheme to reward NHS Trusts which achieve full compliance with the New Deal and encourage others to do so quickly;</p>

  <p>the removal of Trusts' discretion to charge for sub-standard junior doctors' accommodation;</p>

  <p>compliance with the New Deal targets and standards to become an integral part of the personal objectives of Trust Executive Board members;</p>

  <p>a new system of kite marking or New Deal accreditation to signify a Trust's compliance with the New Deal targets and standards;</p>

  <p>a willingness to work with the medical Royal Colleges to examine how consultants might be encouraged and enabled to improve the support they provide for junior doctors in training;</p>

  <p>work with Trusts to pilot imaginative and cost effective ways of reducing junior doctors hours still further towards the 48 hour Working Time Directive.</p>

  <p>These measures will complement the work of a New Deal Implementation Support Group (ISG) which the Scottish Executive has established, in partnership with the Scottish Junior Doctors' committee of the BMA, to work with Trusts and help them reduce junior doctors' hours and improve living conditions still further.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission has a duty of confidentiality to applicants whose cases are being reviewed both under statute and in terms of the privacy provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights. For this reason it is not possible to give details of individual cases. However, I understand from the Commission that up until 7 October, it had received a total of 79 cases. Final decisions to refer or not to refer the matter to the Appeal Court have been made in five cases and decisions are imminent in six. A further 28 cases are under consideration, while review of 11 cases is in abeyance pending the outcome of appeals or of steps by applicants to lodge appeals. Review of the remaining 29 cases will commence as existing cases are dealt with. An additional case worker is being appointed to meet the demand.</p>

  <p>Of the total of 79 cases received by the Commission, 19 were originally submitted to the Secretary of State for Scotland and were transferred to the Commission when it came into operation on 1 April of this year. Thirty-two cases were received by the Commission in their first three months of operation and 28 cases in the period from 1 July to 7 October.</p>

  <p>Of the 19 cases first referred to the Secretary of State, 11 were received at various dates in the 12 months before the Commission assumed its functions and eight were received prior to that.</p>
