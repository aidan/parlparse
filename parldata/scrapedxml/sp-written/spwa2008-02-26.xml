  <p>A number of grants and allowances have been introduced over the years to recruit and retain dentists within general dental services in Scotland, including Orkney. These are:</p>

  <p>commitment payments</p>

  <p>grants for new and existing vocational training practices</p>

  <p>remote areas allowance</p>

  <p>recruitment and retention allowance</p>

  <p>practice allowances</p>

  <p>reimbursement of practice expenses</p>

  <p>deprived areas allowance.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Dental Access Initiative, which was first introduced in 1997, provides grants for those dentists wishing to establish new or expand existing NHS dental practices. This scheme was revised in 2007 to provide for the purchase or relocation of current NHS dental practices and to include specialist orthodontic practices. The financial assistance available under this scheme has also been revised.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are also able to appoint directly salaried dentists to fill gaps in provision.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-9279 on 25 February 2008. A recently completed independent review of Energy Efficiency and Microgeneration Support has provided evidence into some of the barriers impeding the take-up of actions to improve home energy efficiency. These range from a lack of information, advice and finance to more complex matters such as existing housing that is hard to treat.</p>

  <p>In line with findings we are taking additional action to help householders improve the energy efficiency of their homes, including:</p>

  <p>A one stop shop advice network helping householders to take action on energy efficiency, microgeneration and transport. The new network, which goes live from April 2008, will have more challenging targets &ndash; aiming to reach double the number of householders and producing four times more carbon savings as a result.</p>

  <p>New steps to leverage in our fair share of funding through the UK Government&rsquo;s Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT).</p>

  <p>We are currently considering what further action we need to take including the role for standards for existing non-domestic buildings and housing stock and we will shortly be issuing a consultation paper on new policy proposals.</p>

  <p>The Energy White Paper and the Review of Distributed Generation published alongside it, contained a number of proposals and measures to assist more widespread deployment of electricity and heat generation in the UK.</p>

  <p>One of the key barriers identified was the costs and complexities associated with the technical and regulatory aspects of the electricity system. Ofgem and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) have since issued a joint consultation paper outlining a range of options for reducing these burdens.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also considering what action it can take to encourage greater distributed generation, particularly in relation to heat. In doing so we are taking account of the findings of the FREDS Renewable Heat sub-group (referred to in the answer to question S3W-9278 on 25 February 2008).</p>

  <p>To be nominated for World Heritage Site status a site must be on the UK&rsquo;s Tentative List. The current List was published in 1999 and it is due to be reviewed as part of a wider review of World Heritage in the UK. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the Devolved Administrations will shortly be consulting on the issues raised and on the need for a new Tentative List and the process and criteria for inclusion on it.</p>

  <p>Under the Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention issued by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee a World Heritage Site must be of &quot;outstanding universal value&quot;. This is assessed against 10 criteria:</p>

  <p>(i) represent a masterpiece of human creative genius;</p>

  <p>(ii) exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town planning or landscape design;</p>

  <p>(iii) bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared;</p>

  <p>(iv) be an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates (a) significant stage(s) in human history;</p>

  <p>(v) be an outstanding example of traditional human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture (or cultures), or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change;</p>

  <p>(vi) be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance. (The Committee considers that this criterion should preferably be used in conjunction with other criteria);</p>

  <p>(vii) contain superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance;</p>

  <p>(viii) be outstanding examples representing major stages of earth&rsquo;s history, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features;</p>

  <p>(ix) be outstanding examples representing significant on-going ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plants and animals, and</p>

  <p>(x) contain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation.</p>

  <p>All sites must meet at least one of these criteria. Cultural Sites must also show authenticity and all sites must demonstrate integrity. The authenticity of a site should be assessed against the Nara document adopted by the World Heritage Committee in 1994. The Operational Guidelines state that &quot;Integrity is a measure of the wholeness and intactness of the natural and/or cultural heritage and its attributes.&quot; A nominated property is assessed on the extent to which it:</p>

  <p>(a) includes all elements necessary to express its outstanding universal value;</p>

  <p>(b) is of adequate size to ensure the complete representation of the features and processes which convey the property&rsquo;s significance, and</p>

  <p>(c) suffers from adverse effects of development and/or neglect.</p>

  <p>The World Heritage Committee&rsquo;s <em>Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention </em> states that &quot;the reconstruction of archaeological remains or historic buildings or districts is justifiable only in exceptional circumstances. Reconstruction is only acceptable on the basis of complete and detailed documentation and to no extent on conjecture.&quot; This is based on international best practice in the treatment and interpretation of archaeological sites.</p>

  <p>The reconstructions along the line of the German limes were specifically excluded from the World Heritage Site when it was inscribed as part of the Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage Site by the World Heritage Committee in 2005. We therefore do not intend to reconstruct any part of the Antonine Wall.

  <p>Current legislation provides a framework for local authorities to put in place their own schemes for the establishment of community councils, to take account of local needs and geographical circumstances. The Scottish Government plays no direct role in the day-to-day operation of community councils and does not provide any direct funding to them.</p>

  <p>The government is committed to encouraging rural and urban community councils throughout Scotland to work to their full potential. We will shortly be consulting on a model Community Council Scheme, and a Code of Conduct for Community Councillors. These documents have been developed in partnership with the Community Council Working Group, which includes representation from the Highlands, Islands and Scottish Borders, and we are confident that they will provide the tools required for all community councils to represent their communities in the most effective way.</p>

  <p>We are committed to every pregnant woman having a foetal anomaly scan as a matter of routine and we are working with the NHS to ensure that this happens as soon as possible. Currently, all maternity units in Scotland offer an ultrasound scan at booking and around 57% of units routinely provide an 18-22 week scan for the detection of foetal anomaly. Every pregnant woman undergoes a risk assessment on their first visit to the midwife which is used to develop an individualised care plan. This assessment is continuously reviewed and the care plan altered if required. Women are referred to an obstetrician if there are clinical indications for this and in those areas where the anomaly scan is not routinely carried out, patients are selected for the investigation on the basis of clinical need. Local policies will establish the criteria by which these decisions are made.</p>

  <p>Improving outcomes for individuals and communities is at the core of <em>The Same As You?</em> and Changing Lives and is also central to the concordat with local government. Achievement of a significant number of the outcomes and indicators in the concordat will require substantial contribution from social work and social care services and adoption of the principles and aspirations of these reports. In addition, implementation of some of the key recommendations in <em>The Same As You?</em> will continue to be monitored through the collection of annual statistical returns.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also working closely with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to promote a community care outcomes framework. This offers a carefully designed suite of 16 measures which community care partnerships can use to evidence the improvement of outcomes for people who use community care services and their carers. There is a close alignment between these measures and the intentions of <em>The Same As You?</em> and the community care elements of Changing Lives.</p>

  <p>The number of official journeys taken by ministers since their appointment in May 2007, in ministerial cars, private hire cars, and taxis is shown in the following table:</p>

  <p><table width="25%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="34%" align="center" valign="top">Ministerial Car</td>
<td width="37%" align="center" valign="top">Private Hire Car</td>

<td width="16%" align="right" valign="top">6,737</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>i. The table covers the period 16 May 2007 to 31 January 2008.</p>

  <p>ii. Ministerial car journeys are undertaken by Government Car Service (GCS) who provided Scottish Cabinet Secretary/ministers with a car and driver, and where necessary separate transportation of their official documents/boxes, which is included in these figures.</p>

  <p>iii. Private hire cars are only used when it is operationally impossible for GCS to provide a car.</p>

  <p>iv. Taxis are used for short journeys whenever it is practically possible.</p>

  <p>v. Each leg of a car journey is enumerated separately in the table. So a straightforward return is shown as two journeys.</p>

  <p>This compares with a total of 6,607 journeys by ministerial car and 518 by private hire car during the comparable period in the previous year. A record of journeys by taxi in previous years is not held centrally.</p>

Members of the Forum considered, in particular, the contribution that three of the Government&rsquo;s Strategic Objectives &ndash; achieving a Smarter; a Wealthier and Fairer; and a Greener Scotland.</p>

  <p>We are currently gathering and assessing feedback from members of the forum on both the structure of future meetings and the themes to be discussed and will take their views fully into account in determining the themes of future meetings.</p>

  <p>The government regards the two events as complementary. The former is a partnership event, between the Scottish Government and the Parliament, which aims to facilitate engagement between Scotland&rsquo;s businesses and politicians, both the government and the Parliament as a whole. The forum brings together senior figures and leaders in business, trade unions, government, the wider public sector, and the third sector, as an important aspect of the government&rsquo;s strategy to achieve transformational change and higher sustainable economic growth throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Since both the forum and the conference involve engagement with key stakeholders on economic and enterprise matters, it is likely that the outcomes of one will of interest to the other. However, at the moment the government does not envisage any formal relationship between the two bodies.</p>

  <p>1. These figures do not include patients who have claimed entitlement falsely/erroneously to free NHS dental or pharmacy services or NHS optical vouchers. When identified, these patients must pay back the charge evaded/the voucher cost or a civil penalty charge may be imposed. Patients who have committed other types of fraud are included.</p>

  <p>2. Prior to July 2000, cases of potential fraud were investigated by the police.</p>

  <p>3. From July 2000 to September 2004, NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services tackled fraud in family health services only.</p>

  <p>The main functions of NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services are the prevention and deterrence of NHS fraud since it is less costly and more effective to discourage potential fraudsters where possible than to investigate after fraud has taken place.</p>

  <p>The 218 Centre in Glasgow for the support and supervision of women involved in the Criminal Justice system was established in 2003. Funding is provided by the Scottish Government through Section 27 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and paid through the Community Justice Authority to Glasgow City Council as the commissioning authority.</p>

  <p>An initial evaluation of the 218 Centre, published in April 2006, reported that the centre provided many benefits for the target group. However, the evaluation was carried out at a relatively early stage of the centre&rsquo;s existence. The possibility and timing of a further study to look at longer term impacts such as cost-effectiveness and effect on reconviction rates, is currently being explored. This will help identify what particular aspects of this model have proved effective in dealing with women offenders and might be applied in other areas.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have to comply with procurement legislation and, for lower value contracts, their own procurement policies. When selecting which potential suppliers should be invited to tender for public sector contracts, public procurement legislation only allows selection criteria to be used which addresses candidates&rsquo; economic and financial standing and their technical or professional ability, provided that the supplier has been assessed as meeting certain standards in regard to business probity &ndash; for example, payment of taxes, and not having committed an act of grave misconduct in the course of its business.</p>

  <p>When evaluating the tenders received, ethical issues may be taken into account provided that tenderers have been advised of this before submitting their bids, that the ethical issues are directly related to the performance of the contract in question and that such issues are consistent with the principles of equality, transparency and proportionality.</p>

  <p>Funding for local third sector organisations and delivery projects largely sits with local authorities and other public bodies. It is for these authorities to ensure appropriate monitoring, evaluation and audit processes are in place, subject to the oversight of Audit Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has a number of funds which support local action and which have monitoring, evaluation and audit processes in place in line with government funding guidelines. These are also ultimately subject to the oversight of Audit Scotland.</p>
