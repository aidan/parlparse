  <p>The responsibility for the safety of children during journeys to and from school will depend on the circumstances of particular pupils, the journeys they may have to make and the means by which those journeys are undertaken. In many circumstances authorities, parents and pupils themselves will share some responsibility. When authorities make provision for transport under section 51 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, they, and the transport operator, will have a general duty of care towards those pupils.</p>

  <p>The appointment of the President of Employment Tribunals (Scotland) is a reserved matter. Under Regulations made by the Department of Trade and Industry the responsibility for the appointment rests with the Lord President of the Court of Session.</p>

  <p>I understand that the Lord President instructed that the vacancy should be advertised in the professional press and that a Selection Board should be established to interview candidates and make recommendations to him. The advertisement was placed in the Scots Law Times and in the Journal of the Law Society. The Selection Board will comprise Lord Johnston (Chairman) a Senator of the College of Justice, Mr John Elliot, Chairman of the Council on Tribunals (Scottish Committee) and Mr Bill Speirs, General Secretary of the STUC. Five candidates have applied and all will be invited to interview.</p>

  <p>Mr Colin Milne, one of the Regional Chairmen of Employment Tribunals (Scotland), is responsible for routine administrative matters on a caretaker basis. This conforms with practice the last time there was a vacancy for the office of President.</p>

  <p>A Direction is being issued to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to designate an additional 11 Scottish waters under the Shellfish Waters Directive (79/923/EEC). The designations take account of the views expressed in the consultation exercise.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#8217;s shellfish farming industry is an excellent example of sustainable development. It supports the rural economy by providing much-needed jobs in some of the most economically fragile areas of the country. Water quality is vital to this success story because it is a key marketing factor when the industry promotes its product worldwide. Designating the additional waters will safeguard quality so that they can support shellfish such as mussels, oysters and scallops. This will be good for the environment generally as well as for the communities who rely on shellfish farming.</p>

  <p>The waters to be designated are listed in the table below. A notice announcing the Designations will appear in the Edinburgh Gazette. A copy of the Direction to SEPA designating the new waters will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Maps showing the boundaries of the new designations will be sent to the Information Centre in due course.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to extend the FDR scheme to bus services which only take pupils to and from school. We have no information centrally about fuel consumption by these school buses and therefore no estimate of the cost has been made.</p>

However, funding to health boards for the provision of services for alcohol misuse and to local authorities for either drug misuse or alcohol misuse treatment services are not earmarked.</p>

  <p>People can apply at any time for appointment to their local health board and Trusts and their application will be considered when vacancies arise on the boards. Applications can be obtained from the NHS Public Appointments Branch in the Scottish Executive. Some appointments are also advertised in local and national newspapers.</p>

  <p>As I said in the debate on the NHS on 16 December 1999, I am keen to widen the range of members on NHS boards. I have since written to MSPs and MPs asking for their help in identifying local people who could contribute to their local communities by serving as a board member of a NHS health board or Trust. I am delighted to say that in response we have received nearly forty requests for applications. I also wrote recently to national organisations in Scotland, including a number in the voluntary sector, and I am happy to say that we are now receiving requests for applications as a result.</p>

  <p>We are committed to reviewing and modernising the system for making public appointments in Scotland and I am already taking steps to improve the processes for NHS appointments.</p>

  <p>General dental practitioners have been reducing their use of general anaesthesia for several years in favour of administering sedations &#8211; the main alternative method of treating anxious patients. As the number of fees claimed for administration of general anaesthesia has reduced, the number of sedation fees claimed has risen and the upward trend is expected to continue. In addition, more funds will be channelled into sedation training for dental teams. The Scottish Executive is currently considering the fees paid in relation to general anaesthesia and sedation in order to encourage further the move away from general anaesthesia.</p>

  <p>We shall lay regulations to increase National Health Service charges in Scotland from 1 April 2000. There will be an increase in the prescription charge of 10p, from &pound;5.90 to &pound;6.00 per item dispensed. This 1.7% increase is based on the All Items Retail Price Index for the period January to November 1999 (2%). This is in line with our commitment that NHS charges will rise by no more than the rate of inflation for the duration of the current UK Parliament, and means that prescription charges will fall in real terms.</p>

  <p>Prescription pre-payment certificates will go up from &pound;30.80 to &pound;31.40 (1.95%) for four months and from &pound;84.60 to &pound;86.20 (1.89%) for 12 months.</p>

  <p>Prescription charges are expected to raise almost &pound;45 million for the NHS in Scotland in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Charges for elastic stockings and tights, wigs and most fabric supports supplied through the Hospital Service will be increased similarly.</p>

  <p>The maximum patient charge for a single course of dental treatment begun on or after 1 April 2000 will increase from &pound;348 to &pound;354. Only about one in every 1,000 courses of treatment will attract the new maximum charge.</p>

  <p>NHS charges in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will rise by the same amount.</p>

  <p>Any increase in NHS charges over the duration of the current UK Parliament will be based on the All Items Retail Price Index for the November preceding the increase.</p>

  <p>The value of optical vouchers will increase by 2% overall from April 2000. This will ensure that the increased purchasing power effected last year is not eroded.</p>

  <p>The table outlines details of residential homes operated by local authorities. Nursing homes are not operated by local authorities.</p>

  <p>At present, local authority residential homes are expected to operate to the registration standards set by that local authority. The National Care Standards Committee is preparing national standards, which the proposed Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care will use to register and inspect all provision on a consistent and person-centred basis. The proposed standards will be issued for consultation later this year. It will be for each local authority to decide how to provide or purchase care that meets the registration standards and accords with Best Value principles.</p>

  <p>Local Authority Operated Residential Care Homes as at 31 March 1998</p>

  <p>Products and services subject to age restriction are wide-ranging and some are governed by consumer protection legislation which is reserved. However, the Scottish Executive is examining measures for better enforcement of the law to tackle those who make illegal sales to young people within the powers available to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has endorsed <strong></strong> sportscotland&#8217;s strategy <i>Sport 21: Nothing Left to Chance</i> which has the three visions of a country where sport is more widely available to all, where sporting talent is recognised and nurtured and where excellence in sport is achieved.

  <p>With financial assistance from <strong></strong> sportscotland, Fitness Scotland has set up the National Exercise and Fitness Register which vets, registers and monitors the qualifications of exercise and fitness professionals.
