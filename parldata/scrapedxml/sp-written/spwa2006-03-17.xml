  <p>Public service obligations provide a framework within which fare levels, including free fares, on public transport may be determined. However, there are no current plans to extend concessionary travel to forms of public transport other than bus. The two free return ferry journeys per year to the mainland announced for older and disabled islanders is to help eligible islanders in all parts of Scotland to access the free bus scheme. The aid of a social character scheme, which I announced on 13 February 2006, offers eligible residents of Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles, Islay and Jura and Caithness reductions on internal air fares within Scotland.</p>

  <p>It would be impractical to respond in detail to every individual response to a consultation. We do consider all responses that we receive and did try to address these views within the analysis of the consultation and the final bill.</p>

  <p>All respondents receive an acknowledgement letter outlining what will happen after the consultation period of twelve weeks has ended. All parties who were invited to respond to a consultation, all respondents, and all other interested parties receive a copy of the analysis of the consultation and a copy of the final consultation report. Furthermore, all consultation reports are placed on the Scottish Executive website. The report into the consultation of the draft Crofting Reform Bill is available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/10/2790312/03134" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/10/2790312/03134</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently considering the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&rsquo;s (SEPA) response to its consultation on the Water Environment charging scheme. The consultation resulted in a significant number of responses, including one from Kingussie Development Company, which detailed the impact of SEPA&rsquo;s proposal on their industry. Due to the complexity of the scheme, it has taken longer than anticipated to consider a number of amendments proposed by SEPA, including one that acknowledges the importance of small scale hydropower in the development of renewable sources of energy. As I expect a formal announcement to be made very shortly, I do not consider a meeting at this stage to be appropriate.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23104 by Malcolm Chisholm on 6 March 2006, whether it expects the trend of rising home ownership to continue for the next 10 years and what its assessment is in figures of the likely growth over the next 20 years.</p>

  <p>Yes, the Executive expects the level of home ownership will continue to increase over the next 10 years. As I stated in my earlier reply future levels of home ownership will depend on a wide range of factors. There is too much uncertainty in these factors to provide a reliable estimate of changes in owner occupation over the next 20 years.</p>

  <p>Discussions on the plan to remove the rule of 85 from the Local Government Pension scheme are continuing and the Executive is considering options for a solution to this issue in Scotland. The draft Regulations proposed to implement the changes will be published for consultation once discussions have concluded. However, the recent action initiated by UNISON to seek a Judicial Review of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&rsquo;s decision to remove the rule of 85 in England and Wales is likely to delay matters. The recent decision by local government unions to take industrial action throughout the UK on 28 March does not undermine our commitment to secure a negotiated solution.</p>

  <p>Officials in the Health Department are in close touch with the board, including the chair and the Chief Executive. I know from the annual review meeting with the board last September, and from regular updates I receive, that NHS Western Isles is working hard to address a range of clinical and managerial issues. I have made clear to the board that I attach a great deal of importance to sound financial management and sustainable financial balance, in support of high quality, sustainable clinical services. I expect the board&rsquo;s assurances on these matters to be delivered.</p>

  <p>I am clear that NHS Western Isles has further to go in addressing the challenges it faces. I and the Health Department will continue to support the board to make progress, and to monitor its performance. Progress has been made on a number of service issues over the last year or so that demonstrates the commitment of the NHS board to sustain and develop clinical services for the benefit of all the residents of the islands.</p>

  <p>The key actions and decisions needed to keep health care services moving forward in the Western Isles will be taken by the board and its dedicated staff, supported by the community they serve.</p>

  <p>Against that background, I do not believe that a meeting would be productive.</p>

  <p>There are no specific limits on passenger loads for trains. Carriages are designed to rigorous safety standards and standing on a train is not seen as a significant safety risk in its own right.</p>

  <p>Current and anticipated passenger loadings are not considered to be a significant safety issue, therefore the Scottish Executive does not have any plans to impose additional requirements over and above the existing measures First ScotRail take to manage them.</p>

  <p>I expect all NHS boards to implement the national strategy. The action plan which accompanies the strategy sets out what needs to be done and by whom, including a number of actions for NHS boards to take forward.</p>

  <p>Each board has identified an executive director who is responsible for sexual health and wellbeing and lead clinicians have been appointed to drive forward the practical plan for action, which is part of the strategy.</p>

  <p>The Executive has received interim and final clinical service plans from each NHS board. Local inter-agency sexual health strategies developed in partnership between NHS boards, local authorities, the voluntary sector and other key stakeholders have also been received. NHS boards will submit an annual report on progress against the actions outlined in these plans. This will be reported to the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee (NSHAC), and the Executive will then publish an annual progress report, with the first one due in the summer of 2006. These annual reviews will be complemented by a more comprehensive five-yearly review, carried out by NSHAC.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for the NHS boards. The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, the national sexual health strategy, Respect and Responsibility, contains actions for the Scottish Executive Health Department to consider the potential of development and testing of STI diagnostic testing kits in rural and urban settings. It also tasks the department with considering the potential extension of the chlamydia postal testing kit in the light of the evaluation of the Healthy Respect initiative. Scottish Executive officials are actively pursuing these actions with key stakeholders and will report progress to the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee.</p>

  <p>It is our intention to ensure that where boards do want to use postal testing kits they are made available in a cost effective way, through bulk and shared purchasing. The Executive is planning to provide a seminar for lead clinicians on the results of the Chlamydia Postal Testing Kit, to help them assess the suitability of the kits for their service provision.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to state how many social workers will retire over the next five years as this is a matter for employers and individual employees.

The Executive has been promoting social work as part of the <em>Care in Scotland</em> recruitment and profile raising campaign since 2002.

  <p>The President has taken steps to ensure that decisions taken by the Additional Support Needs Tribunals will conform to the rules of natural justice and fair hearing in respect of the allegiances of members. For example, induction training for members included guidance on the circumstances in which they should decline to sit on particular cases. The obligation is on the member to disclose any potential conflict.</p>

  <p>The guidance given by the President, is that it is not appropriate for members to participate in any reference made by a parent against a local authority by which that member is currently employed or contracted. Where that member was previously employed or contracted to the local authority, guidance should be sought from the President, who will consider the facts and circumstances of each case, before deciding if it is appropriate for a member to sit on a tribunal.</p>

  <p>The governing principle, which is in each member&rsquo;s terms and conditions, is that a member should not take on any reference or sit at a Tribunal in any circumstances, which would lead an objective onlooker with knowledge of all the material facts reasonably to suspect that the person might be biased.</p>

  <p>We recognise the potential role of the cruise sector in bringing visitors to Scotland, and VisitScotland is commissioning research to assess the market for and the potential economic benefits of cruise tourism to Scotland. They expect a summary of the findings from this research to be available by the middle of 2007. Some local authorities and ports are already active in marketing opportunities with the cruise liner industry, and can access a variety of funding sources from the enterprise network.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures were used to determine the benefit of the use of aid of a social character to reduce fares for island residents compared with the introduction of public service obligations to reduce fares for all island travellers.</p>

  <p>Between February 2003 and July 2005 a series of studies were commissioned to assess options for improving air services and reducing fares within the Highlands and Islands. These included implementation of a comprehensive network of routes attracting &quot;aid of a social character&quot; or controlled by public service obligations (PSOs).</p>

  <p>I have decided to use &quot;aid of a social character&quot;. This flexible approach maximises value for money; ensures that benefits go straight to the traveller; works with the market, thus avoiding the need to provide subsidies to airlines in areas where services can be provided commercially and would allow competition where it exists, to be maintained, and ensures that the aid provided is targeted at the individuals and communities that need it most.</p>

  <p>No upper age restrictions have been placed on the age of trainees - it is important for the aims of the research project to assess the effectiveness of training by simulation across a range of different driving conditions and environments, and age groups of drivers.</p>
