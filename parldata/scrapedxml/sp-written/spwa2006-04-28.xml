  <p>Between April 1999 and March 2005, 559 Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) were granted in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Information on how many ASBOs were issued to people with diagnosed emotional or behavioural problems or learning difficulties is not collected centrally. Collation of meaningful data would prove difficult in view of the lack of a consistent and widely agreed definition of such problems.</p>

  <p>Broadcasting is a reserved matter and is the responsibility of the Department for Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has worked closely with DCMS throughout the BBC Charter Review process to make them aware of the outcomes we want from the Charter Review and to highlight the potential for improvement in terms of serving the Scottish public. The Executive&rsquo;s response to the consultation on the <i>BBC Charter Review Green Paper</i>, which DCMS launched in March 2005, can be found on the BBC Charter Review website at <a href="http://www.bbccharterreview.org.uk" target="_blank">www.bbccharterreview.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>We are continuing to work with DCMS to ensure that the next Royal Charter and Framework Agreement take account of the different circumstances in the devolved nations of the UK as well as the interests of listeners and viewers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There is no legislation in Scotland that would enable a local authority to implement such a scheme. We are currently awaiting the report of the independent Local Government Finance Review Committee. Once the way forward on local taxation is known, we can come to a view regarding any discount regimes to be put in place.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-04-28.S2W-24891.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80046" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0428.htm#6">

  <p>There is no definition of what constitutes &quot;fully trained staff within the drug treatment sector&quot;. However, there is a single set of occupational standards, Drug and Alcohol National Occupational Standards (DANOS), which underpin all substance misuse training delivered in Scotland through Scottish Training on Drugs and Alcohol (STRADA). The Executive provided &pound;860,000 in 2005-06 to fund training delivered through STRADA.</p>

  <p>Between October 2001 and December 2005 STRADA provided 17,000 training places across 18 different modules. STRADA also offers a Post Graduate Certificate in Addiction from the University of Glasgow; to date 85 individuals have successfully completed this course. Bespoke training courses requested by Alcohol and Drug Action Teams are also delivered by STRADA and include practise-based workshops and specialised training courses.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also provided two year funding (&pound;655,440 over 2005-06 and 2006-07) to the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) to develop and deliver the RCGP Certificate in the Management of Drug Misuse in Primary Care in Scotland. This funding will provide training to 60 GPs, 20 Pharmacists and 20 nurses. In addition, in 2005-06 the Scottish Drug Forum received &pound;41,557 and Re-Solv &pound;29,128 for drug related training.</p>

  <p>Ring-fenced grant funding of &pound;5.5 million per annum is also paid to local authorities to improve the quality and management of social work provision by increasing the availability of training for relevant staff. It is not possible to disaggregate what proportion of this funding is spent on drug related training.</p>

  <p>In addition, all schools in Scotland will continue to provide drugs education as part of the 5-14 Health Education guidelines. The Executive&rsquo;s <i>Know the Score</i> communications strategy will also continue to run targeted campaigns which provide information about drugs, their effects and where help can be obtained. The strategy is supported by a free telephone information line and a dedicated website. The range of <i>Know the Score</i> materials is available to Directors of Education for use in schools.</p>

  <p>Scottish Fire Service Circular 4/2003 introduced the concept of risk-based emergency response through Integrated Risk Management Planning (IRMP) at fire authority level. This approach takes us away from the traditional response approach to fire cover to a more flexible, locally determined risk-managed approach which is intended to improve community safety. The Highlands and Islands IRMP was implemented on 1 April 2005.</p>

  <p>The planning of the workforce to deliver first class health services, including specialist nurses who work with sufferers of chronic conditions to patients in Scotland, is primarily a matter for individual NHS boards. As at 30 September 2004, there were 219 nurse specialists working with patients who have chronic conditions such as Diabetes, Epilepsy, HIV, Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and Palliative Care. Further information is published on the Scottish Health Statistics website under Workforce Statistics, at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a> .</p>

  <p>A Review of Nursing in the Community is also underway, which, when completed will set the direction for creating a modern re-designed community nursing service. This will significantly contribute to the reduction of hospital admissions, facilitate hospital discharges, improve the management of patients with long-term illness and support the care and treatment of patients in their own home and community settings.</p>

  <p>Each NHS board apart from NHS Tayside has appointed a Lead Clinician to integrate sexual health services in their area. NHS Tayside is in the process of appointing an additional consultant in GU Medicine along with other frontline staff. The responsibilities of the Lead Clinician are being taken forward by a number of senior clinicians on a portfolio basis, making best use of the available expertise.</p>

  <p>Overall progress on implementing the sexual health strategy and action plan is undertaken by the multi-agency Strategy Group and the effectiveness of the portfolio approach will be evaluated after 12 months.</p>

  <p>Respect and Responsibility identified NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) as the key mechanism to support the development of appropriate clinical standards for dealing with sexually transmitted infections and wider sexual health issues. As the initial stage in formulating these standards, work has been undertaken on the development of key clinical indicators, the first five of which were considered at the February 2006 meeting of the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee and which are shortly to be implemented by NHS boards. Further work on additional key clinical indicators and standards will be taken forward by NHS QIS during 2006-07 with the intention of consulting on these in summer 2007.</p>
