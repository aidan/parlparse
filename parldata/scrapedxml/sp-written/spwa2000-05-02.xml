  <p>The Electronic Communications Bill provides for a voluntary scheme of approval for service providers to enable both parties to a transaction to be confident of the identity of the other and the security of the transaction. Officials are working with the Alliance for Electronic Business on the "T scheme", which would be self-regulating. However, the Bill includes provisions for a government-regulated scheme, if self-regulation fails.</p>

  <p>Many consumer concerns can be met by the development of e-commerce codes which comply with core principles. TrustUK will approve codes of conduct for e-commerce which meet the core principles and offer consumers good protection. Online businesses which subscribe to TrustUK approved codes will display an &quot;e-hallmark&quot; indicating that consumers can shop with confidence. TrustUK is expected to be launched in June.</p>

  <p>Comprehensive information on all the financial packages available to inward investors is not held centrally and to provide a detailed list would involve disproportionate costs. However, the number of companies that received Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) over &pound;1 million total 72.</p>

  <p>Some of the companies have undertaken more than one project, and their total RSA payments over this period have exceeded &pound;1 million. This information covers 1 April 1989 to 31 March 1999.

  <p>When I appeared before the European Committee on 21 March I set out my broad welcome for the recommendations in the review, which aimed to streamline the process of administering Structural Funds Programmes so that they achieve maximum impact and leave a legacy. I have considered carefully the report of the European Committee as well as the responses received from interested parties throughout Scotland, and I have now prepared a formal response to the report which accepts its recommendations. I have sent this response to the Convenor of the European Committee and placed a copy in SPICe for the information of members.</p>

  <p>No conditions are attached to the Freight Facilities Grant awarded to Safeway which restrict the company from backloading.

  <p>The Scottish Executive expects health boards to carry out effective public consultation on proposals for significant service changes and developments. The Executive welcomes the fact that Greater Glasgow Health Board is actively seeking to improve their arrangements for public consultation.

  <p>Transfers to community ownership will enable councils and councillors to develop a more strategic role in the provision of housing in their area. To support this process, we have proposed that Scottish Homes&#8217; development funding role should transfer to the council following a whole stock transfer. Councils will continue to have statutory responsibility for the homeless in their area.</p>

  <p>Currently, a local councillor may make representations on housing matters to the council on behalf of a constituent who is a council tenant. Transfer need not prevent a councillor from making such representations to the new community landlord on the constituent&#8217;s behalf. In the case of the Glasgow transfer, there will be councillors on the management boards of the Glasgow Housing Association and the Area Housing Partnerships.</p>

  <p>Some 1,300 council houses in North Ayrshire were insulated in 1999-2000 through the Warm Deal grant allocated to the council by the Executive. For this financial year, the council has total resources of some &pound;6 million for capital investment in its own housing stock.

  <p>It is for health boards, in conjunction with NHS Trusts, to determine the increased staffing levels necessary in light of local needs and circumstances, and to ensure the appropriate funding is in place.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing record levels of financial resources to the NHS in Scotland. The Minister for Finance announced in Parliament on 30 March that, in addition to the increase agreed in the Budget Bill, the Health budget will be increased by &pound;173 million in 2000-01, with major real terms increases each year following through to 2003-04.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer has set up a short-life working group to look at intensive care and high dependency services. One of the issues the group will consider is staff recruitment, retention and training. Health boards are expected to take the working group&#8217;s recommendations into account when deciding how to use their share of the additional &pound;6.8 million, which I announced on 22 February, together with their general revenue allocations.</p>

  <p>Source: Scottish Health Service Costs.</p>

  <p>In 1995-96 health boards did not consistently identify the costs of Community Psychiatric Teams. It is therefore not possible to provide meaningful comparative figures for this period.</p>

  <p>Expenditure figures for 1999-2000 are not yet available, and health boards will not be in a position to provide forecasted expenditure for 2000-01 until later this year.</p>

  <p>There has been a steady reduction in the real terms expenditure on hospital-based treatment commensurate with the increase in community based health spend as part of the Executive&#8217;s modernisation agenda to provide support for mental health patients in the community. This additional support is provided not only by the NHS in Scotland, but extends to care in the community provided by local authorities.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that I am today making available to health boards a total of &pound;60 million, subject to the provision of satisfactory plans showing how the resources are to be used.</p>

  <p>These funds will enable health boards and NHS Trusts to accelerate delivery of national and local priorities, particularly in the three clinical priorities of heart disease, cancer and mental illness, and with a particular focus on children&#8217;s services. As part of that work, health boards and NHS Trusts must ensure that:</p>

  <p>services affected by peaks in demand, particularly during the winter, are better managed;</p>

  <p>in co-operation with other agencies such as local authorities, the number of delayed discharges is minimised;</p>

  <p>waiting lists and waiting time targets are consistently met;</p>

  <p>financial targets are met and no overspends are incurred.</p>

  <p>In addition to the existing performance monitoring arrangements, a team drawn from the NHS and the Health Department will be established to keep progress under review and to offer guidance and support when necessary on the steps that need to be taken or put in place.</p>

  <p>The amounts for each health board are as follows:</p>

  <p>The New Deal for Lone Parents is progressing well in Scotland. By the end of January, 11,180 lone parents had agreed to participate and 3,860 had already found work.</p>

  <p>Figures for Inverclyde are not available. However, the corresponding figures for the district of Renfrew and Inverclyde &#8211; 739 participants and 287 into work &#8211; show that the programme has a higher proportion into work than the Scottish average.</p>

  <p>The Diet Action Plan contains 71 recommendations for action to be taken over a 10-year period to improve Scotland&#8217;s diet. The wide range of action taking place at both national and local level demonstrates that steady progress is being made with implementation. It is my intention to bring together a range of individuals and interests in the near future to assess progress to date and to address how we might give added impetus to our work on improving diet.</p>

  <p>This is a complex area but is one which we must handle effectively if we are to bring about sustainable improvement in the health of the Scottish people. Scotland&#8217;s diet will not be improved overnight, not least because of the population&#8217;s strong cultural attachment to unhealthy dietary behaviours. A number of sources are being utilised to track ongoing change in Scots&#8217; eating habits. These include the Scottish Health Survey, the UK National Food Survey, the UK Diet and Nutrition Survey and the Infant Feeding Survey. The work of the Food Standards Agency, which was established on 3 April, will also contribute to the monitoring of change in the Scottish diet.</p>

  <p>14 local authorities have made representations. The majority are supportive of our plans to introduce a single social tenancy although concerns do exist principally about how the revised right to buy will impact on rural areas, the issue of whether it will be applied retrospectively and the extent to which further exemptions are required. These areas are the subject of ongoing discussions with housing interests.</p>

  <p>There are no legal sanctions available to individuals to enforce contributions from other residents.</p>

  <p>However, where a roads authority has served a notice under section 13 of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 requiring the frontagers to a private road to make the road up to, and maintain it at, a suitable standard, the notice must specify a scheme whereby the cost is to be apportioned amongst the frontagers. If, following the serving of such a notice, the requisite number of frontagers so agree, the works may be fulfilled on their behalf by the local authority, who shall then recover the costs from the frontagers.</p>

  <p>There is provision for a person upon whom such a notice is served to appeal by summary application to the sheriff within 28 days. The sheriff's decision on the matter shall be final.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will announce the outcome of the recent public consultation on the implementation of Article 5 of the Landfill Directive to limit the landfilling of municipal waste.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-05-02.60.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0502.htm#6441">

  <p>A consultation paper on limiting the landfill of biodegradable municipal waste as required by the EC Landfill Directive was issued on 17 November 1999. The consultation sought views on the types of mechanism which could be used to ensure that biodegradable municipal waste is diverted away from landfill and therefore the targets in Article 5 of the Landfill Directive be met. Five different options were presented and are discussed in the paper.</p>

  <p>A total of 33 responses were received by the Scottish Executive and copies of these have been placed in the Executive&#8217;s library for public inspection. Of the respondents who expressed a preference, 84% favoured the option of system of permits which will allow local authorities to landfill set quantities of biodegradable municipal waste in any given year. This option was supported by the majority of local authorities which responded and by all the respondents from the waste management industry. The Executive has concluded that this is the preferable method for implementing the Directive targets. Legislation will be needed to establish such a system.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper also explained several other issues related to implementation of the Directive&#8217;s targets. Views on the possibility of establishing a tradable system for landfill permits were less conclusive. Overall, however, there was a general view that this proposal would be of benefit, although it is clear that further discussion is needed on the details of how the system should be established. The Executive has concluded that there is merit in establishing a system of tradable landfill permits, probably issued free initially to local authorities and allowing trading between local authorities. This should allow authorities more flexibility to take local considerations into account in making decisions on dealing with waste. Trading is also expected to prove more cost-effective and of benefit to the environment, as authorities can achieve economies of scale without necessarily transporting waste over long distances. Available landfill capacity can be used for more local waste where it is available and provides the Best Practicable Environmental Option.</p>

  <p>There was widespread support for Scotland making use of the additional four years allowed for in the Directive to meet the targets, delaying the first deadline to 2010. It is clear that in view of the extent to which we rely on landfill, there is merit in allowing as long as possible to achieve the challenging targets. However, it is vital that work starts now to reduce the amount of waste which is disposed of to landfill and that the extension is not used as an excuse for delaying action. We must begin to change our ways now, without delay.</p>

  <p>The Executive has commissioned research to investigate the costs of implementing the Landfill Directive. The results of this research will also help inform the detailed design of the permit system and how permits should initially be allocated.</p>

  <p>Some concerns were raised about the proposed interpretation of the definition of municipal waste in the consultation paper. However, the proposed interpretation is consistent with the base information for municipal waste produced in the UK in 1995 which is held by EUROSTAT and which will form the basis for the measurement of the Directive&#8217;s targets. The Executive will consider this interpretation further in the light of legal advice.</p>

  <p>Further consultation will be undertaken later this year on both the details of the proposed landfill permit system and on other aspects of implementation of the Landfill Directive.</p>

  <p>The tighter standards for lead prescribed in the EC Drinking Water Directive published in December 1998 are being transposed into Scottish legislation. The existing drinking water quality regulations set a maximum level for lead in drinking water of 50 microgrammes per litre. This level will be reduced to 25 microgrammes per litre in 2003 and then reduced further to 10 microgrammes per litre in 2013.</p>

  <p>Failure to meet the lead standard in domestic water supplies is generally due to the presence of lead plumbing. Plumbosolvency control is already practised at many water treatment works but the water authorities have recently identified additional areas where treatment may help meet the new standards. The authorities should have additional plumbosolvency control measures in place by December 2001.</p>

  <p>The only lead pipes owned by a water authority are lead communication pipes running between the water main in the street and the boundary of a property. The use of lead communication pipes stopped around 1960. Lead communication pipes are being replaced by water authorities as part of their mains rehabilitation programmes. If, despite the actions taken by a water authority, a domestic property fails to meet the new standard after the prescribed date, water authorities will provide consumers and property owners with advice on remedial action that they can take.</p>
