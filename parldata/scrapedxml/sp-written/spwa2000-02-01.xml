  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it intends to discharge its commitment, set out in its Programme for Government, to promote renewable energy.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-02-01.S1W-4084.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0201.htm#4084">

  <p>The Minister for Energy at the Department of Trade and Industry is today announcing to the House of Commons the Government&#8217;s intention that 10% of the UK&#8217;s electricity requirements will be provided from renewable sources by 2010. This target will be an integral part of the Government&#8217;s Climate Change Programme, and represents an increase of 5% on the level that is expected to be achieved by renewable energy by 2003. The Government believes that this increase can best be achieved within the framework of a competitive market, by placing a new Renewables Obligation on all electricity suppliers.</p>

  <p>Through its Programme for Government, the Scottish Executive is committed to the development and promotion of renewable sources of generation. I am, therefore, keen that the Scottish Executive should make an important contribution to the UK&#8217;s climate change programme, and the 10% renewables target. Counting the output from our hydro schemes, and renewables projects in the pipeline under the Scottish Renewables Obligation, we expect that well over 10% of Scottish electricity demand will be met from renewables by 2003. As part of the Scottish Climate Change Programme, a draft of which will issue for consultation soon, I intend to seek views on increasing, by around 5%, the share which renewable electricity will by then have of the Scottish market, a similar increase to that sought for the UK as a whole. This would be implemented by a new Renewables (Scotland) Obligation, which would run in parallel with the Renewables Obligation in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>We are aware that an increase in the production of renewable energy in Scotland will face particular barriers. To help address some of these, I am currently reviewing the planning guidance for renewable energy. The purpose of this review is to help planning authorities find the balance between national policy on climate change and renewable energy, national policy on landscape and nature conservation and the local impact of particular schemes. In addition, I plan to review with the electricity companies in Scotland the capacity of the Scottish electricity grid to connect more renewables projects.</p>

  <p>I am placing in SPICe a copy of Mrs Liddell&#8217;s Parliamentary Answer along with the UK Government response to last year&#8217;s consultation on the promotion of renewable energy.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its policy is in relation to the provision of council housing for single people convicted of non-violent crimes and who were council tenants prior to serving a prison sentence but are homeless on their release, and what impact this policy has on the likelihood of such individuals re-offending.</p>

  <p>The primary statutory responsibility for dealing with homelessness rests with local authorities. In discharging their responsibilities local authorities are required to have regard to the Code of Guidance issued by the Scottish Executive which includes specific guidance on measures to prevent ex-prisoners from becoming homeless. The Scottish Executive has been concerned to note the extent to which ex-prisoners feature amongst those people who sleep rough. That is why we have adjusted the focus of the Rough Sleepers Initiative to increase the emphasis on prevention and support for this group. The Homelessness Task Force will consider whether further action is required to address the needs of people who may be at risk of becoming homeless, including ex-prisoners.</p>

  <p>Both the Knowledge Economy Taskforce and the Digital Scotland Taskforce are cross-cutting initiatives and there are clearly linkages between the work of both groups, although the Knowledge Economy Taskforce has a discrete interest in areas such as business innovation and human skills. The main area of common interest is in e-commerce and this is being managed by close liaison between both taskforces. The members of each group are being made aware of the work of the other.</p>

  <p>I have today authorised the recruitment of a further six permanent Sheriffs who will be given Commissions as floating Sheriffs enabling them to serve wherever required throughout Scotland. These posts will be advertised and successful candidates will be appointed as soon as possible. Scottish Ministers are still considering their response to the High Court judgement which led to the suspension of the use of temporary Sheriffs. Subsequent cases in the Supreme Courts, which involve challenges under the ECHR to aspects of judicial appointments, may have a bearing on the outcome. One such case is still before the Court and I shall make a full statement to Parliament once we have reached conclusions.</p>

  <p>When they were let, the 25 passenger rail franchises in Great Britain were designed steadily to reduce the Government&#8217;s support for passenger rail services. This reduction is currently treated by the UK Treasury as a general saving to the Exchequer. The estimated total value of franchise payments to ScotRail is &pound;1.749 billion for the period 1997-98 &#8211; 2003-04. The estimated cumulative reduction of franchise payments for the same period, compared to the amounts which would have been paid had payments continued at the 1997-98 level, will be &pound;0.271 billion. Corresponding reductions are taking place in the other franchises throughout Great Britain. Details of the ScotRail franchise are set out in the table below.</p>

  <p>Investment in the railway industry in Scotland and elsewhere in Great Britain is principally a matter for the industry itself. In its 1999 Network Management Statement for Scotland, Railtrack outlined investment of some &pound;2.2 billion over the next ten years. ScotRail is investing around &pound;170 million in new trains that will enter service between now and 2001. Public sector support for passenger rail franchises underwrites almost all of this investment. Rail services are eligible for support from the Scottish Executive Public Transport Fund, totalling &pound;90 million between 1999 and 2002. The Rail Passenger Partnership scheme, for which &pound;105 million is available over the next three years, is administered by the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority on a GB basis.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. For Strathclyde PTE-funded services, revenues are paid to SPTE and offset their franchise payments to ScotRail: these revenues are estimated at &pound;309 million for 1997-98 &#8211; 2003-04.</p>

  <p>2. Reductions are calculated against baseline year 1997-1998.</p>

  <p>3. The figures for 1997-98 and 1998-99 include incentive payments to ScotRail.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive direct funding to the voluntary sector in 1998-99 totalled &pound;23 million. Of this, &pound;275,000 (1.2% of the total) was allocated to the Ethnic Minority Grant Scheme. The scheme provides grants to voluntary organisations in Scotland for projects designed to reduce discrimination and promote racial equality.</p>

  <p>A strategic review of Scottish Executive funding for the black and ethnic minority voluntary sector was announced on 27 October 1999 and the outcome of the review will be reported in the summer.<br /></p>
