  <p>Cancer services in Scotland are delivered by clinicians working within three regional managed clinical networks. The whole-time equivalent (WTE) of oncologists working within a particular cancer centre area and the ratio of these to the local population is therefore not an indicator of the level of patient access to these highly specialised services.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the latest available WTE of consultant oncologists working within the areas covered by the three regional cancer networks. The table should be read in conjunction with the notes below.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to the question S1W-1021 by Ross Finnie on 10 September 1999, whether achievement of the target of incinerating 60% of meat and bonemeal stocks produced under the Over Thirty Month Slaughter Scheme by March 2002 is on schedule.</p>

  <p>As at week ending 4 November 2001 some 287,800 tonnes of meat and bonemeal (MBM) produced from animals rendered under the Over Thirty Months Slaughter Scheme has been incinerated. The Rural Payments Agency currently has some 4,100 tonnes of incineration capacity available per week, with a further plant undergoing commissioning. When complete this will bring the weekly capacity to well over 5,000 tonnes.</p>

  <p>The total quantity of MBM arising from animals slaughtered and rendered under the scheme between May 1996 and March 2002 is expected to be about 100,000 tonnes more than was assumed when the target was set. Notwithstanding that, present projections indicate that the target can be met but its achievement depends critically on the amount of MBM produced between now and 31 March 2002 and the effective performance of the contracted incineration facilities.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not propose to offer any specific assistance for this purpose. The United Kingdom does not currently have the facilities to remove ozone-depleting substances from insulation foams, from which it follows that there is a gap in the market which industry may be able to exploit. It is up to individual companies to identify and take advantage of a business opportunity which presents itself in this way.

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the importance of affordable water charges. That is why it introduced the current transitional relief scheme. Considerable further work is needed on the affordability of water and sewerage charges in the longer term.

  <p>As announced on the 12 November, I have agreed the revenue caps as advised by the Water Industry Commissioner. This means that provided the case for the creation of Scottish Water is agreed by Parliament, I expect domestic charges not to increase in the north next year. Domestic charges cannot be determined for the four-year period as a whole, however the Water Industry Commissioner's assessment that there will be no significant changes in the north is a reasonable one.</p>

  <p>Comparative figures cannot be given for the non-domestic sector owing to the differing natures of bills resulting from variety in size and type of businesses served.</p>

  <p>The Scottish water industry must become substantially more efficient over the next four years, with inevitable cuts in staffing levels, regardless of whether Scottish Water is created or not.
