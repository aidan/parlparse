<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-11-05.S2W-3309.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80097" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa1105.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>There is no formal register of school-age children with autism. The annual school census does, however, collect data on the main difficulty in learning, including autism, though not where it is a subsidiary difficulty. The following tables provide data from the school census in 2001 and in 2002. The tables are not comparable because the 2001 school census collected this information on pupils with records of needs only, whereas the 2002 school census combined those with records of needs with those pupils with Individualised Educational Programmes.</p>

  <p>Total Number of Pupils and Number of Pupils with Record of Needs with Autistic Spectrum Disorder as Main Difficulty in Learning in Publicly Funded Schools by Local Authority</p>

  <p>The underlying objectives of the CAP reform agreement link closely with our own strategic objectives for Scottish agriculture as set out in <em>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</em> . These also underpin many of the commitments set out in the rural section of <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> . The reform agreement therefore will help deliver many of these commitments. Two of the main commitments in the partnership document are:</p>

  <p>seek reform of the CAP to secure improvements for Scotland and to shift subsidies away from merely supporting production to recognising the economic, social and environmental contribution that agriculture makes to rural development, and</p>

  <p>implement land management contracts to deliver reformed CAP support which takes account of the diversity of Scottish agriculture and its economic, social and environmental impact.</p>

  <p>The agreement itself very largely achieves the first of these commitments - through decoupling. The flexibilities available in the agreement also open up possibilities for advancing the second commitment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is undertaking a wide-ranging consultation on the implementation of the CAP reform and the flexibilities that are available. The consultation will last three months from 6 October 2003 to 6 January 2004, and decisions will be taken in February-March 2004.</p>

  <p>The latest gross domestic product figures available for Scotland are presented in the Office of National Statistics regional accounts. This shows that in 2001 (the latest year available), Scottish GDP was estimated to be &#163;69.2 billion at current basic prices, resulting in an average GDP per economically active person (2001 June-Aug Labour Force Survey) of &#163;27,500. The UK equivalent (excluding extra-regio activity) was &#163;29,400. This implies that, for the same population and workforce in Scotland in 2001, the average GDP per economically active person would need to have been &#163;1,900 higher in order to reach the same level as the UK average (note that this would, in turn, result in an increase in the actual average UK GDP/economically active person).</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cut across a number of different policy areas. In each of these areas, the main policy driver may not necessarily be climate change, but the impact on greenhouse gas emissions is an important consideration when policies are being formulated. The <em>Scottish Climate Change Programme</em> , available on the Executive's climate change website at <a href="www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange</a> , includes information on expenditure in a number of these areas. Such expenditure will often bring social, economic and environmental benefits beside that of reducing greenhouse gas emissions: we do not keep records of the proportion of expenditure directly attributable to emission reductions.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that peatland also offers the potential to assist delivery of its target for reduced carbon emissions by 2050. The Scottish Executive supports the maintenance and restoration of peatlands through its agri-environment schemes and through Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). SNH&#8217;s Natural Care Schemes are targeted through the Caithness and Sutherland and Lewis Peatland Management Schemes as well as other management agreements with individual owners and occupiers of peat bogs.</p>

  <p>Projects aimed at restoration of blanket and raised bogs in Scotland have additionally benefited from substantial support from the EC Life-Nature Programme. These initiatives have received Scottish Executive support and this will continue in future where appropriate.</p>

  <p>The UK Blanket Bog Habitat Action Plan target is to restore 75% of the total extent of restorable blanket bog in the UK by 2015. Scotland&#8217;s contribution to this target is being monitored through a series of interim targets, the first of which is to bring the total area of blanket bog in or near favourable condition to 340,000 hectares by 2005. Progress towards these targets is monitored and overseen by Scottish Natural Heritage.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage is currently working to develop an agreed definition of &quot;favourable condition&quot;, and assess the condition of blanket bog within the Sites of Special Scientific Interest series, and that exercise has not yet been completed. To help secure favourable condition and restore areas of minor degradation, Scottish Natural Heritage operates a number of management schemes and agreements as well as contributing to specific bog restoration projects.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) operates a number of management schemes which include prescriptions to ensure the sympathetic management and restoration of peat bogs. These include the Caithness and Sutherland Peatland Management Scheme, the Lewis Peatlands Management Scheme and the Skye Peatlands Management Scheme. Scottish Natural Heritage also negotiates individual management agreements with the owners and occupiers of peat bogs throughout Scotland. Total expenditure on SNH management agreements that target peatland features was:</p>

  <p>Complete restoration of whole woodlands to peatland is not provided for in forestry grant schemes, but Forestry Commission Scotland&#8217;s Woodland Grant Scheme and the new Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme fund restoration work in relation to the management of forest edges, and smaller scale restoration of peatland habitats within forests.</p>

  <p>There is no definitive estimate of Scottish peatland coverage but Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has produced estimates for two of the three main types of peatland, namely blanket bog and raised bog.</p>

  <p><u>Blanket Bog</u></p>

  <p>SNH&#8217;s recently developed Scottish blanket bog inventory estimates the total extent of blanket bog as 1,927,000 ha. Some 55% of this is considered to be degraded to varying degrees as a result of past agricultural drainage, peat cutting, erosion etc.</p>

  <p><u>Raised Bog</u></p>

  <p>SNH have estimated that there are approximately 24,000 ha of raised bog at present, of which 14% is actively peat forming, 23% is degraded but capable of restoration and 63% is no longer restorable.</p>

  <p><u>Fens</u></p>

  <p>Fens, the third habitat and the lesser of the three types in terms of area, are the least known in terms of diversity, extent and condition. Scottish Natural Heritage has recently embarked upon the development of a Fen Inventory to collate information held by itself, other agencies and voluntary organisations.</p>

  <p>The Environmental Protection Act 1990 contains the main legislation on statutory nuisance and enables local authorities and individuals to take action to secure the abatement of a statutory nuisance. However, light pollution is not defined as a statutory nuisance under the act. Therefore, local authorities have no statutory powers to take action against security lights on domestic properties that are causing a nuisance to neighbouring householders.</p>

  <p>We have no plans at present to introduce legislation to bring light pollution within the scope of statutory nuisance. However, we are considering the report on <em>Light Pollution and Astronomy</em> published by the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee on 6 October 2003 which contained various recommendations on controlling light pollution.</p>

  <p>We intend to return the currently prescribed industries to conventional valuation at the next non-domestic revaluation which is due to take place on 1 April 2005. This means that these industries will be treated in the same way as other industries: valued by independent assessors and have the right to appeal their valuation. The majority of respondents to the consultation were in favour of this proposal.</p>

  <p>Our aims for non-domestic rates are stability and certainty for business and continued harmonisation of valuation treatment north and south of the border. As part of this, we must be assured that the resulting valuations for these industries are robust. If this cannot be achieved, then we may review the position. This is a similar position to that adopted in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>Decisions about the aggregate number of trainee midwives in Scotland are taken on the basis of recommendations from the Student Nursing Intake Planning (SNIP) steering group which meets annually and brings together a wide range of expertise.</p>

  <p>The recommendation of the steering group in relation to the academic year 2003-04 was that the annual student midwife intake should be set at 180, reduced from 220 in 2002-03. This recommendation was based on the steering group&#8217;s assessment of workforce supply and demand factors.</p>

  <p>The Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) which provide midwifery training in Scotland were subsequently given student midwife intake numbers that reflected a proportional reduction. I understand that the number of trainee midwives at the School of Nursing and Midwifery at Paisley University, who place their students in a number of clinical settings including Inverclyde Royal Hospital, decreased from an intake of 45 per year to 37 per year in response to the SNIP report.</p>

  <p>Decisions about the placing of student midwives in particular hospitals are matters for the HEIs themselves in discussion with local health care providers.</p>

  <p>The way in which self-funding care home residents choose to fund their care is a private matter for them. While most such residents will be benefiting from free personal and nursing care, many will not have been financially assessed by their local authority; and some will be fully funding their care directly with the home, without local authority involvement. It is not possible therefore to estimate how many residents of voluntary and private sector care homes have funded their care by selling their homes, nor will it be possible in future for the same reasons. The information requested on public sector care homes is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>We are, however, in the process of collecting information on the number of care home residents who have a deferred payment agreement in place with their local authority. Such agreements obviate residents&#8217; selling their home during their lifetime.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise plays a key role in enabling and supporting economic development and ministers recognise that the board and its chair are central to its success. The appointment of a new chair was advertised in the national press on 20 June. The Executive received 24 applications. These have been reviewed against the person specification for the post by an advisory panel which included a representative from the department and an independent assessor.</p>

  <p>The panel has concluded that although there were some applications which were of the required calibre there were not enough to provide ministers with a sufficiently wide choice. In the light of their conclusion, and after consultation with the Commissioner for Public Appointments, we now wish to take steps to widen the search for candidates and intend to engage the services of Executive Search and Recruitment consultants. All existing applicants are being advised of this decision.</p>

  <p>It is our intention that the new chair will be announced as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is substantially improving the A77 linking central Scotland with Dumfries and Galloway, by constructing the M77, upgrading the Whitletts roundabout in Ayr, and providing new overtaking opportunities between Ayr and Stranraer. The M74 motorway links Dumfries and Galloway to the UK motorway network, and we are supporting a feasibility study investigating improved local rail services between Glasgow and Dumfries and Galloway on the west coast main line.</p>
