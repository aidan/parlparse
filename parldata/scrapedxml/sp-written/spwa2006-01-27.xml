  <p>The Executive recognises the critical role played by successful and dynamic city-regions as engines of growth for the national economy and the contribution that cities make to national competitiveness. This is reflected in a number of recent policy statements, including the <i>National Planning Framework for Scotland</i> , the <i>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</i> , the <i>Infrastructure Investment Plan </i> and the refreshed <i>A Smart, Successful Scotland</i> , which emphasise both the connections between cities and city-regions and the importance of collaborating to compete effectively on the international stage.</p>

  <p>In line with the conclusions of the Cities Review, we recognise that the regeneration of particular places and communities is key to the overall success of each city and to each of the city-regions that surrounds them. Our programmes of investment in skills, transport and infrastructure are bringing clear benefits to all our city-regions.</p>

  <p>Specific investment programmes include the Cities Growth Fund and the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund. The Executive is also supporting pathfinder Urban Regeneration Companies in Craigmillar, Raploch and Clydebank.</p>

  <p>As part of its response to the Cities Review, the Executive approved the creation of the Cities Growth Fund, the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund and announced consultation on Urban Regeneration Companies.</p>

  <p>The Cities Growth Fund provides a dedicated source of infrastructure investment funding for our six city-based local authorities to deliver sustainable economic growth and regeneration in each city-region. It will provide &pound;173 million over the five years 2003-08.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive allocated &pound;20 million to the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund for financial years 2004-06 and a further &pound;24.3 million has been made available through Spending Review 2004 for 2006-08.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also supporting innovative delivery vehicles such as Urban Regeneration Companies (URCs). This is backed by &pound;20 million from the Scottish Executive over the period 2004-06. To date three Urban Regeneration Companies have been granted &quot;pathfinder&quot; URC status in Scotland. A further &pound;22 million has been allocated through Spending Review 2004 for the period 2006-08.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Budget also includes funding for a wide range of other measures which benefit our cities and their surrounding city-regions. These include addressing the skills gap, tackling unemployment and supporting business growth and jobs.</p>

  <p>There was no direct funding for local authorities to deliver the Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) at its inception in November 2004.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has given the local authorities funding of &pound;2 million in 2005-06 to support the development of money advice services. The table breaks down that figure by local authority.</p>

  <p>The decision on how to spend the allocated funding is for each local authority to make, but the Executive set out in guidance their expectation that at least &pound;40,000 of each allocation (&pound;1.28 million pounds) was to be spend on providing or enabling DAS approved money advisers.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not currently collect information on (a) consumer debt and (b) overall debt. A recent report from the Department for Trade and Industry contains some information on debt for Great Britain, however we do not have this information at Scotland level. The report can be accessed via the following link <br /> <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/topics1/pdf1/debtdtionmori.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/topics1/pdf1/debtdtionmori.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>From July 2006 the Office for National Statistics survey on wealth and assets will collect information on household debt. The first annual results should be available at the end of 2007. There will be results for Scotland as a whole, but not for individual local authority areas.</p>

Further information and plans for future activity in this area are provided in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Response to the Lambert Review of Business-University Collaboration, March 2005, a copy of which is in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre. The Scottish Funding Council has established an overarching Knowledge Transfer and Innovation Group which will take forward the knowledge transfer agenda in both the university and the college sectors. Technology Ventures Scotland, supported by Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Funding Council, also looks at knowledge transfer strategy and innovation across Scotland, taking an overarching role in encouraging the commercialisation of Scotland&rsquo;s Science and technology research, particularly from the perspective of business.</p>

  <p>In England and Wales, under the penalty notice for disorder scheme, the police can issue penalty notices for certain firework offences, but this scheme does not apply in Scotland. The Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004 creates a police power to issue fixed penalty offences for certain offences associated with antisocial behaviour. The scheme is currently being piloted in Tayside, but the list of fixed penalty offences included in the scheme does not include any offence relating to fireworks.</p>

  <p>It would be possible to prosecute an offence relating to fishing without a licence in the Scottish side of the Solway Estuary in an English Court. Fishing licensing arrangements are set up on a UK basis. The only licensing regime that applies exclusively at present on the Scottish side of the Solway is that established for fishing vessels throughout UK waters by an Order under section 4 of the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967. Section 14 of that act states that an offence can be treated as having been committed in any part of the United Kingdom. The relevant Order is the Sea Fish Licencing Order 1992 (SI.1992 2633) (as amended) which has UK extent and proceedings for a breach of which can be applied anywhere in the UK. There have, however, been no instances of such an offence committed in Scotland being prosecuted in England or vice versa since devolution.</p>

  <p>In February 2003, the First Minister announced his intention to take action to increase Scotland&rsquo;s population by attracting people to live and work in Scotland. Following this announcement, a project team was set up in the Executive to develop proposals to encourage and facilitate the managed migration of people to Scotland. This team was supported by a steering group, comprising external interests as well as government officials. The team&rsquo;s work contributed towards the policy statement, <i>New Scots: Attracting Fresh Talent to Meet the Challenge of Growth</i> , which was published on 25 February 2004.</p>

  <p>Negotiations to acquire the Fresh Talent uniform resource locators (urls) began in March 2004 &ndash; as these domain names were owned by a private company - before the launch of the scotlandistheplace.com website. Negotiations to procure the domain names with the company were not successful at that point. The names Fresh Talent.com, Fresh Talent Scotland.com and Fresh Talent.co.uk were finally acquired for &pound;3,000 in February 2005.</p>

  <p>The current treatment of babies with deformational plagiocephaly includes supervised &quot;tummy time&quot; and encouraging non-sleep patterns and activity, for example playing and being held. In nearly all cases of deformational plagiocephaly the child&rsquo;s head returns to a normal shape without any treatment. If the condition worsens or shows no sign of improvement, then referral to a neurosurgeon would take place.</p>

  <p>There is little evidence to support the use of helmets and the current consensus view of paediatric neurosurgeons in Scotland is that these should not be used.</p>

  <p>The requirement was advertised in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> . From the initial responses to the advert, 12 companies were selected to respond to a detailed requirements document. Following an extensive evaluation process, the respondents were reduced initially to five and then to two.

  <p>There are two aspects to clinical systems delivery with the GCS toolset. The first is the on-going development of the toolset product itself, and its implementation within NHSScotland developer teams, or by third parties commissioned by NHSScotland, to enable clinical systems development. The second relates to the development of clinical applications with the toolset, and their subsequent implementation in the clinical environment. The contract is concerned with the first of these &ndash; i.e. the delivery, maintenance and continuous development of a robust and forward-looking toolset that keeps pace with technological advances and clinical requirements, and its successful implementation across NHSScotland. However, the usefulness of GCS-built clinical systems in the delivery of patient care will be the most powerful measure of toolset effectiveness, so benefits realisation measures will take both aspects into account. Criteria for measuring benefits realisation will therefore include the ease, flexibility and build-speed facilitated by the toolset during the development process, plus the clinical acceptability and level of usage of resultant systems.</p>

  <p>The contract itself includes an enabling framework with AxSys for the development of applications although this is not an exclusive contract.</p>

  <p>Use of the toolset by NHSScotland developers is currently being piloted by the SCI-DC (Scottish Care Information &ndash; Diabetes Collaboration) team based in the Clinical Technology Centre of Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. It is planned to develop the next version of the SCI-DC Clinical system, in support of diabetes hospital out-patient clinics, with the GCS toolset. A number of Early Adopter projects have also been identified for early development, in the clinical priority areas of cancer and mental health, and detailed requirements gathering is currently underway. Since the toolset will be used in a variety of settings and for different purposes, the timeline for individual developments will vary. However, it is planned that the GCS toolset will be made widely available to the service during the summer of 2006 &ndash; once training and skills prerequisites are established, and national guidelines for its optimal usage have been informed by the early work.</p>

  <p>The first milestone is the delivery of standard GCS interfaces to the NHSScotland core integration products &ndash; i.e. SCI Store and SCI Gateway. Delivery of these interfaces is due for completion in early March 2006. Delivery of an appropriate training and support infrastructure is another major milestone for the programme, and the requirement will be informed by on-going work with the SCI-DC team. Planning work is on-going with the local projects involved in early implementation to agree milestones and delivery targets for their individual projects. The delivery of successful clinical systems in support of patient care is of course far wider than the development tools of choice, with development representing only a small proportion of the overall timescale.</p>

  <p>As with the procurement of any system, it is only possible to predict future success by thorough evaluation, feedback from existing users of the supplier and product and from past experience. The Executive has no reason to believe that the GCS toolset will not fulfil the requirement for NHSScotland. However, it should be noted that the toolset is delivering a capability to develop systems, and not the clinical systems themselves, and the ability of NHSScotland to make effective use of the toolset will be a major factor in its success.</p>

  <p>The contract lays down staged payments for the toolset with payments falling due after successful delivery of developments. The eventual cost of the licence is also tied to the number of users and the move to a full (unlimited) national licence is at the sole option of NHS Scotland. The support terms include a service credit regime if the contractor fails to meet pre-determined response requirements. Similar features are also anticipated for developments commissioned by NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>The contractor could suffer late, or reduced, payment of the licence fees or lose income for support of the toolset or any developments. There are therefore significant incentives in place for the contractor to deliver and to support the toolset.</p>

The agreed process is being followed, with cost envelopes being prepared for each scheme for approval by HM Treasury. Discussions on the cost envelopes for the England and Wales schemes are already underway.

  <p>There are a range of schemes supporting families with children under three, including the Sure Start Scotland programme which provides targeted support for families who are vulnerable for whatever reason. These families are not, however, always located in areas of multiple deprivation. <i>Mapping Sure Start Scotland</i> indicated that there has continued to be a year on year increase in the numbers of children and parents supported. In 2003-04 these were 15,400 and 9,600 respectively.</p>

  <p>Phase 1 of the National Demonstration Project for Child and Family Health in Scotland, <i>Starting Well</i>, targeted children aged 0 to three and their parents from two specific areas of multiple deprivation. Phase 2 of the project works with vulnerable children aged 0 to five across Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Although the &pound;318 million Community Regeneration Fund does not target 0 to threes directly, it supports a range of activities in areas of multiple deprivation. This includes some which may be of indirect benefit to 0 to threes such as child care and health support.</p>

  <p>There are over 100 Working for Families (WFF) projects currently operating in 10 local authority areas which support parents in disadvantaged areas or groups to progress towards or into employment by removing childcare barriers. Support is provided to parents of children in the 0 to 16 age group, which includes parents of children under three, although these parents are not specifically targeted as a separate sub-group. WFF projects include key workers who provide focussed adult support for employment related activity and a range of childcare projects aimed at improving accessibility to services and building capacity where necessary.</p>

  <p>Expenditure on the Channel Tunnel Rail link in 2003-04 that is included in <i>Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses</i> in identifiable expenditure outside the UK amounted to &pound;166 million (43 per cent of all expenditure on the Channel Tunnel Rail link, corresponding to the share of foreign passengers using the service) and the estimate of the Scottish share of this is calculated using its population share.</p>

  <p>&pound;224 million (57 per cent of all expenditure on the Channel Tunnel Rail link) was identified within the UK and of this &pound;1.2 million (0.3 per cent of all expenditure on the Channel Tunnel Rail link) was allocated to Scotland, based on information of passenger origin.</p>

  <p>This methodology is used because expenditure outside the UK cannot be identified to any specific UK region and the estimated Scottish share of identifiable expenditure outside the UK is based on the assumption that the Scottish population benefits from the enhanced travel opportunities from outside the UK.</p>

  <p>A recent report by the Scottish Executive published 23 January 2006, <i>Scottish Innovation System: Actors, Roles and Actions</i>, benchmarks Scotland&rsquo;s performance in innovation against other European regions. The report ranks Scotland&rsquo;s innovation performance relative to the European Innovation Scorecard 2004 as follows:</p>

  <p>Scotland is above average (top quartile) in terms of the overall regional innovation index, and again in terms of those indicators dominated by public investment decisions.</p>

  <p>Scotland is below average (third quartile) in terms of the key measures of innovation outputs &ndash; the share of new-to-the-firm products in manufacturing.</p>

  <p>Business research and development expenditure in Scotland is below average (third quartile).</p>

  <p>Scotland has below average (third quartile) employment in medium or high-tech manufacturing although knowledge diffusion among Scottish manufacturing companies is still above average (second quartile).</p>

  <p>Employment in high-tech services is above average (second quartile), while knowledge diffusion among Scottish service companies are below average (third quartile).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive uses a wide range of measures to monitor Scotland&rsquo;s innovation and research and development (R&amp;D) performance against international comparators.</p>

  <p>The key measure we use when assessing the performance of Scotland in respect to innovation, is the Community Innovation Survey (CIS). The CIS provides a range of indicators of innovative performance and allows comparisons to be made with other regions of the UK and European countries.

  <p>The Scottish Executive also monitors research and development expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product in our key OECD competitors, to benchmark Scotland&rsquo;s relative R&amp;D performance. These data are published annually by the Executive in Business Enterprise Research and Development in Scotland. This can be accessed via the following web link:</p>

  <p>A review of the Scottish Executive Managing Attendance procedures was undertaken during 2005 and consideration given to what further actions could be taken to reduce the Executive&rsquo;s sickness absence below the current level.</p>

  <p>The revised procedures, which will shortly be implemented, include involving line management to a greater extent in managing staff who breach the intermittent absence trigger point and a more prompt referral of staff to the Executive&rsquo;s Occupational Health Service, where applicable. A new training course for line managers, intended to develop effective management techniques for dealing with managing attendance, is in its final design stage.</p>

  <p>Resolution strategies for all long-term sick cases have been developed, resulting so far in the return to work of a third of the cases approached, with some others leaving the organisation through resignation, dismissal or medical retirement. This work is on-going.</p>

  <p>These measures together with a variety of flexible working practices are aimed at reducing sick absence and assisting staff to return to work as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many cases of unfair dismissal have been brought against it in each year since 1999; how many of these cases it lost; how many cases are outstanding, and what the total cost was of these proceedings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold, on a central database, information related to the number of claims for unfair dismissal that have been brought against it since 1999, the outcome of such claims and the costs involved in responding to such claims. This information could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. At present there is one on-going claim for unfair dismissal against the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Central Office of the Employment Tribunals in Scotland, the Eagle Building, 215 Bothwell Street, Glasgow, holds a public record of all Employment Tribunal cases brought in Scotland and may be able to provide some information relevant to your question.</p>

  <p>The licences referred to above were issued for a variety of purposes and include disturbance of otters and the destruction and repair of holts.</p>

  <p>The licences have now been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) (Bib. number 38705), and each licence details the activities permitted under the licence, the purpose for the licence, as well as its time period. As amendment and extension licences have been included, the number of licences placed in the SPICe totals 44.</p>

  <p>Information which could lead to the identification of individual persons, or locations of otter holts becoming known, has been taken out of the licences for data protection purposes under the terms of the Environmental Information (Scotland) Regulations 2004.</p>
