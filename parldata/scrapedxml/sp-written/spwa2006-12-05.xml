  <p>The available information on the numbers of drink-drive accidents and casualties in Scotland is derived from the GB-wide estimates compiled by the Department for Transport. The latest estimates are included at table 22 of <em>Road Accidents Scotland</em> <em>2005</em> which was published by the Scottish Executive in November 2006, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41118). These and other statistics collected centrally do not include information about any previous convictions that drivers involved in drink-drive accidents may have.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) is Scotland&rsquo;s sole prosecution authority. The decision whether to prosecute is based on the facts and circumstances of each individual case and COPFS does not have operational targets relating to the number of prosecutions in respect of any category of crime, including the sale of alcohol to customers who are drunk.</p>

  <p>Procurators fiscal throughout Scotland are working in communities to raise the profile of and respond effectively to all aspects of antisocial behaviour.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware of some local authorities handling efficiency savings in such a way that the devolved school management (DSM) budget at head teachers&rsquo; disposal is reduced; whether it is aware of any other local authority practices that involve funds which are notionally within the DSM budget, and what its position is on the matter.</p>

  <p>In setting the local government finance settlements for the three years 2005-08, an efficiency assumption of 0.7 per cent per year was factored in. It was agreed that this efficiency assumption should not be applied to the education, police or fire allocations for employment costs. It is a matter for local authorities as to how they meet the efficiency gains identified, which are applied against education non salary costs, including those which are devolved to school level.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any evidence that implementation of the Moray Firth Seal Management Plan has resulted in an increase in salmon populations.</p>

  <p>The Moray Firth Seal Management Plan has focussed on the management of seals that forage in rivers and so targets the individual animals believed to cause most damage to stocks. It has been shown that removal of salmon by seals may have a large impact where stocks are low, for example during spring months.</p>

  <p>The plan therefore takes a precautionary approach to lessening the impacts of predation on salmon stocks while minimising impacts on the common seal population but the numbers of salmon returning to Scottish rivers depends on a wide range of factors. The concurrent variations in these factors can result in large fluctuations between years in numbers of salmon and means that it is very difficult to isolate the impact of individual management measures from records of salmon catches and counts.</p>

  <p>A total of 93 seals were shot during the first phase of the plan between April and December 2005, a significant reduction on the previous level and less than permitted under the licence.

  <p>The Moray Firth Seal Management Plan provides for an annual licence application under the Conservation of Seals (Scotland) Order 2004. Scottish Executive consideration of this application, includes the securing of scientific advice on seal conservation and management and the undertaking of an appropriate assessment due to the presence of the Dornoch Firth and Morrich More SAC for common seals.</p>

  <p>The maximum numbers permitted under the licence were calculated using a precautionary permitted biological removal figure recommended by the statutory scientific advisers on seal management. The licence sets out maximum numbers and the provisions of the licence are only used where it is considered that this is necessary to protect fisheries.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for contacting patients has not transferred from NHS boards and it is their decision whether to issue the letter or not. The letter is issued by Atos Origin, on behalf of NHS boards, to all patients entitled to receive free flu vaccination because they will be aged 65 years and over before the end of March 2007. The data used to identify these patients is held on the Community Health Index database operated by the Practitioner Services Division.</p>

  <p>Each year the content of the letter and the distribution arrangements are agreed with the Scottish Flu and Pneumococcal Working Group whose members include representation from Health Protection Scotland, Scottish Executive, pharmacy colleagues, Practitioner Services Division, general practice, media colleagues and NHS Board Immunisation Co-ordinators.</p>

  <p>I am not aware of any plans to map grey squirrel populations on a national scale. The Red Squirrel Action plan includes the mapping of red squirrel strongholds and areas where incursions of grey squirrels are most likely, with the intention that control measures will then be targeted on those areas.</p>

Immunocontraception is one method currently under consideration; funding is currently being provided for investigation of this as a potential method of long-term control and trials are underway to investigate methods of targeting delivery of chemical sterilant for grey squirrel control.</p>

  <p>The UK Red Squirrel Group co-ordinates actions to support red squirrel conservation. The relevant Scottish statutory agencies are represented on this group as are those from the north of England. This provides a forum for discussion of cross-border issues and for sharing information and good practice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Red Squirrel Action Plan 2006-2011, recognised the importance of targeted grey squirrel control as the most effective approach to red squirrel conservation. It also recognised the particular risks currently facing red squirrels in the south of Scotland from the spread of grey squirrels testing positive for Squirrelpox virus antibodies. Action has been taken by SNH and FCS to control the flow of potentially infected grey squirrels from the Cumbria region through the employment of grey squirrel control officers.</p>

  <p>Grey squirrels are listed on Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. This schedule lists those species which it is illegal to release into the wild. Anyone who releases a grey squirrel into the wild is guilty of an offence and would be liable to prosecution. The investigation of criminal activity is a matter for the police.</p>
