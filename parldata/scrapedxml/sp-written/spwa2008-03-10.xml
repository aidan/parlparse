  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, under the Solidarity Golden Rule of its Government Economic Strategy, what representations it intends making to influence the UK Government to reduce inequality by ensuring that welfare reform addresses Scotland&rsquo;s social equity issues and whether this includes addressing the level of withdrawal of housing benefit by 65p in the pound for income earned over the benefit thresholds.</p>

  <p>I am contacting Stephen Timms MP, Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, to arrange a meeting soon to discuss a number of matters, including the impact of welfare reform, on the people of Scotland.

  <p>There are no national screening programme arrangements for the detection of prostate cancer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is provided with expert, independent advice on screening programmes by the UK National Screening Committee (NSC).</p>

  <p>The level of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) in the blood is one of a range of investigations which may be undertaken to help confirm a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Currently available tests cannot differentiate between those men whose prostate cancer will grow rapidly and aggressively and those in whom it will remain localised to the prostate for the rest of their lives. Thus, some men could be offered treatment that they do not require and current treatments for prostate cancer can also have serious side-effects, including impotence and incontinence. PSA levels may also be raised in a number of conditions unrelated to cancer.</p>

  <p>For these reasons the current PSA test and treatment for prostate cancer do not meet the requirements for an effective population based screening programme and is not currently recommended by the NSC. The NSC continue to actively review the research findings as they become available on screening for prostate cancer and Scottish Government will continue to monitor their advice and recommendations closely.</p>

  <p>The cost of health care for an individual depends on their health. Although it is true to say that on average the costs of treating older people (and very young children) are higher in any given year than for working age people, this is a result of the current population profile, healthy life and life expectancies. If an individual was to live longer, the related per capita costs for health care over the individual&rsquo;s life would depend on the extent to which the additional years of life were spent in good health.</p>

  <p>The policies that we are putting in place involve investing in the early years of life to help people sustain and improve their healthy life expectancy. The <em>Better Health, Better Care: Action Plan</em> sets out our programme of work to improve Scotland&rsquo;s health and details our actions increase the length of health life expectancy.</p>

  <p>If these policies result in a shorter period of chronic illness at the end of a person&rsquo;s longer healthy life, then the total cost to the NHS over a person&rsquo;s lifetime may in fact be less than at present despite the fact that they have lived longer.</p>

  <p>There is no definitive answer. Longer life expectancy only inevitably leads to rising costs if age related patterns of morbidity and treatment were to remain static.</p>

  <p>Along with increasing life expectancy the Scottish population, in common with other developed countries, is experiencing increasing healthy life expectancy.</p>

  <p>Although per capita NHS costs, in any one year, are highest for the youngest and the elderly within the population, the effect of an increasingly elderly population in the future is not clear cut.</p>

  <p>The apparent association of ageing and health care cost increase is based on the assumption that, despite longer life expectancy, the onset of serious illness continues to be around the same age as currently, and that individuals simply spend a longer time with chronic illness, incurring health care costs.</p>

  <p>The more likely scenario, illustrated by increasing healthy life expectancy, is the postponement of the onset of chronic ill health - and its progression to levels of severity, including death. So the costs shift to an older age cohort.</p>

  <p>The implementation of<em> Better Health Better Care</em>, including investment in the earlier years of life, and increased disease prevention measures are designed to increase health life expectancy resulting in the scenario described. People will live longer, healthier lives with the onset of chronic illness and demands on the NHS delayed.</p>

  <p>The <em>Better Health Better Care</em> Action Plan indicated our commitment to the concept of mutuality and an annual ownership report. Distributed free of charge to all Scottish households, this will set out information on the rights and responsibilities of patients and their carers, alongside useful information about how to access local services, raise issues or complaints and get more involved in the design and delivery of local health services.</p>

  <p>We will shortly begin work with patient and community groups to agree an appropriate form and content for the report. Until this work is completed it will not be possible to give an accurate estimate of the cost which will be incurred.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s original proposals to enhance accident and emergency services at Hairmyres Hospital was in recognition of the fact that Hairmyres would be one of two emergency hospitals in Lanarkshire. NHS Lanarkshire are now in the process of considering the management of the totality of emergency activity in the region. However, recognising the levels of accident and emergency activity and the need to ensure that patients are seen as quickly as possible, in accordance with clinical priority, redesign work is underway to aid patient flows, and the impact of this initiative will be evaluated.</p>

  <p>Mileage rates are specified under Agenda for Change terms and conditions and any changes are agreed through the UK NHS Staff Council - the partnership organisation set up in the wake of the introduction of Agenda for Change to oversee the operation of the new system&rsquo;s terms and conditions across the UK, and also to act as a forum for discussion of relevant issues. Membership of the council includes representatives of trades unions and professional representative organisations, NHS employers and UK Health Departments.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that a sub-group of the staff council has been tasked with conducting a fundamental review of mileage rates and lease car policy, taking account of both motoring costs and environmental issues.</p>

  <p>In the interim, the mileage rate for regular uses with cars under 1,500cc has been increased in an effort to help the least well paid members of staff until such time as new arrangements can be put in place.</p>

  <p>Agenda for Change covers non medical staff but the likelihood is that mileage rates for staff not covered by Agenda for Change (i.e. doctors) will also be altered in accordance with the findings of the UK Staff Council sub-group, once these are known.</p>

  <p>Over the period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2007, Scottish ministers called in and determined 250 planning applications where the planning authority had not issued a decision but was minded to grant planning consent subject to notification to the Scottish ministers. No planning applications have been called in by Scottish ministers after a decision notice was issued by a planning authority.</p>

  <p>Where a planning application is refused by a planning authority the applicant has the right to appeal to Scottish ministers. Appeals are heard by an inquiry reporter. Most appeal decisions are delegated to reporters but in cases where the application is judged to be a matter of national concern Scottish ministers can &quot;recall&quot; the appeal case for their own determination. Ministers can accept or reject the reporter&rsquo;s recommendation. The number of appeals recalled for determination by Scottish ministers over this period is 98.</p>

  <p>A breakdown of the yearly figures for called in applications and recalled appeals is provided below:</p>

  <p>There are no plans at present to alter the Victim Notification Scheme (VNS) in light of the review of the Robert Foye case. The Scottish Government is committed to extend the scope of the VNS from 15 May 2008 to cover offenders sentenced to 18 or more months in prison. The current scheme is joined by around 600 victims a year. It is estimated that the number of victims joining the extended scheme will rise to nearly 2,000 a year.</p>

  <p>Victims who join the VNS will be notified whenever an offender has become eligible for temporary release and also if the offender is unlawfully at large.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The decision to contact victims immediately following the abscond of a prisoner is a matter for the Chief Constable. A memorandum of understanding for advising the media of a prisoner who absconds exists between the Scottish Prison Service and the Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland).</p>

  <p>The SPS will write to any victims registered under the Victim Notification Scheme 48 hours following the incident to provide information on the abscond. The same individuals will also be notified when the prisoner is returned to custody.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what estimate it has made of the number of students who will see a reduction in the grant or bursary or student support that they currently receive due to changes to the means-testing arrangements announced on 15 February 2008.</p>

  <p>Under the previous Scottish Executive, this information was not recorded. The Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) did not ask for details of partner&rsquo;s income because this factor is currently not recognised in the income assessment for living cost support in higher education. It is therefore not possible to estimate how many students will be affected by the changes as we do not know how many students&rsquo; parents have partners or how many students themselves have partners.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government did attempt to model the costs involved in estimating how many students in Scotland will see a reduction in the grant or bursary or student support that they currently receive due to the means-testing arrangements. However, because this information is not available, it is not possible to produce accurate forecasts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will ensure that all income available to households when applying for living cost support will be recorded by SAAS and will closely monitor the numbers affected by these changes from 2008-09 onwards.</p>

  <p>We will make funds available to students who are in genuine hardship through their institutions discretionary funds.</p>

  <p>Historically, the advice from the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS), previously the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), has been that the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not have the ability to set their own interest rate as this is a reserved issue. Based on this advice, the interest rate payable on student loans in Scotland (and Wales and Northern Ireland) has consistently been set in line with the rate set by DIUS.</p>
