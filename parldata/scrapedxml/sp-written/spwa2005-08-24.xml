  <p>The Executive continues to promote Scottish architecture through its policy on architecture. A progress report which details both the achievements of policy to date and our future plans was published in February 2005, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 35568). Recent initiatives have included events promoting Scottish architecture abroad in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and France.</p>

  <p>The establishment of Architecture and Design Scotland in April 2005 as a national champion for good architecture and design represents a major step forward in encouraging and promoting quality development in the built environment across Scotland. In 2006 we plan a formal review of policy which will take into consideration the Cultural Commission's recent recommendations on architecture and the built environment.</p>

  <p>The UK-wide cycle-to-work scheme already extends to Scotland, and promotes cycling through an annual tax exemption which allows employers to lend cycles and cyclists&rsquo; safety equipment to employees as a tax-free benefit.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has considered the possibility of purchasing and managing a fleet of ferries for the provision of lifeline ferry services to the northern islands since the last changes in maritime regulations relating to the safety design of ferries took place in 2002 and, if not, what the reasons are for its position on this matter.</p>

  <p>The fleet of three ferries owned by Royal Bank Leasing Ltd and currently leased to NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries Ltd for the provision of the Northern Isles lifeline services were purpose built for the routes after the award of the 2002-07 subsidy contract to NorthLink in December 2000. The vessels are fully compliant with the new Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) regulations which came into force in 2002. The contractual arrangements between the Scottish Executive, Royal Bank Leasing Ltd and NorthLink relating to the 2002-07 contract provide for the fleet to be made available, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to any future operator of the services awarded a subsidy contract by the Scottish Executive. The availability of the vessels for future contracts has, therefore, been secured without the Scottish Executive assuming ownership of the vessels.</p>

  <p>Note: *Grants paid to P&amp;O to make the necessary vessel modifications to meet safety requirements under the Safety of Life at Sea Regulations (SOLAS).</p>

  <p>The system of support for ferry services to the Northern Isles changed in 1998. Prior to this, P&amp;O received Tariff Rebate Subsidy (TRS), based on volumes carried. From 1998, a block grant payment mechanism was used. The higher levels of subsidy paid to P&amp;O from 1998 partly reflect that change.</p>

  <p>Decisions will be taken on whether or not to impose restrictions in the Firth of Lorn and Loch Creran Special Areas of Conservation and what the nature of these might be once consideration of the issues relating to the sites is complete. These decisions will be made as soon as possible and, in any case, well before works starts on Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s Assessment of Mobile Gear Fishing Impacts on Special Area of Conservation Features within the Firth of Lorn, the specification for which is currently being prepared. Account will be taken, however, of information obtained from the organisation&rsquo;s site condition monitoring on the Firth of Lorn, which is underway at present.</p>

  <p>Until these decisions are taken, the Executive is not in a position to consider whether compensation may be appropriate.</p>

  <p>The extra &pound;2 million will begin to forge the closer links between our drugs strategy and our plans for reducing reoffending, signalled in the <em>Criminal Justice Plan</em> , published in December 2004, by creating up to an extra 1000 treatment places. The extra money will extend the range of community interventions targeted at those individuals whose drug misuse brings them into contact with the criminal justice system so that we can offer them access to treatment facilities at each stage in the process. I will announce the details in due course. This is an opportunity to make better use of the combined expertise of the health and justice services in such matters and the arrangements for monitoring effectiveness will build on the best of what already exists.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s support for non-national museums and galleries is directed through the Scottish Museums Council. On 26 July 2005, the Scottish Museums Council published <em>A National Learning and Access Strategy for Scotland&rsquo;s Museums and Galleries</em>, with a Ministerial foreword. This strategy aims to ensure that learning and access are integrated into museum service delivery as part of standard practice.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will investigate ways of providing non-national museums and galleries with additional funding, in light of their economic importance as referred to in the report, <em>Realising the True Impact of Museums and Galleries in Scottish Tourism</em> , and whether it has had any meetings with COSLA or other public bodies with regard to museum and gallery funding.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive support for non-national museums and galleries is channelled principally through local authorities. In addition, the Executive provides specific grant through the Scottish Museums Council. Local authority grant aided expenditure in respect of museums and galleries rose from &pound;21.2 million in 1999-2000 to &pound;29.4 million in 2005-06. Funding for the Scottish Museums Council increased over the same period from &pound;1 million to &pound;2.8 million.</p>

  <p>A consultation exercise on the delivery of a Significance Recognition Scheme for Scotland&rsquo;s non-national museums and galleries ended in July. The consultation identified the mechanisms for delivering the scheme and acknowledged Scotland&rsquo;s important cultural heritage collections. The scheme will offer a strategic context for investment by national and local government, Lottery distributors and others. Further information on the Scheme is available on SMC&rsquo;s website: <a href="http://www.scottishmuseums.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.scottishmuseums.org.uk/</a>.</p>

  <p>Its implementation will be considered in the context of the Executive&rsquo;s overall response to the Cultural Commission&rsquo;s Report.</p>

  <p>I met COSLA to discuss the Cultural Commission&rsquo;s Report on Wednesday 17 August. In addition, the Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the national institutions and SMC on a wide range of issues, including funding for museums and galleries.</p>

  <p>The national strategy for sport in Scotland, which is owned by all the key agencies and partners in sport including the Scottish Executive, is set out in Sport 21 2003-07. Several of the targets contained in Sport 21 focus on developing participation in sport and we are committed to working with key partners and agencies in progressing their delivery. At community level the delivery of Sport 21 targets largely rests with local authorities in line with their statutory responsibilities. Sportscotland, the national agency for sport in Scotland, is working closely with local authorities to support the implementation of the strategies developed to support the delivery of these Sport 21 targets.</p>

  <p>All Scottish Executive funding for sport is channelled through <strong></strong> sportscotland, the national agency for sport in Scotland. Over the last five years, <strong></strong> sportscotland has invested exchequer and National Lottery funds as set out in the following table, to stimulate the development of sport in local communities. There are aspects of other <strong></strong> sportscotland programmes which support local initiatives. For example, sports governing body funding frequently includes an element for coaching but it is not possible to define the split between work at local or national levels.</p>

  <p>Note: *The Sports Facilities Programme was reviewed during 2003 and subsequently replaced by the Building for Sport Programme in May 2004. The decline in Lottery income resulted in a reduction in the number of awards, both in terms of the amount offered, and as a percentage of the total project cost. The Building for Sport Programme has two strands: community facilities and training and competition facilities.</p>

  <p>The School Sport Co-ordinator and Active Primary Schools programmes were incorporated into Active Schools in April 2004.</p>

  <p>Further details of each of these programmes can be obtained from <strong></strong>sportscotland&rsquo;s website or from <strong></strong>sportscotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has supported the development of a wide variety of local initiatives working with partners including Paths to Health, Jogscotland, SUSTRANS and YDance. Funding for these initiatives is summarised below:</p>

  <p>During the period 2000-05, the Scottish Executive has provided additional funding to local authorities. The &pound;95 million released in June 2002 as a result of a budget revision and End-Year Flexibility arrangements, was made available for work on two key areas:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Improving the quality of life for children and young people; in particular for making healthy choices an easier option by improving access to sport and leisure activities; and</p>
<p>For improving the local environment, with particular action on local streets and roads, on crime and community safety and on environmental improvements.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Further additional &quot;quality of life&quot; funding was announced in December 2002 which provided an additional &pound;180 million over three years.</p>

  <p>While each local authority has different needs and priorities it was open to them to use any of this additional funding for leisure and recreational purposes.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive further to the answer to question S2W-14229 by Nicol Stephen on 14 February 2005, when the findings of the feasibility study into the Glasgow Crossrail link, due to be published in mid-June 2005, will be published.</p>

  <p>Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) commissioned Scott Wilson railway consultants to undertake a feasibility study of Glasgow Crossrail. I understand that Scott Wilson have now reported their findings to SPT for consideration. The report will then require the approval of SPT before submission to the Scottish Executive.</p>
