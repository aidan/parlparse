  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-15864 by Peter Peacock on 1 June 2001, how many local authorities are undertaking a rolling programme of Best Value service reviews; which local authorities have developed Public Performance Reporting Frameworks; which local authorities are making information about performance available to those who are recognised stakeholders in their activities, and, for each local authority, who the recognised stakeholders are.</p>

  <p>All local authorities have voluntarily undertaken a rolling programme of Best Value reviews of all their services and will be or have already publicised the results of these reviews locally. In addition, from April 2000 all local authorities have developed their own Public Performance Reporting framework which makes information about performance available to those who are recognised stakeholders in local authority activities.</p>

  <p>Details of who each local authority consults with are not held centrally. However we do expect authorities to consult with all relevant stakeholders in their area. Who these stakeholders are is for the local authority to determine, although they would be expected to consider the views of all parties who are affected by their decisions.</p>

  <p>One of the core principles of Best Value is the requirement for local authorities to consult with stakeholders where appropriate. Indeed, the Best Value Task Force report, which set out how Best Value should be implemented in Scotland, stated that effective consultation is essential to the success of Best Value and that local authorities should ensure that all relevant stakeholders are consulted. This includes the voluntary sector where they make a significant contribution to service delivery or where they are one of the local authorities key partners.</p>

  <p>The Department for Education and Skills has introduced various routes into teacher education in England and Wales, including part-time courses. The introduction of such courses is aimed at dealing with acute teacher supply difficulties experienced there. The position in Scotland is rather different. The <i>Supply of Teachers</i> report, 2nd Edition - June 2001, details the background to the current position on teacher supply and outlines progress on planned improvements to teacher workforce planning practices. Copies of the report are in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (Bib. no. 14980) and it is on the Executive&#8217;s website.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-16892 on 10 August and that institutions are able to offer any course on a part-time basis provided it meets the requirements set out in the <i>Guidelines for Initial Teacher Education in Scotland</i> as in the answer to question S1W-16022 on 13 June 2001.</p>

  <p>Individualised Educational Programmes (IEP) and Records of Needs are separate planning documents to meet the needs of children with special educational needs (SEN).</p>

  <p>Where a child has a Record of Needs, it is expected that the Record will provide the strategic content from which an IEP can be prepared. The IEP outlines the more detailed steps to be taken to enable children with SEN to achieve specified targets. It underpins the day to day teaching and learning process by which a child&#8217;s special educational needs can be addressed.</p>

  <p>The Record of Needs is a legal document &#8211; the IEP is less formal. The current review <i>&quot;Assessing Our Children&#8217;s Educational Needs: The Way Forward&quot;</i> will look at the role of the Record of Needs and IEPs.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, chief executive of Historic Scotland to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland began monitoring the condition of all scheduled ancient monuments in 1986. A team of 11 part-time locally based staff visits these sites on a cyclical pattern and records their condition and the surrounding land use on a central database. Over 7,000 sites of national importance are currently monitored in this manner. There are no plans to extend monitoring to unscheduled archaeological sites.</p>

  <p>The Homelessness Task Force, which I chair, is considering, amongst other things, the need for improved housing provision, advice and support for the resettlement of people leaving institutions, including the armed forces. The task force has been collecting evidence on ways to improve assistance to vulnerable service personnel prior to discharge, at the point of discharge, and after discharge.</p>

  <p>There are no firm figures on the number of people with armed forces&#8217; experience who are presently homeless. There is however clear evidence that a significant proportion of homeless men have had a career in the services. In Scotland, the National Monitoring and Interim Evaluation study of the Rough Sleepers Initiative showed that 13% of people using RSI services had past experience of the armed forces. In England, it is estimated that between a fifth and a quarter of rough sleepers have been in the services at some point in their lives.</p>

  <p>Currently DD Circular 26/1993 provides guidance to local authorities on housing for people leaving the armed forces. This circular encourages local authorities to give fair and sympathetic consideration to applications for housing from ex-service personnel. (A copy of the circular has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre.) The <i>Code of Guidance on Homelessness</i> also identifies people recently discharged from institutions as potentially vulnerable, and therefore in priority need.</p>

  <p>The Homelessness Task Force is examining improvements in the definition of priority need categories including its extension to include vulnerable ex-service personnel. This would be in line with proposals in England.</p>

  <p>The task force will be setting out its key recommendations in its report at the end of this year. It will be seeking support from the Ministry of Defence, the Armed Forces and its Resettlement Services, and the ex-service benevolent sector<strong> </strong>for these recommendations.</p>

  <p>A young Scottish student starting a full-time course in Scotland from this month will have access to a total maintenance package of grant and loan worth &#163;4,315, where their family income is &#163;15,000 or below. Up to &#163;2,000 of this support will be payable as bursary. It may be supplemented in individual cases by supplementary grants and payments from Hardship Funds. In 1979, the full maintenance grant was &#163;1,100 or &#163;3,361 at current prices.</p>

  <p>The Performance and Innovation Unit review will consider how the regulatory and legal framework could better enable voluntary organisations to thrive and grow; encourage the development of new types of organisations where needed; and ensure public confidence. The review will therefore touch on both reserved and devolved matters. We have established contact with the review team and will consider any implications their findings may have for devolved matters in due course.</p>

  <p>Following adoption in 1999 of the National Waste Strategy: Scotland, 11 Area Waste Plans are being developed across Scotland to identify the best ways of dealing with waste and to identify the waste management facilities required.</p>

  <p>As with other development proposals, planning applications for waste incinerators will be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Although the National Waste Strategy and Area Waste Plan are not land use planning documents, they are material considerations that decision makers should take into account when making development control decisions or preparing their development plans.</p>

  <p>We will be publishing a Planning Advice Note on planning for waste management facilities by the end of this year. The PAN will both guide development plan policy formulation and inform development control decisions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has allocated &#163;50.4 million over three years (&#163;4.2 million in 2001-02, &#163;16 million and &#163;30.2 million) to the Strategic Waste Fund for local authorities to begin to implement the National Waste Strategy. The funds are available for authorities to implement their part of the Area Waste Plans (AWP) which are currently being prepared. No specific allocation of funds has been made yet in support of any specific AWP. To date, no applications for funding have been received from local authorities as the Area Waste Plans are not yet complete, although an initial &#163;3 million was distributed between all authorities in 2000-01 to assist with recycling and composting projects.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring that the Scottish water authorities meet statutory requirements. The authorities have achieved a very high level of compliance, and where problems remain, urgent action is being taken to address them.</p>

  <p>Achieving compliance is an on-going process. The water quality and standards process put in place by the Executive, in consultation with the Water Industry Commissioner, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Scottish water authorities, outlines the environment and drinking water standards (including UK and EU statutory requirements) the water authorities must meet and estimates the investment required to meet them.</p>

  <p><i>Water Quality and Standards, Investment Requirements for Scotland&#8217;s Water Authorities 2000-2002</i> (Q &amp; S 1) is available in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (Bib. no. 8483).</p>

  <p>A copy of the consultation paper on <i>Water Quality and Standards 2002-2006</i> is available in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (Bib. no. 14923). A copy of <i>Water Quality and Standards, Investment</i> <i>Requirements for Scotland&#8217;s Water Authorities 2002-2006</i> (Q &amp; S 2) will also be available shortly in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre.</p>
