  <p>The latest year for which we have complete information is 2004-05. Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) were launched across Scotland in August 2004 for eligible 16-year-olds. The national roll-out to all eligible 16 to 19-year-olds will be complete in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>The total number of students who received an EMA in 2004-05 was 23,650 &ndash; see the Statistical Publication Notice available from the internet at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/11/02112052/20531" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/11/02112052/20531</a>.</p>

  <p>The following table relates the 16-year-olds that receive EMA payments for attending either school or college to the total 16-year-old population in each area. Note that those not receiving EMA payments may no longer attend full-time education, may not have applied or may not be eligible on income grounds. As we do not have family income data for all young people in each area it is impossible to say what the take-up rate of EMAs is.</p>

  <p>Because of the complex nature of projects and the potential burden to business from collecting this information, fully comparable data on the outcomes of all the planned projects listed in answer to question S2W-23314 are not available.</p>

  <p>Every project receiving regional selective assistance (RSA) or other public sector grants is scrutinised to ensure that the agreed grant conditions are achieved. Typically these conditions involve meeting job number and capital investment targets. We retain the right to claw back grant if the conditions are not met.</p>

  <p>Directly monitoring all inward investments would be highly complex and burdensome to businesses. For example difficulties arise in attributing job creation to a particular project when companies undertake additional investments as part of their normal business cycle. In addition, the time taken for individual projects to achieve announced job numbers means that jobs created each calendar year will result from investments over a number of years.</p>

  <p>We are working to improve the statistics available on the contribution of overseas-owned companies to Scotland&rsquo;s economy. In 2005 the Executive published data for 2002, 2003 and 2004 showing overall employment levels and turnover in companies with overseas ownership.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that offers of funding made in each year could cover several subsequent years; that each grant is subject to conditions of funding typically involving job or investment targets, and that not all of the funding offered may eventually have been paid out. Out of the total &pound;19,735,000 in RSA funding offered to first-time foreign investors during the four years in question, &pound;8,527,969 has been paid to date.</p>

  <p>Monitoring of companies in receipt of funding from Scottish Enterprise is an operational matter for that organisation.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise advises that the information is not available in the form requested because each of the grants potentially available to foreign companies has different condition periods and records do not distinguish between support that companies receive to set up in Scotland and support for subsequent projects.</p>

  <p>However, all funding offered to foreign companies is subject to conditions, typically involving job targets or target investment levels over three to five years, and Scottish Enterprise reserves the right to claw back funding if these conditions are not met.</p>

  <p>The Commission has recently published a Communication on <em>Improving Consultation on EU Fisheries Management</em> . The document can be found here:</p>

  <p>Whilst the Commission does not recommend a change in the timing of the fishing year itself, it proposes a number of measures designed to achieve greater stakeholder engagement and earlier and fuller discussions of proposals.</p>

  <p>International quota swaps are a regular and important feature of the UK&rsquo;s quota management arrangements. To date this year, some 36 international swaps have been concluded, securing almost 13,000 tonnes of additional quota, including around 4,400 tonnes of North Sea haddock. The Executive will continue to pursue further opportunities as the year progresses where they are in the best interests of the Scottish industry.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the (a) mean and (b) median waiting times have been in respect of in-patient procedures for the 50 most common specialties in each year since 1997.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-06-27.23.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0627.htm#11">

  <p>The majority of patients who require in-patient and day case treatment are treated quickly. Nearly 53% of the patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals receive immediate treatment and never join a waiting list. Of those who do wait, over 40% are admitted within one months and over 70% within three months.</p>

  <p>The distribution of waiting times for in-patient discharges is highly positively skewed. The arithmetic mean is an inappropriate statistical measure for such distributions because a very small number of long waiting times can have a disproportionate effect on the mean waiting time.</p>

  <p>The median and mean are not targets for NHSScotland; they are only summary measures for patients who waited for treatment. Reducing maximum waiting times is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s priority for NHSScotland. The current national maximum waiting time for in-patient and day case treatment is six months. This will be reduced to 18 weeks by the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland is making good progress towards meeting the next key target of a maximum wait of 18 weeks by the end of 2007. At that point, a new approach to defining and measuring waiting will also be introduced to replace availability status codes (ASCs), which have the effect at present of excluding patients from waiting times guarantees where for example, they are medically unfit for treatment, where they have asked for their treatment to be postponed, or where their treatment is highly specialised or of low clinical priority. The new approach will be fairer, more consistent and more transparent.</p>

  <p>Retrospective analyses of waiting times for hospital treatment compiled from SMR01 returns are based on data that does not record whether patients have had an ASC applied. The information requested has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39918) and it includes the waiting times of patients who have been exempted from waiting times guarantees for the reasons given above and therefore overstates true waiting times. It is not possible to estimate the extent of the overstatement.</p>

  <p>We are consulting on changes that might be made to the Renewables Obligation Scotland (ROS) in order to provide a source of long-term, increased funding to wave and tidal energy generators. We want Scotland to be the centre for marine energy research, development and manufacturing. Changes to the ROS should help ensure this happens.</p>

  <p>We have also allocated &pound;8 million for marine energy development to be spent over the next two years. This money will be made available to develop the correct infrastructure, environmental understanding and marine technology to help get projects in the water around our coast.</p>

  <p>In partnership with our enterprise agencies we have provided around &pound;6.6 million to the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC). This includes over &pound;3 million to set up wave and tidal test facilities at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC). These facilities have already been used to help develop Ocean Power Delivery&rsquo;s Pelamis device. We have also provided &pound;650,000 to help prepare EMEC for the arrival of Scottish and Southern Energy&rsquo;s Neptune tidal device and recently agreed to award &pound;136,500 for EMEC to develop internationally recognised standards and certification for the marine energy industry. We will continue to make investments in EMEC over the coming years.</p>

  <p>Scottish wave and tidal developers are also eligible to apply for funding from the DTI&rsquo;s Marine Renewables Deployment Fund.</p>

  <p>We remain committed to supporting this important sector and will continue to examine and consider further means of accelerating its development in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s Flag Flying Guidelines were first issued in June 2001, following consultations with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (who were responsible, pre-devolution, for guidance on flags). In October 2005, the Executive&rsquo;s Flag Flying Guidelines were amended to state that the St Andrew&rsquo;s flag should be flown every day. A copy of the Executive&rsquo;s current Flag Flying Guidelines has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39896).</p>

  <p>Note: 1. Borrowers in arrears with no repayment schedule include those with a very small balance remaining, and those subject to litigation. In both cases the borrower is required to repay the whole amount outstanding.</p>

  <p>This level of detail is not available for earlier years. However, the second table shows borrowers with publicly-owned mortgage-style loans in arrears by whether they are less than two months in arrears or more than two months in arrears at the end of financial years 2001-02 to 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Note: 1. Includes borrowers in arrears with no repayment schedule.</p>

  <p>Comparable information is not available before 2001-02. Income-contingent loans were introduced in 1998. Most income-contingent loan repayments are collected by employers through the tax system and current policy ensures that deductions keep pace with earnings so borrowers do not become overdue on their accounts.</p>
