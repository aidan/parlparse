  <p>The Government set up a Disability Rights Task Force in 1997 to report on how to secure comprehensive and enforceable civil rights for disabled people. Their report is expected later this year. One of their early recommendations was to set up a Disability Rights Commission to work towards the elimination of discrimination against disabled people, promote equality of opportunity and good practice, and to advise the Government on the operation of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The proposal is for a Commission for Great Britain with an office in Scotland. A Bill is presently before Parliament at Westminster.</p>

  <p>The EU funded School Milk Scheme has been in operation since 1977.

  <p>I have already held discussions with a number of business leaders and they are generally supportive of the current structure and activities of the two agencies. Both organisations have strategies which contain clear commitments to assisting new and growing businesses, which may include co-operative ventures, and I intend to work closely with them to ensure that they deliver on our commitment to bring together the promotion of enterprise and lifelong learning.</p>

For example, the Scottish Partnership on Domestic Violence is developing a strategy on domestic violence; the MacLean Committee is reviewing the sentencing and treatment of serious sexual and violent offenders, who may have personality disorders; and an expert panel chaired by Lady Cosgrove is looking at sex offending and supervision in the community.</p>
