  <p>There has been regular contact between the Scottish Executive and the National Disability Council (NDC) since July 1999. We look forward to working with the new GB-wide Disability Rights Commission (DRC) which will formally replace the NDC on 25 April 2000.</p>

  <p>I met with Bert Massie, Chair of the DRC, and with DRC officials when they were in Edinburgh recently to give evidence to the Parliament&#8217;s Equal Opportunities Committee.

  <p>The UK Government has already announced its intention to legislate to implement the task force&#8217;s recommendations on education. A consultation paper on the measures to be included in the legislation was issued by the Department for Education and Employment on 17 March.</p>

  <p>The Executive intends to publish its response to the Disability Rights Task Force report in the summer. To inform the ongoing cross-departmental consideration of the recommendations the Executive will shortly be inviting comments from a broad range of organisations based in Scotland on how to take forward the recommendations in devolved areas.</p>

  <p>A number of the recommendations are specifically directed at the Disability Rights Commission (DRC). The Executive will look to work closely with the new Commission, as they take forward consideration of those aspects of the report, to ensure that account is taken of Scottish circumstances.</p>

  <p>Decisions on whether to proceed in Scotland by way of legislation or otherwise would take account of the responses to the consultation as well as consideration of the package proposed by the UK Government and the DRC.</p>

  <p>A fact-finding exercise into specific aspects of this issue has been underway for some months now. I met with the Haemophilia Society in September 1999 to discuss their concerns first hand and thereafter tasked my officials with ascertaining the facts surrounding the heat treatment of blood products for haemophiliacs in the mid-1980s. This will assess whether haemophilia patients in Scotland were exposed to the risks of the hepatitis C virus through blood products longer than they should have been, given the state of knowledge at the time. The outcome of this investigation will allow me to decide whether any further action is warranted.</p>

  <p>The Haemophilia Society, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and the Scottish Haemophilia Directors have all been asked to provide information. My officials are currently analysing the information gathered. This is a complex area and it would be premature to comment on possible outcomes until all the facts have been properly examined. I have undertaken to make the findings available to the Health and Community Care Committee and to the public.</p>

  <p>In line with the recommendations of the McIntosh Commission on Local Government and the Scottish Parliament, the modernisation of council decision-making structures and policy development processes is being taken forward by an independent panel &#8211; the Leadership Advisory Panel chaired by Alastair McNish. The panel has been tasked with advising councils on the development of their plans for modernisation over the course of this year, and then reporting to us on councils&#8217; change plans by the year&#8217;s end.</p>

  <p>During this period it will be for the panel to identify any blockages preventing modernisation and to do what they can to help councils overcome these hindrances. If they cannot be resolved satisfactorily the panel will ultimately report on them to us when they make their assessment at the end of this year. It will then be for us to consider how any blockages, such as exist, should be addressed.</p>

  <p>Management and operational practices may also be a barrier to modernisation in terms of service delivery. A new commitment to continuous improvement in local government has been taken forward on a voluntary basis so far in Scotland under the guidance of the Best Value Task Force. This involved a partnership between the Executive, CoSLA and its members, and the Accounts Commission. The task force&#8217;s final report was published in December 1999 and recommended that some legislative amendments were needed to remove barriers to the full development of best value. Scottish ministers are currently considering the final report and how best to fulfil their commitment to deliver best value in local government.</p>

  <p>These figures are derived from GAE allocated to each force and divided by the estimated population of each area as at 30 June 1997 for 1997-98 and 30 June 1998 for 1998-99 and 1999-2000. The population figures for June 1999 are not yet available. As authorities may set budgets above or below GAE levels, actual expenditure may be different from the GAE allocation to individual forces. The 1997-98 figure for Lothian and Borders includes an additional amount of &pound;4.8 million allocated to assist the force in policing the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting which was held in Edinburgh in 1997.</p>

  <p>Eligible expenditure attracts police grant of 51% up to a cash limit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s indicators for measuring the effectiveness of action tackling poverty were set out in <i>Social Justice: A Scotland where everyone matters</i> , published on 22 November 1999, and the companion technical document. The Scottish Executive will report on these annually.</p>

  <p>In addition, assessments of deprivation are carried out for specific purposes, including the allocation of local authority grants. The indicators of deprivation used within the grant distribution system are described in detail in the annual Grant Aided Expenditure 2000 <i>Green Book</i>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Office Central Research Unit published a revised index of deprivation in 1998, combining 1991 census indicators with more recent non-census indicators of deprivation to provide a picture of deprivation in Scotland. The revised area deprivation index was applied at postcode sector level and ranks postcode sectors according to the index.</p>

  <p>Copies of all these documents are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The right to buy legislation restricts the discount available to those who have exercised the right to buy on more that one occasion. This means that any discount a tenant has received on the first sale would be deducted from any discount they would be entitled if they applied to buy another house.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware that subsidence has occurred recently. It is for Midlothian Council, who now have the benefit of deemed planning permission for their proposals, to decide whether to proceed with the development. There are no powers under planning legislation to hold an inquiry into a particular application after planning permission has been granted for that application. It would be open to the council, however, to consider whether they wished to hold an inquiry under any other powers which might be available to them.</p>
