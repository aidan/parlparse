  <p>East Ayrshire Council installed central heating in 133 dwellings in 2001-02, and expect to install it in 80 dwellings in 2002-03 and 203 dwellings in 2003-04. South Lanarkshire Council installed central heating in 863 dwellings in 2001-02, and expect to install it in 1,094 dwellings in 2002-03 and 1,100 dwellings in 2003-04. All council houses in these areas should have central heating by 31 March 2004. North Lanarkshire does not take part in the Central Heating Installation Programme; all its stock having central heating.</p>

  <p>Eaga are responsible for delivering the Central Heating Installation Programme to owner-occupiers and private renters. They collect data by main postcode area. That data shows that 195 private dwellings in the KA postcode area had central heating installed in the period from October 2000 to 31 January 2001. One hundred and thirteen private dwellings in the ML postcode area had central heating installed in the same period. There is no estimate of the number of private householders in these areas who will benefit during the remainder of the programme, but Eaga will make every effort to ensure that everyone who is eligible is made aware of the programme and encouraged to apply.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-03-31.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80167" speakername="Iain Gray" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0331.htm#3">

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working closely with the Ayrshire Economic Forum to ensure that through investing in jobs and skills, and encouraging the growth of new businesses, we create sustainable economic growth and employment opportunities.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the particular economic problems of North Ayrshire, I announced last week an allocation of an extra &#163;1.2 million to North Ayrshire Council for strategic local transport infrastructure projects.</p>

  <p>The Ayrshire Strategy for Jobs is a five-year strategy designed to create a more diverse economic base, to facilitate the acquisition of new skills, to enhance Ayrshire's competitiveness as a business location and to address problems of economic exclusion. The New Deal has helped nearly 3,000 people in North Ayrshire enter employment and there are special initiatives for those clients who face particular difficulties.</p>

  <p>The Executive-funded Training for Work (TfW) programme is also available to unemployed adults on a voluntary basis and, in 2002-03 aims to offer 500 work-related training opportunities to clients in Ayrshire. In February, there were 221 trainees on TfW from North Ayrshire. Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire also provides training via programmes such as Skillseekers, the Individual Employment Fund and the Employment Initiative for SIP Areas.</p>

  <p>North Ayrshire has benefited directly from &#163;775,358 from the European Regional Development Fund and &#163;1,412,367 from the European Social Fund from the Objective 2 Programme 2000-06. These projects should cater for some 1,280 trainees. Under the Objective 3 Programme 2000-06 more than &#163;14 million has been awarded to projects operating in North Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>Since July 1999, 39 projects from companies in North Ayrshire, creating and safeguarding jobs in the area, have benefited from over &#163;13 million in Regional Selective Assistance.</p>

  <p>Through the Better Neighbourhoods Services Fund (BNSF) the Scottish Executive is providing &#163;6.75 million over three years (2001-04) to improve services in the Vineburgh/Redburn and Ardeer areas of North Ayrshire, including a Jobs Access Fund, guidance and training to help people improve their employability, and an Intermediate Labour Market (ILM) programme.</p>

  <p>The claimant count unemployment rate between February 1999 and February 2003 for Scotland reduced by 1.5 percentage points, as against 1.3 percentage points for North Ayrshire, however claimant count unemployment rates have fallen in 26 out of the 30 wards in North Ayrshire. Furthermore, the gap between the average claimant count unemployment rate for Scotland and the average for the worst four wards in North Ayrshire has decreased by 0.5 percentage points.</p>

  <p>Average earnings in North Ayrshire have increased by 5.1% between 1999 and 2002 and the number of employee jobs in North Ayrshire has increased by 11% between 1999 and 2001, compared with 6.5% in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Overall attainment levels in publicly-funded schools have remained fairly steady since July 1999, although the percentage of the S4 roll who attained five or more standard grades (or equivalent) has increased from 91% to 93% in 2002 in North Ayrshire (whilst the national average has remained at a constant 91%).</p>

  <p>I have now announced that, working in partnership with our colleagues in the Treasury, we have agreed that the same financial arrangements for debt write-off which apply to whole-stock transfers should also apply to partial stock transfers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>This means that partial transfers are now on the table as another option available to local authorities in addition to whole-stock transfer and retention using the new financial flexibility that the Prudential Regime will offer. The onus is now on local authorities to use these funding options to deliver for their tenants the new Scottish Standard for Social Housing.</p>

  <p>Rules will govern how partial transfers to community ownership will in practice operate: primarily we will need to see that any partial transfer proposal is part of a wider strategy to ensure that all of an authority&#8217;s housing stock is brought up to the new Scottish Social Housing Standard</p>

  <p>The policy of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is to prosecute all such cases where there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to do so. This policy has not changed since 1997.</p>

  <p>Information from the Crown Office information system shows that in the year April 2001 to March 2002, out of a total of 9,130 cases of drunk driving that were reported to the procurator fiscal, 97.5% were prosecuted. A decision not to prosecute was only taken in 1.4% of reported cases. Due to upgrading work being done to the computer system within the Glasgow office, these statistics do not include data in relation to the Glasgow area. However, I am satisfied that these figures clearly demonstrate that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service deals with drink driving cases robustly.</p>

  <p>These figures are a better indication of the number of prosecutions of drink driving cases than statistics of court proceedings, which are not directly comparable with recorded crime statistics.</p>

  <p>The responsibilities for programme management and reporting within the Construction Management procurement route rest with the Construction Manager (Bovis Lend Lease). The Construction Manager provides fortnightly programme updates at a strategic level to the Holyrood Progress Group. These reports incorporate the programme implications of onsite progress and delays for all trade packages together with their respective tasks within the detailed construction programmes. This amounts to many thousands of individual tasks and associated milestones with resource management techniques being applied by the trade contractor and the Construction Manager on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer under what conditions, and on whose authority, the project plan for the Holyrood project is revised and on what three most recent dates amendments to the plan were made.</p>

  <p>The project plan provides the general basis for managing the project and sets out the various roles and responsibilities of the parties involved. The plan also incorporates change control procedures, which are rigorously adhered to. Following reviews of the project plan, there has been little need to introduce amendments mainly due to the fixed requirements of contracts with the consultants involved. The most recent amendments have incorporated changes to internal Project Team personnel and have been authorised by the Project Director.</p>

  <p>There are no arrangements for peer review within the Parliament, outwith the usual management responsibilities. The project has been audited on a regular basis, both internally and externally and the Spencely review in spring 2000 provided a thorough and helpful external peer review of the project.</p>
