  <p>The Interim Route Development Fund (IRDF) can invest in new direct air routes which improve business connectivity, enhance inward investment prospects and encourage in-bound tourism. All new routes, on which offers of investment have been made, have been evaluated as having satisfied one or more of these objectives.

  <p>The following table contains information regarding funding the Scottish Executive has allocated specifically to support and promote breastfeeding in each year since May 1999, expressed also as a percentage of the total health budget in each year.</p>

  <p>This table only contains information about funding specifically and solely for breastfeeding support and promotion. The Scottish Executive also fund initiatives where breastfeeding support and promotion forms part of a larger project, including the Starting Well Demonstration Project and the Scottish Healthy Choice Awards.</p>

  <p>It is also important to note that no specific funding has been allocated to NHS boards to support breastfeeding. NHS boards are given an annual unified budget to meet the health care needs of their resident populations. It is for boards to determine, within the funds available, how to manage and deliver local health care services to meet these needs taking account of national and local priorities.</p>

  <p>No specific funding has been allocated to NHS boards to support breastfeeding. NHS boards are given an annual unified budget to meet the health care needs of their resident populations. It is for boards to determine, within the funds available, how to manage and deliver local health care services to meet these needs taking account of national and local priorities.</p>

  <p>I also refer the member to the answer given to question S2W-5498 on 26 January 2004 for further information about breastfeeding funding. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>Caledonian MacBrayne's need for additional or replacement vessels is kept under review and there are regular discussions with the company on such matters. We recently announced plans to make funding available to the company for a new &pound;8.75 million sheltered water vessel for the Wemyss Bay-Rothesay route. We are also in discussion with the company about its longer term investment proposals.</p>

  <p>The process of ordering vessels must be conducted in accordance with EU public procurement procedures. Caledonian MacBrayne has considerable experience in following these procedures.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Information is not kept in the form requested. For the private sector the information is held by postcode area and in the PA postcode area 1,367 systems have been installed to date. The total Scotland figure for all sectors is 28,672 to date. The average waiting time in the private sector is five months, but average waiting times in the public sector are not available. However, all council housing without a central heating systems are due to have one installed by April 2004 if the tenant wants it and RSLs are due to complete their programme by December 2004.</p>

  <p>Until recently the Executive was represented on the Crown Estate's Fish Farming Research Committee (CEFFRC). The Committee enabled stakeholders to direct available funds to aquaculture research. The CEFFRC has since been superseded by the Scottish Aquaculture Research Forum, which will be formally established shortly.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available.</p>

  <p>The terms of service for general practitioners are set out in regulations. These require that a general practitioner does not have a patient list which exceeds 3,500. If that number is reached the general practitioner should accept no more applications from patients to join the list and the NHS board should not place with the general practitioner any of the patients which it is obliged to assign to a doctor. On occasion general practitioners inform the board that for various reasons, such as when a partner is on long term study leave, they do not wish additional patients for the time being and are not granting applications from patients. If it is necessary for the board to choose such a general practitioner when making a patient assignment, however, the general practitioner would be obliged to accept the patient if the list size had not reached the maximum.</p>

  <p>We see the management of tenancy deposits as an integral part of good management and so do not at present have proposals to establish a separate system for controlling the management of deposits.</p>

  <p>We are committed to encouraging high standards of management in the private rented sector. The work done so far to take forward the partnership agreement commitment to develop core standards for voluntary accreditation schemes has included the issue of tenancy deposits and their return. The Housing Improvement Task Force has recommended strengthened powers of regulation to complement the voluntary route of accreditation and, as I said on 16 December when I announced by response to the task force proposals, we will explore the possibility of a national registration scheme for all private landlords.</p>

  <p>No decision has yet been taken on where the third phase of the Sustainable Scottish Marine Environment Initiative (SSMEI) will be piloted.

The pilot management schemes will be aimed at testing the effectiveness of differing alternative approaches to the sustainable development of Scotland's marine environment.</p>

  <p>However, the locational issues for aquaculture developments are being addressed through the location/re-location working group, which is developing criteria to assess whether existing farms are poorly located and to consult, in due course, with industry and other stakeholders on their proposals.</p>

  <p>Limited information on leavers and joiners is available by comparing staff in post on each census date. Staff who appear in one census but not the next are presumed to have left. However if an employee joins and leaves NHSScotland between census points, they will not be included. As such any figures shown may underestimate the total number of leavers.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the number of consultants leaving NHS Argyll and Clyde in each of the last five years by reason for leaving; Table 2 shows the number of nursing and midwifery staff; Table 3 shows the number of allied health professionals (AHP) leaving NHS Argyll and Clyde in each of the last five years by qualification status.</p>

  <p>We are committed to improving patient services by supporting new ways of working that reflect best practice and offer innovative solutions to workforce issues including reducing the reliance on agency staff.</p>

  <p>NHS employers have been asked to implement the recommendations made in the Audit Scotland Report Temporary Measures (2000) and Planning Ward Nursing-Legacy or Design (2002) on the use of bank and agency nurses. NHSTayside has shown the way by reducing total nurse bank and agency hours by over 60% in the period April 2001-December 2003.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to implementing nationally co-ordinated nurse bank arrangements to improve patient services and reduce expenditure on agency nursing. A project is currently underway to develop and cost options for delivering on this commitment and will report in May 2004.</p>

  <p>Officials have monitored the development and implementation of NHS LIFT over the past three years. Neither Scottish Ministers nor bodies appointed by them currently have the statutory powers to form or participate in forming companies for the provision of health services.</p>

  <p>A report by the Short Life Working Group on Joint Premises Development, which included representatives from the Scottish Executive, NHSScotland and COSLA, was issued on 10 July 2003. The report recommended that statutory powers should be sought to allow the forming of joint ventures and that any proposals would be subject to further consultation. The report specifically recommended that any resulting consultation would include specific consideration of the NHS LIFT model and its possible application in Scotland. This matter is currently being assessed.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services has operated a free phone fraud hotline since January 2001. Originally aimed at uncovering fraud by patients and family health service practitioners, the hotline may now be used by anyone within or outwith the NHS, including members of the general public who wishes to report anonymously any incident of potential fraud or other irregularities in or against NHSScotland. The existence of this number and the fact that calls may be made anonymously are featured in all publicity campaigns and material by NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services, together with a message of encouragement to make use of the free phone number, rather than turning a blind eye to NHS fraud. The NHSScotland website which went live during 2002-03 as part of the Scottish Health on the Web website, also allows confidential reporting of potential NHS fraud online by anyone who accesses the website.</p>

  <p>Partnership Information Guideline entitled <em>Dealing with Employee Concerns</em> was issued to NHSScotland employers in January 2002. This includes a freedom of speech policy and provides employees with a range of options through which they can raise any concerns they may have in the widest sense.</p>

  <p>In the wider context, the Scottish Executive is committed to taking all practicable steps to prevent and detect fraud across the public sector and has a range of measures already in place which are aimed highlighting fraudulent activity. Within the Executive these measures include the identification of an initial contact point, the fraud response co-ordinator; to receive information about suspected frauds, either by telephone (using a fraud hot-line) or in writing, from individual members of staff, who may wish to remain anonymous. The Executive also requires public bodies to have in place fraud response arrangements appropriate to their own circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that public transport is accessible to people with disabilities. Under the partnership agreement the Executive is committed to assessing improved public transport concessions for disabled people.</p>

  <p>The assessment will, among other things, look at the barriers to accessible transport for disabled people, enhanced concessionary fares and options for door to door travel. To achieve this we will work with public transport providers, the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland, voluntary and other interested bodies. We are about to commence a public consultation on how best to take forward the assessment and extending the concessionary bus fare scheme to a national off-peak scheme for older and disabled people.</p>

  <p>Ministers have also approved a &pound;0.5 million per annum budget to pilot rural demand responsive transport between 2004-06 and a further &pound;0.5 million per annum to pilot urban community transport/demand responsive transport over the same period.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not issued guidance on this particular aspect of neighbour notification. However, where a planning authority deems that an alteration to the approved proposals represents a material change, then they should request the submission of a new planning application.

  <p>Deaths and serious injuries on Scotland's roads fell by 9.6% between 2000 and 2002. In 2000 3,893 people were killed or seriously injured, in 2001 3,755 and in 2002 3,518, so at the end of the three year period there were 375 fewer fatal or serious casualties than at the beginning. These reductions in road accidents and casualties reflect the impact of a range of road safety measures, such as action to address driving with excessive speed or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including advertising.</p>

  <p>More must be done. We will continue to increase our efforts to improve road safety, but this evidence suggests that the combination of measures is having a significant impact in helping to cut deaths and serious injuries on Scotland's roads. It is not possible to definitely attribute the improvement in deaths and injuries to any individual measure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued revised guidance to education authorities on school transport issues in August 2003. Circular 7/2003, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 29135), reminds them of their duty of care for the safety of pupils, including pupils using school transport, and makes it clear that all statutory requirements must be complied with.</p>

  <p>The guidance sets out the legal requirements with regard to the fitting of seat belts in vehicles used to transport children on organised school trips, including home to school transport. It also encourages local authorities to consider how best to ensure that children use seat belts, where these are provided.</p>

  <p>The Executive is addressing road safety through a combination of engineering, enforcement and education.</p>

  <p>The Executive has set targets for a 40% reduction in the number of people killed and seriously injured in road accidents and a 50% reduction in those figures for children by 2010, compared with the average for the years 1994-98. Good progress has been made. By 2002 the number of deaths and serious casualties was 27% below, and the number of child deaths and serious casualties was 38% below the baseline.</p>

  <p>The Executive provides funding to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign for the development of key road safety education initiatives and publicity messages. The campaign has produced a range of educational resources, many aimed at children, and has mounted effective publicity campaigns, focussing on drink and drug driving, speeding, seat belt use and young driver safety.</p>

  <p>The Executive funds free membership of the Children's Traffic Club in Scotland, which offers road safety training to all three and four year old children in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive is providing funding for local authorities, totalling up to &pound;27 million between 2003 and 2006, for the introduction of 20 mph speed limits outside schools and related safety projects.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also providing funding totalling &pound;1,080,000 over five years for pilot child pedestrian training schemes. Twelve selected local authorities are receiving funding to enable them to set up and run schemes to train five and six year old children in pedestrian skills.</p>

  <p>The Executive is providing local authorities with dedicated funding of nearly &pound;38 million for cycling, walking and safer streets projects over the period 2000-06.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also funding school travel co-ordinator posts within all Scottish local authorities.</p>

  <p>The capital funding being made available by the Executive to local authorities for the introduction of 20 mph speed limits around schools can also be used for safer routes to school projects and the development of home zones. A wide range of measures can be implemented under safer routes to school schemes, including crossings for pedestrians and cyclists, the provision of footways and cycle-ways, and traffic free entrances to schools. This specific additional funding does not cover the gritting of roads.</p>

  <p>Non-trunk roads are the responsibility of the local authorities concerned, and their funding forms part of the general local government finance settlement. It is entirely a matter for individual authorities to decide what priority should be given to the maintenance and improvement, including gritting, of each road for which they are responsible.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the Stats 19 statistical report format. These returns cover only accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>The table gives the numbers of injury road accidents which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on the B822 between the point where that road crosses the Gonachan Burn and the point where it crosses the East Dunbartonshire Local Authority boundary, north of Lennoxtown, in the years 1993 to 2002 inclusive.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given in the table are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at a local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in the process of preparing revised guidance to help local authorities to prepare local transport strategies which the Scottish Executive would expect to address issues of accessibility. Local transport strategies are produced voluntarily by local authorities. However, the Scottish Executive strongly recommends that local authorities produce local transport strategies in accordance with guidance issued under the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>

  <p>The Department for Transport has published a guide, <em>Inclusive Mobility &#8211; A guide to best practice on Access to Pedestrian and Transport Infrastructure</em>, which is available to all local authorities and will be recommended in the local transport strategy guidance.</p>

  <p>Under the provisions of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, it is for individual licensing authorities to determine the requirements for taxi testing and inspection for vehicles operating in their area, including where the necessary test certificate can be obtained from. Information is not available centrally on the number of MOT testing centres authorised by individual authorities to provide such services.</p>

  <p>The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 provides for the introduction of taxi accessibility regulations containing the minimum specification requirements for such vehicles. Such matters are reserved to the Westminster Parliament, although their application in Scotland is executively devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Until such time as the regulations are introduced, and their application in Scotland determined, licensing authorities, under the provisions of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, have discretion as to the type, size and design of taxi that may operate in their area, including whether they must be wheelchair accessible. While at present there is no statutory duty on licensing authorities to require taxis to be wheelchair accessible, the Scottish Executive have encouraged licensing authorities to use their discretionary powers to improve the availability of taxis to people with disabilities.</p>
