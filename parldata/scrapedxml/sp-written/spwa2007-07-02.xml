  <p>The Scottish Executive published <em>Review of Access Criteria for Infertility Services in Scotland</em> in March 2007 to inform boards of recommended changes to be made to the access criteria to funded infertility services.</p>

  <p>Guidelines for access to IVF treatments were developed by the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland (EAGISS) in 2000. The Scottish Government has asked NHS boards and trusts to work towards full implementation of the EAGISS guidelines. It is up to each individual NHS board in Scotland to follow and apply the guidance and we will monitor the implementation of the EAGISS guidelines to ensure consistency of approach.</p>

  <p>Health boards have taken different approaches to the assimilation of staff to the new Agenda for Change pay bands and the subsequent assessment and payment of any arrears of pay that are due. While in general terms the health boards are nearing completion of the process, they are at different stages. We are therefore unable to assess on a pan Scotland basis the level of payments still to be made to staff.</p>

  <p>None. The Scottish Executive has made a commitment that no member of NHS staff will receive a reduction in salary as a result of the implementation of Agenda for Change.</p>
