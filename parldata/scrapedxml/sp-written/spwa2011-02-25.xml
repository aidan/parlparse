  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what (a) agencies, (b) organisations and (c) public bodies and services it has provided with Saltire flags for purposes other than celebrating St Andrew&rsquo;s day in each of the last four years and what was the total cost was.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-02-25.S3W-39237.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80330" speakername="Fiona Hyslop" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0225.htm#1">

  <p>The Saltire is Scotland&rsquo;s national flag and dates back to the 12th century. It is one of the most recognisable symbols of Scotland and encourages a sense of pride amongst Scots. Therefore it is natural that the Scottish Government uses it for promotional purposes at large scale national and international events, such as St Andrew&rsquo;s Day, Scotland Week and Burns Night. The use of Saltire flags at St Andrew&rsquo;s Day celebrations started under the previous administration.</p>

  <p>In line with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s guidance on public procurement, securing value for money is crucial to the wider objective of delivering high quality, cost-effective public services. The Scottish Government procured Saltire flags in bulk in order to secure the best value for money and keep costs lower.</p>

  <p>The cost of purchasing Saltire flags in the last four years is provided in the following table. 2006-07 figures are included for reference.</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="47%" valign="top">2006-07</td>
<td width="53%" align="right" valign="top">&pound;132,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="47%" valign="top">2007-08</td>
<td width="53%" align="right" valign="top">&pound;173,750</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="47%" valign="top">2008-09</td>
<td width="53%" align="right" valign="top">&pound;89,600</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="47%" valign="top">2009-10</td>
<td width="53%" align="right" valign="top">&pound;52,200 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="47%" valign="top">2010-11</td>
<td width="53%" align="right" valign="top">&pound;0*</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>Note: *There were no Saltire Flags purchased in 2010-11. Surplus stock from the previous year was used.</p>

  <p>The average annual expenditure (&pound;78,888) on promotional flags as described in the table is lower than that spent by the previous administration, which spent &pound;132,000 in financial year 2006-07.</p>

  <p>These flags are distributed as and when required at events in Scotland and overseas, including our annual St Andrews Day celebrations. To breakdown the agencies, organisations, public bodies and services provided with Saltire flags and occasions when they have been used for purposes other than celebrating St Andrews Day is unavailable because this could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>Our funding for the Scottish Book Trust is currently focused on the Early Years Bookgifting Programme which provides books for all our young children. We have no plans to extend this universal approach to pupils in other school years.</p>

  <p>We are aware, however that the Early Years Bookgifting Programme is linked into the Trust&rsquo;s wider children&rsquo;s programme, so that a real continuity of impact and benefit to children can be achieved.</p>

  <p>Currently, farmers and crofters can claim support for the provision of shelters for stock in such areas which makes them less accessible to bird predators, for example, through the &quot;Restructuring Agricultural Businesses&quot; Option under Rural Priorities.</p>

  <p>A number of other deterrents like flying kites, scarecrows, flickering tapes etc can be used but all of these need backed up by a regular presence of people and physical scaring. In areas where these methods aren&rsquo;t working or where they are impractical, there is recourse to using legal methods to minimise serious damage for those species of predator which can be legally controlled.</p>

  <p>The legislation that protects all wild birds, including sea eagles and ravens, as well as badgers already contains provisions to allow licences to be issued to control these species for the purpose of preventing serious damage to livestock.</p>

  <p>General licence No.2/2010, issued by the Scottish Government, authorises any person to kill or take certain species of wild birds in accordance with specific conditions for the purpose of the prevention of serious damage to livestock.</p>

  <p>For those species not covered by General licence No.2/2010, individual licences may be sought from the Scottish Government to kill or take any wild bird species, or badgers, for the same purpose. In considering any such licence application the Scottish Government would have to be satisfied that a licence was necessary to prevent serious damage and that there was no satisfactory alternative. Consideration would also be given to the impact of the licence on the conservation status of the species for which control is sought.</p>

  <p>Foxes may be controlled under the existing legislation without the need for a licence providing that permission has been granted from the landowner and subject to meeting the relevant animal welfare requirements and firearms provisions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive for what reason it continues to support the reintroduction of sea eagles given that evidence has suggested that limited supplies of live or fresh prey in Scotland have been a factor in the reduction of the breeding performance of golden eagles.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-02-25.S3W-39264.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80301" speakername="Roseanna Cunningham" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0225.htm#8">

  <p>The sea eagle was driven to extinction by human persecution over 90 years ago. It is one of our most spectacular native birds and the reintroduction programme is a mechanism to allow population recovery. The sea eagle is one of 32 species within Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s Species Action Framework endorsed by the Scottish Government and other government agencies.</p>

  <p>There are differences in territory selection between golden eagles and sea eagles in Scotland. Sea eagles generally nest at lower levels than golden eagles and prefer to nest in trees where they are available and close to the coast or lochs. Sea eagles also eat a broader diet with a higher proportion of sea birds and water birds as well as fish, whereas golden eagles eat a higher proportion of terrestrial species such as rabbits and hares.</p>

  <p>In the areas of western Scotland where both species occur the sea eagle population continues to increase whilst there have been some local increases in golden eagle numbers over the same time period. This means that neither food supplies, available nest sites or competition between the species is significantly impacting on either population, therefore there is no reason for the Scottish Government to withdraw its support for the reintroduction of sea eagles to Scotland in line with its biodiversity targets.</p>

  <p>The document <em>A Policy for Sika Deer in Scotland</em> was led by the then Deer Commission for Scotland and was developed and agreed by a Sika working group (staff from the Deer Commission for Scotland, the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage). It was published by the Stationery Office in 1997.</p>

  <p>The 1997 policy document has now been superseded by the Scottish Government's strategy for wild deer: <em>Scotland's Wild Deer: A National Approach.</em> Development of the strategy was led by the then Deer Commission for Scotland and aided by a steering group (Deer Commission for Scotland, Forestry Commission Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Rural Directorate of the Scottish Government) and an advisory group (representatives from organisations with an interest in deer management). It was also informed by a public consultation, a strategic environmental assessment and a socio-economic assessment. It was published in 2008.</p>
