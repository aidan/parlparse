  <p>Scottish Executive funding for Scottish Development International is allocated in a block grant via Scottish Enterprise and there is no specific allocation made for any individual industry sector. Therefore data is not available centrally on the breakdown of resources used by SDI for the promotion of the Scottish music industry.</p>

  <p>SDI delivers an on-going programme of activities responding to the international business needs of companies in the Scottish music industry and the creative industries more generally. This has included supporting Scottish attendance at international music conferences and festivals together with producing promotional materials for use in overseas markets. This support is co-ordinated with the activities of the Scottish Arts Council and Enterprise networks.</p>

  <p>In addition, companies in the Scottish music industry can access the full range of advice, assistance and funding SDI offers to all Scottish companies looking to enter international markets.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive believes that future structural funds should be focused primarily on the poorer member states.

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows.</p>

  <p>The Performance Standards for Social Landlords and Homelessness functions, developed and published jointly by Communities Scotland, COSLA and Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, require that landlords are responsive to the particular needs of applicants and the changing needs of existing tenants and that properties are adapted efficiently to meet these needs. Compliance with these standards is monitored through Communities Scotland&rsquo;s regulatory framework and inspection programme</p>

  <p>The Scottish Housing Quality Standard, introduced in February 2004, and relevant to the housing stock as a whole, requires that a smoke detector is present in every home. Allied to this, the design guide <em>Housing for Varying Needs</em> advises that occupants with impaired hearing will require safety devices such as smoke detectors to have a flashing light signal in addition to an audible alarm.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows.</p>

  <p>To date, none of the local authorities on the new Community Ownership Programme has had their receiving organisations&rsquo; business plans approved. However, Communities Scotland continues to provide practical support to councils and registered social landlords in working towards finalising plans for submission for approval.</p>

  <p>The concept of a crofting community land trust was first explored by the then Scottish Office in 1996 in connection with proposals for community ownership of croft land owned by the Secretary of State For Scotland.</p>

  <p>Parliamentary consideration of options for the creation of community bodies and crofting community bodies under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 was informed by the community land trust concept. The company model provided under the act was favoured by Scottish ministers because of the low set up costs and robustness, openness and transparency which are features of companies limited by guarantee, registered under the Companies Act, with documentation being publicly accessible at Companies House.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to take appropriate measures to ensure that any PPP contracts they enter into meet their requirements.

  <p>We have no evidence of any significant or generalised shortfall of permanent teachers in chemistry or maths. Although, it is recognised that teacher supply is tighter this year than in the past, particularly in relation to the availability of supply teachers. We recognise that in any individual school a particular subject shortage can have significant impacts. The management of supply cover is in the main primarily a matter for local authorities.</p>

  <p>Entrants to chemistry and maths Postgraduate Certificate in Education courses are up by 15% and 85% respectively compared to last year as we build towards the commitment in the Partnership for a Better Scotland to increase teacher numbers to 53,000 by 2007.</p>

  <p>The requirement for supply teachers is discussed with members of the Teacher Workforce Planning Advisory Group which includes representatives of education authorities and the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC). The purpose of the group is to offer advice on the requirement for newly trained teachers to Scottish ministers who in turn offer advice to SHEFC who are responsible for setting intakes to courses of teacher training. An allowance of 7% in primary and secondary education has been included within the statistical model from 2004 for the need for supply teachers.</p>
