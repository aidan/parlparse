  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive who the &quot;new landlords&quot; referred to in the press statement of 19 September 2000 on the &pound;350 million funding package for central heating are, what obligations these new landlords will be under and how much of the funding package will be generated from those obligations.</p>

  <p>The new landlords referred to are those acquiring council houses following a vote by tenants in favour of transfer. These landlords will be required, in submitting transfer proposals to councils, to include the provision of heating and insulation in their capital investment programmes. On the basis of the transfer of an estimated 37,500 council houses without central heating and insulation, this would account for investment to the value of about &pound;94 million of the total &pound;350 million. The costs of providing heating and insulation will be reflected in the valuations of the houses to be transferred.</p>

  <p>The amount to be spent will depend on the precise number of dwellings which lack central heating. About &pound;2,500 will be spent on heating and insulation for each dwelling as part of the post-transfer investment programme. If the tenants vote for transfer, the measures will be installed by the new landlord. The cost will be reflected in the valuation of the stock. If transfer does not proceed, the Scottish Executive will make the necessary resources available. The time period for the works depends on the outcome of the ballot on stock transfer. This will be the case for all seven authorities currently on the path to a ballot on whole stock transfer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports training for employment in the motor trade through the youth training programme, Skillseekers, which includes Modern Apprenticeships. Participation in Skillseekers is demand-led by young people and by employers. Uptake in the motor vehicle sector is good. There are currently 2,659 Skillseekers training in the motor trade and 1,358 Modern Apprentices.</p>

  <p>Young people can also access training in the motor vehicle sector through further education. Currently, 31 FE colleges offer courses in the motor vehicle sector.</p>

  <p>The National Training Organisation, the Motor Industry Training Council, is responsible for promoting the Modern Apprenticeship within its sector and for devising and maintaining occupational standards which link into the SVQ and the Modern Apprenticeship.</p>

  <p>Following consultation with a number of bodies including the Scottish Executive, the Royal Commission has drawn up a preliminary list of the broad topics it intends to cover in this study. It is now seeking to identify the issues and areas it would be most appropriate for the new study to investigate and the Scottish Executive has been invited to contribute to this exercise. This information will help the Commission to scope the study. The new study is expected to begin in the middle of next year, when the Commission will invite the submission of detailed evidence on specific issues. The Scottish Executive will make any response available to the public.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has the statutory duty of exercising its pollution control powers for the purpose of preventing or minimising, or remedying or mitigating, the effects of pollution in the environment. It has the duty of promoting the cleanliness of the inland waters of Scotland and generally to promote the conservation of flora and fauna which are dependent on an aquatic environment, to such extent as it considers desirable. Subject to certain exceptions, no poisonous, noxious or polluting matter, or solid waste matter may be discharged into controlled waters without the consent of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and in compliance with the conditions of such consent. The agency has powers to issue notices requiring certain kinds of activities to be carried out to limit pollution.</p>

  <p>A copy of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#8217;s report <i>Phosphorus Control in Loch Lomond</i> is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 9510). This document provides estimates on the amount of phosphorus believed to be entering the loch from diffuse and point sources. It goes on to advise on proposals to control, by limits on consent to discharge, the amount of phosphorus being introduced from point sources. The implementation of these controls has changed slightly from those shown in the document following feedback from the water authorities and others on the effect of such controls. It is intended to address diffuse sources of phosphorus through catchment management. In this respect, a report, <i>Loch Lomond Catchment Management Plan</i>, has been published and is also available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 9511). A proactive approach is being adopted to deal with phosphorus, to prevent any serious deterioration of the present general good quality of water in the loch.</p>

  <p>Information on phosphorus control measures and algal blooms in other lochs, while not held centrally, is available from the agency. General information on the environmental condition of Scotland&#8217;s lochs, and the agency&#8217;s improvement targets, is contained in its report <i>Improving Scotland&#8217;s Water Environment</i>, which is also available in the Reference Centre (Bib. no. 2964).</p>

  <p>The sale and supply of fireworks is a consumer protection matter and as such is reserved.</p>

  <p>The UK Government undertook a comprehensive review of the controls on fireworks in 1996, which led to the introduction of the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997. The 1997 Regulations control the type and size of fireworks which can be sold to the general public and prohibit the sale of most fireworks to anyone under 18 years of age. It is an offence, which can result in a fine of up to &pound;5,000 and/or a prison sentence, to supply to the general public the more powerful types of fireworks specified in the Regulations. The Regulations also require that all fireworks intended for sale to the general public, whether manufactured here or imported, must comply with the British Standard on the safety of fireworks, BS 71124 Part 2: 1998.</p>

  <p>The UK Government is keeping this matter under review.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what percentage of the Scottish fishing fleet&#8217;s allocated quota for each species is expected to be caught this year.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-11-15.19.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80135" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1115.htm#10">

  <p>The &quot;Scottish fishing fleet&quot; is not allocated fish quotas. Quotas are allocated to three fishing groups in the UK &#8211; producer organisations (20); the non-sector and the 10 metre and under fleet. There are around 70 UK quota stocks which are allocated to fishing groups. Uptake of UK quotas is routinely monitored at group rather than at individual vessel level.</p>

  <p>Under the devolution settlement, a &quot;Scottish boat&quot; is defined by reference to its port of registration. It is possible for Scottish-registered vessels to be fishing out of English ports and vice versa. Similarly, some of the seven Scottish-based producer organisations may have in their membership vessels which are not registered in Scotland.</p>

  <p>However, for the purposes of this answer, we have assumed the &quot;Scottish fishing fleet&quot; to mean the seven Scottish-based fish producer organisations. For west coast nephrops, however, the Scottish fleet also includes those vessels of under 10 metres in length and those in the non-sector (over 10 metre vessels not in membership of a fish producer organisation) since both groups have a significant interest in this fishery.</p>

  <p>It is not possible at this stage to accurately predict the likely level of percentage uptake of quotas by the Scottish fleet since a number of factors such as availability of fish and weather conditions can bear on uptake levels in the weeks to end-December.</p>

  <p>However, based on recorded uptake as at 9 November (the latest available figures), the following tables show the approximate percentage uptake of the main whitefish stocks by the scottish producer organisations based on current allocations:</p>

  <p>There have been a number of local and national surveys in this area, some funded by the Scottish Executive. These have found clear evidence of a marked social class gradient in the prevalence of mental health problems, including suicide, first admissions to hospital for schizophrenia and GP contact rates for depression and anxiety. In particular, surveys have shown that at least 50% of &quot;looked-after&quot; children and young people have significant mental health problems.</p>

  <p>The range of measures being taken by the Scottish Executive to tackle deprivation, by improving the circumstances and environment in which people live, will help contribute to better mental health. The provision of services, informed by research findings, is increasingly recognising the particular needs of vulnerable groups, including those who live in deprived circumstances. For example, through the Mental Health and Well Being Development Fund, the Scottish Executive now funds four projects, which provide special Child and Adolescent Mental Health services to &quot;looked-after&quot; children and young people.</p>

  <p>NHS Management Executive Letter (2000) 24, issued on 28 April 2000, advised the NHS in Scotland of an increase in the Specialist Registrar (SpR) establishment in oncology. Five additional posts are to be allocated to medical oncology and seven extra posts to clinical oncology.</p>

  <p>Operational matters relating to nuclear submarines are a matter for the Ministry of Defence (MOD). I understand, however, that all work on the nuclear reactors and associated systems of nuclear submarines are conducted in accordance with stringent safety rules. These are regulated by MOD&#8217;s internal regulator, the Chairman of the Naval Nuclear Regulatory Panel. The rules are designed to maintain the safety of the public, the ship&#8217;s company and the environment.</p>

  <p>I understand from MOD that the particular reactor problems for the nuclear submarines Sceptre, Sovereign and Superb will not result in discharges to the marine environment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is contributing over &pound;2 million to the Waste Resource Action Programme (WRAP), which is being established in conjunction with DETR, DTI and the National Assembly for Wales. WRAP will investigate and aim to overcome major barriers to recycling in Britain. Plastic has already been identified as a priority for action.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also working with DETR and interested parties to explore opportunities specifically to increase the recycling of plastic farm films which form a significant amount of plastics often disposed of on farms.</p>

  <p>The Executive also jointly funds the ReMaDe (Recycling Markets Development) project in Scotland. ReMaDe is already working to encourage recycling of several materials and plans to look at opportunities to recycle plastics.</p>

  <p>In November 1999, Sarah Boyack opened a Materials Reclamation Facility in Polmadie, Glasgow. It was funded by a &pound;2.6 million award from the Scottish Office Capital Challenge Fund. The facility sorts aluminium and steel cans, paper and different types of plastics for recycling. I was pleased to hear that the one-millionth plastic bottle for recycling was processed at the facility during the summer.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive recently hosted a conference on plastics recycling, organised by RECycling Of Used Plastic Containers Ltd (RECOUP). Over 70 people from local authorities and business attended the conference and discussed the problems and possibilities for increasing plastics recycling.</p>

  <p>The sums above constitute between 0.7% and 0.8% of the Executive&#8217;s plans for Total Managed Expenditure. The values of the proportions shown for the expenditure here are highly sensitive to the value of &quot;European&quot; spending. The value of the department&#8217;s significant expenditure on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on-farm payment schemes is very sensitive to factors such as the value of sterling. While the Executive&#8217;s plans for &quot;non EU&quot; spending shown above are fixed for the Spending Review 2000 period, its plans for CAP spending are classed as Annually Managed Expenditure (AME), outside the Scottish Block and formula arrangements. The spending is classed as AME because actual expenditure on CAP schemes is prone to considerable variance from plans. The proportions shown here therefore, based on comparisons between fixed and variable plans, do not allow meaningful conclusions to be drawn.</p>

  <p>*Due to ongoing refurbishment, there are currently 68 spaces in use.</p>

  <p>**Saughton House is shared with a number of other Government Departments and agencies and car parking is not specifically allocated between the departments. The Scottish Executive accounts for 60% of total staff occupying the building and the figure shown is pro rata.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to encouraging its staff to consider using more sustainable transport modes in getting to and from work. A Green Travel Plan covering our main Edinburgh buildings is currently being prepared, for publication in the autumn.</p>

  <p>A range of initiatives is underway or planned to encourage more sustainable travel practices by Scottish Executive staff based at the buildings listed above, including:</p>

  <p>- an intranet-based Green Travel website, which has areas for car-sharers and bicycle users, public transport timetable information and links, and other information of practical use for members of staff;</p>

  <p>- interest-free loans for purchasing annual travel tickets and bicycles and cycling equipment;</p>

  <p>- discounted annual travel tickets for Lothian Buses services; and</p>

  <p>- the provision of pre-paid books of bus tickets for business travel.</p>

  <p>We said in the <i>Scottish</i> <i>Executive</i> <i>Statistical</i> <i>Plan</i> <i>2000-2001</i> , released as a consultation document in April, that we were undertaking a review of our dissemination of statistics. We invited comment on several options for change which we were considering. One of these was a proposal to develop a new volume of social statistics to complement <i>Scottish Economic Statistics</i> . Between them, these would cover the material in the existing compendium, the <i>Scottish Abstract of Statistics</i> , which would be discontinued.</p>

  <p>Respondents to the consultation overwhelmingly supported this change. We are accordingly proceeding with the preparation of the new volume, to be called &quot;Scottish Social Statistics&quot;, which will be published early in 2001. It will present a wide range of information on life in Scotland, using a format which combines tables and graphs with a extensive text. This is in line with the second proposal we made in the plan, to introduce a new style of publication which provides more commentary on the statistics and their policy context, which respondents also favoured.</p>

  <p>There will be no further editions of the <i>Scottish Abstract</i>. The material which it contained is already publicly available in a variety of paper and electronic publications.</p>

  <p>We remain committed to making statistics available as quickly as possible in forms which users find useful. The third proposal in the plan was to enhance the information on the Scottish Executive website to include more detailed tables which have previously been available only on request. We have begun to take this forward with the addition of a range of economic statistics, including local authority profiles.</p>

  <p>Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 prohibits the keeping, treating or disposal of controlled waste unless a waste management licence authorising the activity has been issued by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). The Act also places a Duty of Care on any person who handles controlled waste. These provisions apply to waste tyres, other than household waste, although SEPA would not authorise the burning of tyres in the open.</p>

  <p>The unauthorised burning of tyres would be dealt with in various ways, depending on circumstances. If a business burns tyres in an unauthorised manner it would be liable to prosecution under section 33 or 34 of the 1990 Act. If the burning of tyres involves household waste, a local authority has powers to take action under the statutory nuisance provisions in the 1990 Act. Waste tyres from commercial agricultural premises are not regulated by SEPA but are subject to the Clean Air Act 1993. There are no plans to amend these powers.</p>

  <p>SEPA has monitoring powers under section 108 of the Environment Act 1995. These include the power to enter at reasonable times (or, in an emergency, at any time) any premises which an authorised officer has reason to believe it is necessary for him to enter. The provisions also permit the examination of, and the taking of samples from, the premises, and the taking of samples of air, water or land on, or in the vicinity of, the premises.</p>
