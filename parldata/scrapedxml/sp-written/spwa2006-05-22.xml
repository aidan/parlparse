  <p>The Executive intends that the reforms in the Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Bill will strike a fair balance between creditors and debtors.</p>

  <p>As part of striking the right balance, the intended new diligence of land attachment already includes robust debtor protections that will apply where homes are attached, including a power for the court to refuse to agree a sale that will have an unduly harsh effect, and a duty on the court to look at whether there is suitable alternative accommodation.</p>

  <p>Also, land attachment is a diligence and debtors can therefore stop an attachment by getting help and support from the new Debt Arrangement Scheme</p>

  <p>The Executive nonetheless notes the recommendation in the stage 1 report that the main dwelling house should be exempted. We will therefore consider carefully whether or not to make changes at stage 2 of the bill.</p>
