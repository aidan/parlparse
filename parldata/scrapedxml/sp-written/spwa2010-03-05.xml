  <p>Information on the number of acute occupied bed days which are directly attributable to alcohol-related conditions is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Information on acute occupied bed days is recorded on the SMR01 dataset. SMR01 has space for up to six diagnosis codes to be recorded, a main diagnosis and up to five secondary diagnoses. Alcohol-related problems will be recorded as either a main or a secondary diagnosis, so it is not possible to identify the cases where alcohol was directly attributed to the length of the admission.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Excludes mental illness hospitals, psychiatric units and maternity hospitals.</p>

  <p>2. Figures in this table relate only to those individuals who are treated as inpatients or day cases in an acute hospital. They do not include individuals managed as outpatients.</p>

  <p>3. Note that these figures include residents from other health boards that were treated in Lothian hospitals but do not include Lothian residents treated in other health boards.</p>

  <p>4. Discharges where alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded as primary or secondary reasons for admission to hospital.</p>

  <p>5. Diseases recorded using the World Health Organization&rsquo;s International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD10).</p>

  <p>- Alcohol-related: F10, K70, X45, X65, Y15, Y90, Y91, E24.4, E51.2, G31.2, G62.1, G72.1, I42.6, K29.2, K86.0, O35.4, P04.3, Q86.0, T51.0, T51.1, T51.9, Y57.3, R78.0, Z50.2, Z71.4, Z72.1. These codes were defined in a recent in-depth review of ISD&rsquo;s core alcohol related code set. Further information about the review and resulting consultation process is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.alcoholinformation.isdscotland.org/alcohol_misuse/3986.html" target="_blank">http://www.alcoholinformation.isdscotland.org/alcohol_misuse/3986.html</a></p>

  <p>6. Caution is necessary when interpreting these figures. The recording of alcohol-related problems may vary from hospital to hospital.</p>

  <p>Due to the way alcohol related conditions are recorded, it is not possible to determine whether or not the reason for admission is directly attributable to alcohol. Therefore, this figure may be an overestimate.</p>

  <p>Information in the table above relates to discharges from acute non-obstetric, non-psychiatric hospitals. It should be noted that patients with alcohol-related conditions may be admitted to mental illness hospitals. Statistics for these admissions are not included in the table.</p>

  <p>The method used to regulate care services is an operational matter for the Care Commission. It is for the commission to evaluate and review its own inspection methodology. As part of the corporate arrangements for public bodies, officials regularly discuss with the commission its regulatory activities, including its approach to inspections.</p>

  <p><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">The Care Commission&rsquo;s Corporate Plan which sets out its objectives and details its key performance indicators (KPIs) is approved by Scottish ministers. There are KPIs relating to inspection activity and enforcement. The commission submits to my officials a monitoring report setting out how it has performed against the KPIs.

  <p><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">The corporate governance arrangements also include discussions on the commission&rsquo;s regulatory activities in order to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s care services continue to improve. The Commission strives to deliver improvement in a number of ways. These include more targeted inspections and a focus on people who use services and their carers, as well as increased participation from users and their carers in the regulation of care services.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Norovirus is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting). Outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis are more likely in semi-closed environments such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools and cruise ships.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Poor hygiene is probably the main factor that starts outbreaks especially if catering and waiting staff are suffering from gastrointestinal infection. Norovirus is highly infectious and, for example, individuals tend to vomit in a very profuse and projectile manner. This can produce an aerosol of viruses that infect people who have had no other contact with the individual and despite their keeping good hygiene.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Outbreaks may also be due to contamination of food. Recent outbreaks across the UK have been due to oysters that have probably been contaminated by human faecal contamination of oyster beds.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">There are two main differences between an addiction support area and a drug free area. The first is the inclusion of prisoners on stable substitute prescription treatment. A drug free area would normally exclude a prisoner on such treatment. The second is in the methods employed by staff in focussing on treatment and recovery, working towards a more therapeutic relationship between staff and prisoners. Drug free areas have historically been focussed on drugs and their exclusion, rather than prisoners with problematic drug use and their support needs.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Assessments are made by the nursing addictions team and regular drug testing is part of the agreed criteria. Each prisoner is supported with an individual care plan and has community and through care links to ensure continued support after release. The regimes include regular one to one support and group work with the Enhanced Addiction Casework Service and Addiction Nurses, group work with both Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), Lothian and Borders Abstinence Programme (LEAP) and various healthcare supported relaxation and self-awareness therapies. Prisoners have access peer support from C-Plus, an organisation providing knowledge and awareness on Hepatitis C, HIV and other blood borne viruses.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">There are 38 spaces in the HMP Edinburgh Addiction Support Area. Between January and September 2009, 80 prisoners had been admitted to the Addiction Support Area and 37 prisoners had been liberated. Of these liberations 16 were on a reducing prescription of methadone, 18 completely drug free and three who had reduced methadone and had switched to Suboxone (an opiate substitute which also blocks opiates). 6 of the liberated prisoners had re-offended and had been returned to custody, however they had continued to be either drug free or on the same prescription as when they had left the prison and did not present with drug related problems on re-admission to custody.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">There are 38 spaces in the HMP Edinburgh Addiction Support Area. Each prisoner must be serving a minimum of 45 days. The criteria for access to this type of environment is primarily motivation to change, as well as a willingness to take part in voluntary random drug testing. Prisoners who are receiving a substitute prescription should not be excluded from an Addiction Support Area, provided they are stable and consistently free from illicit substances. Prisoners who have finished a detoxification prescription and are drug-free are also included in the criteria.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Joint Improvement Team is supporting the development of Telecare services in Scotland. All 32 health and social care partnerships are pursuing and developing local telecare services. Additional funding of &pound;4 million is being made available for the financial year 2010-11 to enable partnerships to promote and encourage a consistent and mainstreamed approach to telehealthcare technologies across Scotland.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">As part of the eCare Programme, Local Data Sharing Partnerships are upgrading their social care systems to allow them to interact on a multi-agency basis with partners across health, education, the police, and other public sector agencies. Greater emphasis is also being placed on the involvement of the third sector in the technology supporting Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) requirements, which involves private and voluntary sectors.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">These developments will facilitate closer working arrangements with local private and voluntary sector social care service providers in order to support the independence and well-being of an increasingly large number of potential service users.</span></p>
