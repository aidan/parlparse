  <p>Case C-368/98 concerns a woman from Belgium who obtained orthopaedic treatment in France. The court confirmed the rule that treatment in such cases is to be provided under the conditions applying in the country providing the treatment. The court did not establish an unqualified right to medical treatment in other European Union countries. The implications for NHS patients relate to issues such as patient safety, quality assurance and proper arrangements for aftercare. Against this background, the legal and policy impact of this and other recent judgments are currently being considered in detail.</p>

  <p>On 27 April 2001 I announced funding for an additional 375 junior doctors. This followed my announcement of 100 extra junior doctors on 28 June 2000. These will be targeted at areas with an identified need for additional resources.</p>

  <p>In 2001-02 health boards received an average increase in unified budgets of 6.5 per cent, which represents a cash increase of over &#163;270 million. In addition, boards are to receive average increases of 6.5 per cent and 7.4 per cent in 2002-03 and 2003-04 respectively. It is the responsibility of health boards to determine local priorities for the use of these funds including meeting the targets and standards of the new deal for junior doctors.</p>

  <p>No. The new contract for doctors in training was introduced in December 2000. This requires that from 1 August 2001 all pre-registration house officer (PRHO) posts and from 1 August 2003 all senior house officer (SHO) and specialist registrar (SpR) posts must fully comply with the hours limits of the new deal. Trusts which fail to meet this requirement will be in breach of contract.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department (SEHD) expects all employers locally to work within current employment and health and safety legislation. Compliance with contracted hours is a matter for individual Trust employers and is not information that is held centrally by SEHD.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to introduce new procedures similar to those announced for England. The inquiry procedure rules that were introduced in 1997 and amended in 1998 have allowed for more prompt and effective handling of planning inquiries in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working in conjunction with HEBS and ASH Scotland to explore the best means of raising awareness about the impact of passive smoking. A long-term media campaign, linked to other action at community and industry levels, is being devised. This is being informed by the results of a survey of customer attitudes to smoking in public houses and restaurants. The campaign will be multifaceted, focusing on issues associated with smoking in the workplace and in the home as well as in places of entertainment such as pubs, restaurants, and clubs. The first phase of the campaign is expected to be launched later this year. HEBS and ASH Scotland are also collaborating to produce guidelines for local authorities on the development of tobacco policies in the workplace.</p>

  <p>Our aim has been to ensure that the KickStart programme is not &quot;top down&quot; in its approach and that it meets the diverse needs of voluntary and community groups around the country. This meant that we consulted widely, including with the social inclusion partnerships (SIPs). The views of SIPs have strongly influenced the design of the programme and various changes have been made. For example, as a result of SIP views, KickStart will now run for an extra year, until March 2003, and with an increased allocation of &#163;625,000.</p>

  <p>Most of the SIP clusters are in the process of recruiting their development workers and aim to have them in post between October and November.</p>
