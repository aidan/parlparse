  <p>Further to my answer of 17 April 2008, the equality impact assessment currently being undertaken, has been established to examine the effect of the amalgamation of the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland (MACS) with the Public Transport Users&rsquo; Committee for Scotland (PTUC), taking on board evidence from stakeholders as gathered in the recent consultation, to assess how the enlarged PTUC will best meet the interests of disabled travellers in the future.</p>

  <p>The decision to move to full incorporation of MACS with the PTUC was taken following a wide-ranging consultation seeking views from organisations representing disability and mobility interests carried out between December 2005 and March 2006. The requirement to undertake an equality impact assessment in relation to disability came into effect in December 2006.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide estimates of the number of GP consultations in NHS Tayside directly connected with alcohol-related conditions. While Scotland-wide estimates are available, these are based on a small number of practice team information practices. The small number of practices involved precludes robust analysis at NHS board level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is clear that a long-term strategy is required for the management and conservation of Bute House and confirms that it will publish plans for any major redevelopment or refurbishment once these have been established. Decisions will be taken in due course supported by work commissioned under the previous administration; no architectural work on the long-term development of the building has been commissioned since May 2007. There have been no detailed discussions on Bute House with the National Trust for Scotland since May 2007 but discussions are likely in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has requested the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to extend its current flood warning service by the introduction of an active flood warning dissemination programme, similar to the system which has been in operation for a number of years in England and Wales through the Environment Agency. This will introduce a service where registered members of the public and partner organisations will be contacted directly via a range of media. SEPA has furthermore been given by the Scottish Government &pound;1.046 million over a three year period to provide a three hour minimum lead time to deliver flood warning to the catchment of the Rivers Dee, Don, Deveron and North Esk in North East Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has also consulted on proposals to establish a new framework for the implementation of sustainable flood risk management in Scotland, and will be introducing a flooding Bill later this year. It has also just announced the opening of the Scotland Rural Development Programme which includes support for a number of natural flood management measures, and is working with the National Flood Forum to establish a presence in Scotland. The forum will work with SEPA to engage with communities to raise awareness of flooding.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is providing &pound;200,000 to Western Isles Council for research in the hydrodynamics of the South Ford area in South Uist, and in addition is supporting Angus Council with &pound;70,000 to consider intervention strategies seeking to slow the rate of erosion at Montrose Beach. This research will help in the understanding of coastal processes and assist in developing longer term and strategic approaches to coastal flooding and erosion in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Contingency planning is primarily a matter for local responders, as defined under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, to whom the Scottish Government will provide appropriate support.</p>

  <p>After the flooding in parts of England during the summer of 2007, the Minister for Environment wrote out to each of the eight regional Strategic Co-ordinating Group (SCG) asking for confirmation that they were adequately prepared to respond to similar events, should they occur in Scotland. All SCGs indicated they had assessed the flooding risk in their area, and had undertaken planning for such eventualities.In January 2008, a further self-evaluation was commissioned by the Scottish Government from SCGs in relation to their planning for a wider set of extreme weather events that might arise as a result of climate change, including coastal and inland flooding. Responses are currently being collated and evaluated by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>In addition, an exercise built around an extreme weather scenario is planned for the first quarter of 2009, and is designed to evaluate responders capabilities to deal with resulting challenges.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government in partnership with Esep Ltd who are responsible for administering application rounds and post approval monitoring, will fully comply with European Commission Regulation Article 60(b) No 1083/2006. This covers the need for &quot;verifying that the co-financed products and services are delivered and that the expenditure declared by the beneficiaries for operations has actually been incurred and complies with Community and National Rules&quot;. This will involve a number of controls including verification of supporting documents before claims for re-imbursement are made and, are also likely to involve on the spot monitoring of project progress and financial checks. This control environment will apply to all project sponsors including VisitScotland.</p>

  <p>Question S3W-8959 related to the 140 day custody limit which operates in High Court cases.</p>

  <p>The Scottish courts are able to establish whether custody limits are exceeded in cases where an application is submitted by the Crown to extend that time limit.</p>

  <p>In terms of section 65 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 as amended, where there is a risk that the time limit will be exceeded, an accused may be admitted to bail by the Lord Advocate and liberated from custody, or arrangements made to bring the accused before the court in order that an application to extend the time limit beyond 140 days may be considered.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Court Service only collects information on the number of those cases where the Crown has applied to the court to be able to retain the accused person in custody beyond 140 days. In 2007 the High Court granted 487 applications to extend the 140 day custody time limit in relation to an accused.</p>

  <p><em>Choosing Scotland&rsquo;s Future </em> sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s view that on independence, the current parliamentary and political union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland would become a monarchical and social union, united kingdoms rather than a United Kingdom, maintaining the relationship first forged in 1603 by the Union of the Crowns and that both nations would be equal members of the European Union and thus partners in, among other things, the single market. This proposed relationship between the nations of these isles will better reflect the needs and realities of Scotland in the 21st century.</p>

  <p>The white paper explains that within this relationship, a broad range of cultural, social, and policy initiatives would continue and it is likely that both an independent Scotland and the remainder of the United Kingdom would seek to maintain a series of cross-border partnerships and services, much in the same way as the current British-Irish Council or indeed the Nordic Council. A Scotland separate from the United Kingdom would in contrast not involve any of these positive and appropriate partnerships between equal and independent nation states.</p>

  <p>On a global level, there has been considerable debate about whether peak oil has occurred. In any event, significant reserves remain in the North Sea and the Scottish oil and gas industry, which is of enormous economic importance to Scotland, will remain a vital sector of our economy for decades to come.</p>

  <p>The Government Economic Strategy (GES) sets out how the government intends to create a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth. While the strategy will continue to evolve as economic conditions change, the strategy identifies the Scottish oil and gas industry as one of significant economic importance to Scotland. The strategy also sets out the desired characteristics of growth - one of which is sustainability - and sets challenging emissions targets. The GES identifies the energy sector (with a particular focus on renewables) as a key sector which has an important part to play not only in contributing to Scotland&rsquo;s wealth but also in developing an energy supply that is diverse and sustainable and which supports the transition to a low carbon economy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made no specific assessments of Scottish or global oil supplies. However, we regularly monitor world energy markets, including future estimates of oil reserves prepared by the industry, international agencies, and the UK Government, to assess future security of supply. These estimates indicate that there will be sufficient supply in both the North Sea and globally over the next few decades to enable Scotland and the rest of the world to make the transition to a low carbon energy supply.</p>

  <p>Funding is a non-refundable grant contribution up to 50% of eligible costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, at a maximum of &pound;100,000 per project. The fund has been allocated on a competitive basis, with applications assessed against the following criteria &ndash; potential economic development impact, additionality, technical advancement and a thorough appraisal of the applicant.</p>

  <p>There has been no precise limit on the fund. Instead, the sums allocated have been limited by the number of applications, as well as the limits imposed by the wider Scottish Enterprise energy team budget for each year. Around &pound;250,000 has been awarded since the fund&rsquo;s launch in June 2007.</p>

  <p>A full evaluation has not yet been conducted, as two projects are still in progress and one completed just last month. Signs to date indicate that the funding has been a reasonable success in supporting the marine sector and encouraging collaboration across sectors but more evidence is needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.</p>

  <p>A review will take place later this year, the findings of which will inform the fund&rsquo;s future.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government officials met Commission officials in November 2007, when discussions took place on the requirement to comply with EU directives and carry out appropriate assessments of the designated sites potentially affected by the Gordonbush wind farm application.</p>

  <p>Consequently, officials agreed to provide the Commission with the determination documents and the appropriate assessments on the designated sites, once Scottish ministers had made a decision.The Gordonbush application was granted consent 9 April 2008. The decision letter, consent and appropriate assessments are available on the Scottish Government website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/Energy/Energy-Consents" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/Energy/Energy-Consents</a>.</p>

  <p>: The request does not fall within the scope of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body&rsquo;s agreed policy on flag flying. The Parliament routinely flies the Saltire, Union and European Union flags on a daily basis. In addition, the Parliament flies the United Nations and Commonwealth flags on United Nations Day (24 October) and Commonwealth Day (2nd Monday in March) respectively. Outwith these dates, the Parliament will also fly the relevant country flags for a visiting head of state and, on occasions, for a visiting Prime Minister or parliamentary speaker.</p>
