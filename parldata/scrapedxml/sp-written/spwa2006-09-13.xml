  <p>Since 2003, the Scottish Executive has made available antisocial behaviour funding to Dumfries and Galloway Community Planning Partnership as follows:</p>

  <p><table width="25%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">

<td width="49%" valign="top"> 2004-05</td>
<td width="51%" align="right" valign="top">&pound;642,000</td>

</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>In addition, Dumfries and Galloway has been awarded a total of &pound;183,872 for provision of noise nuisance services over the period 2004-06.</p>

  <p>This specific Scottish Executive funding for antisocial behaviour services complements funding through the core local government finance settlement that may also impact on measures to tackle or prevent antisocial behaviour. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s specific antisocial behaviour funding is subject to an outcome agreement made between the Executive and local partners. The support provided to local authorities through the core local government finance settlement is provided through a block grant and it is the responsibility of local councils to allocate these resources according to local needs.</p>

  <p>The new lead clinician for diabetes in Scotland, Dr Donald Pearson, was appointed in August 2006.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards, with the exception of Orkney, have a lead clinician and manager in post to support diabetes managed clinical networks. In Orkney, the lead clinician post has been unfilled for two years and the network manager post has been unfilled for five months. The imminent establishment of a Community Health Partnership has enabled these gaps to be addressed and it is expected that a lead clinician will be in post by October. A new joint management structure encompassing the diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke managed clinical networks will be put in place during the autumn.</p>

  <p>There are well-established procedures involving the Police, Maritime and Coastguard Agency and, where required, MOD Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel for the removal and/or disposal of munitions beaching on land in Scotland. Detailed information on past UK sea-dumping of munitions in Beaufort&rsquo;s Dyke and elsewhere is held on the MOD website at: <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/HealthandSafety/DSC/DsandcEnvironmentSeaDumping.htm" target="_blank">http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/HealthandSafety/DSC/DsandcEnvironmentSeaDumping.htm</a> .</p>

  <p>The Executive and Scottish ministers maintain close contacts with emergency response organisations. The basis of any emergency response is based on the principle of subsidiarity in which control of operations is exercised at the lowest practical level. This approach has proven robust in Scotland. Further information can be found in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and its accompanying guidance Preparing Scotland published on the Scottish Executive website: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/02/27140215/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/02/27140215/0</a>.</p>

  <p>The Community Environmental Renewal Scheme was designed to assist communities in the vicinity of past or present quarries subject to the Aggregates Levy (in the case of disused quarries provided that they would have been subject to the levy had they been in operation today).</p>

  <p>The Aggregates Levy proceeds were available first from 2002 to 2004, and again from 2004 to 2007. Over this period &pound;7.1 million has been offered or paid to 287 projects.

  <p>The rate of progress regarding the implementation of the Gender Equality Duty for public authorities depends on the precise form and scope of the duty - and the specific duties for Scotland are not due to be lain before the Scottish Parliament until October 2006.</p>

  <p>When the Scottish duties become law, the Equal Opportunities Commission Code of Practice and accompanying guidance on the implementation of the Gender Equality Duty will also be available to public authorities. This will be an important tool in helping public bodies to understand and meet the statutory requirements on them (with effect from April 2007) to promote equality between women and men.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-27982 on 13 September 2006. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of an individual clinician to make appropriate decisions on treatment in the circumstances of the individual patient. Patients who are currently receiving the drug should continue on their existing course of treatment until their clinician directs otherwise.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not collect information on the total amount spent on hospital food and nutrition by NHS boards. However, the catering costs incurred by NHS board are reported in the costs book each year.

  <p>The 2006-07 Investment Programme estimates that at least &pound;200 million of private finance will be generated in support of delivering 7,100 housing approvals. The estimate was produced assuming an average grant rate per project of 66% and an average private sector contribution of 34%.</p>

  <p>All elements of Glasgow Housing Association&rsquo;s (GHA) business plan are relevant to determining the costs of second stage transfer (SST) since the prices set for individual transfers will be driven primarily by disaggregation of that business plan. In addition, GHA has allocated a specific sum of &pound;6 million within its business plan for costs associated with taking forward SST.</p>

  <p>Making the sign of the cross does not constitute a criminal offence. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service fully respects religious belief and lawful religious practices and would not countenance action against an individual for lawful acts of religious reverence or observance. Where any religious act or symbol is abused with intent to mock persons of that religion, or as part of conduct calculated to incite disorder it may form part of the circumstances amounting to a Breach of the Peace, but this will depend critically on the context of the incident and the facts and circumstances of the individual case.</p>

  <p>In criminal proceedings, under the Sexual Offences (Procedure and Evidence) (Scotland) Act 2002, the accused in rape and sexual offence cases are prevented from personally cross-examining the complainer and are required to be legally represented for the whole trial. In addition, there are significant restrictions on the extent to which evidence can be led regarding the character or sexual history of the complainer in rape and other sexual offence cases. The Executive has no plans to extend these provisions to civil cases.</p>

  <p>The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004 provides for the use of special measures, such as screens, a supporter, a prior statement as evidence in chief, live TV link and the taking of evidence by a commission, by adult vulnerable witnesses when giving their evidence. An adult vulnerable witness can include anyone where there is a significant risk that the quality of their evidence may be diminished by reason of fear or distress in connection with giving evidence at the trial. Applying this definition will enable the court to take into account the wider circumstances of the case, such as the nature of the evidence the witness will give, and any relationship between the witness and the accused. Such considerations are likely to be particularly relevant in cases, whether criminal or civil, which may involve a witness being questioned about sexual matters.</p>

  <p>Provisions in the Vulnerable Witnesses Act will be implemented for civil proceedings from October 2007.</p>

  <p>The transport corridor between Birnam and Ballinluig in particular is very constrained. A road improvement in this area could affect the existing railway line, the River Tay and its tributaries. The River and its tributaries are protected by their European Directorate designation as a Special Area of Conservation - and the National Scenic Area.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland&rsquo;s consultants will assess the feasibility of engineering a dual carriageway in this corridor with acceptable impacts on these constraints and on the local residents. The consultants will also report on the cost and economic benefits of such a proposal.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>
