  <p>We are currently implementing the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005. This contains broad new powers to allow tough action to be taken against those who sell alcohol to children. The act comes fully into force on 1 September and we encourage licensing boards to use their new powers to crack down on rogue retailers.</p>

  <p>The law in respect of underage sales is also being enforced. Test purchasing is an early success story, helping the police in their efforts to stop underage sales. The number of reports to procurators fiscal in respect of the sale of alcohol to under 18s has also increased significantly from 252 reports in the six months to September 2007 to 394 reports in the six months to March 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that community supported activity can play a valuable role in reducing alcohol-related harm and tackling antisocial behaviour. Community Alcohol Partnerships can bring the benefits of effective partnership working by all relevant partners to tackle issues such as underage drinking and a number of positive indicators appear to have resulted from initial schemes.</p>

  <p>Since the HBOS shareholders voted on 12 December in favour of the acquisition by Lloyds TSB, both the First Minister and John Swinney MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth have spoken to senior executives of the new Lloyds Banking Group to offer continued assistance and support as the new merged organisation takes shape.</p>

  <p>Our policy has always been to strive to secure the best possible outcome for Scotland. Our preference throughout the takeover process has been that a continuing standalone Bank of Scotland would have best served the interests of Scotland&rsquo;s businesses, bank depositors and customers. That has not prevailed. We remain, however, fully committed to helping Lloyds Banking Group realise the benefits of Scotland as a location of choice for them in terms of our highly skilled workforce, cost efficient property base and world class business infrastructure. That will also maximise jobs and decision making in the Scottish economy.</p>

The scheme is reviewed annually by the National Goose Management Review Group.</p>

  <p>The first annual report of the Scottish Policing Performance Framework, which was published on 8 December 2008, will help ensure that the public and other stakeholders are better informed about how their police force is working to tackle crime. This can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/12/08094452/0" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/12/08094452/0</a> .</p>

  <p>The Association of Scottish Neighbourhood Watches promotes good citizenship and greater public participation in the prevention and solution of crime. The Scottish Government provides the Association with grant funding (&pound;253,000 in 2008-09), and is supporting their award ceremony in April 2009 which will help raise awareness of local citizenship, crime prevention and community safety activity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also provides grant funding (&pound;220,000 in 2008-09) to Crimestoppers Scotland. Crimestoppers Scotland regularly host campaigns to encourage the public to contact them with information on criminals or crimes. They also publicise their success at providing the police with information that leads to convictions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Police Service is committed to ensuring that local communities are fully aware of, and can influence, local crime-fighting activity through a number of initiatives and strategies, such as the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) Public Reassurance Strategy which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http;//www.acpos.police.uk/Documents/Policies/CRIME%20-%20ACPOS%20Public%20Reasurance%20Strategy%2010.09.07.pdf" target="_blank">www.acpos.police.uk/Documents/Policies/CRIME%20-%20ACPOS%20Public%20Reasurance%20Strategy%2010.09.07.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Where necessary the Scottish Government will raise awareness through public information campaigns, such as work which is currently underway to develop a campaign around the misuse of air weapons, firearms and replica weapons.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government publishes statistical information to raise public awareness of the levels of different types of crime in local communities. In particular, the Recorded Crime in Scotland Statistical Bulletin, published in September 2008, presents statistics on crimes and offences recorded and cleared up by the eight Scottish police forces, broken down by crime/offence group, police force area and council area. These statistics are available on the Scottish Government website ( <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/09/29155946/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/09/29155946/0</a> ) and are announced in the national media.</p>

  <p>Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics (SNS) is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s on-going programme to improve the availability of small area statistics in Scotland. Members of the public can find out statistical information about their local community, including crime levels, by entering their postcode on the SNS website <a href="http://www.sns.gov.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.sns.gov.uk/</a>. We are currently working with forces to update and enhance this for the 2009 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</p>

  <p>Police Forces, Community Safety Partnerships and their local partners work hard to raise awareness of crime levels in their communities and reassure the public that these issues are being addressed. More information can be found on local authority and police websites.</p>

  <p>The review of national antisocial behaviour policy is considering this issue in relation to antisocial behaviour and will report to Parliament in early 2009.</p>

We made clear at these meetings, the importance of energy companies acting to minimise the impact of high energy prices, particularly on our most vulnerable people. We are urging energy companies to pass on any reductions in wholesale energy costs to consumers as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>In addition to the November meetings, we continue to have regular dialogue with energy supply companies on a range of issues including energy pricing.</p>

  <p>The over-riding purpose of the Scottish Government is to increase sustainable economic growth. This is growth in all parts of Scotland including our rural communities.</p>

  <p>This purpose remains unchanged. In the current economic climate we will redouble our efforts to help every business, irrespective of size, location and sector, endure and grow. Key programmes which will assist many of the small and medium-sized retailers operating in rural communities are being enhanced.</p>

  <p>The Small Business Bonus Scheme will be extended from April 2009 with an extra &pound;50 million in support being made available. Regional Selective Assistance has been extended across the whole of Scotland. Businesses can access advice on cash flow and business efficiency issues from the Business Gateway website and directly from Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Assistance is being provided across all sectors through the six key elements of the Scottish Economic Recovery Programme.</p>

  <p><em>The Government Economic Strategy</em> (GES) sets out how we will focus on creating a more successful country through increasing sustainable economic growth. It is a wide-ranging strategy that recognises that all the arms of government need to play a role in strengthening the Scottish economy. This includes working with other public, private and third sector partners to ensure that enterprise and business development support is responsive, focused and accessible to all sectors of Scottish society, including disabled people.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise play a key role in delivering aspects of the GES.</p>

  <p>Both enterprise agencies support the Equality Matters in Business project, a pioneering Scotland-wide project that aims to enhance the advice and support given to small and medium sized enterprises on the business benefits of good practice in equality and diversity. It is a two year scheme running to March 2009 which covers all strands of equality, focuses on the demand for diversity and addresses the barriers that prevent the supply of a diverse workforce.</p>

  <p>Statistics are not available on the outcome of this project however, monitoring procedures are being put in place to record the number of businesses advised and an evaluation is currently being carried out.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration Scottish Natural Heritage has given to evidence on the number of golden plovers adjacent to the Coir&rsquo;an Eoin section of the Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands Special Protection Area (SPA) and whether such numbers would give cause to extend the SPA to provide appropriate protection.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has advised that the Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands Special Protection Area (SPA) was identified following considerable assessment and detailed survey over a period of years. The component units of the SPA reflect the outstanding active blanket bog areas and the outstanding community of birds including golden plover which are related to this habitat. The site boundaries were determined using the principle of safeguarding intact hydrological units wherever possible, and making use of clearly identifiable features such as streams, watersheds etc. The eastern boundary of Coir&rsquo; an Eoin marks the eastern extent of active bog in this area, generally following the burn, Allt a&rsquo;Mhuilinn.</p>

  <p>The adjacent area which provides habitat for golden plover has a significantly different character and comprises drier peatland merging into dry heath. The quality of habitat is much more degraded and provides poor habitat for other bird species. On this basis, the site was considered unsuitable for inclusion in the Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands SPA. Viewing the area as a separate entity, SNH&rsquo;s assessment is that it does not meet the criteria set out in the UK SPA Selection Guidelines.</p>

  <p>Further information on the development and application of the UK SPA Selection Guidelines is available via the following web link <a href="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1405" target="_blank">http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1405.</a></p>

  <p>Earlier this year, Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) indicated in its Scottish Forestry Strategy Implementation Plan that a sustained programme of around 10,000 hectares of new planting would be required each year to achieve the Strategy aspiration of 25% woodland cover by the second half of the century. FCS estimated that the private sector would plant 80% of the annual programme, while the remainder would be planted on the national forest estate. It is therefore too early to assess progress against this programme, particularly as the incentives to help delivery, the forestry measures within the SRDP, have just been put in place after the closure of the Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme. Progress will, however, be monitored closely over the coming years, and the figures will be published.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 62 on Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) states that all patients admitted to hospital for major trauma (e.g. fracture causing immobilisation), major surgery (e.g. duration over 30 minutes), or acute medical illness (e.g. likely to require bed rest for three days or more) should be assessed individually for risk of VTE. Some elements of the diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are covered in SIGN Guideline 36 on Antithrombotic Therapy.</p>

  <p>SIGN is now reviewing Guideline 62 and will incorporate recommendations on the diagnosis and management of DVT and pulmonary embolism into a single document. Guideline 36 is also under review.</p>

  <p>On 26 January 2008, the Chief Medical Officer and the Chairman of NHS QIS wrote to all NHS boards, asking them to address the requirement for written policies for the prevention and management of DVT as a matter of urgency, based on SIGN Guidelines 36 and 62, and to ensure that consistent and accessible patient information was available. NHS QIS completed a follow-up report in December 2008, concluding that NHS boards had provided reasonable reassurance that they had continued to implement, and in some areas complete, these actions.</p>

  <p>NHS QIS has stressed to NHS boards that they should continue to consider this a high priority and fully implement all aspects of their strategy on the management of DVT. The Chief Medical Officer is following up the NHS QIS report with NHS boards&rsquo; medical directors.</p>

  <p>The evidence base around individuals&rsquo; participation in Higher Education (HE) has identified a range of financial, cultural, institutional and dispositional factors that influence individuals in their choice of pursuing HE. This evidence does not specifically refer to &quot;hardship&quot; in isolation but rather that the costs associated with study and a fear of debt generally can impact on individual choices to participate in HE. Costs and fear of debt are identified as key themes in the growing research evidence conducted with current and prospective students.</p>

  <p>Ongoing Scottish Government research (Student Income, Expenditure and Debt survey) will provide more up to date information of students&rsquo; perceptions of debt and costs and assess the extent to which these are determining factors in students&rsquo; decisions to enter HE. This may provide more specific information relative to student hardship, however, will be unavailable until April 2009.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to establish a widening access unit to improve university uptake rates.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) has lead responsibility for promoting widening access through its own activities, the four regional widening access forums and higher education institutions. In 2008, the SFC strengthened its commitment to widening participation by the establishment of an Access and Inclusion Committee to raise the profile of this activity. The Scottish Government welcomes the establishment of this committee and will continue to work closely with the SFC to promote widening access.</p>

In addition to the &pound;493 million investment programme this year we are accelerating a further &pound;120 million over this year and next to increase the speed of new housing development.

  <p>It is very regrettable when any household has to live in overcrowded conditions. 4.2% of social tenants live in overcrowded conditions and the legislation provides that they must be given reasonable preference for re-housing. Through their housing need and demand assessments local authorities should identify where there is a shortage of family accommodation, which should then be addressed in their Local Housing Strategies and Strategic Housing Investment Plans. In addition, we are providing &pound;1.5 billion during the current spending review period to increase the supply of affordable housing.</p>

  <p>Local authorities will have new powers under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 to issue maintenance orders in certain circumstances. These will require owners to prepare a maintenance plan to secure the maintenance of the property to a reasonable standard. Where an owner fails to implement the plan the local authority will be able to take any action necessary to secure the implementation of that plan. This would include enforcing a plan where an owner is unwilling to pay for his or her responsibilities under that plan.</p>

  <p>Local authorities will also have new powers to pay a missing share into a maintenance account on behalf of an owner who is unable to pay, it is unreasonable to expect them to pay, or they cannot be found. This provision does not extend to paying shares on behalf of owners who are unwilling to pay. But owners already have recourse through the courts to pursue other non-paying owners.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will empower local authorities or other agencies as well as tenants to make complaints to the Private Rented Housing Panel.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-01-15.S3W-19355.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80349" speakername="Stewart Maxwell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0115.htm#32">

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 makes it clear that the Private Rented Housing Panel (PRHP) deals with complaints on repairing standard issues from tenants only. This Standard, which was introduced by the 2006 act, updated the landlord&rsquo;s repairing obligations in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Those obligations could be enforced only by tenants taking court action. The PRHP was established to make it easier for tenants to seek redress.</p>

  <p>As the Policy Memorandum for the Housing (Scotland) Bill explained in 2005, the possibility of having the repairing standard enforced directly against landlords by local authorities or an equivalent agency was considered. This would have been on the model of a local authority taking direct action on houses below the tolerable standard or in serious disrepair, by serving a statutory notice. However it was decided that the underlying principle of the 2006 act, that the householder should have prime responsibility for his or her housing conditions, should apply. The intention was to strengthen the existing mechanism for tenants to act on repair issues, rather than replace it with additional direct regulation by local authorities or other agencies. Since the idea of local authorities directly enforcing the repairing standard has been rejected, it would not be appropriate for local authorities to have the power to complain to a tribunal about breaches of the standard.</p>

  <p>Local authorities already have powers to take direct action on sub-standard houses, the condition of which may also constitute breaches of some requirements of the repairing standard. These powers will be strengthened by the implementation of other provisions in the 2006 act. Local authorities also have an important role in informing tenants about their right to complain to the PRHP, advising them how to go about making a complaint, and, if necessary, assisting them to do so. The Scottish Government strongly encourages local authorities to provide such advice and assistance.</p>

  <p>We therefore have no plans to allow anyone other than tenants to apply to the PRHP.</p>

Local authorities have various powers and duties in relation to overcrowded houses and their occupants, including carrying out inspections to identify overcrowded houses and taking levels of overcrowding into account in the preparation of local housing strategies.</p>

  <p>Where a house is the only or principal residence of three or more people, who are members of more than two families, and it is not specifically exempted by legislation, it is a house in multiple occupation (HMO). The owner of an HMO is required to obtain a licence from the local authority. The licence will specify conditions for the operation of the premises, including the maximum number of occupants. Local authorities have a responsibility to identify unlicensed HMOs and powers to take enforcement action where HMOs are operating without a licence or there is a breach of licensing conditions.</p>

  <p>All private landlords are required to register with the local authorities within whose areas they let houses. A local authority will only register a landlord if they consider that person to be fit and proper to act as such. It is a criminal offence to let houses without being registered. Local authorities undertake a range of activities to identify unregistered landlords and have a range of enforcement powers to use against them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to work with all local authorities to ensure that they make full use of their existing powers.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have powers to identify issues of overcrowding under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. To help address overcrowding, local authorities and registered social landlords are required to give reasonable preference in the allocation of their housing to those people living in overcrowded houses or those with large families. They also have responsibility for ensuring that houses in multiple occupation are licensed and that licensing conditions, including those relating to maximum occupancy, are complied with. Local authorities have a range of powers to deal with issues of poor housing quality and the landlord registration provisions allow them to refuse registration to those people who are not fit and proper to let houses.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government strongly encourages local authorities to make full use of all of the powers at their disposal.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides funding to local authorities through Private Sector Housing Grant to help meet the cost of priority house condition works. In 2008-09, Glasgow City Council received &pound;10.66 million out of a national budget of &pound;67 million. Glasgow City Council also received &pound;83 milllion Housing Association Grant in 2008-09 to help meet the city&rsquo;s housing needs. The council&rsquo;s allocation has been maintained against tight funding pressures in 2008-09. It is for the council to decide how these resources are best allocated to address the housing needs of the city.</p>

  <p>Whilst the problem of teenage gangs is not exclusive to the West of Scotland available evidence gathered by the police suggests that is where the problem is greatest. One of the areas worst affected is the east end of Glasgow, and that is why the Scottish Government announced on 12 December 2008 a &pound;1.6 million funding package to support the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) project. The project will bring together a range of partners from the police, education, social work, health, employment and the community to tackle this long standing problem, delivering coordinated intensive support services, diversionary activities and intelligence led enforcement. The project will be fully evaluated and we hope that the positive findings can, where appropriate, will be replicated in other parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) are currently looking at this issue. This in turn has led the Scottish Command and Control User Group to set up a small working group, under the Deputy Project Manager of the National Command and Control Project, to prepare a National Standard for Incident Recording. This will incorporate the definition of an &quot;incident&quot; and set out a common minimum recording standard.</p>

  <p>In relation to the recording of crimes and offences, action has already been taken to improve consistency in the way crimes are recorded in Scotland. The Scottish Crime Recording Standard (SCRS) was introduced throughout all Scottish Police Forces on 1 April 2004. The main aim of this was to provide a more victim orientated approach that ensured uniformity in crime recording standards throughout Scotland. The list of crime codes used to record crimes is consistent across all police forces in Scotland, and allows Scotland-level statistics to be created. This ultimately ensures a greater degree of comparability between forces than there was previously.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Crime Registrars Group (SCRG), created to oversee change in all forces, has helped achieve a more standardised approach to recording. The group consists of the eight police force crime registrars, as well as representatives from British Transport Police, the Ministry of Defence Police and the Justice Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government. The group meets every three months to review, maintain and improve the SCRS and its use and implementation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continually strives to improve the way in which crimes and offences are recorded in Scotland, and will work with all police forces across Scotland, the SCRG and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to ensure that the rules in place ensure as much consistency and uniformity as possible.</p>

  <p>Some elements of Part 8 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 are currently in force. Section 105(1), purchase of alcohol by or for a child or young person, came into force from 1 June 2006 (subject to a number of transitional provisions).</p>

  <p>For recorded crime data, section 105(1) is covered within a crime code that also contains offences relating to a number of other legislations. It is not therefore possible to find the number of recorded offences that solely relate to section 105(1) of the 2005 act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Criminal Proceedings database has no records up to 2006-07 (the most recent published data) of prosecutions under Part 8 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, most of which does not come into force until 1 September 2009.

  <p>Last year Scottish ministers passed a Direction in exercise of the powers conferred in section 15(3) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. This instructed the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland not to undertake a review of any local government area from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2011, other than (a) a review of boundary issues between two or more local authority areas, which potentially directly affects not more than 300 electors, or (b) a review which is required by a direction made under section 15(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.</p>

  <p>The Local Government Boundary Commission is currently conducting reviews in three areas. The commission published its proposals for the local authority area boundary between Glasgow City and North Lanarkshire at Cardowan by Stepps on 31 October 2008. The commission has commenced reviews concerning two other locations where housing development has taken place across a local authority boundary. These are at Fithiebank, on the boundary between Dundee City and Angus, and at Robroyston, on the boundary between Glasgow City and East Dunbartonshire.</p>

  <p>The commission completed its most recent statutory reviews wards for local government in 2006. Its next reviews of these have not begun, and are due to report between 2014 and 2018.</p>

  <p>The significant reduction in ring fencing under the concordat has been of substantial benefit to local authorities.

  <p>I visited the Department for International Development (DFID) in East Kilbride on 7 November 2008 where I met the Head of DFID&rsquo;s Headquarters in Scotland who is also the Director of East and Central Africa. We discussed the Scottish Government&rsquo;s International Development Policy.</p>

  <p>I wrote to the Secretary of State for International Development on 6 July 2007 expressing the hope that we could meet in the near future. I have not had a response to that request.</p>

  <p>As indicated in my reply to your question on 20 September 2007, final approval would be granted following review of a Full Business Case. This has now taken place and approval was given to NHS Lothian on 22 December 2008. Financial close is scheduled to be reached by the end of January 2009, with work on site commencing soon after. It is anticipated that the new facility will be operational in the summer of 2010.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that processes are in place to ensure that staff who have retired from the NHS after the introduction of Agenda for Change receive their full pension entitlements based on their revised salaries.</p>

  <p>In such cases, health board payroll offices submit amended retirement forms to the Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA). Once SPPA receive all required information the retirement benefits are revised accordingly. SPPA then pay arrears of pension and additional lump sums as appropriate.</p>

  <p>Both health boards and SPPA are working hard to ensure any revised retirement benefits are processed as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>As a result of an approach by the British Medical Association, the issue of free accommodation for FY1 doctors in Scotland was looked at. It was noted that there are recruitment and retention issues for this group of staff in Wales and that this provision had been retained as an interim arrangement. It was concluded that there are currently no significant recruitment and retention issues affecting this group of staff in Scotland which would require the reinstatement of this provision. However, it is open to individual NHS boards to make decisions in relation to the provision of free accommodation in the best interests of the service.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Health Directorates recently facilitated discussions between the British Medical Association (BMA) and NHS Scotland employers in relation to travel and relocation expenses for doctors in training.</p>

  <p>These talks resulted in an interim agreement, covering the period August 2007 to July 2009, on arrangements for specialty trainees. No arrangements were agreed for foundation year doctors in the course of these discussions.</p>

  <p>Employers and the BMA agreed to review this interim agreement from May 2009 and further discussions are therefore planned for that time.</p>

  <p>Compliance with the Working Time Regulations (WTR) is the responsibility of NHS boards as employers. The Scottish Government aims to help the NHS to achieve compliance and continues to issue guidance, disseminate information on good practice and hold WTR seminars to help boards plan rotas and design services in order to achieve compliance.</p>

  <p>Last year all NHS Scotland boards were asked to share their plans for ensuring that their junior doctors reach compliance with the Scottish Government, and our WTR Advisers subsequently met with all boards to discuss their plans. Good progress is being made towards the target with significant redesign and investment in service modernisation already undertaken. New and expanded roles have been developed and out of hour care significantly re-modelled as the hospital at night approach has been introduced.</p>

  <p>I am aware that there are some boards for whom the target will be hard to achieve because of their remote and rural location and also some specialities such as neurosurgery which are likely to be challenging and may require national solutions.</p>

  <p>I am receiving regular updates on the position and will consider what further options and developments can be introduced which will continue to assist the boards in achieving and maintaining compliance at and beyond August 2009.</p>

  <p>Junior doctors hold a training agreement with NES (NHS Education for Scotland) for their seven or eight year training programme, but because they work in different boards during training, they are employed on a series of short term employment contracts by each of the boards they work for during the training period.</p>

  <p>Foundation Year doctors are employed on four month contracts, LATs/FTSTAs and STs on one year contracts. SPRs are variable but longer than one year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not request information from NHS boards on the numbers of staff or details of staff taking special leave as this is an issue for the board as the employer. In addition, we do not request information on staff who have or are suspended as again this is an issue for the board as an employer. Therefore this information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that special leave includes carers, bereavement and compassionate leave as well as suspensions.</p>

  <p>Each board will decide how they record such data in accordance with the local policy.</p>

  <p>There are a number of changes to the VAT rules that impact on NHS Scotland beyond the temporary savings resulting from the reduction to the standard rate of VAT. It is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the overall impact resulting from these changes. For example, changes to the rules in respect of some services procured by NHS bodies will lead to permanent increases in VAT payments on an annual basis. The Scottish Government is contacting HM Treasury to press for recompense resulting from the loss of funding relating to this change. At this stage, it is not possible to determine the response of HM Treasury and therefore we cannot accurately estimate the total level of VAT payments of NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>The planning of the workforce, including Specialist Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Nurses, is a matter for NHS boards who are responsible for planning services in their area based on clinical need.</p>

  <p>In doing so they are required to consider the role of both specialist nurses and nurses with a broader remit working in the community, as part of their plans to make sure that services meet the needs of people living with long-term conditions.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) has been consulting on draft generic and specific standards applicable for Neurological Health Services, including Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. The publication of the standards is likely to take place in summer 2009, and NHS boards across Scotland will be expected to comply with both generic and the specific standards drafted by NHS QIS.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service provides support for the families of prisoners in a number of ways. The majority of prisons in Scotland have Family Contact Development Officers who are an important point of contact for prisoners and their families and who are available to offer information and advice. The Scottish Prison Service also works positively with third sector partners in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for families affected by imprisonment and are currently undertaking a review of visit facilities across the estate.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The actual saving will depend on the value of qualifying expenditure incurred by SPS during this period. Such information and the expenditure distribution by prison are not available. However, based on the expenditure profile during the current year, it is estimated that the reduction in VAT for this period will save the Scottish Prison Service around &pound;3 to 4 million.</p>

  <p>Prior to determining the most suitable method of dealing with an offender, under current legislation the court may make further enquiry into the offender&rsquo;s physical or mental condition and background circumstances. Any reports furnished to court for these purposes are copied to the prison to coincide with the offender&rsquo;s admission.</p>

  <p>Prisoners who are suffering from mental illness who cannot be managed in a prison setting may be transferred to hospital for treatment. Following transfer, prisoners may remain in hospital and be rehabilitated through the mental health system if appropriate If a prisoner is returned from hospital to prison, a Care Programme Approach meeting will be held prior to return to prison, which includes representatives from the Prison Health Centre, to develop a package of care for monitoring and managing the patient on return to prison.</p>

  <p>On occasions where prison health officials identify a potential gap in a medical history, contact may be made directly with the offender&rsquo;s general practitioner.</p>

  <p>The Civil Recovery Unit acts on behalf of the Scottish ministers as the enforcement authority for Scotland under Part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Under those provisions, civil proceedings may be brought in the Court of Session for the recovery of property which has been obtained through crime. Civil proceedings may also be brought in the sheriff court for the forfeiture of cash which has been obtained through crime or which is intended for use in crime.</p>

  <p>The total annual running costs for the Civil Recovery Unit in each year since 2003, including all staff and case related costs, amount to:</p>

  <p>2003-04: &pound;526,000</p>

  <p>2004-05: &pound;1,149,000</p>

  <p>2005-06: &pound;1,300,000</p>

  <p>2006-07: &pound;1,043,000</p>

  <p>2007-08: &pound;1,334,000.</p>

  <p>In 2003, the Criminal Confiscation Unit was responsible for the administration of restraint and criminal confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. That unit was merged with the Fraud and Specialist Services Unit in June 2004 to create the Financial Crime Unit. The Financial Crime Unit now forms part of the National Casework Division at Crown Office. National Casework Division now comprises of the Organised Crime Unit, Financial Crime Unit and the Proceeds of Crime Unit.</p>

  <p>Separate running costs in respect of the administration of restraint and criminal confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act are not available, as the Financial Crime Unit and now the National Casework Division have significant additional responsibilities, including, but not exclusively, the preparation and prosecution of serious and complex fraud, money laundering and organised crime cases. It is not possible to extract costs dedicated to the Proceeds of Crime Unit from the total running costs of the National Casework Division.</p>

  <p>The total annual running costs for the Criminal Confiscation Unit, Financial Crime Unit and National Casework Division in each year since 2003, including all staff and case related costs, amount to:</p>

  <p>2003-04: &pound;559,000 (Criminal Confiscation Unit)</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and its agencies, covered by its Resourcing Policy, carries out pre-appointment checks for all staff employed either on permanent or fixed term contracts. These include nationality checks and where necessary asking prospective applicants to provide documentary evidence that they have the right to work in the UK.</p>

  <p>There have not been any changes in the way the Scottish Government handles applications specifically from foreign nationals since May 2007.

  <p>It is not for the Scottish Government to comment on recommendations made by the Accounts Commission in relation to councils.

  <p>The Scottish Government has work underway to improve the range and quality of equality information across the public sector. This work includes promoting the use of harmonised questions on equalities which will allow for comparison of data from different sources and will involve investigating the possibility of boosts to large scale social surveys.</p>

  <p>In the light of the study&rsquo;s findings, Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 6 Annex 2 now recommends that planning authorities should consider tourism and recreational issues when processing applications from developers.</p>

  <p>The government believes that Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 6 Renewable Energy provides a sound national policy context for addressing onshore wind farm development and the protection of Scotland&rsquo;s natural heritage. It says that significant protection should be afforded to areas designated for their regional, national or international natural heritage value, for example National Parks and National Scenic Areas, through planning authorities&rsquo; spatial frameworks for wind farms over 20 megawatts and says that the integrity of such areas should not be compromised. The SPP also identifies impacts on the landscape as an issue for assessing applications and this is part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process.</p>

  <p>One of the key conclusions of the Economic Impact of Wind Farms on Scottish Tourism was that government policy to pursue growth in the use of renewables was not incompatible with policy to encourage growth in tourism revenues.</p>

  <p>Rural Priorities can only be applied for on-line and one of the main advantages of this is that it helps guide people to the information that is relevant to their particular situation, thereby making it more straightforward to complete. The Scottish Government recognise that this may present some difficulties for some applicants, and for this reason is continuing to work actively to provide assistance for potential applicants. A series of workshops and surgeries have been held by SEARS staff and organisations such as NFUS to provide an introduction to Rural Priorities and further workshops may be undertaken if local demand is sufficient.</p>

  <p>Further assistance available includes:</p>

  <p>Identifying liaison officers in every region to develop local solutions to internet access;</p>

  <p>Working with BT to extend broadband coverage across rural Scotland;</p>

  <p>Providing IT helpdesk to assist with login problems;</p>

  <p>Providing applicants with information about alternative local internet access points;</p>

  <p>Providing training material to NFUS for use in one to one surgeries across the country, and</p>

  <p>Part-funding for applicants who choose to use agents services.</p>

  <p>We take concerns very seriously and these will be taken account in my recently announced review of the Rural Priorities mechanism.</p>

  <p>The Statement of Intent is the first of a two stage application process to the Rural Development Contracts - Rural Priorities. The statement of intent allows applicants to register their interest in Rural Priorities and give an outline of their ideas under the scheme. Case officers use the statement of intent to give feedback on the suitability of these ideas based on the regional priorities, and detail any financial constraint or negative impacts evident.</p>

  <p>On that basis, the statement of intent is working effectively. The statement of intent allows an applicant, before committing significant expenditure or personal time, to make an informed choice before progressing to the second stage of the application process, full proposal.</p>

  <p>The Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP) is designed to support all those who engage in agricultural activity in Scotland. There are no regional budgets within the Programme and hence transfers do not occur between regions of Scotland. Support to land managers is mainly delivered by the SRDP through Land Managers&rsquo; Options (LMOs) and Rural Priorities (RPs). LMOs is non-competitive and payable to all those who are eligible and apply for support. Rural Priorities is competitive and support will be offered to those who are eligible and best able to deliver Scottish Government outcomes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government uses the Government Procurement Card (GPC), a branded Visa Purchasing Card that enables Public Sector buyers to benefit from cost and process efficiency savings in their purchasing of high-volume, lower-value goods and services (generally below &pound;5,000 per transaction), and allows suppliers to benefit by being paid a few days (three-four days) after despatching the goods/delivering the services.</p>

  <p>The procurement cards are provided to the UK Public Sector through a UK Framework Agreement between OGCbuying.solutions, Visa and six Visa issuing banks. Our GPC contract is with Barclaycard. It covers the core Directorates and the Executive Agencies and other bodies that use our finance system.</p>

  <p>The GPC Framework Agreement also covers a separate travel and subsistence (T&amp;S) card which is issued to those members of staff who frequently incur travel and accommodation costs whilst on business.</p>

  <p>There are currently 1,122 GPC&rsquo;s and 346 T&amp;S cards in use across all organisations that use the Scottish Government contract.</p>

  <p>Barclaycard submits a monthly statement for payment and this is paid in full within 14 days of receipt of the statement in line with the terms of the contract. Currently there is nothing due to pay. The level of expenditure incurred using the GPC and T&amp;S cards varies from month to month but, as an indication, the average monthly balance on the statements is &pound;609,000.</p>

  <p>The Improvement Service (IS) exists to support local authorities in their drive towards continuous improvement in service delivery. It was set up as a company limited by guarantee in 2005 by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA), the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (SOLACE) and Scottish ministers. As part of the concordat between the Scottish Government and COSLA, it was agreed that the IS would be governed wholly by local government, through COSLA and SOLACE. Scottish ministers therefore withdrew from the company. The IS was funded directly by the Scottish Government for the first three years; from 2008-09 core funding has been transferred to local government and is included within the total funding package. The Scottish Government still provides funds for delivery of specific services.</p>

  <p>One reference has been made to the Scottish Law Commission since May 2007, in November 2007. Ministers invited the Commission to consider the law relating to Rights of Appeal, Double Jeopardy and Evidential Questions. The Scottish Law Commission is dealing with the reference as three separate projects. Its Report on Crown Appeals was published in July 2008. The Double Jeopardy report is expected later in 2009 with the report on the other matters in 2010 or 2011.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made no estimation of the savings to local authorities as a result of the reduction in VAT nor did we take the reduction of VAT into account in the calculation of the 2009-10 local government finance settlement. Section 33 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 provides all local authorities with the power to recover VAT incurred from supplies of goods and services received so any savings to Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities would be at the margins.</p>

  <p>The main mechanism used for the collection of waste data from local authorities is the waste data flow system. This is a web-based system used by all local authorities in Scotland to report their waste arisings, recycling levels and disposal. The system is also used to monitor the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled under the Landfill Allowance Scheme. In addition, waste data is collected from other sources including waste management licence operator returns, the register of exemptions and supplementary surveys. the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) have overall responsibility for the collation and management of all data collected.</p>

  <p>The waste data gathered is used in various ways. For example, SEPA use it to produce publications such as the <em>Waste Data Digest</em>, which is an annual publication that sets out key waste facts and trends. The data is also used for target setting, performance and compliance monitoring, meeting reporting requirements and of course policy development. Further information on how the data is used can be found on SEPA&rsquo;s website.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the concordat it is the responsibility of individual local authorities to determine how best to manage any business waste collected. Accordingly, we do not intend to place an obligation on local authorities to provide recycling services for business waste. The Scottish Government does however encourage local authorities to recycle business waste whenever possible.</p>

  <p>It should of course be remembered that facilities already exist in a number of local authority areas to allow businesses to recycle their waste, and the Waste Aware Scotland Website has an excellent search facility to allow businesses to locate recycling facilities in their area. Additionally, Waste Aware Scotland are running a Waste Aware Business Campaign that aims to raise awareness of how businesses can deal with their waste more sustainably.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government do not believe that energy from waste should be classified as recycling. This view is in line with Article 3 of the revised Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC which defines recycling as meaning:</p>

  <p>&quot;any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations&quot;.</p>

  <p>The revised EU Waste Framework Directive does attribute different definitions to these terms, so local authorities will need to take account of these definitions when developing their plans for management of waste. However, it should be noted that these definitions are consistent with current Scottish Government policy and delivery of Zero Waste Scotland, so there should be no need to do anything differently.</p>

  <p>Local authorities currently provide waste data returns to Scottish Environment Protection Agency that cover waste recycling, composting, other recovery and disposal operations and we would not expect that to change as a result of the revised EU Waste Framework Directive. Re-use activities are not currently reported separately, and the revised Waste Framework Directive provisions do not place any new requirement on member states to do so. Nevertheless, we will consider wider reporting needs and requirements as part of the review of the National Waste Plan.</p>

  <p>Dumping of sewage sludge is illegal. Sewage sludge may be legally disposed of to landfill or by incineration, or recovered, notably to land. In any of these cases, regulatory requirements apply.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to introduce a national policy on the use of treated sewage.</p>

  <p>In May 2008, Scottish Water published its own National Sludge Strategy which identifies the organisation&rsquo;s long term strategy for the management of sludge in Scotland. The Executive Summary of this document may be found at the following link:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not produce or treat sewage sludge, or regulate its disposal or recovery. Accordingly, information on exact locations where this disposal or recovery has taken place is not held centrally. This is a matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency or Scottish Water.</p>

  <p>Statistics on the amount of sewage sludge recovered/disposed of in Scotland in each of the last four years are available on the Scottish Government website at the following link:</p>

  <p>Please note that the figures for 2004-05 and 2005-06 indicate &quot;post-digestion&quot; sludge quantities. From 2006-07 onwards &quot;pre-digestion&quot; sludge results were reported, therefore the data from these different time periods is not comparable.</p>

  <p>1. Financial year information is not available before 1995.</p>

  <p>2. Includes offences relating to wild birds, their nests and eggs.</p>

  <p>3. Includes the illegal trapping, poisoning and setting of baits for wild birds, amongst other offences.</p>

  <p>4. Includes the possession and sale of eggs taken from wild birds, amongst other offences.</p>

  <p>The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) has established a network of specialist wildlife prosecutors across its 11 operational areas in Scotland.</p>

  <p>These specialist prosecutors will normally receive and prepare relevant cases, as well as prosecuting them in court. Specialist wildlife prosecutors are provided with appropriate guidance material, and also training and development opportunities, to equip them to carry out their duties effectively. In common with other guidance provided to procurators fiscal on the prosecution of crime, its detail are confidential because the publication of such information would allow offenders to attempt to circumvent the law by restricting their offending to conduct which falls short of a prosecution threshold.</p>

  <p>Both the Lord Advocate and I accepted the recommendations of the &quot;Natural Justice&quot; Report following the joint thematic inspection of the arrangements in Scotland for preventing, investigating and prosecuting wildlife crime by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland (HMICS) and the Inspectorate of Prosecution in Scotland (IPS) in so far as these relate to COPFS. One of the recommendations is that COPFS should &quot;carry out a training needs assessment for specialist wildlife prosecutors and provide a suitable training package for both newly appointed specialists and on-going training.&quot; That training needs assessment is underway. In addition, COPFS officials are working closely with Scottish Government, police, and other colleagues to support the development of the Scottish Partnership Against Wildlife Crime (PAW (Scotland) sub-groups recommended by the review team, most notably the Training and Awareness sub-group and also the Legislation, Regulation &amp; Guidance sub-group.</p>

  <p>Training for the judiciary is promoted by the Judicial Studies Committee and not by COPFS.</p>

  <p>The National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) gathers, processes and redistributes intelligence according to the principles outlined in the National Intelligence Model. This model allows police forces, and their support units such as the NWCU, to gather intelligence across more than one force, analyse it and then use it to inform decisions.</p>

  <p>In considering the Gordonbush wind farm application, Scottish Ministers, as the competent authority, undertook an appropriate assessment of the development&rsquo;s impacts on the integrity of the Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands Special Protection Area (SPA), which included the impacts on Golden Plover which is one of the qualifying interests of the SPA. The appropriate assessment was published when the application was consented and can be found on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>In the light of the study&rsquo;s findings, Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 6 Annex 2 now recommends that planning authorities should consider tourism and recreational issues when processing applications from developers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 6 Renewable Energy provides a sound national policy context for addressing onshore wind farm development and the protection of Scotland&rsquo;s natural heritage. It says that significant protection should be afforded to areas designated for their national or international natural heritage value, for example national parks and national scenic areas, through planning authorities&rsquo; spatial frameworks for wind farms over 20 megawatts and says that the integrity of such areas should not be compromised. The SPP also identifies impacts on the landscape as an issue for assessing applications and this is part of the environmental impact assessment process.</p>

  <p>Moreover, one of the key messages of <em>The Economic Impact of Wind Farms on Scottish Tourism</em> report was that government policy to pursue growth in the use of renewables was not incompatible with policy to encourage growth in tourism revenues.</p>
