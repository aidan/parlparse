  <p>No specific research has been carried out into the needs of older women in relation to domestic abuse and other forms of violence. Results from the <i>Scottish Crime Survey 2000</i> suggest, however, that older women are less likely to be victims of violence. The <i>National Strategy to Address Domestic Abuse in Scotland</i> contains a recommendation about the provision of refuge, and other services, to meet the needs of women who may not currently have access to such services, including older women and it recognises that older women may have special need in accessing provision.</p>

  <p>The remit of the Public Health Institute for Scotland (PHIS) is &quot;to protect and improve the health of the people of Scotland by working with relevant agencies and organisations to increase the understanding of the determinants of ill health, help formulate public health policy and increase the effectiveness of the public health endeavour&quot;. Copies of the PHIS Work Programme were sent to all organisations involved in health improvement, both inside and outside the NHS, and to all MSPs and MPs on 4 January 2002 and is available on the PHIS website. Several significant milestones were achieved in 2001.</p>

  <p>Profiles of every parliamentary constituency were published in March 2001, highlighting the range of factors influencing health.</p>

  <p>In conjunction with the Scottish Executive, PHIS supported the development of the new LHCC Public Health Practitioner (PHP) posts, most of whom were in post by the end of 2001.</p>

  <p>PHIS had a significant input into the induction programmes for the new unified NHS boards.</p>

  <p>PHIS led a consultation exercise on the contribution of health promotion to health improvement.</p>

  <p>to assemble the public health evidence base, and</p>

  <p>to support the development of public health skills among different agencies and occupational groups and in communities.</p>

  <p>In response to this, PHIS submitted a work programme which was approved by the CMO, CNO and PHFIG and subsequently published. This sets out the projects which they will undertake over the next two years to help achieve these aims, along with associated timescales.</p>

  <p>In June 2000 the Accounts Commission and Scottish Homes published a report on <i>Managing Rent Arrears</i> , which recommended actions that should be taken by local authorities and registered social landlords to improve their management of rent arrears.

  <p>Although ministers expect that council house sales should take no longer than six months to complete, there is no statutory time limit within which sales must be completed.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are encouraged to complete sales within six months through the inclusion of this target in the list of key housing performance indicators collated and published by the Accounts Commission. Their most recent report, published on 17 January 2002, showed that the percentage of houses sold in 26 weeks or less rose from 60.2% in 1999-2000 to 64.6% in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Housing (Scotland) Act introduced a single regulatory framework for local authorities and registered social landlords. This means that, in future, Communities Scotland will be assessing councils in relation to a number of performance standards, including the efficient processing of Right to Buy applications.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 allows tenants to seek a reduction in the purchase price equal to the amount of rent paid if landlords fail to process applications at particular stages within specified time limits. This is also intended to encourage landlords to process applications without unreasonable delay.</p>

  <p>There are no rules preventing witnesses from being prepared for court by explaining to them what will happen and providing visits to court for young or vulnerable witnesses. Preparation of this type is often done. To coach witnesses in the sense of telling them what to say would undermine their credibility and reliability and might well amount to a criminal offence.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the meeting between the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning and the Secretary of State for Transport, whether the Strategic Rail Authority&#8217;s strategic plan will be amended to confirm that airport links to Edinburgh Airport and Glasgow Airport will go ahead within five years and what the reasons are for the position on this matter.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) intends to carry out an annual revision of their strategic plan. This is to take account of changes in the industry, the outcomes of various studies currently under way, the emerging Joint Transport Studies, and the responses of stakeholders. The Scottish Executive, in partnership with Scottish Enterprise, the British Airports Authority and the SRA, is leading a detailed economic and engineering study of the various options available for rail links to Edinburgh Airport and Glasgow Airport. At the appropriate time the conclusion of the study will feed through into the annual revision of the SRA's strategic plan.</p>

  <p>The Executive and the SRA hope that, depending on the outcome of the study, the relevant local authorities will be keen to progress the requirement for parliamentary powers, thus making it possible to move to design and construction from 2005, subject to suitable resources being available at the time.</p>

  <p>Two projects are funded by the Executive specifically to support survivors of sexual abuse, including male as well as female rape victims. A number of other projects with a broader remit will also provide support to male rape victims. In addition, the Executive commissioned research in this area which is published in the report, <i>The Experience of Violence and Harassment of Gay Men in the City of Edinburgh</i> . Copies are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 5154).</p>

  <p>In terms of the support provided within the criminal justice system, criminal justice agencies have a shared commitment, enshrined in the <i>Scottish Strategy for Victims</i>, to ensure that all victims, regardless of their gender, are able to access support, assistance and information at all stages in the criminal justice process.</p>

  <p>There is a growing recognition of the needs of victims of sexual offences and every Scottish police force therefore has access to a dedicated rape suite. These facilities may be situated in police stations, hospitals or other suitable locations arranged through their local social work departments.</p>

  <p>Work is also being taken forward by the Scottish Prison Service in prisons, and by local authorities, in the community to provide programmes to tackle sex offending behaviour. For example, initiatives such as the Fife Council community protection team Change Programme and the Tay Project are aimed at addressing the offending behaviour of adult sex offenders as part of criminal justice social work&#8217;s statutory supervision of sex offenders.</p>

  <p>The Weeds Act 1959 does not confer any powers on local authorities to act in relation to ragwort. The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department investigates all written complaints received about the presence of ragwort on land.</p>

  <p>The act places responsibility for control of certain weeds, including ragwort, on the occupier of the land and in the first instance, where livestock may be at risk, the Executive will advise the occupier to carry out control measures. Where necessary and as a last resort, powers are available under the act to give occupiers of land formal written notice requiring them to take action.</p>

  <p>Between 1997 and 2000 two children aged between eight and 12 were proceeded against in Edinburgh courts. In one case a plea of not guilty was accepted and in the other the child was detained.</p>

  <p>Operational statistics for children&#8217;s hearings are a matter for the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration. This information is not held centrally. National statistics are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 18780).</p>

  <p>Referrals to the children&#8217;s hearings system are not prosecutions, but hearings to determine whether compulsory measures of supervision are required in the best interests of the child, whether or not they have offended. A children&#8217;s hearing does not impose a sentence on the child before it. It can either discharge the case, remit it to the sheriff court for proof, or make a supervision requirement in respect of the child, attaching such conditions as the hearing deems appropriate.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-02-01.44.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80277" speakername="Sir David Steel" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0201.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>The Parliament&#8217;s External Liaison Unit is currently aware of 21 high-profile visits to the Parliament in the period from 1 January to 30 April 2002. It is anticipated that a further 20 or so high profile visits can be expected during the period.</p>

  <p>(The term high-profile is used to cover all visits organised by the unit and includes visiting parliamentarians, heads of state, representatives of governments including ministers, ambassadors and high-level officials and senior representatives of international or other organisations. Details of forthcoming visits are available on the External Liaison Unit site on SPEIR. Information is kept on the basis of numbers of visits rather than visitors. The figures given, therefore, include both individual high-profile visitors and group visits to the Parliament.)</p>

  <p>The number of actual similar visits to the Parliament in the same period in 2000 was 20, in line with anticipated volume. In 2001 the figure was 57. This demand was greater than the unit had anticipated and measures have been taken to allow the Parliament to manage better the flow and timetabling through the year of visits of this type. It is anticipated, therefore, that while the number of visits between 1 January and 30 April 2002 will be greater than in the same period in 2000, there will be somewhat fewer than in early 2001.</p>

  <p>The policing requirements of the majority of visits to the Parliament are handled by the Parliament's dedicated Police Unit as part of normal duties. Only a small number of visits, depending on the status of the visitor, require a wider input from Lothian and Borders Police or Specialist Departments. There is close liaison between the parliamentary staff handling visits and the police to ensure that any implications for police resources can be taken into account as far in advance as possible. The police services, however, are aware of the need to police the many important visitors to Edinburgh each year and build that commitment into normal budget planning.</p>
