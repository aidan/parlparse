  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to increasing the provision of locally-based energy generated in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have tripled funding support for community and microgeneration projects for the next three years.</p>

  <p>In June we launched an &pound;18.8 million Climate Challenge Fund with the aim of supporting communities across Scotland to take action to reduce emissions. Communities are already coming forward under this scheme to seek support for feasibility studies and capacity building activity to support renewable energy projects.</p>

  <p>Later this year we will seek views on how to increase locally-based energy generation as part of our draft framework for the development and deployment of renewable energy in Scotland. That document will set out a wide range of proposals, including, a draft action plan for renewable heat, and measures to support locally-based community renewable projects. We will also issue an action plan on energy efficiency and microgeneration in the near future.</p>

  <p>We will shortly consult on a draft framework for the development and deployment of renewable energy in Scotland. This will seek views on how to promote distributed energy systems, which includes the more efficient generation of both electricity and heat at the household and community scale using renewables and other low carbon energy sources.</p>

  <p>In the area of building standards, we are taking forward recommendations from the Sullivan Report for research to find ways to encourage low carbon local energy centres.</p>

  <p>There are a range of potential technologies, some of which are still in development, that can reduce emissions, such as carbon capture, supercritical boilers, or flue gas desulphurisation. The package of energy and climate change directives being negotiated by the European Union will drive the development of necessary technologies to reduce emissions associated with burning coal.</p>

  <p>We will shortly be consulting on guidance in relation to consent for construction of thermal power stations, and this will seek views on requirements in respect of emissions reduction.</p>

  <p>Levels of carbon emissions, sulphur and other pollutants from coal-fired power stations are strictly regulated by EU emissions and air quality legislation. The European Union is currently negotiating its Climate and Energy package, which includes new and revised directives on Carbon Capture and Storage, the Emissions Trading Scheme and industrial emissions.</p>

  <p>These new directives will set the framework for what levels of emissions will be considered acceptable from coal-fired power stations in future to meet the EU&rsquo;s agreed target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020.</p>

  <p>Investment in clean coal technologies in Scotland is largely a matter for the private sector promoted by regulation in relation to carbon emissions. However, financial support is required for demonstration of carbon capture and storage and we have urged the UK Government to move quickly in that respect.</p>

  <p>In the current financial year, the Scottish Government has contributed &pound;75,000 to the Scottish Centre for Carbon Storage towards the Scottish carbon capture and storage (CCS) joint study, which will identify storage sites for carbon captured from future thermal power stations, as well as addressing transportational and economic issues. This supports funding from a range of private sector partners.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise has awarded R&amp;D Plus funding support of &pound;2.84 million over the current spending review period to Doosan Babcock for the creation of a research centre specialising in research into clean coal and CCS technologies. This funding was announced on 1 July.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are currently further developing the business plan for the Scottish European Green Energy Centre, which will foster research and commercialisation opportunities for Scottish universities and industry including in clean coal technologies.</p>

  <p>The composition of Scotland&rsquo;s future electricity generation will be dependent on a number of factors, including relative cost of fuels, requirements in relation to carbon emissions and related investment decisions made by the private sector. Therefore, we do not have a specific prediction for coal-based generation.</p>

  <p>It will be for the industry to bring forward proposals for new or replacement capacity, and Scottish ministers will consider each on its merits under our consenting powers in the Electricity Act 1989. We will be consulting shortly on new guidance for applications for consent to construct thermal power generation.</p>

  <p>It is likely that thermal baseload, utilising carbon reducing technology, will be required into the future to help meet security of supply objectives.</p>

  <p>If fitted with carbon capture and storage equipment, estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are that emissions from coal-fired generation would fall by up to 90%.</p>

  <p>Where renewable energy replaces thermal generation without carbon capture and storage, a significant reduction in carbon emissions may also be expected.</p>

  <p>The current Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) competition being run by the UK Government sets a deadline of 2014 for the chosen project to be operational on a commercial scale. We are hopeful that a Scottish based project will win that competition.</p>

  <p>We are also playing an enabling role to assist the development of CCS more generally such as funding research into identifying future carbon stores and participating in the UK Energy Bill&rsquo;s provisions on carbon storage.</p>

  <p>We believe that all of this work will ensure that CCS technologies will be ready for deployment in Scotland at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

  <p>The scale and seriousness of the financial problem faced by Aberdeen City Council have been apparent to all since the Accounts Commission report was published in May 2008. This has clearly built up over a number of years. I have made clear from the outset and on a number of occasions that it will be up to the council to address the issue and that this must be the first priority of all those involved.</p>

  <p>The council now has a recovery programme in place and is being supported to deliver the programme by COSLA which has established an External Support Panel of leading elected members and senior officers in local government. However, the steps which the council takes to resolve its financial position must ultimately be a matter for it and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</p>

  <p>The information requested could only be obtained in full at disproportionate cost. However, in October 2007, the Scottish Government published a baseline list of the 199 national public sector organisations in Scotland, which this Government has committed to reducing by 25% by 2011. This number has already reduced from 199 to 166.

  <p>The Scottish Government has a well established set of disaster recovery and business continuity plans (BCP), which are kept under constant review. These plans are being revised in the light of recent internal restructuring of the organisation. In addition, the Scottish Government Strategic Board has endorsed a refreshed business continuity planning policy and the Government&rsquo;s centralised continuity plans are also being reviewed. As part of the programme of continual review, the strategic board has also agreed that the government&rsquo;s Scottish Resilience Unit should invite directorates and agencies to undertake a self-evaluation of policy areas which contribute (or could contribute) to the long-term development of resilience policy, which will take cognizance of the guidance offered by the National Resilience Planning Assumptions (NRPAs) developed by the UK Cabinet Office in partnership with devolved government.</p>

  <p>At a UK level, Cabinet Office is currently reviewing the way in which the new BCP (BS 25999) standard is to be treated within the civil service, in consultation with other branches of government, including the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to use the Royal Mail for its mail services. Officials meet regularly with representatives of Royal Mail to discuss a range of issues covering service provision.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-9304 on 19 February 2008. Postal services are a matter wholly reserved to the UK Government, therefore the Scottish Government&rsquo;s powers to provide direct support to the Post Office network are extremely limited. Nevertheless, the Scottish Government continues to seek ways to add value.</p>

  <p>A number of meetings have taken place between ministers and officials with representatives of Royal Mail Group and Post Office Limited. These meetings primarily dealt with the Network Change Programme and alternative methods of delivering postal services (outreach services), with the aim of ensuring that sustainable business models underpin the Post Office branches that remain after the current Network Change programme is completed.</p>

  <p>In addition, ministers have continued to encourage all Community Planning Partners, particularly local authorities, to consider the opportunities to promote their services alongside local Post Offices to aid their viability.</p>

  <p>There were two complaints under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Dignity at Work policy in 2007, one each in Directorates in the Justice and Communities and Education portfolios respectively, and one so far in 2008 in a Directorate in the Finance and Sustainable Growth portfolio. All of these complaints related to allegations of bullying and harassment. Of these three cases, one case is still on-going, one was withdrawn to allow mediation to take place and one found there was no case to answer. There were no complaints about race discrimination or gender discrimination in 2007 and there have been none in 2008 to date.</p>

  <p>In line with its Dignity at Work policy, the Scottish Government takes all complaints of this nature seriously and strives to ensure that all staff have the opportunity to work in an environment where they feel safe and secure and are not subject to unacceptable behaviour.</p>

  <p>The pay structure in the Scottish Government comprises nine pay ranges. The factors which are used to determine the salary for each member of staff are their performance, the pay range for their post, and length of time spent in that pay range.</p>
