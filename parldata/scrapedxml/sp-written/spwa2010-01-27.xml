  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-30502 by John Swinney on 15 January 2010, whether a local authority that has requested payment of allotment rents from its tenants using rules or devices that have not been formally confirmed by the Scottish Ministers is liable to prosecution.</p>

  <p>Section 6 of the Allotments (Scotland) Act 1892 provides that a local authority may from time to time make, revoke and vary such regulations as appear to be necessary or proper for the letting of allotments (including provision in relation to the rental to be paid for allotments). However, any regulations made by a local authority shall not be in force unless and until they have been confirmed by Scottish ministers, after such publication and inquiry as ministers shall determine. Therefore, any local authority that makes regulations without obtaining confirmation from ministers, have no effect. There is no offence provision in the Allotments (Scotland) Act 1892 in relation to a local authority making regulations without confirmation from ministers.</p>

  <p>The Healthy Start programme in Scotland, is a statutory UK-wide demand-led scheme (formerly known as Welfare Foods). Pregnant women and families with children up to the age of four on certain benefits or tax credits can claim for the Healthy Start Scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government reimburse the Department of Health for the Scottish costs of the scheme. We also reimburse health boards for the cost of the Healthy Start vitamins issued free of charge to beneficiaries and additionally the budget funds the nursery milk scheme.</p>

  <p>The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has given clear recommendation that both Celvapan and Pandemrix vaccines are safe for use in pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy. Both vaccines have been licensed for use in pregnant women by the European Commission and the European Medicines agency (EMEA).</p>

  <p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommend that pregnant women should be given Pandemrix as it provides adequate levels of antibodies following administration of one dose, thereby conferring more rapid protection than Celvapan which requires two doses a minimum of three weeks apart.</p>

  <p>Supplies of the Celvapan vaccine are limited therefore these are being reserved primarily for at-risk people with severe allergic reaction to egg products. Pandemrix is manufactured in hens eggs therefore is unsuitable for people with egg allergies, Celvapan does not contain egg products therefore is suitable for people with egg allergies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not collate information centrally on the supply and demand of planners across Scotland. It is the responsibility of planning authorities to ensure that they have appropriate staff resources in place to meet their statutory responsibilities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government works does however, work with the planning schools, the RTPI, the Local Government Improvement Service and employers to encourage the availability of appropriate professional skills in the planning service.</p>

  <p>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The constitution and composition of prison Visiting Committees (VC) is determined by the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 - Section 8 &quot;Visiting Committees&quot;, Section 19 &quot;Remand centres and young offender institutions&quot; and Section 39 &quot;Rules for the management of prisons and other institutions&quot; which refers to &quot;The Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 2006&quot; which includes Schedule 2 &quot;Constitution of Visiting Committees&quot;.</p>

  <p>Schedule 2 specifies that VC&rsquo;s have a combined membership of elected members from either the local council in which the prison is located or councils that are served by the prison, and also non-elected members who normally reside in the same community, but can also come from further afield.</p>

  <p>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The following table provides the names of the VC members for each prison. We do not hold detailed information on the occupation of VC members as many of them are nominated by local authorities. Moreover in terms of the 1995 Data Protection Act, we are unable to share such personal information.</p>

  <p>We believe that the current legislation governing changes to bus timetables as administered by the Traffic Commissioner strikes the right balance between maintaining a stable network and allowing operators to adjust services to meet commercial needs. A strength of bus as a mode of transport is its ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances when compared to fixed route modes. We also welcome partnership working between operators and local authorities that leads to increased stability of networks.</p>

  <p>Buses and trains work in very different operating environments. We believe that the current legislation governing changes to bus timetables as administered by the Traffic Commissioner strikes the right balance between maintaining a stable network and allowing operators to adjust services to meet commercial needs. The legislation governing rail timetable changes is necessarily less flexible given the limited capacity of the infrastructure and the number of train operators.</p>

  <p>Under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s normal grievance procedures, grievances are dealt with by the local line manager of the complainant and given the sensitivity of these matters, details of cases are not shared. Information on the average time for handling normal grievance procedures is therefore not available.</p>

  <p>Grievances raised under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Dignity at Work policy are co-ordinated by the HR function. Each Directorate General has very few cases and the length of time the process takes, varies depending on the complexity of the case. Across the Scottish Government as a whole, the average time to complete a grievance raised under the Dignity at Work policy, is between four to six months.</p>

  <p>Under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s normal grievance procedures, grievances are handled by local line management and there is no central information available on the numbers of cases raised.</p>

  <p>Grievances raised under the Dignity at Work policy are coordinated within the HR function. It is therefore possible to identify the number of cases raised. The Dignity at Work grievance cases initiated in Director-General Environment are as follows:</p>

  <p>This is a matter for the bodies responsible for the Scottish Beaver Trial (the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland) in consultation with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) who are responsible for monitoring the trial, including the tracking methodologies, under the terms of the licence issued by Scottish ministers. The licence explicitly recognises the need for a suite of tracking methodologies rather than relying too heavily on radio-tracking in light of the practical and animal welfare limitations of that method.</p>
