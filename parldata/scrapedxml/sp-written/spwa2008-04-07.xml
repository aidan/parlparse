  <p>The Independent Funding Review on Free Personal and Nursing Care, chaired by Lord Sutherland, is currently investigating both the level and distribution of resources to local authorities for free personal and nursing care. The Review will not only look back at the previous allocations, but forward to how we deliver effective and sustainable long-term care for Scotland&rsquo;s ageing population.</p>

  <p>We will consider the findings and recommendations of the review when it reports.</p>

  <p>I met a delegation from Orkney Islands Council on 28 February 2008. Among the matters discussed was the additional &pound;1 million in funding which we have now included as part of the council&rsquo;s overall grant, to support the costs of internal ferry services.</p>

  <p>Orkney Islands Council will receive over &pound;230 million in funding from the Scottish Government over the next three years. The core revenue funding to the Council for 2008-09 will increase by 7 per cent, the second highest increase in Scotland. Local authorities, including Orkney Islands Council, are receiving record levels of investment from the Scottish Government along with more freedom and flexibility than ever before.</p>

  <p>The distribution of funding to local authorities is through a needs-based formula, which is agreed with COSLA. This formula takes into account Orkney Islands Council&rsquo;s need to provide services to its island communities which is recognised through the inclusion of the Special Islands Needs Allowance within the distribution formula.</p>

  <p>Orkney Islands Council will receive a 7 per cent increase in core revenue funding in 2008-09, which is the second highest increase to any council in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Local authorities with island communities receive additional provision through the Special Islands Needs Allowance (SINA) within the local government funding distribution formula.

  <p>Whisky and the wider spirits industry make a vital contribution to the Scottish economy. The effect on the whisky industry and the wider Scottish economy of the increase in excise duty announced at budget 2008 will not be known fully for some time. We are exploring ways to assess the long-term impact of this announcement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government works very closely with the Scotch whisky industry and we will continue to express our support for the taxation of spirits based on their alcohol content.</p>
