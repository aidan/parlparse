  <p>The First Minister met Vince Cable, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, and Tavish Scott, Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats on 1 June 2010. The meetings were arranged following the Secretary of State&rsquo;s appointment to the new UK Coalition Government. The issues discussed included economic recovery, access to finance and the UK Government&rsquo;s plans for fiscal consolidation. The First Minister was supported by appropriate Scottish Government officials while the Secretary of State was supported by appropriate UK Government officials.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions it is having with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) regarding effort trading between Scottish and English fishermen.</p>

  <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has decided, for the 2010-11 effort management period, to permit fishing vessels that it administers to transfer days at sea only to other vessels that it administers. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland has taken an equivalent decision in relation to the vessels that it administers.</p>

  <p>It is for each Fisheries Administration (FA) to consider what steps they regard as necessary to manage the effort of their fleets within the portions of UK fishing effort limits that they are responsible for managing. The Scottish Government considers that it may well be possible to allow for some transfers of days at sea between vessels administered by different FAs, but also considers that close monitoring of any such agreements should be agreed in advance. This issue has been raised in discussions with DEFRA and other FAs, and those discussions continue.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold data on individual drug seizures or offences recorded by the eight police forces in Scotland, and does not therefore hold information on the specific locations in which those seizures took place. As a result it is not possible for the Scottish Government to identify what quantity of cannabis has been recovered from cannabis farms in the Lothians in each of the last three years or what the estimated street value was.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold any data on the number of properties which might be classed as sporting estates. Apart from those estates where game sport is the sole or primary activity, sport shooting or angling also takes place on many other properties in Scotland including, for example, on land where the primary business is agriculture or forestry. Recent research conducted as part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Rural Land Use Study has estimated that at least 20% of Scotland&rsquo;s land area is managed mainly for sporting purposes.</p>

  <p>The UK Government announced a review of the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfer) Regulations on 8 July 2010.</p>

  <p>This action will defer the entry into force of the Regulations from 1 October 2010 to <br /> 1 April 2011 but the announcement made clear that ship to ship transfers require some form of regulation.</p>

  <p>Existing operations in several harbour authority areas in Scotland have a good safety record but the environmental impacts of ship to ship transfer operations is a matter of considerable public interest. I will be seeking reassurance that Scottish interests are taken into account in this review.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many prisoners accessed the Violence Prevention Programme while serving a custodial sentence in each of the last three years, broken down by prison.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-07-15.S3W-34680.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0715.htm#9">

  <p>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond.</p>

  <p>The SPS has delivered a range of violence/anger related prisoner programmes during the last three years which has included the Violence Prevention Programme (VPP) and the Anger Management programme, which has now been superceded by the Controlling Anger Regulating Emotions (CARE) programme. The CARE programme consists of 25 sessions totalling 96 hours whereas the Anger Management programme was less intensive, comprising of 8 sessions and a total of 30 hours, consequently more resources are required to deliver the CARE programme.</p>

  <p>This suite of programmes has provided options to address the needs of prisoners convicted of offences for violence/anger and supports appropriate targeting of interventions aligned to a prisoner&rsquo;s level of risk and need.</p>

  <p>The following table details the completions for each of these programmes for the last 3 years. Whilst this highlights a reduction of VPP completions for 2009-10, this reflects appropriate diversion onto the CARE programme as a consequence of the pre-programme assessment.&quot;</p>

  <p>Total number of prisoners who have completed &lsquo;violence/anger related&rsquo; prisoner programmes in Scottish prisons during the last 3 years</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government currently uses a non geographic number, 0845 774 1741, as its published central contact number for the Scottish Government and its directorates. Use of this non geographic number ensures that calls from anywhere in the UK, using the same provider, are charged the same rate regardless of the callers location. There is no revenue sharing on calls to this number.</p>

  <p>The telephony services within the Scottish Government are centrally managed by the Information Services and Information Systems (ISIS) division. ISIS is following the advice of the communications regulator, OFCOM, and is in the process of implementing the use of non geographic 030 numbers for calls to the Scottish Government. Numbers in the 030 range are for the exclusive use of public sector and not-for-profit organisations. All calls to these numbers are charged at no more than the national rate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not conducted any studies to assess the impact on or benefits for different income groups of the use of non-geographic or 03 telephone numbers by public bodies. We understand, however, that the industry regulator, OFCOM, is currently carrying out a review of all non-geographic call services, including 03 telephone numbers, and that the impact on consumers of the use of these numbers by public bodies will be considered as part of this review.</p>
