The service has advised me that it anticipates this work being completed before the end of February 2011, thereafter the revised code will be conveyed to staff with the support of the SAS Learning and Development Team and Medical Directorate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government views the retention of RAF Leuchars as an issue of national importance, and we are making the strongest possible representations to the UK Government for securing its future. The cross party submission to the UK Government in September 2010 outlined the contribution that RAF Leuchars and the other bases in Scotland make to our local economies and communities. That contribution, and the need for the Ministry of Defence to take social and economic impacts into account within the UK Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), was reinforced at a quadrilateral meeting which I and my counterparts from Wales and Northern Ireland had with the Secretary of State for Defence on 28 September 2010. The case for retaining RAF Leuchars was again made by the First Minister at his meeting with the Secretary of State for Defence on 11 January 2011.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above, and in liaison with Fife Council and other partners, my officials continue to press the Ministry of Defence for clarity on the future direction of the SDSR, in order to ensure that robust and timely representations are made to the UK Government in advance of any decisions being taken in respect of RAF Leuchars.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with Fife Council and partners to ensure that the strongest possible representations are made to the UK Government for retaining RAF Leuchars. Following my meeting with Fife Council, local MSPs and business leaders on Wednesday 22 December 2010, the Scottish Government has agreed to support the campaign to secure the future of RAF Leuchars by continuing to press the UK Government for:</p>

  <p>the retention of RAF Leuchars;</p>

  <p>clarity on the timing of any further decisions, and for</p>

  <p>baseline information to support Fife Council in developing a full assessment of the contribution of RAF Leuchars to the local economy and to local services.</p>

  <p>Financial support provided in Moray is specifically for those adversely impacted by the withdrawal of the RAF from Kinloss, where that outcome is already known. We will continue to provide advice and support and to make the strongest possible case for retaining both RAF Leuchars and RAF Lossiemouth.</p>

  <p>I will be meeting again with Fife partners soon.</p>

  <p>The information on the number of attendances at accident and emergency departments due to falls and fractures during the period 28 December 2009 to 3 January 2010 that was included in response to question S3O-9094 was non-routine management information.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government Health Delivery Directorate collected this management information to assess the impact of an increase in falls and fractures on services, in response to NHS boards highlighting falls and fractures as a significant issue during this period.</p>

  <p>The routine collection of data on hospital admissions for falls and fractures is collected by Information Services Division through the Standard Morbidity Record. Although this data is not published as official statistics, it is available on request.</p>

  <p>Tackling health inequalities remains a priority for the Scottish Government and features prominently in a range of initiatives and activities that impact on both primary and secondary care services. The Keep Well and Well North initiatives, which have primarily focussed on GP practices as the main route to deliver targeted health checks, has enabled some 91,000 individual health checks, and are being mainstreamed across NHSScotland. In tandem with NHS Education for Scotland, further efforts to boost training places in deprived areas are progressing through expanding health inequality fellowships, and delivering the Childsmile programme in dentistry.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government fully recognises the importance of ensuring that rough sleepers are able to access accommodation during extreme weather conditions. Local authorities are best placed to ensure this happens and respond to local circumstances. Against this background, we recently wrote to all local authorities in Scotland to recommend that plans are in place to ensure there is provision for those experiencing homelessness in the severe weather and that this allows any rough sleepers to be brought in from the street.</p>

  <p>We indicated that this should include those that are legally without recourse to public funds as a short term, humanitarian response to the conditions. Guidance was given about some of the options available to local authorities in addressing this issue, including keeping day centres open at night and working closely with the voluntary sector who may have important local intelligence about vulnerable individuals. Local authorities were also encouraged to share good practice as some local authorities have greater experience of implementing provision for rough sleepers than others.</p>

  <p>The level of rent for homes procured through phase one of the National Housing Trust initiative is expected to start at 80% of the current Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rate in each area. Rents are expected to increase by the Consumer Price Index plus 1% each year. LHA rates are published on the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk</a> . These rental levels are lower than the new, reduced, housing benefit ceilings being brought in by the UK Government.</p>

  <p>In short, yes. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s guarantee to participating local authorities will last for 10 years from the date when each local authority lends funds to part finance the purchases of the National Housing Trust initiative homes. The guarantee will be discharged on the date when the local authority&rsquo;s loan is repaid in full where that occurs before the end of the 10-year period.</p>

  <p>Homes built under the National Housing Trust initiative will not become the property of the developers. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) for each site will own the homes as long as they remain available for rent under the initiative. The members of each SPV will be the relevant local authority, the developer and the Scottish Futures Trust. After five years, and prior to the end of 10 years, the developers will have the right to instigate the sale of the homes.</p>

  <p>The level of rent for homes procured through the National Housing Trust (NHT) initiative is expected to start at 80% of the current Local Housing Allowance rate in each area. At this level they will be affordable to households on lower incomes, including those on housing benefit.</p>

  <p>Applicants will need to provide details of their income when they apply for an NHT home. Each participating council determines the target groups in its area based on its evidence of need and demand. Details of each council&rsquo;s target groups are set out in the information memorandum for the NHT which is available on the Scottish Futures Trust website at:</p>

  <p>As at September 2010, there were around 87,000 households receiving housing benefit in the private rented sector who are paying up to the market rent.</p>

  <p>I wrote on 17 November 2010 to the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and other key housing and regeneration stakeholders setting out the implications of the draft 2011-12 budget published that day. This correspondence explained that the provision in the draft budget of almost &pound;400 million included, among other things, around &pound;300 million allocated through current housing and regeneration programmes, as well as additional provision for investment in new affordable housing supply and other housing and regeneration priorities. By using our expenditure next year to lever in additional investment we expect to deliver over &pound;600 million of investment in new affordable housing supply, helping to support around 7,500 jobs.</p>

  <p>The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Good Practice Statement is based on the principle that all treatment should be collaborative and tailored to the needs of the individual patient. It recognises that general practitioners may well need to make referrals to designated clinical services for assistance with the management of patients.</p>

  <p>The report of the Scottish Public Health Network&rsquo;s needs assessment of ME-CFS also outlines a recommended service model that includes specialist hospital services. The report is available at:</p>

  <p>All NHS boards are required to deliver 2% efficient government savings in 2010-11. These savings are retained locally by boards for reinvestment in frontline services. The majority of boards, including NHS Orkney, have set local targets in excess of the efficient government target in 2010-11 to ensure delivery of financial breakeven and to support development and continuous improvement of health care services. NHS Orkney approved a three-year clinical and financial strategy in June 2009 which aims to restore the board to recurring financial balance through sustainable redesign of services. The board&rsquo;s 2010-11 financial plan, including the savings target, is based on the three-year clinical and financial strategy and reflects the board&rsquo;s commitment to reduce reliance on non-recurring funding.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government Health Delivery Directorate collected information to assess the impact of an increase in falls and fractures on services over the period 28 December 2009 to 3 January 2010. This was in response to NHS boards highlighting falls and fractures as a significant issue during this period. This information was non-routine management information. This information was provided in response to question S3O-9094 on 14 January 2010. The answer to the oral parliamentary question is available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the official report can be viewed at:</p>

  <p>According to this management information, during the period 28 December 2009 to 3 January 2010, there were approximately 50% more attendances at A&amp;E departments across Scotland, due to falls and fractures, when compared to the same period in the previous year.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland has not highlighted falls and fractures as a significant issue in the winter 2010-11 situation reports as yet, therefore this management information has not been requested for winter 2010-11. We continually review the need for additional management information from boards against the burdens placed on them by other additional non-routine data requests.</p>

  <p>The routine collection of data on hospital admissions for falls and fractures is collected by Information Services Division through the Standard Morbidity Record. Although this data is not published as official statistics, it is available on request.</p>
