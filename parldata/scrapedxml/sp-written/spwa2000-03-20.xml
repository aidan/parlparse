  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Lord Advocate has seen the Boscombe Down report on FADEC and, if so, whether it was disclosed to the Fatal Accident Inquiry into the Chinook helicopter crash on Mull of Kintyre in 1994 and, if not, whether he will request a copy.</p>

  <p>As has already been explained, allegations about the FADEC software were not made until after the Fatal Accident Inquiry had taken place. The Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence explained to the House of Lords on 1 November 1999 (HL Debs, Col 656), that Boscombe Down was unable to evaluate FADEC because it did not have the necessary equipment. In answer to a request from the Crown Office for information about the allegations about FADEC, the Ministry of Defence also explained that for that reason the evaluation had been contracted out to those who did have the necessary equipment and that it had been found that FADEC posed no flight safety risks. The solicitors, who had raised the question about FADEC, were advised in writing of the position.</p>

  <p>The recent National Audit Office report bearing on this matter is under consideration and the matter will be looked at again following the consideration of that report by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee.</p>

  <p>There has been no reduction in financial support under the Crofters Etc. Building Grants and Loans Scheme.

  <p>I am arranging for a copy of the Chief Agricultural Officer&#8217;s letter to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Efficiency savings in administering the Crofters Etc. Building Grants and Loan Scheme (CBGLS) mean that workloads throughout the nine Area Offices in the Highlands and Islands may reduce in total by the equivalent of five to seven posts. We aim to avoid compulsory redundancies and will explore ways of achieving this e.g. by redeployment of staff to other work.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that CBGLS plays a significant role in retaining population levels in the crofting areas. The overall financial benefits available under CBGLS have not been reduced. Rather, the recent adjustments have allowed them to be extended more widely.</p>

  <p>The rates for grant/loan in 1990 and at present for new houses are:</p>

  <p>Works to improve home insulation may well help to reduce the number of excess winter deaths. The Executive is committed to insulating 25,000 houses each year under the Warm Deal. 100,000 vulnerable households will benefit during the lifetime of this Administration. The Warm Deal can lead to savings of up to &pound;170 in annual fuel bills. This is in addition to the &pound;100 Winter Fuel Allowance, the minimum income guarantee for pensioners, and a continuing fall in fuel prices.</p>

  <p>There are currently a total of 35 Gaelic-speaking students on Initial Teacher Training courses. Of these, 14, including nine post-graduate students, graduate this year. This represents a cost of approximately &pound;290,000.</p>

  <p>In addition, in 1999 the Scottish Executive funded a Gaelic Medium Subject Specialist Teachers Course for secondary teachers. This was run by Sabhal Mor Ostaig at a total cost of &pound;66,000. This year and next similar GMST courses will be run. Their costs will be in the same region but the precise amounts will depend on teacher numbers.</p>

  <p>We have no proposals to review these regulations.</p>

  <p>The 1999 regulations replaced, after widespread consultation, previous Regulations which had been in force since 1987. The decision to revise the regulations was based on a desire to make the procedures more efficient and easier for Order-making authorities to understand. At the same time, the new procedures continue to safeguard the interests of road users and the public at large.</p>

  <p>Among the changes introduced was a provision requiring that all new Orders must be in force within two years of the date on which the proposals were first published. This provision had not previously been provided for and was inserted to prevent local authorities bringing orders into force a number of years after they were proposed. Other changes included a more efficient consultation process and, as a result of this, the previous requirement on local authorities to advertise proposed orders in the <i>Edinburgh Gazette</i> was removed. Finally, a streamlined procedure was introduced for certain types of non-contentious order such as those whose sole effect would be to vary an existing order to include an exemption for disabled persons.</p>
