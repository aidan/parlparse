  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&rsquo; guidance on the biodiversity duty under section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 and whether it intends to issue any parallel guidance in relation to the biodiversity duty under section 1 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-06-06.S3W-276.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80381" speakername="Michael Russell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0606.htm#1">

  <p>I am aware of the guidance launched by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to support public authorities in England and Wales implementing the biodiversity duty brought in under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006.</p>

  <p>Public bodies in Scotland have been subject to a biodiversity duty under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 since 1 January 2005. This duty requires public bodies in Scotland to &quot;further&quot; biodiversity conservation in carrying out their functions, in contrast to the duty in England and Wales which requires public bodies to &quot;have regard to&quot; biodiversity conservation. The Scottish Executive produced web-based guidance in 2005 to promote the duty and to help public bodies in Scotland implement the duty. This guidance is kept under review to ensure that it meets the requirements of users. I will be looking with interest at the guidance issued by Defra, and other examples of good practice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Biodiversity duty guidance can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.biodiversityscotland.gov.uk/pageType2.php?id=19&amp;type=2&amp;navID=59" target="_blank">http://www.biodiversityscotland.gov.uk/pageType2.php?id=19&amp;type=2&amp;navID=59</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition to this guidance, the Executive and its agencies supports a range of initiatives to encourage public bodies to improve their environmental performance, including an annual report on the progress of public bodies.</p>

  <p>Some of the recommendations in this report were overtaken by the implementation of the three-year Child Protection Reform Programme (2003 to 2006-07) which provided a strengthened national framework, and mechanisms, for local agencies to work together to identify the needs of all children in their area and make appropriate provision to meet these.</p>

  <p>Specific resources made available by the Executive to local authorities to safeguard young runaways are:</p>

  <p>a guidance pack which issued to Child Protection Committees in July 2003 on vulnerable children and young people which makes recommendations about the care of young runaways,</p>

  <p>funding of &pound;838,661 between 2002 and 2008 from the Youth Crime Prevention Fund in support of Aberlour Child Care Trust&rsquo;s pilot project, Running Other Choices (ROC), which provides a short-term refuge for young people aged 12 to 15, and</p>

  <p>strengthened Child Protection Committees as an outcome of the recently-concluded three-year Child Protection Reform Programme which is improving multi-agency service provision for this (and other) vulnerable groups of children and young people.</p>

  <p>More generally, local authorities use their GAE provision to support local services as they see fit, and this includes the flexibility to commission or directly provide services for young runaways on the basis of local need.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not have specific plans at present to issue guidance to local authorities on this matter, nor does it hold information centrally about steps taken by local authorities to provide short-term refuge. To address the issue of short-term refuge at a national level, the Executive is funding the Glasgow-based Aberlour Running Other Choices (ROC) project which provides short-term refuge for young people aged 12 to 15 who run away from home or care. This funding support (2002-08) is on a pilot project basis.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s guidance pack on Vulnerable Children and Young People, which was published in July 2003, contains specific recommendations on young runaways. Local authorities are expected to have developed local protocols which give effect to the guidance in ways which best suit their own circumstances.</p>

  <p>ChildLine can currently respond to about 60% of the calls it receives. Recent additional Scottish Executive funding will allow ChildLine to expand its current services and increase the response rate to around 80% for this financial year and beyond.</p>

  <p>The recruitment of head teachers is a matter for local authorities as employers, however the changing demographics of the teaching profession and the societal expectations of public sector leaders will both have been contributory factors in changing levels of applications for head teacher posts.</p>

  <p>All head teachers and prospective head teachers need to demonstrate they are performing in line with the standard for headship (SfH).). The most common means of demonstrating performance in line with the SfH is via the Scottish Qualification for Headship (SQH). The 2006 teacher census shows that there were 310 non head teachers who had gained the SQH compared with 248 in 2005. There were also another 390 on the programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides local authorities with &pound;4 million a year to help teachers achieve the SfH and also funds more general leadership programmes and activities to supplement funding which local authorities target to this area.</p>

  <p>It is already the case that, consistent with agreements made at the National Joint Council for Local Authority Fire Brigades where responsibility for this matter lies, retained firefighters are protected with respect to any loss of earnings incurred as a result of responding to an emergency.</p>

  <p>Action, including research and development, to exploit the commercial potential of the oil produced from the Sweet Gale plant is being taken forward by a consortium led by Highland Natural Products Ltd and Alliance Boots. We have been working with representatives of the consortium to provide support and advice where possible.</p>

  <p>We also recognise the wider potential of non-food crops and we will be exploring over the coming months the options for furthering our knowledge through appropriate research and development.</p>

  <p>The clinical costs of such referrals in 2006-07 was &pound;18,909. Information on the associated costs of travel, meals and accommodation is not available centrally, as it is the responsibility of the NHS board of residence of each child to fund these costs.</p>

  <p>The most recent review of the spinal injuries service in Scotland did not suggest any extension of its services to cover those currently provided by the National Spinal Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville.

  <p>Between 1 April 2005 and 31 March 2007, four Scottish children were seen at Stoke Mandeville. As there have been no new referrals of Scottish children to Stoke Mandeville since 1994, each of the four children concerned received a short-stay review of their rehabilitation care, rather than a full initial assessment, resulting in nine admissions in total from Scotland to the unit.</p>

  <p>The Government is well aware of the difficulties families experience when a seriously ill or injured child is treated at a considerable distance from home. Everything possible is done to ensure that the disruption caused is kept to a minimum. An initial assessment at the National Spinal Injuries Centre can last up to eight weeks, but if annual reviews are arranged, these are for a much shorter period. As much of the child&rsquo;s rehabilitation as possible should be provided locally.</p>

  <p>Affordable housing is broadly defined in <em>Scottish Planning Policy 3: Planning for</em> <em>Housing</em> as follows &quot;Housing of reasonable quality that is affordable to people on modest incomes. In some places the market can provide some or all of the affordable housing that is needed, but in other places it is necessary to make housing available at a cost below market value, to meet an identified need.&quot;</p>

  <p>The main categories of affordable housing are set out in <em>Planning Advice Note 74</em>, available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20796/54073" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20796/54073</a>.</p>

  <p>Affordability, in terms of the rents and prices paid by tenants and purchasers, varies from one location to another so should be determined in a way which takes account of incomes at the local level.</p>

  <p>Our aim is to ensure that Scotland is an unattractive place for any organised crime gangs to do business. We have worked with the UK Government on a number of measures including a joint Scottish Executive and Home Office Action Plan on Human Trafficking. Law enforcement organisations across the UK work together using an intelligence led approach to identify emerging issues which are likely to impact on Scotland in the future, including the accession of new member states to the European Union. Where intelligence indicates that a threat from organised crime exists the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency in support of the Scottish police service takes action to deal with it.</p>

The scheme controls the profits pharmaceutical companies make from sales of branded medicines in the NHS. Within the prices paid by the NHS there remain incentives for companies to develop new medicines and allowances for the cost of research and development. The scheme does not cover generic medicines nor the cost of branded medicines bought without a prescription. It is negotiated every five years; the current scheme runs until 2010.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the criteria are for the allocation of discretionary points to consultants in the NHS.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-06-06.S3W-306.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0606.htm#30">

  <p>The criteria for the allocation of discretionary points to consultants is set out in the Annex to the Health Department&rsquo;s letter of 12 January 2000. This is set as follows:</p>

  <p>1. Discretionary Points are not seniority payments, nor automatic annual increments.</p>

  <p>2. Consultants in all specialties and all types of post are equally eligible and should be treated as such.</p>

  <p>3. To warrant payment of a discretionary point, consultants will be expected to demonstrate an above average contribution in respect of one or more of service to patients, teaching, research, and the management and development of the service.</p>

  <p>4. Progression at each step up the discretionary points scale will reflect the continuing quality and range of the contribution made by the consultant. To attain the maximum of the discretionary point scale consultants will be expected to have demonstrated an outstanding contribution to services.</p>

  <p>5. The criteria for payment of discretionary points should allow for contributions made in the following areas to be taken into account:</p>

  <p>i. professional excellence, including.</p>

  <p>- quality of clinical care of patients.</p>

  <p>- service development.</p>

  <p>- professional leadership.</p>

  <p>- improvements in public health.</p>

  <p>ii. significant contribution towards the achievement of local NHS service priorities.</p>

  <p>iii. undertaking recognised significant heavy workload or responsibilities in pursuit of local NHS service goals.</p>

  <p>iv. contribution to professional and multidisciplinary team working.</p>

  <p>v. research, innovation and improvement in the service.</p>

  <p>vi. clinical audit.</p>

  <p>vii. administrative or NHS management contributions.</p>

  <p>viii teaching and training, including.</p>

  <p>- training of junior staff.</p>

  <p>- involvement in undergraduate or postgraduate teaching.</p>

  <p>- public education and health promotion.</p>

  <p>- contribution to training of other staff.</p>

  <p>ix. wider contribution to the work of the NHS nationally.</p>

  <p>6. The differing opportunities and normal expectations associated with consultants in different fields will need to be taken into account in assessing the level of performance required in individual cases. For example, there will be a different expectation in terms of research content of many honorary contract holders compared with consultants whose duties result in limited opportunities for research work. There would similarly be a different expectation in terms of the management and service development contribution of a consultant in public health medicine or dental public health compared with more clinically based specialties.</p>

  <p>7. The resources available to a consultant, including supporting staff and facilities, and any particular difficulties that he or she may have had to overcome, should also be taken into account in judging the service contribution expected and provided.</p>

  <p>8. In deciding payments employing bodies should ensure that consultants are treated equally regardless of their colour, race, sex, religion, politics, marital status, sexual orientation, membership or non-membership of trade unions or associations, ethnic origin, age or disability.</p>

  <p>We place a high value on the input we receive from all our stakeholders regardless of their particular interests. That is why I and the Minister for the Environment have made clear our desire to meet with stakeholders as quickly as possible and to do so on a regular basis. As you know, one of my first actions when I was appointed Cabinet Secretary was to call a meeting of the Scotland Rural Development Programme Stakeholder Group to hear views on the content and funding of the programme. This group represents the full breadth of rural development interests. The feedback I received at that meeting was extremely encouraging and I hope will herald an era of mutual co-operation.</p>

  <p>As a government we shall continue to listen to our stakeholder groups and set in train a continuous dialogue which will work to benefit economic, social and environmental considerations across rural Scotland.</p>

  <p>Yes. Scotland&rsquo;s National Sexual Health Strategy contains recommendations which aim to improve access to sexual health advice and services for the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The strategy contains a specific recommendation for lead clinicians within each NHS board to ensure women have access to appropriate termination of pregnancy services which are in line with the guidelines produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is currently developing sexual health standards which will contain specific standards around termination of pregnancy services, access to specialist sexual health services and access to long-acting reversible contraception.</p>

  <p>Progression on the six-point Chartered Teacher salary scale typically involves one-off costs of around &pound;1,200 in return for an automatic increase of between &pound;774 and &pound;1,436 per annum in pensionable salary - overall &pound;7,161 above the top of the unprompted teachers&rsquo; scale.

  <p>The non-confidential responses can be viewed on the Executive website at:</p>
