  <p>The tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) met in Nagoya in October 2010, and agreed a new ten year Strategic Plan, alongside many other decisions. This plan contains twenty headline targets, organised under five strategic goals that address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss, reduce the pressures on biodiversity, safeguard biodiversity at all levels, enhance the benefits provided by biodiversity, and provide for capacity building.</p>

  <p>We welcome the agreements reached at Nagoya which should help to provide fresh impetus to international efforts to secure improvement in the condition of global biodiversity and in its capability to deliver the services on which we all depend. We need to take time to assess how best to take forward the individual elements in the many decisions that came from Nagoya which have potential application in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government for its part is assessing the new CBD Strategic Plan, and considering with partners, including Scottish Natural Heritage, the need to revise our own Biodiversity Strategy and the actions planned under that strategy. In making this assessment, we shall have to take account of new EU Biodiversity targets agreed in March 2010 and the forthcoming EU Biodiversity Strategy, expected in early 2011. We shall also have to consider the connections between these objectives for our Biodiversity Strategy and other policies and programmes that impact on the terrestrial and marine environment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s position is that the Public Bodies Bill, as introduced, does not affect the powers, responsibilities and obligations of Scottish Ministers with respect to the public forest estate in Scotland. The Bill provides for new powers for the Westminster Government, by order, to amend the constitution of the Forestry Commission and to amend, delegate or transfer the functions of the Forestry Commission in relation to England. The Bill does not add, or subtract from the existing powers, responsibilities and obligations of Scottish Ministers in relation to forestry.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>After the Spencer Report the Cabinet Secretary for Justice asked HM Chief Inspector of Prisons (HMCIP) to review our progression and community reintegration processes. That inspection work is underway now and we look forward to HMCIP&rsquo;s comments and recommendations. Since the Spencer Report we now have a senior manager, usually the Deputy Governor, in each prison with responsibility for overseeing the systems and signing off on decisions of progression and community access requests. multi disciplinary progression management groups meet in prisons regularly to assess the suitability of prisoners to progress. All agencies involved in the management of individual prisoners and the prisoner her/himself are invited to contribute to this process.</p>

  <p>In assessing the overall level of funding to be provided to local authorities in 2011-12, the Scottish Government has negotiated a funding package with the COSLA leadership. For each local authority to secure its share of that package, it will be required to agree to deliver certain commitments, including &quot;continuing to work with the Scottish Government towards implementation of the Carers and Young Carers Strategy at local level, including the maintenance of an extra 10,000 weeks respite care.&quot; Under the terms negotiated, if Glasgow City Council agrees to deliver the full package, its overall resource funding for 2011-12 will be reduced by 2.6% compared to the funding it received in 2010-11. If the council chooses not to agree to the full package, its resource funding will be reduced by 6.4%.</p>

  <p>A provisional funding allocation of the total local government settlement to each council for 2011-12 will be announced to the Parliament in a statement in early December 2010, accompanied by a finance circular issued to local authorities. The provisional allocation will be calculated on the basis that all local authorities will agree the terms of the package. Subject to their responses, final amounts will then be confirmed in two stages, first in a local government finance order which will be laid for parliamentary approval in February 2011, following the passage of the Budget Bill, and second in an amendment order to be laid in March 2011 after all local authorities have set their council tax levels for 2011-12.</p>

  <p>Within the total to be provided to Glasgow City Council, under the terms of the local government funding settlement, ring fencing for specific services has largely been removed. As a result, whether or not Glasgow City Council agrees to the package, funding for respite care within the total it receives will not be separately identified. It will be for the council to determine what it spends on respite care.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive for what reason the projected outturn efficiency reported in the Efficiency Outturn Report for 2009-10 for the Crofters Commission is &pound;0.038 million as compared with the published planned efficiency of &pound;0.225 million.</p>

  <p>The planned efficiency was linked to the transfer of the Crofters Commission office to Great Glen House. Realisation of the planned efficiency is dependent on negotiations with the commission&rsquo;s previous landlord. Savings are expected to begin in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>The Crofters Commission provided &pound;0.038 million efficiency savings from internal restructuring, and the Director General for Rural Affairs, Environment and Services portfolio exceeded the planned efficiency by &pound;1.120 million in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what programmes are supported by the National Assets and Flooding category of the Environmental and Rural Services Level 2 budget and how it proposes to achieve the 17% reduction in funding between 2010-11 and 2011-12, as indicated in table 11.06 on page 178 of Scotland&rsquo;s Spending Plans and Draft Budget 2011-12.</p>

  <p>The Natural Assets and Flood budget line support programmes aimed at promoting the air quality and the water environment, implementing the EU Noise Directive and the Government&rsquo;s support to flood risk management. It is intended that savings will be made in terms of the level of support provided to air quality and noise actions. We will build on past actions and prioritise available resource to maximise benefits. These budget reductions will not impact on our statutory obligations in these areas.</p>

  <p>This is the first year the Scottish Government has collected this data from local authorities. <em>Home Care Services, Scotland 2010</em> was published today and can be found on the Scottish Government website. The publication contains information on how many clients aged 65 and over receive a meals service.</p>
