  <p>On 22 October 2010, the Scottish Government published its <em>Digital Ambition for Scotland</em> statement. One of our key ambitions is that next-generation broadband will be available to all by 2020, and that significant progress will be made by 2015. We will follow this statement with a more detailed strategy containing specific action plans in the next few months. As part of this work, we will consider what actions are appropriate in respect of all areas of Scotland. However, it is widely accepted that normal market forces will deliver next-generation broadband to urban areas, whereas it is the non-urban areas which are expected to require greater focus in any potential public sector intervention. Urban areas are generally well served by the market in relation to broadband services.</p>

  <p>The draft framework produced by the Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC) is based on an interpretation of the Firearms Act 1968 which is not shared by the Scottish Government. We have written to the SHRC explaining our understanding of the legislation. As such, the Scottish Government disagrees with the responsibilities identified in the draft framework in so far as they are relevant to the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>Firearms legislation is a reserved matter. The primary responsibility for ensuring consistency with human rights law and standards in relation to the regulation of firearms therefore lies with the UK Government. Police forces are public authorities for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998 and consequently Chief Constables are obliged to ensure that officers act in a manner compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

  <p>The relevant human rights law with regard to firearms in the UK is the Human Rights Act 1998. Chief Constables are obliged to ensure that officers act in accordance with the law and in a manner compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. It would not be appropriate for Ministers to comment on a speculative opinion on a hypothetical situation.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Most sudden deaths in people under 35 are likely to be due to an inherited cardiac condition, but without a post-mortem examination it is not always possible to be certain of the cause of death.</p>

  <p>There may be around 30 such deaths a year in Scotland, but both the Cardiac Assessment of Young Athletes (CAYA) programme and the Familial Arrhythmia Network Scotland (FANS) are trying to achieve a better understanding of the numbers.</p>

  <p>This information requested is not available.</p>

  <p>During 2008-09 and 2009-10, the Government made available &pound;200,000 to support the Cardiac Assessment in Young Athletes (CAYA) programme. It offers cardiovascular assessment of those aged between 15 and 25 who are engaged in competitive sports<strong>.</strong></p>

  <p>We have also supported the establishment of the Familial Arrhythmia Network Scotland (FANS). The network aims to raise awareness of familial arrhythmias, define and agree referral protocols, develop national guidance for clinical and genetic testing As we indicated in our Heart Disease and Stroke Actionand establish a national register which will support long term follow-up. Plan, FANS should extend its activities to cover cardiomyopathies, as these represent another significant cause of sudden cardiac death.</p>

  <p>It is the landlord&rsquo;s duty at the start of a relevant tenancy to provide the tenant with written information regarding the repairing standard and their right to apply to the private rented housing panel (prhp) if the standard is not being adhered to. Section 20(1) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 covers this.</p>

  <p>The prhp can provide tenants with its leaflet <em>A brief guide for tenants</em> and information can be seen on its website.</p>

  <p>Shelter, Citizens Advice and law centres also advise tenants of the work carried out by the prhp.</p>

  <p>Rent officers when visiting properties as part of their duties in cases of rent assessment, distribute leaflets about the prhp and inform tenants of their right of appeal to the prhp.</p>

  <p>Section 29 of the current Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill would require a landlord under an assured tenancy to provide a tenant information pack to a tenant at the beginning of the tenancy. Ministers would have the power to prescribe by order the documents to be included. Information on the prhp could be available as part of the pack if this provision becomes law.</p>

  <p>The table contains the most relevant year-on year figures for comparison purposes and details the levels of funding that are provided to Community Justice Authorities (CJAs) who, along with local authorities, are the principal delivery agents of criminal justice social work services in Scotland. CJAs were introduced in 2006-07 and the administration grant allocated in each financial year has not been included in the figures. As well as covering the statutory criminal justice social work services provided by local authorities, this funding also covers a range of other programmes and pilots which have varied by year and by CJA area. Other funding streams such as intensive support packages, ad hoc capital payments and a number of other centrally administered grants, although not included in these totals, could also be said to support criminal justice social work services.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure a smooth transition to the NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) targets for NHS Scotland the Scottish Government committed to phasing in the target shares calculated by the NRAC formula by way of &quot;differential growth&quot;. Under this methodology, all boards continue to enjoy growth in their allocations year-on-year, with those below their target share receiving more growth than those above until the new distribution is achieved over time. In this way no board receives a cut in funding.</p>

  <p>This approach to phasing in funding has been the practice under both the previous SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae. Despite the constraints of the current economic and financial climate, an additional &pound;13 million has been provided to NHS boards below target in financial year 2010-11. The level of additional funding that NHS boards will receive in 2011-12 has yet to be determined.</p>

  <p>As the target shares of NHS boards change on an annual basis to reflect changes in the relative need of their populations, it is not possible to provide a date when all NHS boards will reach their target share.</p>

  <p>The performance management arrangements for staff in the Executive Cohort are set out in HDL (2007)15. Similar arrangements apply to the Senior Management Cohort, but responsibility for these rests with health board remuneration committees rather than the National Performance Management Committee. The system uses &quot;achievement scores&quot; which calibrate to &quot;performance ratings&quot; as set out in the circular.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the percentage distribution for both cohorts across each of the performance ratings for the 2007-08 and 2008-09 performance years. The National Performance Management Committee has still to offer assurance to the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing in respect of 2009-10 and therefore details for that performance year are not provided.

  <p>NHS inform is a NHSScotland service, hosted by NHS24.</p>

  <p>NHS24 provides online information for people who are symptomatic and provides access to a self help guide which assists the public to be signposted to the most appropriate level of care. In addition, NHS24 provides corporate information and information on national campaigns (e.g. Be Ready for Winter and Know Who to Turn To).</p>

  <p>In contrast, NHS inform is a single gateway to the provision of quality assured health and social care information across a range of health and wellbeing topics.</p>

  <p>NHS inform makes use of the existing NHS24 national telephony and technology infrastructure and benefits from being hosted by an organisation already leading in health information management and patient care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no procurement contracts for bus services. The ScotRail Franchise does not include provision relating to talking guides. However, the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998, which were superseded by the Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non-Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2010, require all new rolling stock built from 1 November 1998 to include audio-visual systems providing station destination information. A commitment was also given by ScotRail to retrofit audio-visual information systems into the majority trains built prior to 1998 during routine refurbishment programmes.</p>

  <p>In general, the approval of Scottish Ministers is required if a local authority wishes to dispose of land held on the Housing Revenue Account, or which forms part of common or open space or is held for use as allotments. Otherwise, local authorities may generally dispose of their assets without the Scottish Ministers&rsquo; consent, providing they comply with any statutory requirements relating to the disposal.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports research and development (R&amp;D) across the government, business and higher education sectors, using a number of mechanisms to promote excellence in research, its development and dissemination.</p>

  <p>Data on R&amp;D funding in the UK is published annually by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills within the Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) statistics publication, available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/science/science-funding/set-stats" target="_blank">http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/science/science-funding/set-stats</a>.</p>

  <p>The latest data published for the Scottish Government relates to the 2007-08 and 2008-09 financial years, and shows that the Scottish Government contributed &pound;137 million to R&amp;D in the government and business sectors in 2007-08 and planned to spend &pound;146 million in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>In terms of support to higher education, the table below shows the Scottish Funding Council grants to universities for research and knowledge transfer for each year from 2007-08 to 2009-10.</p>
