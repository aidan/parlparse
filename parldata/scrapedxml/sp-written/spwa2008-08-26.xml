  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to ensure that the proposals in <em>Getting it right for every child</em> , to avoid creating false incentives to make a child subject to competing measures and classifying them looked after and to ensure that children&rsquo;s needs are identified and acted on, are implemented.</p>

  <p>The implementation of <em>Getting it right for every child</em> is continuing through pathfinding activity and in partnership with agencies, including development of assessment of children&rsquo;s risks and needs. Better, earlier identification of risks and needs leading to appropriate, proportionate, timely support should over time lessen the proportion of children requiring support whose needs and risks develop to the point where they require to be looked after children in terms of section 17 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to say how much funding has been allocated specifically for the delivery of English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) as non-formal adult learning since May 2007.</p>

  <p>Funding, which is routed through the Scottish Funding Council to Scotland&rsquo;s colleges (60%), and to community learning and development partnerships (40%), is for the overall provision of adult ESOL learning, formal and non-formal.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08 the Scottish Government provided additional funding of &pound;5 million to support the adult ESOL strategy, which was published on 28 March 2007. Further funding of &pound;3 million per annum for the period 2008-11 was announced on 4 February 2008.</p>

  <p>Also, some ESOL learners may be eligible for adult literacies provision funded by adult literacy and numeracy partnerships.</p>

  <p>The adult english for speakers of other languages (ESOL) strategy for Scotland, launched in March 2007 is for all Scottish residents for whom English is not a first language. This includes migrant workers, asylum seekers and refugees as well as settled minority ethnic communities.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08 additional funding of &pound;5 million was made available to colleges and community learning and development partnerships which has provided over 5,000 new ESOL places. Further additional funding of &pound;9 million over the three-year period from 2008-11 is expected to create a further 7,000 places. Providers have therefore extended classes to the aforementioned groups of residents.</p>
