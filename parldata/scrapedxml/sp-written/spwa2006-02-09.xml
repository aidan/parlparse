  <p>The biodiversity work undertaken on Scotland&rsquo;s national forest estate has recently been subjected to three types of audit procedure. The first is the annual external audit undertaken to satisfy the requirements of the United Kingdom Woodland Assurance Standard. The other two were Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s internal audits of their Forest Design Planning process; which is an annual rolling programme, and a Forest Operations Environment audit in 2003.</p>

  <p>In addition, Forestry Commission Scotland set up an external biodiversity peer review group in 2005. This group was formed to consider Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s delivery of the Scottish Forestry Strategy&rsquo;s environmental agenda on the national forest estate; to examine the effectiveness of past and current action and to make recommendations on what additional or more ambitious steps Forestry Commission Scotland should be taking.</p>

  <p>The review group&rsquo;s recently completed final report is currently being carefully considered by Forestry Commission Scotland and a response to the 74 recommendations is expected by the summer. Addressing the needs of priority species found on the national forest estate, as identified in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, forms part of the overall consideration being given to the peer review group&rsquo;s report.</p>

  <p>We are aware of these reports. Attacks on the police and other emergency workers, who we all depend on for the vital services they provide, are abhorrent and I am sure that the Parliament joins with me in condemning them. The Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005 came into force last May and makes it clear that the Executive will take action to ensure such behaviour is punished appropriately.</p>

  <p>The Scottish DNA Database exports copies of all DNA profiles it holds to the National DNA Database but does not export the DNA samples. A DNA sample is the sample that contains the individual&rsquo;s full DNA which is taken from the individual by means such as a mouth swab. A DNA profile is the numerical sequence derived from a DNA sample by a process which destroys the original sample. It is based on a number of markers from the short-tandem repeat areas of DNA which do not contain genetically significant information but vary markedly between different people, which is why DNA profiles are effective at distinguishing between different people.</p>

  <p>This information is not held.</p>

  <p>All DNA profiles taken from persons who are arrested or detained in Scotland are removed from both the Scottish DNA Database and the National DNA Database unless the case for which they were taken result in a court conviction. As well as the DNA profiles, any information relating to the person, such as their age, is also removed from database records. It is therefore not possible to identify the age of the persons concerned. The majority of cases involving juveniles do not result in court proceedings.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The figures up to 2021 are derived from the recently compiled Scotland 2005 Production Forecast, which is to be published later this year, and they assume that the size of the national forest estate will remain static and that the forest design planning system remains unchanged.</p>

  <p>2. The information is provided in quinquennial tranches (apart from 2006 and the final period from 2027-36). The figures are average annual volumes, which include clearfell and thinning.</p>

  <p>3. The 2027-36 figures are derived from an extrapolation of the current Forestry Commission Scotland forest design plan programme. The figures and the softwood/hardwood split must be treated as highly indicative because the detail is subject to refinement.</p>

  <p>4. The broadleaf volume includes productive broadleaves only i.e. the volume will come from areas where timber production is amongst the main forest management objectives.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The private woodland figures are not forecasts of volumes that will be offered to the market &ndash; they are forecasts of the optimum volume that could be produced from the resource. The amount that is offered to the market will depend on economic conditions and other constraints. Conditions have been less than optimal in recent years and production has been below the level suggested by the availability forecast.</p>

  <p>The figures cover new planting and restocking, and the basis for the calculation of the number of trees is the target stocking density. For conifers this is currently 2,700 plants per hectare and 1,700 plants per hectare for broadleaves.</p>

  <p>Under the current Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme, support is provided to woodland owners and managers to carry out survey, planning and monitoring work on, for example, landscape design, low-impact silviculture, recreational management and archaeology. In addition, plan preparation grants are available for owners wishing to produce long-term forest plans. These measures assist owners who wish to gain UK Woodland Assurance Standard certification.</p>

  <p>A replacement to the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme, which is linked to the 2007-11 rural development regulation and land management contracts, is currently being devised. It is anticipated that under this new scheme there will be more emphasis on the need for owners to produce a forest plan, and again, this will assist owners who wish to gain certification. The Forestry Commission has also funded studies to help determine ways of making certification more accessible to small woodlands and woodlands with low intensity management.</p>

  <p>The information requested as it applies to sheriff court cases is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>High Court figures cannot be broken down by sheriff court area.</p>

  <p>The number of High Court custody time bar extensions per year was not routinely collected until the introduction of an electronic case management system in April 2004. No data are held centrally for 1999 and 2000. The total number of custody time bar extensions from 2001-03 is not known, but research undertaken during Lord Bonomy&rsquo;s review established that during 2001 in 32 of a sample of 141 custody indictments the 110-day period was extended at least once. An interim report of the evaluation of the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2004 showed that between the start of January 2002 and the end of April 2004 there were 369 custody indictments in which the 110-day period was extended at least once, resulting in at least 709 extensions over the 28 month period. For the period from April 2004 to end March 2005, there have been 274 extensions granted by the High Court in respect of the 110-day time limit, relating to 144 custody indictments.</p>

  <p>For extensions to the 140-day time limit in High Court cases in the period since the enactment of the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2004, I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-22255 on 25 January 2006.

  <p>I believe that <em>SEPA View</em> provides a useful means for SEPA to communicate with its stakeholders, schools, NGOs, other interested parties and the general public about the agency&rsquo;s activities and wider environmental issues. It is, however, for the agency to decide whether the publication represents value for money. Information on the content and cost of <em>SEPA View</em> are operational matters for SEPA itself. I have asked Dr Campbell Gemmell, Chief Executive of SEPA, to respond to these issues direct.</p>

  <p>As made clear in <em>Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland</em> 2003-04 (p.18), some programmes included in UK non-identifiable expenditure benefit England (or England and Wales) only but could not be allocated to any English region in particular. HM Treasury is planning to consult with UK departments and the devolved administrations to provide further, more disaggregated, data.</p>

A detailed implementation plan will be published later in the year. Copies of all three are available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The report provides a historic opportunity to modernise social work practice and gives focus for the work of social workers to do the things that they are best equipped and trained to do. Social work services must be designed and delivered around the needs of people who use them, their carers and communities. The Executive intends to take a series of actions to move forward issues highlighted in the report. These will be detailed in the forthcoming implementation plan.</p>
