  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has provided the following detail in relation to this incident.</p>

  <p>On 5 October 2010 the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) emergency medical dispatch centres (EMDCs) in Norseman (South Queensferry) and Inverness experienced difficulty in answering 999 calls via their digital phone lines. Cardonald EMDC in Glasgow was unaffected by the incident.</p>

  <p>During routine maintenance, scheduled for a period of reduced service demand and risk, a BT engineer disconnected main and secondary circuits on the ambulance service digital phone network, a human error that resulted in the Inverness and Norseman EMDCs experiencing disruption. Normal call handling operations were impacted as follows:</p>

  <p>Inverness EMDC between 00:51 and 04:00</p>

  <p>Norseman EMDC between 00:53 and 03:19</p>

  <p>During this period, SAS received 141 calls through the 999 service. Of those, 120 were actual incidents with the remainder being multiple calls. Of those 120 incidents, 60 of them were handled by the Glasgow EMDC through their usual digital phone lines. The other 60 incidents (of which 13 were category A, 36 were category B and 11 were non-emergency) were handled in Edinburgh and Inverness through contingency arrangements, in this case diverting calls to analogue phone lines in those EMDCs. These analogue lines were installed as part of the service response to the incident on 21 July 2010.</p>

  <p>All 999 calls to SAS were answered, and there were no delays in calls (of any category) being answered or logged on to the system for an ambulance to be dispatched. SAS has informed me that there was no impact on the deployment of ambulances and no adverse outcomes attributable to the fault experienced on 5 October 2010. SAS have undertaken a clinical review of the calls that were answered under the contingency arrangements to ensure robust clinical governance and assurance.</p>

  <p>From 1 August 2010, child trust fund (CTF) payments to newly born children were more than halved and will cease entirely from 1 January 2011. Consequently, all families in Scotland with children born after December 2010 will receive no payment.</p>

  <p>From 1 August 2010, the UK Government also stopped the &quot;additional age seven CTF payment&quot; worth between &pound;250 and &pound;500 which was previously paid into the CTF accounts of children turning seven. There are approximately 397,000 children under the age of seven in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) manages the process to develop the clinical and health improvement indicators for the Quality and Outcomes Framework, including prioritising areas for new indicator development and recommending whether existing indicators should continue. This is an evidence based process handled by NICE&rsquo;s independent advisory committee, and Quality Improvement Scotland is involved in representing Scottish health issues. NICE guidance on chronic kidney disease was published in September 2008 and further details of the process are available on the NICE website at <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/cg73" target="_blank">www.nice.org.uk/cg73</a> . It is for the NICE Advisory Committee to decide on when to review the indicators.</p>

  <p>Five hubs have now been established, roughly on a regional basis. We currently await the submission of an action plan from each hub, which will provide a basis for consideration as to how the funding should be distributed.

  <p>The following table shows the number of whole or partial ward closures as a result of infection, for the period 2006 to 2010, in hospitals administered by NHS Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Lothian, Ayrshire and Arran and Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p>The figures in brackets are the number of whole or partial ward closures due to norovirus. NHS Lanarkshire has confirmed that during the period 2006 to 2009 the organism responsible for the remaining ward closures was not confirmed, but that norovirus was suspected in almost all of the cases.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of patients who did not attend (DNA) a first outpatient appointment at a consultant-led clinic in 2009-10 is as follows.</p>

  <p>Prior to the introduction of the new ways of defining and measuring waiting times, DNA information was only available for first outpatient appointments from Scottish morbidity outpatient records. DNA information is now being published from the new ways dataset for both first outpatient appointments and for inpatient and day case treatment. The first published data was for the quarter ending 30 September 2009.</p>

  <p>Latest published information from new ways shows that for the quarter ending <br /> June 2010, there were 33,794 missed first outpatient appointments at a <br /> consultant-led clinic, a DNA rate of 9.0%. For the same period, there were 2,982 missed appointments for inpatient and day case treatment, a DNA rate of 2.6%.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it will act and what it will need to do to address the issues raised in the judgement of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom that found that requiring sex offenders to register indefinitely on the sex offender register without the opportunity for review was incompatible with Article 8 the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-10-25.S3W-37041.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1025.htm#15">

  <p>The UK Supreme Court has ruled that requiring sex offenders to register indefinitely on the sex offender register without the opportunity for review is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). England and Wales will have to introduce changes to give effect to this ruling. A case raising identical issues has been brought before the Court of Session in Scotland, and we have been asked by the court to demonstrate what steps we, in Scotland, are taking to make the law here ECHR compliant.</p>

  <p>In making the law ECHR compliant, public safety is an absolute priority. In recent years we have toughened up the safeguards in place, such as improving risk assessment of sex offenders and the roll out of the successful community disclosure scheme, and our focus must be on enabling the police to manage offenders who pose a continuing risk of sexual harm.</p>

  <p>On 25 October 2010 we will make, lay and bring into force an urgent order under section 12 of the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001 to address the Supreme Court ruling.</p>

  <p>Judges will still have the power to place someone on the sex offenders register for life and indefinite registration for serious sex offenders will continue. The order will introduce a mechanism to provide those placed on the register for life with the right to a review after a set period of time. Offenders who are convicted of a sexual offence as adults (over the age of 18) will be eligible for review after 15 years on the register. For offenders who were convicted when they were under 18, this period will be eight years.</p>

  <p>No offender will be automatically removed from the register when the review date is reached. The police will carry out a robust assessment of every offender who reaches the review date, taking into account a range of information, including any risk assessments carried out through the multi-agency public protection arrangements. A senior police officer will decide whether the risk posed to the public by the offender requires them to remain on the register.</p>

  <p>The offender will be able to appeal the police decision to a Sheriff and the decision of the Sheriff to grant or refuse an appeal can be appealed to the Sheriff Principal, whose decision is final.</p>

  <p>This review mechanism, which is supported by the police, will ensure that public protection is the foremost consideration in meeting the requirements placed on us by the ECHR.</p>
