  <p>The European Commission (CION) anti-dumping investigation used a range of economic and financial indicators to investigate the impact of the actions by salmon growers, based in Norway, on the community industry.</p>

  <p>The investigation found that between 2001 and the investigation period, although the community industry experienced increases in production (5%) and sales volumes (7%), these growth rates were slower than the 15% increase in the overall market. Consequently, the community industry saw its market share fall by 7%. In addition, sales prices fell by 9% whilst cash flows and profitability turned negative. Employment directly linked with the production of farmed salmon fell by 3% and average wages per head also declined. Since the community industry is concentrated into the Highlands and Islands that is where the most significant direct impacts associated with these deteriorating indicators have occurred.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to make a definitive estimate because output and market share can change for a variety of reasons that may be unrelated to the trade dispute. However, the European Commission (CION) investigation concluded that although the Community industry increased its sales volume by 7% between 2001 and the investigation period, it was unable to benefit fully from the 15% increase in the overall growth of the market. Consequently, its market share decreased by 7% whilst that of Norwegian imports rose by 17%.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. However, all businesses operating in the UK are subject to competition rules and may be considered by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) or the European Commission (EC) competition authorities. Even if consideration of proposed company mergers falls to the EC, the OFT would still have to consider whether criteria for referral back to the UK competition authorities are met.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has facilitated a multi-agency approach to the enforcement of the Solway Firth cockle fishery, involving in particular the Solway Shellfish Management Association, Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, the Health and Safety Executive, Dumfries and Galloway Council, the Marine and Coastguard Agency and the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency (SFPA). By taking such steps as sharing intelligence and communicating jointly the key messages on the fishery, this approach has allowed for more coordinated and effective enforcement. Using the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill we are also seeking to make provisions to allow the SFPA to deploy its powers in respect of Regulating Orders and to improve the ability of grantees to enforce Regulating Orders. Our intention is that these powers should be in force in time for the next cockle fishing season in the Solway.</p>

  <p>The Solway Shellfish Management Association has two officers involved in enforcing the Solway Firth Regulated Fishery (Scotland) Order 2006.</p>

  <p>Fishing for cockles in the Solway without a licence granted by the association is an offence. Under Section 3 of the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1963, the association&rsquo;s enforcement officers have power to enforce restrictions and regulations made as part of an Order. In addition, they are able to report any instances of illegal fishing which they may observe to the Procurator Fiscal with a view to criminal prosecution.</p>

  <p>A number of other agencies, including the Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, the Health and Safety Executive and the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency have also been involved in a multi-agency approach to enforcing this Regulating Order.</p>

  <p>The categorisation of an athlete would largely depend on the sport in question and the entry criteria for any associated competition. A &quot;Scottish-level&quot; athlete may be one who is selected to represent Scotland or restricts their participation in competition to national events. A &quot;UK-level&quot; athlete may be one who is selected to represent the UK or restricts their participation in competition to UK events.

  <p>The Regulations which established the water and sewerage charges exemption scheme (the Water and Sewerage Charges (Exemption) (Scotland) Regulations 2002) specify the criteria that Scottish Water must apply in administering the scheme.

  <p>The water and sewerage charges exemption scheme was established originally for four years with effect from 1 April 2002 to assist those organisations that had previously been in receipt of relief and which were likely to be most affected by its withdrawal. The statutory criteria for qualifying for exemption were set with that objective in mind. The Executive extended the scheme from 2006-10, to allow more time for those organisations to prepare to pay for the services that they consume. The Executive has no plans to revise the scheme.</p>

  <p>On 1 April 2006, the Scottish Executive introduced a water services charges reduction scheme for vulnerable households. The scheme provides a reduction in charges of up to 25% a year for households with two or more adults, who are in receipt of council tax benefit (CTB), and no other discount. The purpose of the scheme is to introduce a permanent means of assisting low-income households largely occupying lower council tax bands, in receipt of CTB, which had previously received little or no assistance with their water services charges. The Executive has no plans to extend the scope of the scheme.</p>

  <p>On the 28 September 2005, the Scottish Executive issued a Direction to Scottish Water setting out clearly the objectives Scottish Water must meet in the next regulatory period, 2006-10, and the objectives Scottish Water should plan and prepare for in the period 2010-14. It is for Scottish Water (or its contacting partners) to design and build the necessary technical solutions to meet these requirements, taking into account all material factors, including the known impact of climate change.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recently issued guidance to assist Scottish Water in exercising its sustainable development duty under section 51 of the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002. The issue of climate change is covered under Action 6 of this guidance.</p>

  <p>In setting its objectives for Scottish Water, the Executive is responsible for taking into account the specific environmental requirements of the Water Framework Directive. As the independent economic regulator of Scottish Water, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland is under a duty to ensure that Scottish Water has sufficient financial resources to exercise effectively at lowest reasonable overall cost its core functions. This includes meeting the objectives set for it by the Executive. Therefore, in circumstances where the functions which need to be caught by designation are carried out by the Executive, it was considered unnecessary for the Commission to be designated as a responsible authority.</p>

  <p>The Worldskills Competition is the largest skills competition in the world for young people, with 42 member countries participating in over 40 different skill areas, such as joinery, bricklaying, IT and hospitality. The UK submitted its bid on 31 March 2006 to host Worldskills 2011 in London. Sweden (Gothenburg) and Australia (Melbourne) are also bidding for the honour. I will be attending the Worldskills General Assembly in Melbourne when the successful bid is announced on 10 May 2006. If our bid is successful, I plan to host a parliamentary event to inform and engage a broad range of stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Worldskills London 2011 gives Scotland an opportunity to highlight its skills agenda, to showcase its talents on the world stage and to allow young people to see world-class skills in practice. It would also act as an inspirational focus for skills competition activity in the intervening years, with stakeholders (including Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Association of Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges) working closely with UK Skills to create a Scotland-wide network of skills competitions, providing our young people with an opportunity to prove their excellence at local, regional and national events, leading up to the Worldskills Competition.</p>
