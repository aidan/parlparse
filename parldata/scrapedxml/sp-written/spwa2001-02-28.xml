  <p>Recommendation 13 of the Red Tape Review is currently in progress, with two of the specific aspects of this recommendation already completed. Those which remain, specifically regarding oilseeds regulations and proportionality of penalties, require longer-term action and European Union (EU) co-ordination. My department has been pressing the EU on these issues since the publication of the Red Tape Report, and I am pleased to inform that a Commission Working Group has now been established to look at simplification of the Common Agricultural Policy. The UK, along with other member states, are now providing ideas to this group for consideration, and these suggestions will include the complexity of oilseed regulations and the proportionality of penalties.</p>

  <p>The regulations governing the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) are extremely tight and leave little room for discretion when applying penalties. There are, however, certain circumstances under which &quot;obvious&quot; errors can be accepted, and Area Aid Applications can be amended after the submission date of 15 May. Officials have been pressing the EU on the extension of the obvious error concept, and also on the proportionality of sanctions. My department, along with other UK departments and other member states, are now providing ideas for consideration by a Commission Working Group established to look at simplification of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>

  <p>Under the Agenda 2000 proposals, my officials participated in a number of discussions on the eligibility of oilseeds to receive aid under the Arable Area Payments Scheme. This was because we recognised that the quality control criteria was an area where a simplification of the rules would benefit producers. The European Commission rejected this, as they were anxious to foster their policy of quality improvement in order to reduce the need to import oilseeds from outwith the Community. Currently, however, my officials are taking part in a general exercise on ways of improving the administration of the CAP. We will thus again be asking the Commission to look carefully at this matter.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of the potential benefit of digital technology to rural areas. The Arkleton Trust (Research) Ltd produced a report for Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) in 1995 evaluating the Highlands and Islands Telecommunications Initiative (HITI). The report showed that the initiative had exceeded its job creation targets. Presently HIE attribute over 3,000 jobs in the call centre sector in the region to the publicly supported infrastructure projects of the past decade, including the HITI.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware that local loop unbundling may have an impact on rural areas and has asked Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to collaborate on a study to consider the likely extent of local loop unbundling in Scotland and to suggest measures to maximise its impact.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not hold information in the form requested. The &quot;UK online: the broadband future&quot; report, published this month by the Office of the e-Envoy maps out planned ADSL roll-out, areas served by cable operators and regions with broadband fixed wireless access (BFWA) licensees and, on this basis, estimates that some 15% to 20% of the UK population would be left unserved by higher bandwidth and broadband services by 2003. The report states that this figure probably overestimates coverage, since the BFWA licensees are unlikely to offer services throughout the regions where they have licences.</p>

  <p>Following my announcement on 13 December, the Executive wrote to all education authorities, further education colleges and heads of other centres on 18 December inviting them to submit requests for review by 10 January. By 19 January, the Appeals Review team had received 3,974 returns.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure that no appeals were excluded solely because of their late submission, the Appeals Review team accepted requests for review as late as 29 January when subject teams began their work. In a few very exceptional cases, requests have been accepted beyond this date. However, at this stage in the process it is no longer possible for the team to accept more new cases.</p>

  <p>As at 21 February, 4,216 cases were included in the appeals review process, and a breakdown of these cases by education authority is shown in the table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is required to operate within European and UK Legislation on the deliberate release of genetically modified crops. Under Directive 90/220/EEC consent can only be refused where scientific evidence is available to suggest that the release would cause harm to human health or the environment. The legislation does not permit an application to be rejected solely in response to local opposition. A decision on that basis would be illegal.</p>

  <p>The current statutory notification period is determined in the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The Scottish Executive is aware however of the limited opportunity which this allows for public consideration and comment. Accordingly, assurances have been sought and gained from the biotechnology companies which will provide a longer notification period for this spring&#8217;s farm evaluations. The exact period of notification has not yet been determined.</p>

  <p>The initial identification of individual sites to participate in these trials takes place independently of government and is the responsibility of the Supply Chain Initiative on Modified Agricultural Crops, a body representing the interests of the industry including the National Farmers Union within its membership. The proposed sites must meet the criteria set out by the impartial Scientific Steering Committee which oversees the UK farm-scale evaluation programme. They are selected to represent a variety of conditions, such as climate, ecology and soil type as well as farm type and are intended to provide a representative sample of UK agriculture.</p>

  <p>The Scientific Steering Committee members are:</p>

  <p>Chairman:</p>

  <p>Professor Christopher Pollock, Research Director of the Institute of Environmental and Grassland Research.</p>

  <p>The September 2000 national census showed 1,944 NHS beds occupied by patients who had waited more than six weeks from the date they were assessed as clinically ready for discharge (six weeks is the common period for discharge planning agreement timescales across Scotland). This suggests approximately 700,000 bed days incurred in a recent typical year. This figure is an estimate only and should be treated with caution; due to the absence of national trend-based information, no account can be taken of seasonal fluctuation. It is not possible to calculate accurately the associated cost which is, of course, off-set by the costs that would be incurred following discharge in each case.</p>

  <p>Full details of the September 2000 census are available at the following web site:</p>

  <p>Decisions on the provision of air support are operational matters for Chief Constables and police authorities and it is for them to take decisions on the costs and benefits of specific investment proposals in light of the resources available. Since 1997-98 there have been no formal applications for funding for the provision of air support. At that time an ACPOS Working Group concluded that if air cover was to be provided for Scottish police forces, the preferred approach would involve a national arrangement. This has been considered since by the Scottish Executive, police authorities and ACPOS without a final conclusion being reached. Earlier in the current financial year, Tayside Police wrote to the Scottish Executive Justice Department with an outline business case for setting up an air support unit in conjunction with Fife Constabulary. The response indicated that in the light of previous work on air support the department was unwilling to provide central funding for local provision, although that did not of course rule out the use of local funding where a case might be justified on the basis of local circumstances. This is the approach that has been adopted by Strathclyde which has leased a helicopter.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>Accidents for which winter weather conditions were reported as an attributable factor are not identified as such in the STATS 19 returns.

  <p>The information requested is given in the table entitled &quot;Injury road accidents occurring on the trunk road network, and the associated numbers of fatalities and seriously-injured casualties: 1995 to 1999 (provisional)&quot;, a copy of which has been placed in SPICe (Bib. no. 11548).</p>

  <p>The treatment of the surplus represents unfinished pre-devolution business. The UK Government&#8217;s long established position has been that the surplus should go to the UK Exchequer, and the Scottish Assigned Budget Settlement has been progressed on that basis.</p>

  <p>There is no legal entitlement on the part of Scottish Transport Group pension scheme members to share in the surplus. Scottish ministers have, however, agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that ex-gratia payments should be made to STG pension scheme members which would be broadly equivalent to the final settlement for National Bus Company pension scheme members south of the border. An appropriate amount has accordingly been earmarked for distribution.</p>

  <p>Once the Scottish Transport Group is wound-up the Scottish Executive will be able to access the records held by the Trustees to the pension schemes. We expect these records will require some updating particularly as regards current addresses. In advance of wind-up, however, we have taken the following steps towards such updating: we have set up a dedicated phone line with voicemail advising callers to write to us for a pro-forma to register their interest and a letter providing background to the announcement; we have spoken and/or written to the main trade unions advising them of the position and have provided them with material to pass to their members who are making enquiries; we have written to the Confederation of Passenger Transport to explain the position and asked them to provide our information to all their Scottish bus company members, again supplying pro-formas for pension scheme members to send to us to help verify records; we have written to CalMac in similar vein (some of their employees will have been in STG pension schemes), and we propose to set up a departmental web page from which access to the latest information and pro-forma will be available.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-12843 by Ms Margaret Curran on 8 February 2001, whether the terms and conditions on which Social Inclusion Partnership funding is allocated to particular projects are set locally or by the Executive.</p>

  <p>The terms and conditions of grant are currently being revised to reflect changes to the payment procedures which will take effect from April 2001. Currently, 40% of grant is paid in the year in which expenditure is incurred, and 60% is paid a year in arrears. From April 2001, all grant will be paid quarterly in arrears, in the year in which expenditure is incurred and there will be further changes to the way in which support cost grant is paid.</p>

  <p>We are also taking the opportunity to increase the clarity of the terms and conditions of grant, and the new terms and conditions will include guidance on the issues that grant recipients should address when setting local funding agreements with projects. I expect to issue the new terms and conditions of grant to grant recipients before the end of this financial year and a copy will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The existing terms and conditions of grant set out the requirements that all grant recipients must meet in their use of Social Inclusion Partnership funds. However, each grant recipient also has in place local arrangements setting out the conditions agreed between the grant recipient and projects that the partnership decides to fund. These arrangements are agreed locally.</p>

  <p>A copy of the current terms and conditions of grant for the Social Inclusion Partnership Fund, produced by the Scottish Executive Development Department in 1999, has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 11476).</p>

  <p>These figures also take no account of the possibility that many organisations will take advantage of water metering, where this will reduce their costs. It is therefore likely that additional income to the authorities will accordingly be reduced.</p>

  <p>The Convenor of the Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that the six disabled parking bays incorporated in the landscaping proposals are intended to improve access to surrounding areas and tourist attractions as well as to the Parliament. Security considerations require the Parliament building to have a protective zone that prevents vehicles parking closer than 25 metres around the building&#8217;s perimeter. After consultation with the project&#8217;s access consultants, the pedestrian crossing over the &quot;traffic calmed&quot; Horse Wynd was relocated to provide a direct route to the Parliament&#8217;s public entrance from the parking bays.</p>

Our vending machine providers are unable to supply Fair Trade beverages at present, although they will keep this under review.
