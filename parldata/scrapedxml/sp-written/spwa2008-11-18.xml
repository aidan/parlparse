  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-16814 by Kenny MacAskill on 21 October 2008, whether it intends to take action to increase the number of test purchases of alcohol conducted in police force areas where the number conducted is comparatively and disproportionately low.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that test purchasing provides the police with a useful additional tool to help prevent illegal underage sales of alcohol and that active test purchasing encourages licensees to be more vigilant in exercising their legal obligations to avoid underage sales.</p>

  <p>However, it is just one tactical option available to the police to enforce the law and the number of tests, in themselves, cannot be taken as a reflection of the extent of enforcement activity taking place in a police force area. It also need to be borne in mind that the safety and welfare of the young test purchasers is a paramount consideration and it has taken some forces longer than others to recruit test purchasers and to ensure all the necessary safeguards are in place. We will continue to work with ACPOS to encourage and support test purchasing arrangements.</p>

  <p>It is important to stress that Community First Responders are utilised in addition to an emergency ambulance response being dispatched.</p>

  <p>Where schemes are in place, the Scottish Ambulance Service dispatch Community First Responders to all life threatening category A calls except road traffic accidents, any calls indicating a violent or domestic situation or obstetric calls.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have been in regular contact with the UK government on the issue of fuel costs on a number of occasions in recent months. Examples of this include writing to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to call for a delay in the planed increase in fuel duty which was subsequently postponed. We have also written to the then Scottish Secretary calling to action to alleviate the impact of high fuel prices on vulnerable households in response to the changing economic climate. We also requested use of an EU derogation which would allow a lower rate of fuel duty to be levied in rural and island communities &ndash; two areas hardest hit by the increase in fuel prices. We have also discussed assistance for the fishing industry with UK ministers on a number of separate occasions.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing attended the UK-wide ministerial Fuel Poverty group in July 2008 and discussions on fuel poverty issues have since continued.</p>

  <p>We are continuing to press the UK government for action to minimise the impact of high fuel prices, particularly on our most vulnerable people, including urging a reduction on taxation on domestic energy bills this winter. We are also in discussions with the UK government on a range of UK-wide energy saving initiatives to ensure that Scottish consumers receive at least a fair share of the benefits. We have also said that greater powers over energy matters would allow the right decisions to be taken on energy policy for Scotland, as part of the National Conversation.</p>

  <p>We have not held specific recent discussions with fuel companies on this issue. However, we made it clear that we would expect any fall in the price of oil to be passed on in the form of lower petrol prices as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>More generally, the Scottish Government has been actively calling for action to deal with the impact of rising petrol prices. We wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 3 June 2008 calling for the postponement of the planned 2p increase in fuel duty for October 2008, which subsequently occurred. We also called for the introduction of a fuel duty regulator so that any extra tax raised as a result of higher petrol prices went back into a fuel duty cut. In addition, we have also requested use of an EU derogation which would allow a lower rate of fuel duty to be levied in rural and island communities, two areas hardest hit by the increase in fuel prices.</p>

  <p>&pound;45,000 has been allocated to themed events for Homecoming Scotland 2009 in Ayrshire. A further themed event, Doors Open Days, will take place across Scotland including locations in Ayrshire.

  <p>The application to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is part of a national, strategic project focusing on the marketing and promotion of Homecoming. Those events taking place in the eight eligible areas, including East Ayrshire, will benefit from marketing activity supported with ERDF funding.</p>

  <p>This marketing activity would not be happening to the extent it is without this funding. ERDF funding is claimed back after the expenditure has occurred.</p>

  <p>Wider issues concerning the promotion of alcohol and potential measures under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 are being considered in light of the responses to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol</em>, but we are clear that we do not propose to ban promotions that explain the method of production, history and heritage of Scotland&rsquo;s quality products. We have already given the Scotch Whisky Association an assurance that we will discuss these matters with them before proposing any regulatory action to end the irresponsible promotion of alcohol. I also gave an assurance, when I met the Scotch Whisky Association and toured Dewar&rsquo;s World of Whisky on 21 July 2008, that our proposals will not prevent drams being provided as part of distillery tours.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that the Scottish Government will continue its fares policy at RPI+1% for regulated fares and that there will be no change in balance between regulated and unregulated fares.</p>

  <p>In addition, we have looked at the position in the Strathclyde area. Ministers will align Strathclyde fares changes with the rest of Scotland from January 2009. So that Strathclyde passengers are not adversely affected by the earlier increase ministers have secured a lower rate of increase to Strathclyde fares at 4%. Strathclyde fares would have increased by 6% in May 2009.</p>

  <p>Both of these measures are consistent with the aims of Scotland&rsquo;s Railways; they will maintain the affordability of passenger rail travel and simplify fares arrangements.</p>
