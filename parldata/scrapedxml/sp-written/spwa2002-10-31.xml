<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-10-31.S1O-5764.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1031.htm#1">

  <p>The NHS Scotland Breast Screening Programme provides routine breast screening every three years for women aged 50-64. Women below the age of 50, irrespective of whether or not they received diethylstilboestrol (DES) during pregnancy, are not routinely screened due to the density of their breast tissue which makes it difficult to detect problems.</p>

  <p>Some of those women whose mothers received DES during pregnancy between 1941 and 1975 will already be within the routine breast screening age range. However, any women irrespective of their age who has concerns, should seek advice from their General Practitioner (GP) and may be referred by their GP to the symptomatic breast service, where appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has measures in place to reduce skills shortages in the construction industry. The Scottish Welfare to Work Task Force has established a construction sub-group to develop an appropriate construction industry training course for New Deal clients in Scotland.

There are now almost 5,000 Modern Apprentices undergoing construction-related training in Scotland, of which over 1,200 are in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>In addition, Scottish Enterprise is taking forward a Modernising Construction<i> </i>initiative. Objectives include achieving radical improvements in construction industry skills.</p>

  <p>I fully recognise the particular difficulties being faced by the wider Ayrshire economy, and am confident that local agencies will meet these challenges by working up a shared economic development strategy to boost the local economy and create jobs for local people. This strategy is currently being finalised by the Local Economic Forum and focuses on the key objectives of boosting the economy, developing the workforce and reducing unemployment.</p>

  <p>We intend to promote credible alternatives to widespread closure of our fishing grounds. The processing sector also has other sources of supply and is not wholly dependent on whitefish.

  <p>I am pleased to announce that the Technology Transfer Office is formally established today. It is owned jointly by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise and will operate under the name of Scottish Health Innovations (SHI). A not-for-profit company limited by guarantee, SHI has been established with the sole aim of providing NHSScotland with the necessary support and expertise to identify, manage, protect and exploit its innovative technologies.</p>

  <p>The planning and funding of this initiative - which will total over &#163;2 million over the next five years - has been a collaborative enterprise. The &#163;1.3 million offer of funding from the Health Department's Chief Scientist Office will be supplemented by &#163;450,000 from Scottish Enterprise, &#163;150,000 from Highlands and Islands Enterprise and a further &#163;425,000 won from the Department of Trade and Industry by a consortium of NHS bodies. Additionally, trusts will allow a proportion of the royalties gained from successful exploitation to be retained by SHI for further development and support of NHS technologies.</p>

  <p>Over time, the SHI website will become a shop window for Scottish NHS technologies, both for the benefit of commercial companies interested in licensing those innovations and for NHS researchers. In the more immediate future, it will be a valuable resource for sharing and disseminating such technologies within the NHS.</p>

  <p>The fulfilment of this white paper commitment is an important step in our aim of harnessing NHS innovation for the benefit of the health and the wealth of the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>This commitment was taken forward by the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s Expert Group on the Health care of Older People. Its report, <i>Adding Life to Years, </i> which we published in January 2002, makes a number of recommendations, including the need for a review of the routine health checks of the over 75s offered by primary care. The Scottish Executive Health Department is considering how best to take forward implementation of these recommendations.</p>

  <p>Our policy on this issue will take account of advice from the National Screening Committee (NSC), which is planning two workshops to review all the evidence on the subject, in particular the results which have just emerged from a large, comprehensive trial funded by the Medical Research Council on screening of older people.

  <p>Historic Scotland hosted an exhibition entitled The Thistle and the Rose at Stirling Castle from March to May this year, in conjunction with the National Archives of Scotland and supported by Scottish Widows. The exhibition marked the 500th anniversary of the Treaty of Perpetual Peace in 1502, which was underpinned by the marriage the following year of Scotland&#146;s James IV to Margaret Tudor, the sister of Henry VIII. The exhibition illustrated the significance of that marriage to the history of the relationship between Scotland and England and the Executive has no separate plans to mark its 500th anniversary next year.</p>

  <p>Interception of communications makes an important contribution to the way in which the police and other law enforcement agencies prevent and detect serious crime in Scotland.

  <p>My statement to Parliament on 5 September ( <i>Official Report</i> , <i> </i> cols. 13371 to 13375) referred to a number of developments intended to improve performance management, effectiveness and best value in the prison service. These include the Partnership Agreement reached between the SPS and its trades unions, record investment in the public sector estate and work to introduce published performance agreements for publicly run prisons.</p>

  <p>I was impressed by the dedication of the Governor and her new team who are having to deal with large prisoner numbers and help tackle a serious drug problem in the area.</p>

  <p>I was pleased to learn that the staffing complement at Aberdeen has been increased by five officers to take account of escort demands and the need to balance the sick variable which has been traditionally very low in Aberdeen and fell short of that required to meet current demands. Further measures have been taken to recruit staff and four officers will commence duty in November. Any shortfall in staff is being countered by the ability to offer special payments to existing prison staff. This provides a flexible and effective method of dealing with the unpredictable demands associated with court appearances and hospital guards.</p>

  <p>I was encouraged by the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) plans to improve the health centre as part of a carefully constructed development plan for the whole work on which the SPS have under way. Plans for a new visit facility are under active consideration. Additionally, formulation of a development plan for the prison has commenced and will ensure that any future building work takes account of the projected prisoner population.</p>

  <p>The <i>Scottish Prison Service Estates Review</i> analysed the future supply of prisoner places and set out options for meeting the projected shortfall of supply against demand. My statement on 5 September set out the Executive&#146;s decisions in relation to new prisons and investment in existing prisons. The Scottish Prison Service is currently modelling the detailed effect of these decisions on the supply of prisoner places. It is not possible, however, to say how many places there will be in each prison in each of the next 10 years since this depends on future operational decisions and factors such as the time taken to obtain planning permission, the need for and availability of suitable alternative accommodation during refurbishment and changes in the total and composition of the prisoner population.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made progress in promoting the use of public transport in a number of ways. The introduction on 30 September of free local bus travel for pensioners and disabled people outwith the morning peak makes public transport more accessible and affordable to many. The Executive continues to provide support for improvements through the Public Transport Fund, with &#163;175 million-going to 79 projects. On 18 September I launched Traveline Scotland, a telephone enquiry service providing timetable and journey planning information. The travel awareness campaign Learn to Let Go which is now in its second year has raised levels of public awareness.</p>

  <p>As the member will be aware, the legislation governing irresponsible lending is reserved. However, we are in regular contact with a range of financial organisations such as the Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers and the Scottish Credit Union movement, with whom we discuss a range of social and financial inclusion issues.</p>

  <p>I launched the National Recruitment and Awareness Campaign on 22 October. This aims to raise the profile of social care and social work and to highlight the range of career options available. The campaign is a key part of a sustained commitment to ensuring a confident and competent social services workforce which can meet the demands placed upon it.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has regular discussions with COSLA, the body which represents Scotland's local authorities in relation to these issues.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has more than met it's commitment to fund the agreement <i>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</i> in full. The total costs of the package and the distribution between councils were agreed, in writing, with COSLA.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The management of teacher absence and the causes of absence are matters for individual local authorities as employers. However, Scottish local authorities provide Audit Scotland with information on sickness absence levels among local government staff, including teachers. Table 6b of its most recent report entitled <i>Performance Indicators 2000/2001: Benefits, Finance &amp; Corporate Issues</i>, published on 24 January 2002, contains comparative data for 1999-2000 and 2000-01 and can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/02pi04ac.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/02pi04ac.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is an appeal mechanism to inquire into the reasons for the failure of a local authority to follow planning guidelines relating to planning obligations required through agreements entered into under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 and what the reasons are for the position on this matter.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory appeal mechanism in planning legislation relating to planning agreements under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. It is for the person(s) with an interest in the land in question (insofar as the interest of that person enables him/her to bind the land) and the planning authority to &quot;agree&quot; the terms of any section 75 agreement.</p>

  <p>More generally, complaints about the actions of planning authorities can be pursued with the relevant Council Monitoring Officer, the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman and/or through the courts as appropriate.</p>

  <p>As part of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service Victim Information and Assistance arrangements (VIA), victims are notified by first class post, usually on the same day that the court grants bail. Where special conditions have been applied to the bail order (for example, to stay away from the victim or from a particular place), the victim is telephoned with the information and that is followed up with a letter enclosing a copy of the bail order. If the victim cannot be contacted by telephone, there are arrangements under which the police try to find the victim and provide the information, reporting back to VIA on the action they have taken. VIA provides information up to the conclusion of the case, including any appeal.</p>

  <p>In areas in which VIA does not yet operate, procurators fiscal and police forces pass information to victims under local arrangements.</p>
