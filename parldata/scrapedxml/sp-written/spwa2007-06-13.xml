  <p>The Parliament agreed on 31 May 2007 that the tolls on the Forth and Tay road bridges should be removed. We welcome the support of the Parliament for this, and the widespread support expressed by local people and businesses, including the Fife Federation of Small Businesses. In doing so, we are taking forward a key pre-election commitment.</p>

  <p>We will be discussing the detail of the changes with the bridges and other authorities, but have no plans for further public consultation on this proposal.</p>

  <p>We are very aware of the potential impacts of removing the tolls on the staff who work on the bridge, and will be discussing any impacts with the bridge authority as a matter of priority.</p>

  <p>Staff at the Forth Road Bridge are employed by the Forth Estuary Transport Authority. Issues relating to the possible redeployment of staff are a matter for the authority in the first instance.</p>

  <p>The 1996 Scottish House Condition Survey was the most recent evidence available prior to the introduction of the central heating programme (CHP) in 2001. It showed that there were 32,000 owner-occupier households over 60 years of age without any form of central heating in their homes.</p>

  <p>The 2002 survey, completed prior to the extension of the CHP in 2004, showed that 14,000 over 80s households had either partial or inefficient central heating.</p>

  <p>The number of private sector households that have actually taken advantage of the scheme to date is, according to the number of installations between September 2001 and end April 2007, 58,000. During the lifetime of the scheme the number of Scottish households has grown and the age distribution has changed. This figure also includes a significant number of instances where the programme has replaced defective central heating systems.</p>

  <p>We will support the money advice sector to help those with problem debt. We will increase individuals&rsquo; ability to use financial products and services through financial education, both in and out of school. We will support third sector lenders (credit unions, and community development finance institutions) who provide affordable credit.</p>

  <p>However, our ability to assist in this area is limited due to powers over several important areas that can effect levels of debt such as regulation of consumer credit and financial services and the tax and benefit systems.</p>

  <p>The 11 local authorities receiving the Financial Inclusion Fund are implementing a range of financial education activities. Following positive evaluation, the pilot education projects with Citizens Advice Scotland and the Greater Easterhouse Money Advice have received continuation funding. The lessons learned and best practice developed by Financial Inclusion Initiative Fife will be used to inform the future direction and delivery of services in Fife.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it expects to announce continuation of the Violence Against Women Fund; whether it is proposing any steps to assist local authorities to match any funds that it makes available, and whether any delay in announcing funding has had an impact on any projects run by voluntary organisations across Scotland.</p>

  <p>All projects have funding until March 2008. All projects funded under the Violence Against Women fund were required to consider the issue of on-going funding in their applications, in the event that central funding was not continued after March 2008.</p>

  <p>Until the current spending review is complete the Scottish Government will not be in a position to make any announcements about funding, including the possible extension of the Violence Against Women Fund. However, we will make a decision about the future of the fund as soon as possible after the spending review outcomes are known to avoid any unnecessary adverse impact on projects.</p>

  <p>Match funding was not a requirement of the Violence Against Women Fund but it is recognised as an indication of partnership support at a local level and many local authorities and other local statutory bodies do provide match funding for projects.</p>

  <p>Argyll and Bute education authority is responsible for arrangements to transport pupils to school and the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is responsible for the setting of examinations. I understand that, for the duration of the exams, the authority put in place special school transport arrangements to bypass the protests. These arrangements have now been rescinded, and no problems have been reported to the education authority. The SQA has also confirmed that no special circumstances have arisen with examinations in the area.</p>

  <p>The official source for data on public sector employment is the Quarterly Public Sector Employment (QPSE) series. However, the QPSE is not available below a national level.</p>

  <p>Data on public sector employment is available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) by local authority area. However, it is known that the LFS/APS overestimates the number of people employed in the public sector. This is due to the fact that sector of employment is determined by the individual and some people believe they work in the public sector when in fact they do not. Table 1 shows the number and proportion of people working in the public sector within Dundee City, Angus and Aberdeenshire for five years up to 2005 (the latest calendar year which reliable data are available at a local authority level) taken from the LFS/APS. Please note, as stated above, these are not directly comparable with the official public sector employment estimates from the QPSE series.</p>

  <p>Also please note the estimates are based on a sample survey, and as such, are subject to some sampling error. Taking account of sampling error there are no statistically significant differences in public sector employment levels between any of the years within Aberdeenshire, Angus or Dundee City.</p>

  <p>Sources: Labour Force Survey (LFS), Quarters combined for 2001-02. In 2003 the Scottish figure is taken from the Annual Scottish LFS (ASLFS). In 2004 and 2005 the figures are taken from the APS. The APS and ASLFS include boosts to the main LFS. This means there is a discontinuity in the series.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises the potential economic benefits which could flow from the re-establishment of the ferry service. We have not yet had the opportunity to discuss the way forward for the Campbeltown to Ballycastle service with the reconstituted Northern Ireland Assembly or with the Northern Ireland Executive.

  <p>A survey to collect general practice workforce data was developed last year in collaboration with BMA Scotland and the Royal College of General Practitioners Scotland. The survey identifies the number of people in general practices working full and part-time and estimates the expected number of retirals. This exercise provides evidence and information to support workforce planning at NHS board and at national level, which in turn informs the number of GP training posts required.</p>

  <p>The number of training places for GPs is determined by local and national workforce planning. In the <em>NHS Scotland National Workforce Plan 2006</em> , it was indicated that the number of GP training posts from August 2007 would increase by 50.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland is assessing a proposal by Hjaltland Housing Association and Shetland Islands Council to operate a tenants incentive scheme. The Scottish Government is currently considering how best to support those who aspire to home ownership, but who are unable to become owner-occupiers with their own resources, and will look at the proposal for Shetland in that context.</p>

  <p>I have already confirmed that in honouring our commitment to maintain accident and emergency services at Ayr and Monklands, I am not signalling a general review of service changes that have been made in the NHS.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS Borders to plan and deliver services to meet the needs of its resident population. The board has retained the hospital site in Coldstream to provide a dental care facility for the people of Berwickshire and it will reinvest savings from the closure of the Jedburgh facility in development of a community heath centre in the town.</p>

  <p>I am keen that we maintain forward momentum and don't consider it would necessarily be helpful or indeed possible to reconsider the decisions taken by NHS Borders. However, I will continue to engage with local communities about the range of services provided locally.</p>

  <p>I recognise that there are many issues to address, for example relating to clinical workload and staffing. I want these challenges to be faced up to in a way that puts patients first and is innovative.</p>

  <p>It is now a matter for the board to determine how best to deliver these services and to produce proposals. Their proposals will then undergo a process of independent scrutiny, following which I expect to take a decision by the turn of the year.</p>

  <p>UK Sport has responsibility for the UK Performance Pathway and through this a total of &pound;600 million has been made available over the six years from 2006-07 to 2012-13 to support athletes, including Scottish athletes, from having their talent confirmed all the way to the podium. This figure includes a total of &pound;300 million additional funding made available by the UK Government in the March 2006 Budget to support the UK&rsquo;s 2012 ambitions - &pound;200 million of which is provided through exchequer funding, with a further &pound;100 million to be raised by the UK Government through the private sector.</p>

  <p>Support for athletes is tiered according to their performance potential and ranges from financial support with living costs and competition and travel expenses to sports science and medical support, coaching, and equipment. Support is offered to UK athletes, including Scottish athletes and support comes from across the UK, again, including in Scotland, for example through the Scottish Institute of Sport.</p>

  <p>There are currently a total of 122 Scottish athletes funded through UK Sport&rsquo;s World Class Performance Programme across 29 Olympic and Paralympic sports. Forty-three of those athletes are on the World Class Podium Programme, while 79 are on the World Class Development Programme. In total, approximately &pound;6 million per annum is currently being invested directly in Scottish athletes by UK Sport. This figure does not include more generic funding from UK Sport to support UK National Governing Body performance activity.</p>

  <p>In addition, sportscotland invests &pound;5 million per annum in the Scottish Institute Network (Scottish Institute and the six Area Institutes), which in turn provides support to Scottish athletes, including Olympic athletes. Sportscotland invest a further &pound;5 million per annum in SGBs&rsquo; sporting pathways. This includes investment in coaching and programme support for athletes.</p>

  <p>We have not received any representations from Scottish Coal on this issue.</p>

  <p>It would be for the company, in the first instance, to consider the feasibility of opening a deep mine. Any proposal brought forward would need to be considered against the relevant statutory provisions in Scottish planning legislation. These ensure that any likely significant effects on the environment are taken into account in the decision making process.</p>

  <p>Public consultation would, of course, be vital for a project such as this and advertisement in the local press and neighbour notification would be required. In addition, planning guidance encourages operators to work closely with local communities at the pre-application stage and the Executive would certainly encourage full community involvement for a project like this. We intend to introduce regulations under the Planning Act 2006 to put in place new statutory procedures for pre-application consultation for major developments.</p>

  <p>Decisions on planning applications are, in the first instance, a matter for planning authorities. The circumstances for notifying applications to the Scottish ministers is set out in <em>Scottish Executive Development Department Circular 5/2007: Notification of Planning Applications</em>, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42716). Paragraphs 24 to 27 explain some of the circumstances where ministers may call in applications for their own determination, although much will depend on the individual circumstances of specific cases. Applicants that are refused planning permission also have a right of appeal to the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>Shortages of land for development are addressed by planning authorities through the development plan process. A new framework for development plans, which will help to deliver up-to-date, relevant development plans, was set out in the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006. The new provisions are expected to come into force in autumn 2008, following the preparation of related secondary legislation. In addition, where a development plan is not adequately addressing the need for land, for example where it is out of date, planning authorities have powers to grant planning permission contrary to the development plan, subject to appropriate consultation and scrutiny.</p>

  <p>Scottish Planning Policy 6 (SPP6) on Renewable Energy makes clear public participation in the planning process is important. Views of the public, where based on relevant planning matters, will be material considerations that should be taken into account when considering proposals. Local communities and their representatives are free to organise referenda to elicit such community views, and we encourage them to do so where they feel that the circumstances merit such an approach.</p>

  <p>Applications to develop wind farms will be considered on their merits, taking into account all material considerations, including those put forward by local communities. Where an application is made under planning legislation for a development with less than 50MW generating capacity, the decision will be in the first instance for the planning authority. It may then be notified or, if refused, appealed to the Scottish ministers. Applications for developments with generating capacity greater than 50MW are made directly to Scottish ministers, under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. Given their role in these decision-making processes, ministers can not comment in advance on any application which may come before them for determination.</p>

  <p>Under the Electricity Act 1989, the Scottish Executive only process consent applications to develop electricity generation stations over 50MW, with a number of exceptions where the limit is lower e.g. hydro 1MW. Highland Council are consulted on all such applications located in the Highlands. When responding, the council will take into account its own planning policies, including its strategy for renewable energy.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers will then determine the application after carefully considering all material issues. If the council object to a proposal, a public local inquiry must be held before Scottish ministers can determine the application.</p>

  <p>Applications below these thresholds are made to the council as the relevant planning authority and it would be for them, or the reporter in the case of an appeal, to consider the weight to be attached to the energy strategy and all other considerations.</p>
