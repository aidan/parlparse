  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-36491 on 30 September 2010. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government notes that this is an opinion and it will be the judgement of the EU Court of Justice that specifies what the law is on this matter.</p>

  <p>This government has made very clear its opposition to dawn raids and to the enforced removal and detention of children. The Minister for Culture and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop, wrote to Damian Green, the UK Government&rsquo;s Minister for Immigration, on 9 September 2010 asking for urgent clarification of the UK Government position and urging him not to renege on the promise to end child detention. We will continue to pursue this issue with UK Government ministers until they deliver on this commitment.</p>

  <p>Asylum support (accommodation and cash support) for asylum seekers is a matter for the UK Border Agency. However, through the Race, Religion and Refugee Integration Funding Stream the Scottish Government has provided &pound;5.6 million for the period 2008-11 to improve the lives of minority ethnic and faith communities in Scotland including refugees and asylum seekers, migrant workers and gypsies/travellers.</p>

  <p>No decisions have been made regarding funding post 2011 which will be subject to the spending review.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for local authorities. The particular information requested is not held centrally. However, there are around 80 local area co-ordinator (LAC) posts in 26 local authority areas in Scotland. Most of these LACs support adults with disabilities and their families, which can include older carers. Some of the LACs have broadened out their role to support older people and other client groups. The carers strategy, <em>Caring Together</em> , published in July this year, contains a range of actions that take account of the needs of older carers.</p>

  <p>The setting of the council tax is the responsibility of each local authority. However, the following table illustrates the increase in each council tax band for each local authority if the funding for the council tax freeze was withdrawn. It has been assumed that the council tax would have increased by the equivalent of the &pound;70 million per annum provided by the Scottish Government over the period 2008-11.</p>

  <p>We have an ongoing programme of system reviews and audits which should serve to ensure that databases and IT system procedures are compliant across core Scottish Government and its agencies. Our work on implementing information asset registers has also contributed to this task by recording details about the data held and information about the systems and databases in which it resides.

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the importance of innovation as a key determinant of our long-term economic growth. Our focus is on alignment across the wider public sector to create a flexible, supportive business environment and we look to our enterprise agencies to deliver support for Scottish businesses, including those in the service sector.</p>

  <p>Following the launch of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Innovation for Scotland</em> framework last year, our enterprise agencies have reviewed existing programmes to provide support to companies for the development of more competitive products and services. For example, Scottish Enterprise has created a new Innovation Support Service which is designed to help businesses use innovation as a driver of competitive advantage in areas such as service innovation and ICT-driven business model innovation to increase revenues and profitability. We will continue to work along with our enterprise agencies and other public bodies to provide support for the competitive growth of all Scottish businesses.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to reach the 2020 emissions reduction target of 42% and how it is measuring progress.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-09-30.S3W-36407.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0930.htm#10">

  <p>On 22 September 2010, the Scottish Government laid a draft Order before Parliament that will set annual emissions reduction targets for the years 2010 to 2022. These targets are designed to prescribe an emission trajectory which will achieve the 42% reduction required by 2020.</p>

  <p>The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 requires that the Scottish ministers also publish a Report on Proposals and Policies for meeting these targets. This report will be published together with a Low Carbon Economy Strategy before the end of the year. These documents will follow the publication of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan in October and together will detail the specific measures that the Scottish Government is putting in place to accelerate emissions reduction and provide strategic direction for the public and private sectors.</p>

  <p>This work will build on emissions reduction measures that the Scottish Government is already undertaking, including, for example:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government launched the &pound;10 million Saltire Prize and has tripled funding for micro and community generation with &pound;13.5 million available per year.</p>

  <p>In 2009-10, we committed &pound;15 million to a new Home Insulation Scheme targeting 100,000 homes in 10 local authority areas. This was increased to &pound;25 million in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>Our &pound;27million Climate Challenge Fund has helped around 250 communities reduce their emissions saving around 700,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>, the equivalent of taking 225,000 cars off Scotland&rsquo;s roads.</p>

  <p>The Energy Saving Scotland boiler scrappage scheme supported over 4,600 householders with a &pound;400 grant towards the replacement of a working G-rated boiler (for over 60s, this did not need to be in working order) with an energy efficient model certified under the Energy Saving Trust recommended scheme.</p>

  <p>With regard to measuring progress, the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 includes extensive provision for monitoring and reporting on progress towards achieving Scotland&rsquo;s climate change targets:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Environment/climatechange/scotlands-action/climatechangeact/targets" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Environment/climatechange/scotlands-action/climatechangeact/targets</a>.</p>

  <p>This includes a requirement that for each year in the period 2010-50, ministers provide Parliament with a report on annual targets, no later than October 31 in the second year after the target year, when emissions figures become available in the Disaggregated Greenhouse Gas Inventory for Scotland. In recognition of the time lag associated with these figures, the Act also requires that the Scottish ministers publish an assessment of the impact on emissions of budget proposals. The first of these carbon assessments was published in September 2009. To ensure external scrutiny, from 2011 ministers must request that the expert Committee on Climate Change report annually setting out its views on progress towards Scottish emissions reduction targets. Ministers are also required to publish a response to this report.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) pilot will be completed in early 2011 and the final evaluation report will be published thereafter. Initial findings indicate that there has been no significant displacement of traffic as a result of RET. The interim evaluation report and other relevant documents are available on the Scottish Government website:</p>

  <p>An assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed scheme, during construction and operation, has been undertaken. Details of potential impacts, mitigation measures proposed to avoid or reduce impacts and any residual impacts are presented in the Environmental Statement, which can be found on the project website <a href="http://www.forthreplacementcrossing.info" target="_blank">www.forthreplacementcrossing.info</a> . These include groundwater and water environment impacts and highlighted a potential issue in the area around the South Queensferry junction.</p>

  <p>A further assessment of this potential issue, based on the findings of the Forth Replacement Crossing project ground investigations carried out in 2008, 2009 and 2010 together with ongoing groundwater monitoring has been undertaken.

  <p>The role of the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) is set out in statute. It includes the provision of advice to ministers, and the duty to secure the coherent provision of further and higher education. Ministers do not consider that the provision of advice on the merger proposal conflicts in any way with the SFC&rsquo;s involvement in the implementation of the merger, or on the manner in which the SFC reports on progress.</p>

  <p>Ministers will expect to be regularly apprised by the SFC on progress, reflecting the close interest of ministers in the development of the new college.</p>

  <p>I understand that the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) consulted on the future curriculum which might be delivered by Glasgow colleges. However, it was the Scottish Government, and the colleges themselves, which consulted on the merger proposal. I am unaware of any separate consultation on the merger undertaken by the SFC.</p>

  <p>In general, ministers would expect all public bodies to consult on significant propositions, and to apply their judgment on the organisations and individuals which might be involved.</p>

  <p>Ministers have now published the main evidence on which the decision to approve the merger was based. That evidence includes the educational rationale for the merger cited jointly by the three merging colleges, and the advice provided to ministers by the Scottish Funding Council which also highlighted the benefits of merger. The relevant documents can be viewed on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website at:</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers promote the Romans in Scotland in a variety of ways. Recognising the importance of the monuments themselves, through Historic Scotland, they have scheduled 238 Roman sites in Scotland as nationally important, 18 of which are currently in the care of Scottish Ministers and are open to the public and promoted as places to visit. Historic Scotland is also currently assessing all Roman forts and camps in Scotland to ensure that the most important sites are preserved for future generations and to celebrate Scotland&rsquo;s unique Roman heritage.</p>

  <p>Following the recognition of the Antonine Wall by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2008, Historic Scotland has worked with the five local authorities and other partners, including the Forestry Commission, British Waterways and the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments, to establish processes and projects aimed at delivering the actions listed in the World Heritage Site Management Plan. A number of projects and events have already taken place. In order to bring a consistent approach to the understanding and promotion of the wall the partners have commissioned (through Historic Scotland Interpretation Unit) an interpretation plan for the Antonine Wall which will be issued for comment in October 2010. It will include a plan for the partner organisations to provide interpretive and educational material relating to the Antonine Wall and the wider story of the Romans in Scotland both on and off site. It will be followed by plans to bring the same consistency to access and marketing all aimed at increasing access to and an understanding of the Romans in Scotland and within the Empire, making it relevant to visitors and local communities alike.</p>

  <p>Learning and Teaching Scotland&rsquo;s &quot;Scotland&rsquo;s History&quot; website hosts a section on Caledonians, Picts and Romans that gives access to extensive materials which promote Roman history in Scotland. These include background information, audio and video clips, games and teachers&rsquo; resource packs as well as links to the collections databases of National Museums of Scotland, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, the Hunterian Museum and the British Museum. There are also direct links to other relevant websites such as Historic Scotland, the BBC&rsquo;s Scotland&rsquo;s History, Channel 4 History, Archaeology Scotland and the Antonine Guard.</p>

  <p>There are a wide variety of Roman heritage based events and educational activities which have taken place across Scotland in 2010 involving a number of key partners who share a common interest in the promotion of Roman heritage. Historic Scotland also recently provided grant support for the International Limes Congress, part of which included a tour for international experts of Roman sites in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government currently has no plans to create a National Roman Centre nor has it plans to commission the research that would be needed to support the development of such a list. The current priority is to work, through Historic Scotland, with local authorities and other partnership organisations to deliver the management plan outcomes agreed with UNESCO in 2008 for the Antonine Wall World Heritage Site.</p>

  <p>There are many important collections of Roman artefacts dispersed around Scotland in both national and local museums. Such collections already provide an invaluable resource for the study and interpretation of Roman Scotland.</p>

  <p>Staff at the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) have experience in both the private and public sector of delivering large investment projects. This experience is demonstrated by the SFT&rsquo;S delivery of &pound;111 million of net savings and benefits for the taxpayer during 2009-10, its first full year of operation. The National Housing Trust (NHT) initiative is a collaborative project and the SFT is acting as a central purchasing body for the NHT. The SFT has worked closely with Scottish Government and local authority housing officers, along with the private sector, in the NHT&rsquo;s development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has responded to the UK Government&rsquo;s consultation on how the mechanism for its proposed cap on immigration should operate. Our opposition to an annual limit on immigration is based on the potentially serious economic consequences for Scotland.</p>

  <p>This was confirmed and, accordingly, the NHS board initiated formal public consultation on 30 August 2010. This will run until 30 November 2010 and I would encourage all local stakeholders to play a full part in this process and to register their views with the board.</p>

  <p>Significant collaborative procurement in Scotland is undertaken by a National and various Sectoral Centres of Expertise. This model was established on the recommendation of John McClelland CBE in his report <em>Review of Public Procurement in Scotland</em> . Under this model:</p>

  <p>(a) Procurement reform is well established in the health sector &ndash; a Business Improvement Programme commenced in 2003, with reform consolidated across the sector by the launch of a Centre for Procurement Expertise (National Procurement, NHS National Services Scotland) in 2005. This activity has delivered &pound;172 million of savings to date and is on track to deliver a further &pound;29 million in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>(b) The Higher and Further Education Sector Centre for Procurement Expertise (Advanced Purchasing for Colleges and Universities) was established in 2007-08 and has delivered over &pound;15 million savings since then, and is on track to deliver over &pound;10 million in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>(c) Collaborative procurement in other parts of the public sector has delivered savings of &pound;94 million to date, and is on track to deliver a further &pound;49 million in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>Our consistent policy has been and remains to ensure that public sector pay settlements in Scotland are moderate, affordable, sustainable and demonstrate value for money.</p>

  <p>In our annual pay policies, we have progressively tightened pay parameters, and will continue to do so in respect of 2011-12.</p>

  <p>Ministers themselves have given a clear lead in pay restraint by freezing their pay in 2009-10 and 2010-11. We have also extended this approach to the highest paid people under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s control, through freezing the basic pay of chief executives of non-departmental public bodies and of senior civil servants.</p>

  <p>We have consistently borne down on non-consolidated performance-related payments for senior public sector staff, reducing the number of chief executives with a contractual entitlement to such payments, and also reducing their scale.</p>

  <p>In addition, in 2009-10 and again this year, we have asked the chairs of non-departmental public bodies and public corporations to invite their chief executives to waive part or all of any bonus to which they may be entitled. A significant number of chief executives have chosen to respond positively to this invitation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that smoking can be a contributory factor to vision loss in some cases.</p>

  <p>To coincide with the introduction of the smoke-free legislation in 2006, which banned smoking in most work places, the Scottish Government supported RNIB Scotland to raise awareness around the health risks associated with smoking and loss of sight through a series of road shows across the country. RNIB Scotland continue to raise awareness of such issues through their website.</p>

  <p>We will, of course, continue to look for opportunities to raise awareness of the issue through social marketing activity undertaken by the Scottish Government and our key partners such as NHS Health Scotland, ASH Scotland and RNIB Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, work is also ongoing to increase the number of brief interventions and referrals for specialist smoking cessation support made by all health professionals. Included in this is the range of professions involved in the assessment and treatment of patients where there may be a risk of sight loss.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is driving forward a programme of action to improve the physical and mental well being of those with mental health problems, including by encouraging and promoting smoke-free lifestyles.</p>

  <p>In March 2010, following extensive consultation with key stakeholders, we announced that new guidance would be prepared to help mental health residential service providers move towards establishing smoke-free environments. The aim of this guidance, which is being developed by NHS Health Scotland in consultation with key stakeholders and service users, will be to drive change at a pace which is acceptable to individual services, and, most importantly, to the service users themselves. The guidance will draw on best practice from residential mental health services which have already successfully implemented completely smoke-free policies. The guidance is expected to be published by the end of March 2011.</p>

  <p>It is recognised, of course, that a key component of achieving smoke-free services is to ensure that appropriate stop smoking support and advice is available. With this in mind the Scottish Government is continuing to invest in NHS stop smoking services, over &pound;40 million in this spending review period to enable NHS boards to provide high-quality and accessible services across their areas.</p>

  <p>Moreover the <em>Guide to Smoking Cessation in Scotland 2010 - Planning and Providing Specialist Smoking Cessation Services</em>, published by NHS Health Scotland and ASH Scotland, includes guidance on how evidence-informed specialist stop smoking services should operate. This includes a recommendation that when working with people with mental health problems tailored smoking cessation advice should be provided and timely access to an intensive smoking cessation service, with fast tracking, should be offered where possible.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the many challenges faced by both service users and service providers in mental health establishments in relation to smoking levels. That is why detailed guidance is being developed by Health Scotland which will help to inform and encourage inpatient units to provide healthier non-smoking environments for patients. The guidance will help service providers to plan, prepare and put in place robust strategies to challenge the smoking culture that presently exists in many of these units.</p>

  <p>We do not currently have formal arrangements in place for national-level monitoring of smoking levels in mental health inpatient units but we are exploring the scope for updating a mapping report on smoking policies in residential psychiatric services which was undertaken by ASH Scotland&rsquo;s tobacco and inequalities project. This may inform a baseline against which progress could be monitored towards achieving a reduction in smoking levels following the issuing of the guidance material.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Additional to the funding outlined above &pound;2 million per annum is contained in NHS board baselines from the smoking kills and health improvement fund.</p>

  <p>2. In addition a smoking cessation service was introduced as part of the community pharmacy contract at end August 2008. The following figures represent payments to community pharmacies providing a smoking cessation service.</p>

  <p>2008-09: September 2008 &ndash; March 2009</p>

  <p>(part year service began end of August 2008) = &pound;3,461,230*</p>

  <p>2009-10 = &pound;3,746,096</p>

  <p>2010-11 = two months fees for April and May 2010 = &pound;677,523. It is estimated that the costs for the full year will be similar to 2009-10.</p>

  <p>*The 2008-09 figure includes one-off readiness and administration payments to each pharmacy providing a smoking cessation service to cover set-up and training costs.</p>

  <p>Total revenue resource limit (RRL) figures are not available for 2010-11 as in-year board allocations have yet to be confirmed for all programmes. To maintain consistency with prior year figures, smoking cessation funding as a % of total RRL has not been calculated for 2010-11.</p>

  <p>All figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;1,000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is investing heavily in NHS stop smoking services, over &pound;40 million in this spending period, to enable NHS boards to provide high-quality and accessible services to all smokers across their areas.</p>

  <p>There is limited national Scottish evidence on differences in health risk behaviours for ethnic minority groups - the respective populations are quite small &ndash; for example, the Pakistani population being around 0.63% and the Bangladeshi population 0.04% of the Scottish population at the 2001 census. However, the Scottish Executive report <em>High Level Summary of Equality Statistics: Key Trends for Scotland 2006</em> noted that smoking prevalence was lower among minority ethnic groups, as a whole than among white ethnic groups, although percentages were based on small sample sizes.</p>

  <p>In addition, the <em>Dimensions of Diversity</em> report published by the Scottish Public Health Observatory in January 2010, notes that a series of studies in Glasgow has found that among members of ethnic minority groups, with the exception of Pakistani men, smoking rates are much lower than among the general population, with particularly low rates among ethnic minority women (4 to 5%). Other studies have shown a high prevalence of use of other tobacco products, particularly in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. The use of certain types of non-smoked and chewing tobacco may be more widespread than in the general population.</p>

  <p>There has been targeted support for minority ethnic communities through local tobacco alliances and national pilot smoking cessation projects under the Partnership Action on Tobacco and Health (PATH) initiative, which is funded by the Scottish Government. PATH, NHS Lothian and the Minority Health Inclusion Project have produced a DVD resource for discussing the use of various tobacco products with those in minority ethnic groups. The resource was presented to the Ministerial Working Group on Tobacco Control in May 2010 and a Scottish Government official has since met with the stakeholder organisations to explore how to maximise the impact of this resource.</p>

  <p>The <em>Guide to Smoking Cessation in Scotland 2010 &ndash; Planning and Providing specialist smoking cessation services</em>, published by NHS Health Scotland and ASH Scotland, includes guidance on how evidence-informed specialist stop smoking services should operate. This includes recommendations for working with target groups, including minority ethnic groups, and a recommendation to provide services in the language chosen by clients, wherever possible. The national telephone helpline smoke line has the Language Line translation facility available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is investing heavily in evidence-informed NHS stop smoking services, over &pound;40 million in the current spending review period, to enable NHS boards to deliver high quality, accessible services across their population. This includes substantial stop smoking support provided in the heart of communities, including the most deprived areas, via the smoking cessation element of the national public health service contract with community pharmacies, introduced in 2008.</p>

  <p>In 2009, 14,431 successful one month quits were recorded in the two most deprived &quot;within board&quot; Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles, equating to 54.5% of all successful quits recorded in NHS stop smoking services. The Scottish Government is considering how to build upon this as part of the work which is currently ongoing to review and update NHS Scotland HEAT targets.</p>

  <p>I have asked David Middleton, Chief Executive of Transport Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland follows the resourcing policies of the Scottish Government and posts in the agency are created and removed to reflect changing business needs. From 1 April 2010 stricter controls on replacing leavers were introduced centrally and these changes have been implemented in Transport Scotland. As a cost saving measure, all unfilled posts have been removed from our staffing profile.</p>
