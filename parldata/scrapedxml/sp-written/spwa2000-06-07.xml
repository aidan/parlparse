  <p>Discussions are underway with the Department of Social Security and the Office for National Statistics to investigate the use of nationwide surveys (such as the Family Expenditure Survey, the Family Resources Survey and the General Household Survey) to provide information which will allow us to produce analysis of income, benefits claimed and household types (e.g. single parents, number of children etc.) at unitary authority level for Scotland. Discussions with the Department of Social Security about the availability of statistical information from their systems for the administration of benefits (which is a reserved matter) are also continuing.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Household Survey will provide the average number of children per lone parent household in each local authority after the first full sweep of the survey (i.e. after two years). These results should be available by summer 2001. For the larger local authorities only, results will be available this summer.</p>

  <p>The introduction of National Tests has improved the quality of attainment information for parents on pupil performance and information on S2 targets in reading, writing and mathematics, and the progress made against them, is provided to parents each year by education authorities and schools.</p>

These will be considered together with the implementation of the recommendations in the report <i>Achieving Success in S1 &amp; S2,</i> which will ensure that all secondary teachers have sufficient time to assess individual pupils&#8217; progress.</p>

  <p>Monitoring of air quality in the context of industrial emissions is a matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, local authorities and the relevant industries; surveillance of the health of people in their areas is a matter in the first instance for health boards. Smoke emissions from flarestacks should be reduced to the least possible level consistent with the safe operation of the plant in order to minimise both their visual impact and any effect that they may have on ambient air quality.</p>

  <p>In this context, although there was a higher level of &quot;flaring&quot; around Mossmorran from June to August 1999, the overall level for the year has not increased due to the lower level of &quot;flaring&quot; in the last six months.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to develop a national strategy for osteoporosis. It is for local health boards to determine the services which are required to meet the needs of their local population within available resources. Guidance to help health boards devise their strategies was issued by the Health Department in 1997 in the form of a Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) report on osteoporosis. This gave the conclusions of a group of experts drawn from within the NHS on the current situation in Scotland, a review of recent research, and options for the prevention, detection and management of osteoporosis.</p>

  <p>Scottish Homes total planned capital expenditure within its development programme for 2000-01 is &pound;7 million higher than the equivalent figure for 1999-2000. This has allowed capital expenditure in the current year to be increased in both rural and urban areas. The same holds true for capital expenditure in Glasgow and North Clyde Region.

Our commitment to the community planning process will be further demonstrated by the establishment of our Community Planning Task Force and by the wider package of post-McIntosh measures which we are progressing.</p>

  <p>Openness, transparency and accountability are among the key criteria on which the Leadership Advisory Panel are assessing councils self-reviews of their policy development and decision-making processes. The panel and individual councils, working together, will ensure more open and accountable processes are developed across the country.</p>

  <p>I and Scottish ministerial colleagues had a constructive meeting with local authority leaders and chief executives on 26 May at which we discussed a shared vision for using information and communications technology to deliver more convenient and efficient public services in Scotland. It is for authorities themselves to decide how to make progress, but I am sure that councils understand that integrating people, processes and technology can make a major contribution to internal efficiency and to better services to the public.</p>

  <p>We sought further comment on this recommendation as part of our post-McIntosh consultation exercise and have considered the responses carefully. There was almost unanimous support for the granting of such a power from local authorities, CoSLA and the Local Government Committee of the Scottish Parliament. Having listened to the arguments put forward by these bodies we are convinced that such a power - which might be better described as a power of community initiative - will stimulate new ideas and innovation in local government and will encourage joint working between local authorities and other bodies. It will help to provide a platform from which to develop a community leadership role for modern Scottish local government.</p>

  <p>I am therefore pleased to confirm that the Executive will introduce a power of community initiative for Scottish local government in a future Local Government Bill in line with the McIntosh Report&#8217;s recommendation. Our detailed proposals will be issued for consultation in due course. The consultation will consider the exact scope of the power. It is not intended that it should cut across the duties or powers of other statutory bodies.</p>

  <p>Levies collected and the percentages allocated directly to Scotland in each of the last five years are given in the table below. The balance of income is channelled to MLC core activities, which include technical and development support at the headquarters in Milton Keynes and technical support through the Brussels Office from which Scottish producers benefit.</p>

  <p>The advent of QMS will ensure the continuation of existing funding arrangements to SQBLA and SPII, with money currently used to support the MLC&#8217;s Scottish Office being added to the total. Additionally there is scope for extra cash to be injected into QMS, including resources from the MLC&#8217;s main budget. Unlike its predecessors, QMS will also have a direct influence on Commission decisions affecting all levy monies raised in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The appointment of board members and the criteria used to select them is entirely a matter for the organisations represented on QMS. However, I have always believed that if QMS was to succeed it would need to appoint people of the highest calibre and, in my opinion, the appointment of Neil Kilpatrick as Chairman and other members of the board meets that requirement.</p>

  <p>In a recent study (Gilchrist and Hooke, 1997) conducted in Greenock prison 29% of prisoners reported that they were drinking over the safe limit for men as advised by the Inter-Departmental Working Group. In Cornton Vale Prison (Loucks, 1997) an estimated 10-15 % of women were found to be addicted to alcohol.</p>

  <p>Around three quarters of prisoners are estimated by the SPS to have been on illicit drugs just before entering prison. Various elements the SPS drugs strategy together succeeded in reducing this so that interim results for 1999-2000 show that only 15% tested positive for drug misuse within the prison setting.</p>

  <p>The extent and degree of mental illness or psychological disturbance is not known with any precision. Studies have ranged from 3% to 82% of the prison population.</p>

  <p>The monitoring of accidents on these routes is the responsibility of the local authority. However, accident information has been collected as part of the report <i>A comparative evaluation of Greenways and Conventional Bus Lanes</i> , which was published on 19 May.</p>

  <p>In general, and taking no account of relative traffic volumes, the Greenway appears safer than the conventional bus corridor, particularly in respect of pedestrians, cyclists and bus accidents.</p>

  <p>The potential impact on Hawick as a location for inward investment is not being addressed by the A6091/A7 Galashiels to Hawick Route Action Plan study. The purpose of this study is to examine the potential for improvement of the road by a programme of local improvement schemes to reduce accidents while improving the environment of the route.</p>

  <p>This issue would best be addressed in a specific report exploring all the economical issues surrounding a Selkirk bypass. However, as the preliminary assessment of a Selkirk bypass option indicates that any benefits accrued are outweighed by the high construction costs, there are currently no plans to carry out a more detailed study of the bypass option.</p>

  <p>The validity of the Assignation Statement relating to the Skye Bridge has been considered by the Appeal Court of the High Court of the Justiciary. It was submitted that the Assignation Statement was not valid because it was unsigned, undated and should have been issued when the Skye Bridge Crossing Toll Order was made on 23 June 1992. It was also submitted that the Assignation Statement and a copy of that Toll Order should then have been made available for inspection. That court, in its decision dated 16 December 1999, rejected these submissions.</p>

  <p>Midlothian Council were awarded &pound;802,000 additional capital consent from the second round of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Public Transport Fund towards the cost of a bridge to take cyclists and pedestrians across the Edinburgh City Bypass at Sheriffhall. The allocation of this additional capital consent, of which &pound;600,000 has been issued to the council, relates to financial year 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The original solum of the Waverley Line, proposed by consultants as the most appropriate location for its reinstatement to link with the existing track at Millerhill, meets the City Bypass approximately 500 metres from the preferred location for the pedestrian crossing.

  <p>In Estuarial Areas, there are currently two candidate special Areas of Conservation proposed as well as 11 classified and two proposed Special Protection Areas. It is also our policy that proposed sites should be protected as if already designated.</p>

  <p>I understand that West of Scotland Water proposes to build a storm overflow at Kilbarchan to alleviate a long-standing problem of flooding after heavy rain. The proposed scheme has been examined by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) which is confident that it will result in an improvement in the quality of the Kilbarchan Burn. SEPA has granted a consent for the discharge subject to a condition requiring the sewage to be screened to prevent raw sewage solids entering the stream.

  <p>The Executive does not hold the information requested. However, the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) has been asked to carry out a study to determine the extent to which lead solder has been used in plumbing installations in new housing across Scotland. SCIEH are due to report later this year.</p>

  <p>There is no lead contamination in the public water supply. Lead contamination occurs as a result of the use of lead for internal plumbing or for service pipes which connect properties to the water main in the street. The water authorities own the short length of service pipe from the main to the property boundary but property owners are responsible for the remainder of the service pipe and for all internal plumbing. The Executive has asked the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health to carry out a survey to establish the extent to which lead has been used, in contravention of the water bylaws, in the plumbing systems of new houses.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what is the percentage and number of households who rely on a public water-supply main of lead construction.</p>

  <p>There are no public water supply mains of lead construction. Historically, lead pipes were only used for internal plumbing or for service pipes connecting properties to the main in the street.</p>

  <p>The new Drinking Water Directive tightens the standard for lead in drinking water and requires that member states take all appropriate measures to reduce the concentration of lead in the water as a result of lead plumbing or service pipes. To achieve this goal the water authorities are about to carry out a lead sampling programme to help them identify properties that have lead plumbing and service pipes. The results of the sampling programme will enable the authorities to target areas that would benefit from measures to reduce the uptake of lead from pipework. Many areas already have such measures in place but it is likely that further areas will be identified. The results of the sampling programme will also provide a good estimate of the percentage and number of households with lead plumbing.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its estimate is of the number of households whose internal plumbing is (a) of lead construction and (b) of a construction which uses leaded solder joints, and whether it intends to undertake work to establish how many households are affected by this problem.</p>

  <p><i>Drinking Water Quality in Scotland 1994</i> reviewed the extent of lead pipes in domestic plumbing. The estimate then was that there were 589,000 properties in Scotland with lead plumbing. The results of a lead sampling programme about to be undertaken by the water authorities should provide a more up-to-date estimate of the number of households with lead plumbing.</p>

  <p>It is not known how many properties have internal plumbing with lead soldered joints but such joints were the normal form of construction until lead solder was banned from water fittings in 1987. The Executive has asked the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health to carry out a survey of new houses to determine the extent to which lead soldered joints have been used in new homes.</p>

  <p>The Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 1990 require water authorities to notify customers of lead failures associated with water samples taken from their premises and of the measures that could be taken to reduce the risk to health from lead.</p>

  <p>The new Drinking Water Directive tightens the standard for lead and it also requires the water authorities to notify both property owners and consumers of any lead failures. The water authorities are about to undertake a lead sampling programme to identify any problem areas within their water supply zones. Property owners and consumers will be advised of any failures detected during the sampling programme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what regulation and requirements it proposes to ensure that consumers are told of the possibility of high lead content in their water supply, and what powers will be made available to require that action is taken to remedy the situation.</a></p>

  <p>The Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 1990 require random samples to be taken from household dietetic taps within each water supply zone. Where lead is detected in a tap sample, in breach of the current regulatory requirement, the householder is notified and advised of the measures that they can take to reduce the risk to their health from lead.</p>

  <p>Despite the tighter lead standard in the new Drinking Water Directive, if non-compliance with the standard is due to domestic plumbing then a failure to meet the standard will not be considered to be a breach of the Directive. Consumers and property owners must be alerted to the risk but it is not practical to require them to replace their lead plumbing. This is not the case with public buildings such as schools, hospitals and restaurants. Public buildings must fully comply with the Directive. Any failure to meet the lead standard in a public building as a result of lead plumbing will require the plumbing system to be replaced.<br /></p>
