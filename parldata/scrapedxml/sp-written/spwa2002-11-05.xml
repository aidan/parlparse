  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what evidence it has of badger baiting teams operating in the south of Scotland; whether there has been any increase in badger baiting over the last 10 years and, if so, whether there is any evidence to suggest that the existing legislative powers are inadequate to tackle this issue; what plans it has to introduce new legislation on badger baiting and, in the meantime, whether it will issue guidance to police forces, procurators fiscal and any other agencies to ensure that all incidents of badger baiting are investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no evidence to suggest that badger baiting teams are operating in the south of Scotland, nor have they received information about any increases in this type of activity occurring in Scotland over the last 10 years.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are firmly committed to ensuring that Scotland's natural heritage - including badgers - is properly protected. The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 is widely regarded as an effective method of dealing with crimes against these animals. It allows the courts to impose a custodial sentence of up to six months or a fine of up to &#163;5,000. There are no plans to introduce changes in legislation to amend this act.</p>

  <p>The Chief Constables of Scotland's Police Forces are responsible for operational matters affecting their forces and determine how criminal investigations are conducted. The Crown Office already issues guidance to procurators fiscal on various statutory offences, including the legislation relevant to badgers.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the Post Office and Post Office services is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>A decision not to roll out Your Guide nationally was announced by DTI Ministers on 15<sup> </sup>October. The decision was taken largely on value for money grounds, following the evaluation of a major pilot.</p>

  <p>Officials will continue to stay in close contact with DTI and Post Office efforts to identify the potential for government departments to deliver services through post offices in future.</p>

  <p>The Executive's public internet access point initiative is creating over 1,000 new venues across Scotland where people can have cheap, easy access to the web and all its services - public, commercial and voluntary sector. We are actively encouraging rural post offices to participate in the scheme - which provides eligible venues with computer hardware, software, and internet connectivity - all free of charge. The scheme therefore allows rural post offices to provide another valuable service to their customers and potentially another source of income for small post offices.</p>

  <p>The above information covers 14- to 16-year-olds who entered any penal establishment, including Young Offenders Institutions. Information distinguishing young offenders who were in an adult prison from those in a Young Offenders Institution cannot meaningfully be supplied. This is because many young offenders will pass through an adult prison on their way to reception in a Young Offenders Institution or may be transferred to a Young Offenders Institution after reception in an adult prison. Table 5 presents a breakdown of the number of receptions of 14- to-16-year-olds by the receiving establishment while Table 6 shows a breakdown of the first establishment entered by 14- to 16-year-old offenders commencing a continuous period in custody. Copies of Table 5 and Table 6 have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24884 ).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, not the local authorities, is responsible for the provision and maintenance of signs on the trunk road network. However, it is the policy and practice of Scottish ministers that it is for local authorities to take a view on whether an alteration to a trunk road sign is required to reflect local needs. Such changes would then require to be submitted by the local authority to the Scottish Executive for approval.</p>

  <p>The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 requires local authorities to provide and publicise a range and level of services appropriate to the needs of children with disabilities in their area. Children with disabilities are entitled to an assessment of need and the local authority is required to provide a range of services to meet the identified needs of that group of children identified as being in need. It is the responsibility of the local authorities to determine how they manage their services to ensure they meet their statutory requirements. In addition, the Scottish Executive provides funding to a range of voluntary organisations delivering information and services to families with children with disabilities, including the Family Fund Trust, Capability Scotland, Contact a Family and SENSE Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive provided pump-priming funding for Visual Impairment Scotland through its three-year Innovation Fund grant scheme for developing innovative and integrated approaches to child health, on the basis that NHS boards would continue funding successfully evaluated projects at the end of the grant funding period. The Executive is encouraging further development of integrated children's services through implementation of the action team's recommendations in <i>For Scotland's Children</i> for which funding has been made available through the Changing Children's Services Fund, distributed through local authorities. Local authorities, NHS boards and the relevant voluntary sector representatives determine how this funding should be deployed.</p>

  <p>The Joint Future agenda is demonstrating how local partners in health, social work and housing can come together to jointly prioritise, resource and manage services. We expect that this new approach will have wider application in other partnership activities where such a holistic approach is needed.</p>
