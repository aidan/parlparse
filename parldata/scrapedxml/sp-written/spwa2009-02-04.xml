  <p>As part of our new relationship with local government, we are placing greater emphasis on ensuring positive outcomes for stakeholders, and less emphasis on inputs and processes.</p>

  <p>To support this, we are working with local partnerships to develop and implement performance management arrangements that focus on outcomes for service users and carers, including young carers, and which enable local partnerships to measure and manage their performance effectively. We continue to work closely with Carers Organisations in developing the outcomes approach.</p>

  <p>The focus of the young carers section of the revised Carers Strategy will be on ensuring positive outcomes for young carers, through better identification and improved support in both young carer specific services and mainstream children&rsquo;s services.</p>

  <p>We have provided funding to the Princess Royal Trust for Carers to conduct a mapping exercise into young carers services across Scotland. This work will highlight good practice in supporting young carers, as well as identifying gaps in provision. The results of this study will inform the development of the young carers section of the Carers Strategy.</p>

  <p>Officials have been in touch with Orkney Islands Council to clarify the position.</p>

  <p>Orkney has made clear that there is no intention to withdraw existing direct payments. The waiting list for direct payments is regularly reviewed and applications are actioned as additional resources become available. In the interim, clients on the waiting list are offered social care services.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government statistics make clear that Orkney currently has the highest rate of clients per 10,000 population receiving direct payments. The council is actively looking at the existing position, the current financial pressures, and projected additional financial demands to resolve this situation. <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/10/27092036/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/10/27092036/0</a>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-19457 by Frank Mulholland on 20 January 2008, how many direct measures have been issued by procurators fiscal in relation to alleged offences under section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 since April 2008, broken down by (a) type of drug, (b) class of drug and (c) sheriff court district.</p>

  <p>The information requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>While the use of direct measures for possession of Class A drugs in very exceptional circumstances cannot be discounted, the clear policy is that they should only be issued for possession of small quantities of Class B and Class C drugs such as cannabis.</p>

  <p>Guidance to procurators fiscal makes it clear that possession of a Class A drug is not appropriate for a Direct Measure and should be prosecuted in the sheriff court.</p>

  <p>All data collected from a national entitlement card (NEC) application is collected in accordance with the Data Protection Act, 1998. Applicants are made aware of their rights under the act via the application form and a separate terms and conditions leaflet. In addition, applicants are asked whether or not they grant consent for their information to be shared with other public sector organisations. Individuals can also change this consent.</p>

  <p>Applicants for a NEC provide their local council with personal details including their name and address, date of birth, telephone number, gender etc. This information is necessary to validate and verify an applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to services and establish a card holder citizen account, which is used to administer the NEC scheme i.e. information which allows the council to issue/re-issue a card.</p>

  <p>Each local authority has access to the records of their own residents only and is the data controller of this information. Council employees need a &quot;digital certificate&quot; (the means of allowing secure and private communications between authenticated parties) in order to access the system and all activities on the system are audited and logged (including any unauthorized attempts to access the system). Any transaction data in relation to individual services continues to be held separately by local authorities, i.e. it is not stored on the central card management system.</p>

  <p>Plans are also in place for individual card holders to have their own secure user login and password in order to see the data that is held about them and to be able to change the data, e.g. to notify a change of circumstances such as change of address.</p>

  <p>Veterinary advice and the analysis by Scottish Government&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence in Epidemiology is that a mass vaccination campaign against bluetongue virus 8 would be in Scotland best interests.

  <p>We will consider any proposals from local authorities which make use of tax increment financing so long as these make financial sense. The City of Edinburgh Council is currently exploring the use of tax increment financing with the Scottish Futures Trust.</p>

  <p>In parallel, we are exploring in conjunction with COSLA as part of a joint review of the local government distribution formula, whether it may be possible to incentivise councils to grow their business rate by retaining any additional business rate income that they raise. One option being considered is tax increment financing. This review is due to be completed by end October 2009 and will inform the local government settlement for 2011-12, following the next spending review.</p>

  <p>Spend on mental health services will continue to be drawn from the record funds allocated to NHS boards and local government overall. It is the responsibility of these agencies to work in partnership and to allocate funds from the total resources available to them on the basis of local needs, priorities and agreed targets including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and commitments, which includes priority attention to mental health.</p>

  <p>In addition, &pound;5 million also allocated in 2008-09 to NHS boards for partnership spend to support implementation of the Mental Health Act, and delivery of the HEAT targets for mental health in Scotland. Similar allocations will be made next year and in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>I am grateful to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland (HMICS) for the Independent Review of Policing in Scotland report. The issues it raises are challenging and complex. The Scottish Government will work closely with key partners and stakeholders to consider thoroughly the challenges identified before formulating a way forward. I expect to be in a position to respond to the issues raised in the report by early summer.</p>

  <p>The Purpose of the Scottish Government is to increase sustainable economic growth across the whole of Scotland. To achieve this, we need to support local areas and businesses to regenerate and grow our town centres.</p>

  <p>That is why the government signalled its intention to introduce a new &pound;60 million Town Centre Regeneration Fund as part of the budget package for 2009-10.</p>

  <p>We will also be launching on 12 February a new Town Centres and Local High Streets Learning network which will act as a source of learning, advice and long-term support for practitioners.</p>

  <p>Over the two years 2006-08, we provided &pound;1.1 million in support for the BID pilot programme, and we are continuing to provide seedcorn funding grants and practical support on the ground for local partners seeking to establish a BID. This will help create more vibrant and viable town and city centres.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are removing or reducing business rates through the Small Business Bonus Scheme as part of our drive to create an environment in which small businesses - many of them in our town centres - can flourish, underpinned by a fair taxation system. By cutting overheads and enabling them to invest more, the scheme is helping to sustain tens of thousands of small businesses across the country.</p>

  <p>The content of reports laid before the Scottish Parliament are a matter for the bodies laying those reports and any issues arising there from should be taken up with the authors. The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman periodically gives evidence to parliamentary committees, particularly the Local Government and Communities Committee which hears evidence on her annual report each year. This provides opportunities for members to raise issues with the ombudsman in a parliamentary setting.</p>
