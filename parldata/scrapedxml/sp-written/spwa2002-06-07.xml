  <p>In recognition of the importance of supporting carers we have made &#163;10 million a year available to local authorities under the <i>Strategy for Carers in Scotland</i> . This is double the resources previously available. These resources are being used to support carers in a variety of ways and can be used for the training of carers in functions related to their supporting role.</p>

  <p>The Executive allocated &#163;22.6 million to implement the recommendations of the Beattie Committee which examined the needs of young people who require additional support to make the transition to post-school education and training or employment. &#163;4.5 million of this funding was committed to improving support for students in further education.</p>

  <p>Further education institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for the provision of appropriate learning opportunities for students with special needs. Students with autism or Asperger&#146;s syndrome may be enrolled on either mainstream courses or special programmes in further education colleges and colleges can claim additional funding in respect of these students.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is conscious that the greatest contribution to the reduction of risk, and best intervention, is the earliest possible detection of a disorder, with continuing effective co-ordinated interventions by all relevant agencies.</p>

  <p>With this in mind we have commissioned the Public Health Institute for Scotland to conduct a review of child and adolescent mental health provision. This report, which will be available later this year, and the <i>Autistic Spectrum Disorders Needs Assessment Report</i> published in February, will better inform planning and provision decisions in this area of care.</p>

  <p>Each person has their needs assessed prior to discharge. The single shared assessment process, which will be in place for all care groups by April 2003, enhances the joint approach to providing support in the community, with appropriate health and/or social care put in place to meet individual needs and provided by members of the relevant Primary Health Care Team or local authority social work department.</p>

  <p>A key recommendation of the Joint Future Group was that joint discharge/rapid response teams should be put in place in each local authority area. These teams consist of both health and social care professionals and enhance the care available to those discharged from hospital.</p>

  <p>No specific recommendations are made in the published guidance. The aim is to provide agencies with a workable planning and audit tool to use in assessing the level and type of provision appropriate for their area.</p>

  <p>Each of the professions listed will have varying degrees of contact with those who suffer from anorexia nervosa and therefore varying needs in the area of specialist training.</p>

  <p><u>General Practitioners (GPs)</u></p>

  <p>GPs are encouraged to look at their own personal learning needs (based on the principles of adult learning) and the needs of their patients. Each GP receives an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed amount of training in areas approved by the Deaneries. In the future, the appraisal process will assist GPs to identify their learning needs with the help of trained appraisers.</p>

  <p><u>Community Nurses</u></p>

  <p>There is no discrete specialist training in this area for community nursing. The specialist practitioner programmes for community nursing (community psychiatric nursing, public health nursing and district nursing) touch on the subject and students sometimes use the subject for a project and thereby study it in more depth, but this is at their own discretion. Nurses working in this highly specialised area would attend ad hoc specialist short courses, study days, modules etc, at their own or their trust&#146;s discretion.</p>

  <p><u>Teachers</u></p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities to ensure that a wide range of continuing professional development opportunities is available for qualified teachers. Training aimed at equipping teachers to deal with issues relating to anorexia nervosa could be recognised as one such appropriate opportunity.</p>

  <p><u>Social Workers</u></p>

  <p>There are no set requirements for the inclusion of specific training in relation to anorexia nervosa as part of the Diploma in Social Work. Most courses, however, will have specific input on mental illness, and in many cases eating disorders will be covered to some degree. Practising social workers, especially those in adult community care teams and those working in psychiatric hospitals or community mental health teams, will be involved in working with persons with anorexia nervosa as part of a multi-disciplinary team. Specialist information and training will be available to those working in such settings.</p>

  <p>Social workers who have been practising for two years and have relevant experience are eligible for additional specialist training as Mental Health Officers to carry out specific functions under the Mental Health Act. This entails additional training of at least 60 days and will have a taught component of between three and four weeks. As part of the latter there will invariably be input in respect of anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, especially as they may present complex ethical and legal issues in respect of treatment.</p>

  <p><u>Psychiatrists</u></p>

  <p>As part of the theoretical training involved in the three years&#146; experience required of junior psychiatrists before they sit the Membership of the Royal College of Psychiatrists examination, there will be extensive didactic teaching in eating disorders. In addition, especially in the area of general psychiatry, junior psychiatrists will have the opportunity to see, assess, and treat patients with eating disorders, under consultant supervision. This clinical experience will be expanded in the three years that general psychiatrists spend as Specialist Registrars (SpRs).</p>

  <p>Alongside this, SpRs will have the opportunity to develop a special interest in eating disorders &#150; there is protected time in the SpR contract to allow such a special interest &#150; and SpRs also have the opportunity to acquire skills in particular psychological interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy. About 50% of SpRs are involved in some form of psychological intervention training.</p>

  <p>The training in the specific area of anorexia nervosa can be accessed through postgraduate deaneries as part of NHS Education for Scotland, The Royal Colleges of Psychiatry and General Practitioners and other providers such as voluntary agencies.</p>

  <p>A template for eating disorders was widely distributed to all board areas in October 2001. It offered a service profile/specification for the organisation of co-ordinated services and support for those with, surviving or developing an eating disorder (NHS HDL (2001) 75).</p>

  <p>A number of statutory mechanisms are in place to protect peatlands in Scotland. Raised bog and blanket bog habitats are both protected under the EU Habitats Directive through the designation of sites as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). There are 27 proposed and candidate raised bog SACs in Scotland, and together these support some 68% of Scotland&#146;s &quot;active&quot; raised bog, and some 32% of the area of raised bog which has been assessed as degraded but capable of restoration. There are also 45 blanket bog candidate SACs covering a total area of over quarter of a million hectares.</p>

  <p>In addition, a further 42 raised bogs and around 100 sites with blanket bog interests are afforded domestic UK protection through designation as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Bogs outwith the statutory nature conservation designation are subject to the safeguards provided through the planning system when being considered for new peat extraction applications. Those bogs which are subject to existing planning consent are protected through the on-going Review of Mineral Permissions (ROMPs) process.</p>

  <p>The UK Biodiversity Action Plan identifies both raised and blanket bog as priority habitats, and a number of initiatives are under way to achieve targets that have been set out in this plan. Both raised bog and blanket bog have specific habitat action plans developed to deal with issues affecting these sites.</p>

  <p>There is no commercial peat extraction from any of Scotland&#146;s national or internationally protected peatland sites.</p>

  <p>Scotland supports substantial areas of both raised bogs and blanket bogs, with an estimated total resource of 27,884 ha and 1,060,000 ha respectively. Peat extraction occurs from both habitat types.</p>

  <p>The proportion of peatland currently subject to planning permission for commercial peat extraction is calculated as 4% of raised bog and 0.002% of blanket bog habitat; overall this equates to 0.3% of the total Scottish peatland resource.</p>

  <p>There is no commercial peat extraction from any of Scotland&#146;s national or internationally protected sites.</p>

  <p>The UK Lowland Raised Bog and Blanket Bog Habitat Action Plans encourage the use and production of alternatives to peat, and the Scottish Executive is jointly responsible for the objectives of the plans, in partnership with other agencies. The action plans aim to:</p>

  <p>1. Review and where necessary amend or develop policies on the consumption of peat by 2002, with the aim of achieving a reduction in peat consumption in all sectors and for all purposes. A minimum of 40% of total market requirements to be based on non-peat materials by 2005.</p>

  <p>2. Encourage and provide advice on the development and marketing of peat alternatives to reduce amateur and professional demand for peat-based horticultural products, to achieve the long-term safeguard of peatlands. It is recognised that approximately 75% of extracted peat is used by amateur gardeners in the UK, and one of the key themes of the Scottish Biodiversity Forum is addressing this audience through the Garden for Life initiative. Useable alternatives to peat based garden composts are now easily available.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive provided an additional &#163;3 million to local authorities in 2001 to enable them to increase recycling and composting. A further &#163;50.4 million is also now available for local authorities to begin implementing area waste plans, and this should enable a significant increase in the production of compost in Scotland. The Scottish Executive supports two market development programmes (ReMaDe and WRAP) which aim to promote the use of recycled products, including compost.</p>

  <p>Work already undertaken suggests that a mortgage to rent scheme could have a number of benefits which would justify the cost of operating the scheme. A successful application under the scheme will avoid the possession by the lender of the applicant&#146;s home, and this will in many cases reduce the financial burden experienced by the lender in taking possession of the property. It will also avoid costs to the public purse, such as court costs and legal aid costs when the lender seeks an order for possession and the cost to the local authority of dealing with a homelessness application, an application to be re-housed and the possible need to transfer any children to a new school. It would also avoid the indirect costs of providing further replacement accommodation in the social rented sector.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of people currently assisted by mortgage rescue schemes run by other agencies is not known. It is too early to say how many people might be helped under the Executive-sponsored mortgage to rent scheme since this will depend on the number of applications and the precise details of each case. We will, however, be seeking to ensure that the scheme, when it becomes operational, assists as many people as possible within the limits of the available funding.</p>

  <p>No, the Executive has no plans to do so since the current arrangements are satisfactory and comply with the <i>Commissioner for Public Appointments&#146; Code of Practice</i> .</p>

  <p>A standard question on political activity, as set out in the<i> Commissioner for Public Appointments&#146; Code</i>, is asked of all applicants for appointments to public bodies. The question only asks for information which is already in the public domain and does not ask for private or personal information such as membership of a political party or voting preferences.</p>

  <p>Our action programme to reduce youth crime, launched on 28 January, identifies the measures we will take this year to build a safer Scotland and reduce youth offending. All authorities have received funding to support multi-agency youth crime teams and to put in place effective programmes which will reduce youth crime. South Lanarkshire has received &#163;552,000 in the last two years and will receive &#163;552,000 next year. The Executive is completing a mapping exercise of all local authorities to measure their progress with developing these services and programmes. The results will be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre when available.</p>
