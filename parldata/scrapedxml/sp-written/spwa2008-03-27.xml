  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has attempted to assess the total value of single farm payment reductions suffered by farmers and crofters as a result of having reduced livestock numbers on their land during all, or part of, the 2000 to 2002 reference period to comply with the terms of their land management agreements with Scottish Natural Heritage.</p>

  <p>No such assessment has been undertaken, nor would such an assessment be meaningful in terms of the Single Farm Payment Scheme (SFPS). Those farmers and crofters who participate in the scheme and also participated in management agreements run by SNH during the period 2000 to 2002, had their entitlement to support calculated in the same way as other farmers and crofters. In essence, Scottish ministers were only allowed to include in these calculations production units (animals or areas) that met all relevant scheme conditions during the reference period. There was no discretion within the scheme to address cases that were founded on hypothetical or notional levels of production i.e. Scottish ministers could not recognise claims where a producer had an expectation of support based on what has been called &quot;ghost&quot; animals. This was the situation throughout the UK. I can appreciate that producers in this situation have a perception of injustice but the reality is that as far as SFPS is concerned, they are being treated in exactly the same way as other producers in terms of the way their entitlements have been calculated.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament has shown itself willing to tackle the &quot;booze and blade culture&quot;. We will send out a clear message to those who think it is acceptable or cool to carry a knife that it's not.</p>

  <p>Educating our young people, giving them more to do, and preventing them carrying a weapon are fundamental if we want to see reduced levels of knife crime. But we will not be soft. Tough enforcement by our police forces will continue to be a key part of our efforts.</p>

  <p>We are not closed to considering further legislative action, but believe judges are best placed to make decisions about the most appropriate sentence, taking into account in such cases all the factors they think are relevant.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have set Registers of Scotland the financial goal of achieving a return of 10% on net capital employed over the three-year period ending 31 March 2009.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland will shortly publish Registers of Scotland&rsquo;s (RoS) 2008-13 Corporate Plan, which sets objectives to secure continuing performance improvements. In particular, as milestones for 2008-09, the keeper has set the following goals for the conduct of registrations and for customer service, which ministers endorse:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>to reduce the standard production cost index by 1% for the three years ending 31 March 2009 compared with the three-year performance to 31 March 2008;</p>
<p>where it is in the Keeper&rsquo;s power and is legally appropriate, to complete the recording and registration of:</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>80% of Sasine writs within 20 working days; with the remainder to be completed within 40 working days;</p>

  <p>60% of Dealings with Whole within 30 working days; with the remainder to be completed within 100 working days, and</p>

  <p>70% of standard First Registration applications within 70 working days:</p>

  <p>as milestones in a three-year strategy to deal with older, complex casework, where it is in the Keeper&rsquo;s power to do so and is legally appropriate, to:</p>

  <p>complete registration of 25,000 Transfers of Part cases, along with their consequential Dealings with Whole, and</p>

  <p>eliminate all pre-January 2006 First Registration casework.</p>

  <p>to achieve a registration accuracy rate of at least 98.5% for applications despatched during the previous 12 months;</p>

  <p>to continue to operate at Charter Mark standards by:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>achieving a 98% rating for overall customer care in the annual customer satisfaction survey, and</p>
<p>processing 98% of all customer enquiries in compliance with RoS&rsquo;s published response standards.</p>

  <p>The cost estimate for the scheme is &pound;295 million to &pound;395 million, with a benefit to cost ratio of approximately 5:1. This is based on the risks currently identified but we will continue to monitor this in light of prevailing tender prices for roads contracts.</p>
