  <p>Scottish Government spend for alcohol misuse in the last three years was as follows:</p>

  <p>2006-07 - &pound;12.07 million</p>

  <p>2007-08 - &pound;12.4 million</p>

  <p>2008-09 - &pound;28.9 million</p>

  <p>The majority of funding from the Scottish Government is directed via NHS boards for provision of alcohol treatment and support services. Decisions on spend are made locally by Alcohol and Drugs Partnerships. The following table provides funding allocations for treatment and support services, made over the last three years to NHS boards.</p>

  <p>Direct payments from local authority budgets usually form the main component of an individual&rsquo;s complete self-directed support package. Self-directed support encompasses direct payments as well as the other funding streams that an individual may be eligible for, such as disability living allowance or the independent living fund.</p>

  <p>The draft guidance has been jointly agreed by the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (CoSLA). Local authorities will be asked to confirm by 1 December 2009 that their local arrangements for access to social care services and timescales for access to personal and nursing care services are compatible with the national definitions and standards set out in the finalised guidance. Joint arrangements will be established for the ongoing monitoring of the operation of the eligibility criteria, and waiting times, as monitoring information becomes available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to work in partnership with CoSLA to ensure a transparent and consistent approach across Scotland for older people to access appropriate services.</p>

  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) publishes each year life expectancy figures for local authority areas. These figures are based on data for a period of three consecutive years to provide large enough numbers to ensure accuracy. The most recent publication is for 2005-07. Figures for 2006-08 are due to be published in September.</p>

  <p>Life expectancy at birth for each local authority area is given in tables 1, 2 and 3, for all persons, males and females respectively, together with the ranking of each local authority area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government issues regular guidance to local authorities in Scotland to ensure Councils adopt a broad consistency of practice and a minimum standard of content for the production of financial information for general use. However, local authorities have discretion, within the guidance, as to the format in which this information is published and there is no set requirement for local authorities to publish information in real-terms.</p>
