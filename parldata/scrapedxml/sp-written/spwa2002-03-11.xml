  <p>The statutory framework is set mainly by the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1990 and Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, but these do not confer specific powers on ministers, relating to the provision of toilet facilities for disabled people at sports stadiums.</p>

  <p>Part III of the 1995 act was introduced to improve access for disabled people to goods, services and facilities. From October 2004, service providers to the public will have to make reasonable adjustments to the physical features of their premises, to overcome physical barriers to access, if access is impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people. The <i>Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds</i>, the fourth edition of which was published by the then Scottish Office and the then Department of National Heritage in 1997, contains a chapter on spectator accommodation for people with disabilities. That chapter refers to the 1995 Act and relevant Building Regulations and the requirement on managers to comply with them. The Disability Rights Commission is the body through which people&#8217;s complaints of non-compliance with the 1995 act can be addressed.</p>

  <p>The rules for the installation of a central heating system under the Central Heating Installation Programme, are the same throughout Scotland. Landlords in the social rented sector apply similar arrangements. A central heating system is installed to provide heat to the main living areas of the dwelling, such as the living room, the hall, the bathroom and the main bedroom or bedrooms, depending on the size of the household. If a householder lives in a larger property and wishes to extend the system to other parts of the house, they can pay to have the additional work carried out, subject to the agreement of Eaga Partnership and the installer.</p>

  <p>To date, the Scottish Executive has not provided direct or explicit encouragement or assistance to small towns wishing to establish a development trust. However, initiatives such as Working for Communities have focused on exploring new ways to organise and deliver services.

  <p>Communities Scotland has a remit to improve the delivery of community regeneration and promote community empowerment, and part of this will be developing and testing new ways to deliver regeneration and ways to increase community participation in, and ownership of the regeneration process.

  <p>We expect NHS boards to implement the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network guideline on the management of diabetes, which includes an emphasis on the fundamental importance of healthy eating as part of diabetes health care behaviour.</p>

  <p>Much of type 2 diabetes, which accounts for about 85% of the prevalence of the condition, is a consequence of overweight and obesity. If overweight people lose weight, they reduce their risk of developing diabetes. Our Scottish Diet Action Plan, <i>Eating for Health</i>, promotes the provision of healthy food choices and health education in order to encourage individuals to choose a balanced diet. Physical exercise is also important.</p>

  <p>Local authorities do not receive from the Executive an earmarked allocation for dealing with drug misuse. In February 2001, however, the Executive sent out information to drug action teams (DATs) and other local agencies detailing how the &#163;100 million package of new expenditure on tackling drug misuse would be distributed over the three years from 2001-02. Incorporated in the information pack was a breakdown, by DAT area, of the distribution of the new resources over the three year period, including details of allocations to local authorities. The complete package is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and on the <i>Drug Misuse in Scotland</i> website <a href="http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</a> .</p>

  <p>In the current financial year, the Executive earmarked an additional &#163;6.8 million within local authorities' Grant Aided Expenditure line for the rehabilitation of drug misusers. We also made available to local authorities in 2001-02 additional resources of &#163;4 million for drug projects under the Changing Children's Services Fund and &#163;2.5 million for diversion from prosecution/community disposal schemes.</p>

  <p>DATs are being asked to account for the spend of these additional resources and other direct spend on tackling drug misuse as part of their annual corporate planning arrangements. Information on expenditure is not yet available for 2001-02.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-11.32.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80258" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0311.htm#17">

  <p>The question is based on a false premise. The Low Frequency Noise Report, undertaken by Casella Stanger for the Scottish Executive in partnership with DEFRA and the other Devolved Administrations, neither addresses nor confirms the existence of the so-called &quot;Largs Hum&quot;. Rather, it sets out general guidance for those dealing with and investigating complaints about low frequency noise.</p>

  <p>The use of the term &quot;Largs Hum&quot; implies that the issue is one of general concern to residents of Largs, however, North Ayrshire Council is aware of only three cases from Largs&#8217; residents about low frequency noise in the last two years. In one case, the complainant advised the council the noise had stopped, in another a potential acoustic source was identified. In the one other case &#8211; behind the present interest in the &quot;Largs Hum&quot; - despite extensive investigations, there has not been clear instrumental evidence showing the existence of a problem. As the answers to previous questions (S1W-12675 on 5 February 2001, 13098 on 9 March 2001 and 14341 on 9 April 2001) on this matter have made clear, the Executive is satisfied that North Ayrshire Council has acted fully and correctly in this matter. North Ayrshire Council officials involved in the case have indicated that they have read, and welcome, the procedures suggested in the Low Frequency Noise Report. They have also stated that they believe their actions met and exceeded the recommendations made therein. In addition, after having made wide-ranging enquiries of various expert bodies, the Executive is satisfied that, insofar as a judgement can be made, there is no identifiable acoustic source in this case.</p>

  <p>In the absence of any significant corroboration and after making enquiries of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Glasgow Caledonian University, Scottish Power and The Royal Navy and in the light of the proper actions of North Ayrshire Council, the Executive considers it inappropriate to fund the further full independent inquiry sought.</p>

  <p>European regulations do not create criminal offences. There are therefore no changes to EU fisheries regulations of the kind suggested in the question.</p>

  <p>Associated criminal offences are set out in domestic UK and Scottish legislation. There are essentially three sources of criminal offences in fisheries: section 30 of the Fisheries Act 1981; breaching a licence condition, and via Statutory Instrument.</p>

  <p>The new EU technical conservation regulation under the cod recovery plan was published on 19 October 2001. On 19 November, the Executive sent a draft guidance note to the Scottish Fishermen&#8217;s Federation (SFF) for comments. On 21 November, the SFF offered comments by telephone. The Executive then issued the guidance to all fishing vessel licence holders in Scotland on 23 November 2001.</p>

  <p>No disagreements of a substantive nature were highlighted at this time by fishing industry representatives.</p>

  <p>Parliament was made aware of the position in the Scottish Ministers' Annual Report, <i>Further Education in Scotland 1999</i> , which was laid before Parliament on 25 October 2000.</p>

  <p>The report contained the following footnote:</p>

  <p>Student Programme Achievement Ratio, Student Achievement Ratio by Unit of Learning and Post Course Success Ratio.</p>

  <p>Performance Indicators have not been included in the 1999 Further Education Annual Report as the data used is not adequately robust. The Scottish Further Education Funding Council is currently reviewing performance indicators which will assist future decisions of the council and inform ministers.</p>

  <p>As <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> acknowledged, people who live and cope with chronic disease or long-term disability acquire a great deal of expertise and insight about their condition. Innovative Scottish programmes, such as <i>Allies in Change</i> and <i>Partners in Policymaking,</i> have shown that the expertise of patients can be put at the heart of service redesign. When these &quot;expert patients&quot; and health care professionals come together to plan and develop services, strong partnerships are created which lead to positive change in service culture and practice. Change that can only come about because of the depth of understanding which patients and users of services bring to the process.</p>

  <p>We are building on the approach successfully demonstrated by these programmes by requiring every NHS board to set up at least one <i>Partners in Change</i> programme by April 2002. People with long-term health conditions are now involved in preparatory work on over 80 local <i>Partners in Change</i> programmes. Among these local schemes are some where people teach others with that condition how to manage it, in others patients provide training for staff on the benefits of self-management, or work with staff to plan a redesigned service. This work is confirming that people want support and recognition for the key role of those who support them, often their own family, or neighbours, helped by their GP practice. It is supporting the NHS adopt a &quot;whole person&quot; approach that supports the people it serves across the span of their needs.</p>

  <p>There are also well organised, well-informed support groups for most chronic conditions. These groups possess a powerful and valuable insight into the spectrum of needs of people with enduring health problems. We are taking steps to ensure that these support groups are closely involved in service redesign and delivery at both a local and national level.</p>

  <p><i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i>, published in December of last year, reported on how this, and other work identified in the <i>Involving People</i> section of <i>Our National Health,</i> will be developed over the coming three years. Harnessing the expertise of patients is key to creating a patient-focussed NHS that exists <strong>for</strong> the patient and is designed to meet the needs and wishes of the individual receiving care and treatment.</p>

  <p>Good medical and psychiatric practice for patients with a diagnosis of mental disorder or learning disability involves multi-disciplinary reviews of people in community care, or in-patient facilities, including the presenting problems, diagnosis, behaviour and care.

  <p>The Clinical Standards Board&#8217;s Standards for Schizophrenia include a statement that patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia should have access to assessment by a specialist in substance misuse. Over the past year, Primary Care NHS Trusts have been auditing themselves to see to what extent they comply with this standard, and a report is expected soon from the board on the findings from its external accreditation of trusts.</p>

  <p>Information is not held centrally in the form requested. Individual NHS boards and trusts are responsible for deciding what resources are necessary for effective infection control, and for identifying these resources within the increased allocations made available to all NHS boards this year. All boards and trusts are clear that infection control is an extremely important goal for the NHS, and that their performance against the recently-agreed infection control standards developed by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland will be reported publicly by the end of 2002.</p>

  <p>In addition to expenditure by NHS trusts, the Department has, in 2001-02, allocated additional funding of &#163;0.2 million for infection control nurse training and &#163;0.5 million to support the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health in implementing the national surveillance framework for Healthcare Associated Infection.</p>

  <p>Information about deaths resulting from healthcare associated infection (HAI) is not available. HAI is not a notifiable cause of death.</p>

  <p>There are considerable clinical uncertainties about the degree to which a HAI may contribute to death. In addition, there can be uncertainties about the source of infections which cause or contribute to death. The Scottish Executive and NHSScotland are committed to reducing the incidence of HAI.

  <p>The aim of the Accounts Commission report <i>Full House - Theatre Utilisation in Scottish Hospitals</i> , which was published in June 1999, was to help hospitals to improve the use of planned theatre sessions, to identify ways to minimise session and case cancellations, to make full and best use of theatre resources and to use management information in an effective way. The report made a number of recommendations for actions to assist in this regard. These recommendations were, in the main, detailed operational matters for NHS trusts.</p>

  <p>In compiling their Local Health Plans, NHS boards, in conjunction with NHS trusts, will assess the capacity needed to meet national and local health targets. This work will include an examination of theatre requirements and utilisation. In addition, the National Waiting Times Unit is currently working with NHS trusts, to develop and share best practice to help ensure better and more effective use of existing capacity, including theatre capacity, in NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Under present extradition arrangements with European member states, the 110-day rule does not apply to a fugitive committed to custody in Scotland pending a decision as to their extradition but it applies to fugitives extradited to Scotland once they have been fully committed. The position will be the same under the proposed European Arrest Warrant arrangements.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant is to introduce simplified arrangements for the surrender of a fugitive from one member state to another.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-11.79.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0311.htm#34">

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S1W-23021 today, which confirmed that we are adopting a policy of rationalisation and compatibility of computer systems throughout NHSScotland. Rationalisation of systems and resources is necessary to achieve cost effectiveness, best use of available resources and to enable patient information to be shared with appropriate consent and under agreed protocols between NHS organisations across a board area and across Scotland. This approach is reflected in the updated National IM&amp;T Strategy available on <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/">www.show.scot.nhs.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>An important element of the infrastructure required to provide the right information at the right time in the right place across the whole of Scotland is a robust telecommunications network with the capacity to cope with the millions of clinical messages exchanged each year and increasingly with the sharing of images including real time images such as are used in telemedicine. For those reasons NHSScotland are active partners in the Scottish Executive Broadband initiative in which the Highlands and Islands as well as the South of Scotland are designated as pathfinder areas.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The figures for administration staff include administration and clerical staff, senior management and senior nurse managers, and cover all staff employed by health board areas.</p>

  <p>2. The figures for average available staffed beds are based on the average daily beds available for the reception of in-patients.</p>

  <p>The number of administration staff rose between 1991-92 and 1995-96. Since then the number has fallen from 18,016 to 17,017, a reduction of 5.5%. The reduction in staffed beds throughout this period reflects a number of factors including the transfer of patients from hospital to community care, increased use of day surgery, and shorter lengths of stay.</p>

  <p>The increase in the ratio of administration staff to staffed beds in the NHS does not take into account the major expansion that has taken place over this period in the provision of care and treatment for patients in the community, and in hospital settings that do not require the use of inpatient beds.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter falling within the responsibility of the Chief Constable of Strathclyde. However, I am advised that the need to deploy a total of 880 police officers in connection with this demonstration inevitably diverted the officers concerned from other duties as well as incurring significant additional costs in extra duty and other payments. Strathclyde Police dealt with these pressures without making demands on other forces.</p>

  <p>This figure is the Strategic Rail Authority's best estimate of the commitments needed to deliver the short and medium term priorities for growth and improvement set out in <i>The Strategic Plan</i> . The proportion of that figure that will be required for the Scottish network depends both on the contents of our directions and guidance for the Scottish passenger rail franchise and on the subsequent commercial negotiations that the SRA will conduct on the Executive's behalf.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents. The returns do not provide information about the causes of the accidents.</p>

  <p>Accidents for which adverse or winter weather conditions were reported as an attributable factor are not identified as such in the STATS 19 returns. The returns do, however, include information about the weather and the road surface condition at the time of the accident.</p>

  <p>The following table 1 lists the number of injury road accidents by month and police force from May 1997 to October 2001, the latest month for which information for each force area is held centrally.</p>

  <p>The following table 2 lists the number of these injury road accidents which occurred in what might be regarded as adverse or winter weather conditions. The following types of accidents were counted for the purpose of producing the figures in this table - those for which either (a) the weather was recorded as one of the following: snowing; fine with high winds; raining with high winds; fog or mist (if hazard); or other adverse weather conditions; or (b) the road surface condition was recorded as one of the following: snow; frost/ice; or flood (surface water over 3 cm deep).</p>

  <p>In the tables all figures for 2001 are provisional.</p>

  <p>Information on road accidents which lead to a report to Procurators Fiscal is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Further to the answer to questions S1W-22360 and S1W-22361 on 8 February 2002, the difference in figures showing the allocations made is because the response to question S1W-22360 details the anticipated spend in one financial year while the response to question S1W-22361 sets out the allocation of funds over five financial years in respect of the applications of those who have been offered an agreement to join the scheme.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide a definitive statement of what will be spent this year because not all businesses to which an agreement has been offered have yet accepted, and because within the five year period of the agreement scheme participants have some discretion about when to carry out certain capital works and when to claim reimbursement. Estimates of spending on Rural Stewardship Scheme (RSS) measures in any particular financial year are therefore subject to variation. A geographical division of anticipated spending on RSS measures in the current financial year, based on revised forecasts, is provided in the response to question S1W-23014 today.</p>

  <p>(a) The Core Sex Offender Programme (STOP 2000) is currently available at HMP Barlinnie and HMP Peterhead.</p>

  <p>Criteria for this programme include a history of sex offending and appropriate cognitive ability. Those referred must agree to go onto the programme. Prisoners may be deemed not ready to take part in the programme in relation to a number of other criteria relating to literacy, physical and mental health and complete denial of offence.</p>

  <p>The Adapted Sex Offender Programme is available at HMP Peterhead and HMYOI Polmont.</p>

  <p>Criteria for this programme include a history of sex offending and cognitive level of borderline learning disability or below or social functioning problems. Again, the prisoner may be deemed not ready if they do not meet the other criteria such as mental and physical health, or are in complete denial.</p>

  <p>Sex offenders can also access Scottish Prison Service programmes for Anger Management, Cognitive Skills, Drugs, Problem Solving and Approved Activities in Relationships, Alcohol, Parenting and Drugs at most establishments.</p>

  <p>(b) The Scottish Executive funds local authorities through the 100% funding arrangements for criminal justice social work to provide programmes for sex offenders. Where a specific group work programme is not available in an area a qualified social worker will work with an offender on an individual basis to address his/her needs. All offenders subject to statutory supervision whether as part of a community sentence or on release from custody have access to programmes either on a group or individual basis. Offenders not subject to statutory post release supervision can access programmes by seeking voluntary assistance.</p>

A copy of the latest report is available from the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17148).</p>

  <p>In addition, a survey is currently being undertaken by the water authorities to determine the level of compliance across Scotland with the tighter lead standard being introduced in December 2003. The purpose of the survey is to identify areas where steps need to be taken to meet the new standard.

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water. The Chief Executive&#8217;s response is:</p>

  <p>The energy consumption associated with pumping water from Balmore to the existing Glasgow supply system will vary depending upon the water demand in any given year and the mode of operation selected for both the Balmore and the new Milngavie water treatment plants. Based on an average year demand, the energy consumption of pumping from Balmore into the Glasgow supply system could lie within the operating range of 3.6 million kWh to 7 million kWh.</p>

  <p>For the option selection process, the lower figure was selected for use in all option comparisons as being the most representative energy consumption figure for a typical operating year and compatible with operating efficiency frameworks.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water. The Chief Executive&#8217;s response is:</p>

  <p>Each discipline was asked to score options against their criteria to assist in summarising the information in the Environmental Statement. Each discipline adopted its own scoring approach and a variety of different ranges and scoring methods were used, although for all criteria a low score represented worse and a high score better performance. So for example the environmental team scored all options on a range of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) for all environmental criteria; the different engineering disciplines used ranges e.g. 0-2, 0-5, 1-5, depending on the criterion and the degree of differentiation between the options. For energy consumption the quantitative values were simply converted to a scale of 1 to 10 from worst to best. <u>It should be emphasised that the scores for different criteria are not equivalent and cannot be summed together</u>. The scoring ranges are indicated on the appraisal framework in Table D6.2 of Appendix D in the Environmental Statement.</p>

  <p>It is worth stressing that throughout the complex decision making process, final choices were made by discussion and debate between different disciplines in the team. Consequently distortions related to importance did not occur. Tools were used to help the team sort out their ideas and distil information down into a manageable form to help their discussions, but they were <u>not</u> the principal methods used to make choices.</p>

  <p>Monitoring to identify the exact number of rats in sewers is not undertaken by the Scottish Water Authorities. In the event of a reported rodent infestation outbreak a reactive approach is adopted as this ensures that responses are appropriate to local needs and are effective in the protection of public health.</p>

  <p>In spring 2001, the Scottish Executive oversaw the introduction of a voluntary joint agreement between COSLA and the Scottish Water Authorities. This agreement helps to ensure effective collaboration between local authorities and water authorities re. the control of rodents in sewers. This document is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 19755).</p>
