  <p>The Scottish Executive Childcare Strategy aims to provide affordable, accessible, good quality child care for children aged 0 to 14 in all neighbourhoods. Responsibility for addressing local child care needs rests with the local authorities in conjunction with Childcare Partnerships.</p>

  <p>The Executive is providing &#163;16.75 million in the current financial year (2002-03) to local authorities to meet the aims of the strategy. In the Scottish Budget 2003-06 the Executive announced significant increases in Childcare Strategy funding. The allocations for the period are shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 removed the distinction between residential care homes and nursing homes and all such services are now known as care homes. Under the act, regulation of these services is the responsibility of the Care Commission, taking account of the appropriate national care standards for care homes, which are developed and published by Scottish ministers, and the associated legislation. The standards for care homes all include a standard on staffing, which states that staff will have the knowledge and skills needed to provide care. The standards also detail the level of training which care staff need to have and the date by which this must be achieved.</p>

Local authorities can still grant hardship relief to applicants who fall outwith this criteria under the normal terms where the Scottish Executive funds 75% of the cost.</p>

  <p>Nearly &#163;30 million has been made available over the seven years of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance programme to assist processors in Scotland. Aid under this programme will continue to be available.</p>

  <p>The equine industry can play an important role in improving the rural economy. The Scottish Executive is working with VisitScotland and the Enterprise Networks to support the development of the rural economy. These activities cannot realistically be the responsibility of one official. It is important that all departments and public bodies understand the potential role of the equine industry.</p>

  <p>Equine matters are diverse including animal health, tourism and rural enterprise. These issues are dealt with by a number of Scottish Executive departments and we are not convinced that a dedicated team in a single department would improve the consideration of equine matters in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Agricultural College&#146;s (SAC) proposal to withdraw campus-based education and research services from its Auchincruive Campus is part of an option for rationalisation that SAC has sought ministers&#146; agreement to, on the basis of a report of an options appraisal conducted by consultants Deloitte &amp; Touche.</p>

  <p>I have asked SAC to invite comments on the report from staff and other stakeholders and this has been done. I have also asked SAC for further work on the options appraisal. Ministers will take account of comments and representations that SAC receives and the additional information I have asked for before completing their consideration of the options appraisal report and SAC&#146;s recommendation. This process is likely to take a number of weeks.</p>

  <p>Without prejudice to the outcome of the option appraisal process I understand that SAC has been working with Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire and South Ayrshire Council to find alternative uses for parts of the Auchincruive campus which has exceeded the College's requirements for some time.</p>
