  <p>We also fund Keep Scotland Beautiful (KSB) for work such as the new local environmental audit management system to audit councils&#8217; litter clearance, and revise the code of practice on litter and refuse. KSB also does educational work such as the recent campaign against litter from cars.</p>

  <p>In the Anti Social Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill we are giving powers to issue fixed penalty fines for littering to police officers, and to direct relevant bodies on carrying out their duty to clear litter.</p>

  <p>Following its review, Historic Scotland will continue to develop its relationships with stakeholders and customers and to welcome dialogue with external bodies. Recent examples of this policy in practice include working with the City Councils in Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and Stirling to develop City Heritage Trusts; supporting and meeting regularly with the Built Environment Forum for Scotland (BEFS); and developing concordats with key partners in the historic environment, most recently with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland and soon with the National Trust for Scotland. Historic Scotland also intends to consult more frequently and formally with stakeholders on policy development.</p>

  <p>The Executive shares the interest of the UK Government in promoting agreements by separating parents in relation to contact and residence matters affecting children, without the need for court intervention.</p>

  <p>To this end, we provide grant aid to Family Mediation Scotland and ten local mediation services to assist separating parents reach a negotiated settlement for their children. Whilst we have no immediate plans to pilot early intervention schemes on the lines proposed by the UK Government, we will consider their outcomes with interest.</p>

  <p>An NHS employers&#8217; reference group for the consultants&#8217; contract has been meeting on a regular basis since it was established in November 2003. This group, which includes management representatives from a number of NHSScotland boards and Scottish Executive staff, is overseeing a co-ordinated and consistent approach to planning for the introduction of the consultants&#8217; contract and has issued regular advice to all NHSScotland employers to help take forward this work. The group has examined in detail the financial aspects of the contract and has been carrying out an assessment of costs across all NHS boards.</p>

  <p>Planning for introduction of the new GMS Contract on 1 April 2004 has been on-going since the positive outcome of the UK-wide GP ballot in June 2003. A national reference group, comprised of staff from across the NHS boards in Scotland and Scottish Executive representatives, has been operating since last year to oversee the implementation process. A finance working group, with its membership drawn from finance directors across NHS boards and the Scottish Executive, has been meeting on a regular basis to examine the financial envelope for GMS in Scotland and identify any likely pressures resulting from implementation of the new contract.

  <p>There are no plans to return to the previous arrangement of national NHS funding. The criteria for a national service include low volume and high unit costs. As the sleep service does not meet these criteria, it cannot be considered as a national service.

  <p>The Scottish Executive Staff Handbook makes it clear that staff incurring car parking fines for parking illegally whilst on official business will not be reimbursed from official funds.</p>

  <p>However there are occasions when circumstances arise which are beyond the control of officials and which prevent officials returning to parked vehicles in time to avoid incurring parking fines. Such occasions are very exceptional but do occasionally arise. Examples are where meetings involving ministers and visitors supported by an official from another building overrun the scheduled time allocated. Between 2000-04 13 occasions have arisen where the Scottish Executive has reimbursed officials for car parking fines incurred. A clear audit trail outlining the individuals reasons for applying for reimbursement is held on file for audit inspection.</p>

  <p>There were also four occasions during the period 2002-04 where government car service drivers received a parking ticket. This occurred when drivers were dropping off papers or ministerial boxes to destinations where no immediate parking provision existed. Also the Scottish Executive van service has incurred three parking tickets when transporting secure mail where the driver has required to park the vehicle directly outside a building and visit a reception area to obtain a signature before handing over official papers.</p>

  <p>Information about parking fines (which is only available from year 2000) is as follows:</p>

  <p>Because of the fundamental role that FE colleges have in encouraging people of all ages and from different backgrounds to participate in post-school learning, a large proportion of the resources available to FE colleges can be associated in some way with the promotion of social inclusion.</p>

  <p>The figures provided in the table relate to the specific elements that cover the additional costs of social inclusion, over and above the standard funding per student place, provided to colleges by the Scottish Further Education Funding Council in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. These figures consist of the entry costs social inclusion premium; retention and achievement social inclusion premium; and remote student element of the core funding provided to colleges by the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC).</p>

  <p>2. In addition to the figures shown above, colleges in receipt of the remote student element also received a remote institutional based element at a base rate of &#163;191,359 for 2003-04. Colleges that are extremely remote but on the mainland received a 15% increase on this base rate and island colleges received a 30% increase. Remote colleges are marked *, extremely remote **, and island ***. SFEFC is currently reviewing the way in which the funding methodology takes account of remoteness.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it will take to promote Scotland as a cruise liner destination; what steps are being taken to market theme cruises in particular; which organisations are responsible for each such promotion and marketing activity; what mechanisms are available to deliver such activities; what the role of Cruise Scotland is in relation to such activities, and what funding will be provided to Cruise Scotland or any other appropriate body for these purposes.</p>

  <p>Cruise Scotland was formed in 2001 as marketing consortium, funded entirely by membership fees, to promote Scotland as a destination for cruise liners. With a membership consisting of a group of area tourist boards and ports, for which cruise liner business is a relevant market, Cruise Scotland is currently the only mechanism available to continuously promote Scotland as a cruise liner destination. On a national scale Cruise Scotland also works in joint promotions with Cruise UK, a VisitBritain funded initiative.</p>

  <p>Cruise Scotland has developed themed itineraries in the past according to demand from operators. It is developing further suggested itineraries based on ports of call, time available onshore and various themes including golf, gardens and historic attractions.</p>

  <p>Apart from some relevant overseas destination marketing carried out by VisitScotland and the local activities of other marketing consortia and private businesses, only Cruise Scotland is currently promoting such activity specifically for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive announced on 3 February that the Transitional Reduction Scheme will continue for a further three years. Households on council tax benefit will receive a reduction in their water and sewerage bills in the financial year 2004-05 where their bills exceed a threshold of &#163;240.</p>

  <p>The Executive intends to put in place arrangements to ensure that the scheme is phased out in a measured and gradual fashion over the financial years 2005-07 so as to minimise the impact of withdrawal. It will consult the local authorities about these arrangements.</p>

  <p>In the long term, the best way to minimise the impact of water charges on all customers is to ensure that Scottish Water delivers its services at an efficient cost. To that end the Executive has put in place regulatory arrangements that require Scottish Water to make substantial savings in its costs.</p>

  <p>At this time, the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 does not yet apply to the decisions of councils.</p>

  <p>We are currently developing the necessary secondary legislation to implement the provisions of that Act.</p>
