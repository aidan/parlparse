  <p>I have noted, with concern, reports about the education budget within Scottish BORDERs Council. The position is currently the subject of a formal reference to the Accounts Commission. I have also made clear that, following the conclusion of <strong> </strong> the controller of audit&#8217;s investigations, I will ask Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectors of Education to bring forward their planned inspection of the education authority functions within Scottish BORDERs Council.</p>

  <p>My department has recently received proposals from the council to transfer resources into their national grid for learning and inclusion programmes for the current financial year. Their proposals were:</p>

  <p>A total of &#163;358,000 to be transferred into the council&#8217;s national grid for learning programme from resources which are currently uncommitted in the following programmes:</p>

  <p>Separately, &#163;31,000 to be transferred from the alternatives to exclusion programme into the inclusion programme.</p>

  <p>Before considering these transfers, I instructed my officials to seek assurances from the council that achievement of the key national objectives of each of the programmes concerned would not be prejudiced. The council has given these assurances; early intervention roll-out across the BORDERs will continue, and adult/pupil ratios will be below 1:15.</p>

  <p>I also asked my officials to seek assurance that the transfers would have no detrimental effect on existing levels of provision for children with special needs. The council has told my department that there will be no reduction to the council&#8217;s inclusion programme under the excellence fund. Indeed, &#163;31,000 will be transferred into this programme from the Alternatives to Exclusion programme. to assist in maintaining existing levels of support for children with special educational needs.</p>

  <p>In the light of these assurances, approval to the transfers has been given.</p>

  <p>The council has also notified my department that in the light of the overspending on their education budgets which has recently come to light they are no longer able to resource their planned objective of providing a new autism unit at Howdenburn Primary School in this financial year. I have been assured that this proposal will be revisited when the council has completed its longer-term review of expenditure and provision.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive health department and the Food Standards Agency for Scotland jointly conducted an initial public consultation between July and October 2000, following recommendations by the Committee on Medical Aspects on Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA) on the fortification of wheat flour with folic acid. A summary analysis of the consultation responses has been published and is available on the websites of both the Scottish Executive and the Food Standards Agency.</p>

  <p>On matters relating to food safety the Scottish Executive is advised by the Food Standards Agency. The agency is fully committed to ensuring that food manufacturers provide relevant and meaningful information for consumers.</p>

  <p>There have been increasing restrictions placed on production of ruminant mechanically recovered meat (MRM) and with effect from mid-August MRM production has been confined to pigs and poultry.</p>

  <p>Separate labelling of mechanically recovered meat in the ingredients list of prepacked meat products has been a requirement since 1997. A recent agreement on a European definition of meat reinforces this labelling requirement, and in addition places mechanically recovered meat outside the definition for the purposes of the quantitative declaration of &quot;meat&quot; ingredients in meat products. The new definition has to be implemented by January 2003.</p>

  <p>I have received Sir Anthony Campbell&#8217;s report into the process of prosecution decision making in the case. I have been advised that Dr Jandoo has now completed his report concerning the liaison which took place between the authorities and the Chhokar family, although Dr Jandoo has still to submit his report.</p>

  <p>On 10 September, the Minister for Justice and I were requested by Mr Anwar of the Chhokar Family Justice Campaign to delay publication of both reports until at least 10 October due to the poor health of a family member. We are both of the view that this is the right thing to do. As a consequence, it is now our intention to publish both reports shortly after the October recess.</p>

  <p>From April 2000, the Scottish Executive inclusion programme is providing an additional &#163;19 million over two years to assist education authorities in making schools more accessible to children with special educational needs. This funding can be used to ensure effective access to school buildings for children with disabilities, and authorities should use it to supplement use of their mainstream resources for accessibility.</p>
