  <p>Carers organisations include the national carer organisations (NCOs), carers centres, and young carer projects.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises and values the important role of the NCOs. Through section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, we have provided them with substantial core and project funding over a number of years. Decisions have yet to be made about public expenditure provision from 2011 onwards. Subject to the outcome of these decisions, we will consider continuing to support the NCOs in response to acceptable applications for section 10 funding.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and Community Planning Partnerships are responsible for delivering services which meet local needs, as expressed in the single outcome agreements. Funding for local projects, including carers centres and young carer projects, is therefore provided by local authorities. Funding is also provided by NHS boards at local level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government did, however, provide a grant to the Princess Royal Trust for Carers to help support young carer projects most at risk in 2010-11. It is a matter for the PRTC, with the Scottish Young Carers Alliance, to allocate those resources as appropriate.</p>

  <p>A decision on the timing and production of this report has yet to be agreed. Estimates of Scottish production emissions in 2010 - that is the emissions created within Scotland during 2010 - will first become available and formally reported during 2012.

  <p>There are no plans for the Scottish Government to develop an electronic single shared assessment specifically for patients and clients with drug and alcohol problems.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has developed single shared assessment for all users of community care services based on an the <em>National Minimum Information Standards</em> (NMIS).</p>

  <p>Agencies can introduce other aspects into single shared assessments to meet local priorities and to inform performance management reporting. These can include specialist assessments for drug and alcohol services.</p>

  <p>Agencies had until March 2009 to implement NMIS in support of single shared assessment in paper form and are expected to share information electronically within six months of the systems being put in place to do so.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the estimated numbers of women in the specified age ranges who consulted either a GP or practice-employed nurse in Scotland for an eating disorder (anorexia, bulimia and other psychological eating disorders) during 2007-08 and 2008-09.</p>

  <p>Estimates are based on data from a small sample of general practices in Scotland that participate in the Practice Team Information (PTI) scheme. The patients registered to PTI practices are representative of Scotland as a whole in terms of their age, gender and deprivation profile. Precise estimates are difficult to generate for small age groups and/or for conditions where patients consult relatively rarely. Confidence intervals, introduced from 31 March 2009, are shown to indicate the degree of precision of these estimates.</p>

  <p>Because the method for estimating numbers of consultations has been revised since a similar question was answered last year (S3W-21249 on 18 March 2009), the table also includes revised estimates for the years 2003-04 to 2006-07.

  <p>Figures are not shown for men as robust estimates could not be calculated. Relatively few PTI practices in recent years have recorded any eating disorders consultations for men aged 10-30 and in those that do the total number of consultations recorded is very small.</p>

  <p>Under the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 NHS boards have a statutory duty to ensure the provision of pharmaceutical services. In doing so, they have the statutory role in determining applications made to them for entry to the pharmaceutical list. The 1978 act provides that there must be rights of appeal against the decisions of health boards on these applications. The NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2009 set out the procedures for such appeals to be determined by the National Appeal Panel.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has recently completed a consultation exercise considering issues in relation to the process by which applications to join the pharmaceutical list are considered. As part of this, we sought comments on the need for guidance and/ or training of those involved in the process. We will now consider whether any amendments or further activity is necessary in light of the views offered.</p>

  <p>Diagnosis of Leber&rsquo;s disease is made using the following methods: taking a history; identifying signs and symptoms; blood and urine tests; testing visual acuity and visual fields; electrophysiology studies, and fluorescein angiography. A CT or MRI scan is also undertaken to exclude other inflammatory and structural causes of acute optic neuritis, particularly if there is no family history.</p>

  <p>No prevention or treatment is available for Leber&rsquo;s disease at present. Several drugs and interventions are being tested, such as Brimonidine, near-infrared light treatment, Vitamin B12, and viral vector techniques. Gene therapy and stem cell therapy may help with management of the condition in the future.</p>

  <p>Genetic counselling and referral to appropriate agencies for supportive advice regarding life circumstances and lifestyle may also be offered.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland&rsquo;s <em>Best Practice Statement on Maternal History Taking,</em> which was published in August 2008, sets what information should be included as part of the Scottish Woman Held Maternity Record (SWHMR).

  <p><em>Preventing Overweight and Obesity in Scotland: A Route Map Towards Healthy Weight</em> (published February 2010) sets out both national and local governments&rsquo; respective long-term commitment to tackling overweight and obesity, to help achieve a healthier Scotland and contribute towards sustainable economic growth. The Route Map acknowledges that the rise in the number of women who are obese during pregnancy is a cause for concern due to the risks that obesity poses to the health of both the mother and infant, as well as its influence on long-term adult health. There are a number of actions within the Route Map aimed at supporting pregnant women and new mothers to develop healthy lifestyle behaviours.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government expect NHS Scotland systems and processes to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998, the Human Rights Act 1998 and any other relevant law. The European Court of Human Rights case predated the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and the Data Protection Act (1998) which set out the principles that organisations must comply with in the handling of personal data. Under the Data Protection Act 1998, NHSS organisations must be able to demonstrate that appropriate technical, managerial and organisational steps are in place. NHS boards therefore adopt a risk based approach to determine what measures are appropriate taking into account the state of technology at the time, the cost of implementing such measures and the nature of the data to be processed and the harm that might result from, for instance, unauthorised access. Issues of access control and audit of access will be important considerations as new systems promoting the sharing of information in the interests of safe effective and efficient provision of care are developed.</p>

This is reflected in the Lothian figures which are proportionally higher as they have chosen a fully managed service and their service cover community as well as acute sectors.</p>

  <p>The Patient Management System will deliver improvements in the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information held by integrating previously disjointed processes and reducing the reliance on paper-based records and manual activities. The system will introduce standard methods for recording and processing patient information that will make it more easily accessible and retrievable electronically, when and where required, but only by authenticated and authorised persons. Electronic access controls and audit trails will introduce levels of information assurance that are not feasible in paper-based systems. Electronic capture will improve the consistency of health records, and electronic data can be backed-up to provide additional resilience.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland uses information security risk analysis and management methods to identify and mitigate risks. The NHS Scotland Security Policy states that boards will undertake a survey of their information systems and data, and make an assessment of the likely security risks, including an evaluation of the likely impact and occurrence of any threats. Boards then introduce measures to mitigate these risks. This approach was taken in the evaluation of the Emergency Care Summary record and will be used as TrakCare is deployed in boards.</p>

  <p>TrakCare is a client/server system and therefore, in general, the servers will be located in a secure server room at some distance from the required access to the record. In boards the servers will normally be at a hospital site, but a third-party data centre could also be selected. These are choices for the boards to make. There should be no need for TrakCare servers in GP practices.</p>

  <p>Clinical portal is not a single system but a range of joined up products and services that will provide clinicians with a single route to access priority information. NHS boards are currently working in regional consortia to determine how best to deliver clinical portal based on their different starting points and technical environments. Key considerations will be the availability of priority information held electronically within national or local NHS board clinical systems, and the technical infrastructure on which clinical portal will be deployed. Detailed design of the portal, including the level of performance which is acceptable to clinicians for front-line use, will be determined by boards. Clinical portal responsiveness is likely to be impacted more by the wider technical environment and the number of different clinical information sources than by the number of simultaneous clinical portal users. The incremental approach adopted to delivery of clinical portal will enable the portal to grow and develop at a pace that is in step with the clinical usage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish eHealth Programme recommends a standards-based approach when choosing or developing ICT systems, with a preference for open standards to ensure the maximum level of interoperability. The eHealth N3 network allows for standard data formats to be communicated between applications, and a good example of this is the SCI Gateway application that enables the secure transfer of documents between primary and secondary care using SIGN standards and national XML definitions. Indeed, SCI Gateway has now been deployed in Wales.</p>

  <p>The eHealth standards library, published on the eHealth website, lists standards statements that have either been approved or are in progress.</p>

  <p>A further notable development in this area is that, as part of the national procurement for a Patient Management System (TrakCare), a contract has been signed for an integration product called Ensemble (which lies at the heart of TrakCare). This will enable interoperability between applications within and across boards, and relies on the definition and adoption of standard data formats, many of which are open and international.</p>

  <p>A working prototype of clinical portal is currently under development within a consortium of South and East NHS boards led by NHS Lothian. North and West NHS board consortia are currently defining and assessing their delivery options. The incremental approach advocated in the eHealth Strategy is part of our design. The current phase of portal work is intended to give us much clearer indications of the benefits of different approaches, how much they will cost and how long they will take. We want this information to be available before we invite boards to commit to a particular route for delivering portal benefits. The three regional consortia, encompassing all territorial boards, are due to report in late summer 2010. The Clinical Portal Programme Board will then be in a position to consider issues of timing and affordability of clinical portal deployment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of Dr Brian Robson&rsquo;s comments at the Institute of Healthcare Management Scotland Conference in October 2007 that in England 15% of hospitalisations are complicated by medication errors, one in seven hospital admissions occurs because care providers do not have access to previous hospital records and 20% of laboratory tests are requested because the results of previous investigations are not accessible, whether there are corresponding figures for Scotland and, if so, what these are.</p>

  <p>Information on the volume of incidents relating to the accessibility of hospital records or laboratory test results is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>Hospital discharge records, which are collected centrally, are coded with diagnostic information relating to the patient&rsquo;s stay. Although medication errors may be identifiable in certain circumstances, the data would not fairly and accurately reflect the true prevalence of such errors or give an indication of harm to patients.</p>

  <p>Patient safety is a key priority for the Scottish Government. It is vital for patients to have confidence that when they access any part of the healthcare system, they will receive the best available treatment without fear of harm. The Scottish Patient Safety Programme is being implemented in every NHS board and is designed to improve the safety of care.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for ensuring the quality, safety and effectiveness of the services they provide. Appropriate governance arrangements are in place and these arrangements are the subject of review by a number of external bodies and agencies. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) has commenced a review of all NHS boards in Scotland with regard to performance against NHS QIS Clinical Governance and Risk Management Standards.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that prescribing rates can be influenced not only by prevalence and detection rates of depression, but also prescribing practice around the dosage and duration of the prescription &ndash; for example the same people might be staying on antidepressants for longer periods, or they may be receiving a higher dose.</p>

  <p>We will ensure those who need antidepressants will continue to receive them in accordance with clinical guidelines, while investing in alternatives that increase choice for clinicians and service users through improved access to evidence based interventions such as psychological therapies.</p>

  <p>The Family Friendly Policies for NHS Scotland employees are covered in the Supporting Work Life Balance Partnership Information Network (PIN) Policy. This policy can be found at <a href="http://www.staffgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/partnership/partnership-information-network/" target="_blank">http://www.staffgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/partnership/partnership-information-network/</a> .</p>

  <p>This policy framework covers job share policy, career break policy, reduced working year policy, flexible working policy, annualised hours policy, home working policy, phased retiral policy, maternity leave, paternity leave, breastfeeding policy, parental leave policy and adoption and fostering leave policy.</p>

  <p>These policies support staff to balance home life with the demands of work by encouraging both the service and its staff to adopt flexible working practices. The ability to work flexibly opens up career opportunities to a greater range of individuals, which in turn leads to development of equality of opportunity.</p>

  <p>These policies support the Staff Governance Standard, and their implementation within each health board is monitored through the Staff Governance Self-Assessment Audit Tool, which is completed at a local level by the Area Partnership Forum and Staff Governance Committee, and is then used by the Scottish Government to inform discussions during the annual review process.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to include the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) in the guidelines on the use of consultancy. The SFT Management Statement and Financial Memorandum specifies the general principles that SFT is required to adhere to in any expenditure, including the procurement of external advice.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-34105 by Alex Neil on 14 June 2010, what guidance it has issued to the Scottish Futures Trust in respect of its use of consultants for the National Housing Trust initiative and whether it has set a limit of spend per contract.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Futures Trust&rsquo;s (SFT&rsquo;s) policies in using consultants or other external advisors for the National Housing Trust (NHT) initiative are the same as for all other SFT projects. SFT&rsquo;s Management Statement and Financial Memorandum specifies the general principles that the SFT must adhere to in any expenditure. This includes the overarching requirement that procurement is based on value for money, as well as, if applicable, compliance with any relevant EU or other international procurement rules.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Futures Trust&rsquo;s (SFT&rsquo;s) Business Plan (published on the SFT website at <a href="http://www.scottishfuturestrust.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.scottishfuturestrust.org.uk</a> ) includes a budget allocation of &pound;750,000 in 2010-11 for the SFT&rsquo;s housing related work. This budget is being used, amongst other things, to fund the SFT&rsquo;s work on the National Housing Trust (NHT) initiative and includes SFT&rsquo;s forecast overheads and the need for any specialist advice which cannot be internally resourced. It is for the SFT to determine the most appropriate use of these resources taking account of its Management Statement and Financial Memorandum.</p>

  <p>This information requested is not held centrally by the Scottish Government. Coaches, whether paid or voluntary, are employed by a range of organisations such as local authorities, sports governing bodies and private clubs.</p>

  <p>In partnership with Skills Active and Skills Development work we have recently concluded a short study into the workforce and skills required to support our legacy ambitions for increasing participation in physical activity and sport. The strategic priorities of the Legacy Skills Plan are to develop leadership and management skills, support new entrants to the paid and voluntary sector, make more effective use of paid and voluntary workforce and address skills deficiencies and gaps.</p>

  <p>This work together with the ongoing revision of Coaching Scotland should provide us with a clearer picture of the current coaching workforce and identify future needs to support specific target groups such as elderly people.</p>

  <p>The new Scottish Drugs Recovery Consortium (SDRC) includes a number of members who work with families and children affected by substance misuse. One of these members is the Princess Royal Trust East Ayrshire Carers Centre. The members working together, with their considerable knowledge and experience of problem drug use in families, will have much to contribute in support to carers and young carers of people with substance misuse problems. This can be facilitated through the network of carers centres and with a range of organisations, working in partnership with the Alcohol and Drug Partnerships.</p>

  <p>One of the main concerns of all carers, irrespective of their caring situation, is the provision of timely, effective and personalised support to help sustain them in their caring role. The draft Carers and Young Carers Strategy for Scotland, to be agreed with our strategic partner, COSLA, is likely to set out a range of actions relating to different types of support. For those carers of people with substance misuse problems, there is likely to be a role for alcohol and drugs partnerships in providing support.</p>
