  <p>The Scottish Executive is today publishing the Scottish farm income figures. The estimated figures show that Total Income from Farming at &pound;239 million showed little change from 1998. Net Farm Incomes averaged across all farm types is expected to fall by 22% in 1999-2000. The fall in agricultural incomes reflect the lower prices for many agricultural commodities and the continuing strength of the pound. Detailed estimates of the outputs, inputs and income of Scottish agriculture in 1999 at both the aggregate level and by farm type will be published this morning and will be placed with SPICe.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive was informed about these proposals in November last year. I am aware that the East of Scotland Water Authority wrote in general terms about the scope of the scheme to Scottish Natural Heritage in October 1999. This was followed in November 1999 when the consultants commissioned by EoSWA to produce an environmental impact assessment of a number of options wrote to SNH and others about these proposals.</p>

  <p>SNH raised a number of matters with the consultants, and will be consulted again when the preferred sites for these tanks have been identified.</p>

  <p><i>The National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> , which we adopted in December, sets out the framework for Scotland to move towards more sustainable waste management. It is clear that a great increase in the amount of recycling by local authorities is needed.</p>

  <p>Soundly based targets have a part to play in implementing the strategy and I have asked the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to advise me on appropriate targets for recycling by local authorities by the end of this year</p>

  <p>I am looking to local authorities and others involved in Area Waste Strategy groups as part of the National Strategy to develop plans which will maximise recycling as we strive to divert waste away from landfill. We have made &pound;2.5 million per annum from 2000-01 available to local authorities to assist with this work.</p>

  <p>One of the main problems in achieving increased recycling levels is the lack of stable markets for recycled materials. Last year I was pleased to launch the REMADE project which aims to demonstrate that viable markets can be developed for recycled materials in Scotland.</p>

  <p><i>The National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> promotes the reduction, re-use and recycling of waste. We have adopted the strategy and the Scottish Executive are attempting to lead by example. For instance, the Executive purchases 100% recycled paper wherever possible and recycles paper when it is of no further use.</p>

  <p>The Landfill Tax discourages landfill and promotes reduction, re-use and recycling of waste.</p>

  <p>Regulations are in place to implement the EC Packaging Waste Directive ensuring that at least 50% of packaging waste is recycled by 2001. These regulations should mean that more recycled material will find its way back to consumers.</p>

  <p>The REMADE project aims to identify and develop markets for recycled materials. Part of the project involves work to change standards which demand unnecessary use of virgin materials.</p>

  <p>It is clear that many people are not aware of the impact of the waste they produce. We are looking at ways of raising awareness of waste amongst the general public and promotion of recycling would be a key element of any action taken.</p>

  <p>As part of the additional funding for rural transport announced in the 1998 and 1999 Budgets, the Executive is investing a total of more than &pound;14 million in rural transport measures in Scotland between the financial years 1998-99 and 2000-01. In the first two years the Executive has provided local authorities with an additional &pound;3.5 million per year for the provision of rural public passenger transport services &#8211; mainly bus. This funding is additional to what local authorities currently spend on rural bus services. Also &pound;0.6 million per year (increased to &pound;0.9 million in 1999-2000) is being invested in rural community transport projects in the form of support to community and voluntary groups to help them organise and operate transport in rural areas. As part of the overall package, &pound;4.5 million is due for disbursement in 2000-01. <br /></p>
