  <p>There are no regulations which specifically cover the welfare of wild animals in travelling circuses. However, section 24 of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 requires the person responsible for animals, including circus animals, to take reasonable steps to ensure that the needs of the animals are met.</p>

  <p>These needs include:</p>

  <p>(a) its need for a suitable environment,</p>

  <p>(b) its need for a suitable diet,</p>

  <p>(c) its need to be able to exhibit normal behaviour patterns,</p>

  <p>(d) any need it has to be housed with, or apart from, other animals and</p>

  <p>(e) its need to be protected from suffering, injury and disease.</p>

  <p>Many bodies have concerns about the consequences of depletion of our valuable biodiversity and natural resources. There is general agreement that, while significant improvements have been achieved, EU member states will not achieve the ambitious target adopted by the European Union to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010. The Scottish Government is however committed to delivering policies within the context of the National Performance Framework which will lead to continuing improvements in the state of Scotland&rsquo;s biodiversity; non-governmental organisations and private sector representatives are partners with the public sector in taking forward actions under the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also continuing to work with the UK authorities in contributing to international debate on measures to address global biodiversity loss in the lead up to the 2010 Nagoya Conference of Parties on the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the concordat, local government will make year-on-year progress on class size reduction. Already across Scotland, class sizes in primary schools have fallen to an all-time average low of 23.2. However, we need to ensure legislation properly balances the need for local and national government to manage class size limits and the rights of parents to have a say in where there children are educated. We are currently considering whether current legislation needs to be changed.</p>

  <p>Local authorities, any part of whose area adjoins the sea, are coast protection authorities under the Coast Protection Act 1949 which provides wide powers to protect any land in their areas from coastal erosion. The Scottish Government is providing record levels of funding to local government in Scotland with &pound;23 billion allocated over the period 2008-10. The vast majority of the funding, including funding on coast protection, will be provided by means of a block grant. The former ring-fenced capital funding for coast protection is now included within the general capital grant. It is each local authority&rsquo;s responsibility to allocate the financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having fulfilled statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities. These include the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the reasons are for the rise in antidepressant prescribing over the last 10 years, from 43.54 defined daily doses per 1,000 population per day in 1997-98 to 93.20 in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>The answer is complex. There are four reasons why anti-depressant prescribing can rise. Firstly, more people may be anxious or depressed at a level which would meet the guidance for prescribing of anti-depressants. Secondly, more people may present to their GP, perhaps because of the reduction in stigma or increasing public understanding of mental health issues. Thirdly, prescribing practice may change &ndash; including the use of higher dosages in some cases. Finally, the range of illnesses for which anti-depressants are used may increase over time.</p>

  <p>Our Health Efficiency Access Target (HEAT) is to reduce the annual rate of increase of defined daily dose per capita of anti-depressants to zero by 2009-10, and put in place the required support framework to achieve a 10% reduction in future years.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards are now required to collect real time data on infection rates by hospital and specialty. These reports are published on NHS board websites, and from autumn 2009 will be extended to include information on HAI related deaths.</p>

  <p>The data provided in the following table are provisional and should be treated with caution. Encouragingly, this unvalidated data of Clostridium difficile cases for the period May 2008 to May 2009 would appear to indicate a significant downward trend in the number of incidences over the same period the previous year. The information obtained from NHS boards reveals that there were 6,264 Clostridium difficile cases between May 2007 to April 2008. The total in the following table reveals that between May 2008 and May 2009 the number fell to 4,789 cases of Clostridium difficile. This is a fall of 1,475 cases (a 23.5% reduction).</p>

  <p>The date of each incidence has not been given to preserve the anonymity of patients.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office statement of 24 June indicated that they will not pursue criminal prosecutions following the investigations into the circumstances surrounding the Clostridium difficile outbreak. In my statement to Parliament on 22 April, I indicated my intention to appoint Lord Coulsfield as Chair. Since that time, good progress has been made in establishing an Inquiry secretariat and sourcing accommodation. However, I regret that Lord Coulsfield is now unable to undertake the role of chair of the Inquiry because of circumstances affecting his health. I am grateful to Lord Coulsfield for the preliminary work he had already taken forward.</p>

  <p>I intend to make rapid progress in identifying a new chair for the Inquiry. However, under the terms of the Inquiries Act 2005, I am obliged to consult the chair of the Inquiry on the terms of reference. In these circumstances, I am unable to make an announcement at this stage about the terms of reference and setting up date of the Inquiry but will take forward efforts to appoint a new chair as a matter of urgency, and will return to Parliament as soon as possible to fulfil the requirements of the Inquiries Act 2005.</p>

  <p>Two hundred and fifty applications to the Home Owners&rsquo; Support Fund, which includes the mortgage to rent and mortgage to shared equity schemes, were received in the three months from March to May 2009 and one application has been successful so far. In addition, offer letters have been issued on a further nine cases and a further eight cases are at the conveyancing stage.</p>

  <p>Of the 250 received, 112 were returned to the applicant or their money adviser because the application was incomplete.</p>

  <p>I expect to receive the final report from Lord Gill shortly and along with ministers in the Department of Works and Pensions (DWP) we will be arranging for it to be published as soon as possible afterwards. At that time the report will be accessible from the Scottish Government and DWP websites, the ICL Public Inquiry website and copies will be placed in Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 48473). I would like to take the opportunity to thank Lord Gill and his team for their diligent work on the inquiry.</p>

  <p>The use of private hire cars for ministerial travel is shown in the following table:</p>

  <p>The above figures compare with a total of 616 journeys at a cost of &pound;72,705 for ministerial travel by private hire car during the comparable period in 2006-07.

  <p>I am pleased to announce that the final version of Scotland&rsquo;s second National Planning Framework was published and laid before the Scottish Parliament this morning, 25 June 2009.</p>

  <p><em>The National Planning Framework for Scotland 2</em> builds on the first National Planning Framework (NPF), drawing on the analysis contained in the NPF monitoring report (September 2006) and the views of stakeholders following an extensive programme of public engagement and Parliamentary scrutiny. The framework takes forward the spatial aspects of the Government&rsquo;s Economic Strategy. It articulates the spatial consequences of policies for transport, energy, climate change, waste management, water and drainage, flooding etc, rather than making policy on these matters. It provides a means of efficiently delivering national policies and programmes and identifying key strategic infrastructure needs which support the Scottish Government&rsquo;s central purpose of sustainable economic growth.</p>

  <p>Copies of the <em>National Planning Framework for Scotland 2</em>, the accompanying Participation Statement including Final Conformity Report, and a statement in response to the Views of the Scottish Parliament on the Proposed National Planning Framework are available from the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib. numbers 48492, 48493, and 48494).</p>

  <p>Teacher employment is a matter for local authorities. Local authorities employ teachers on a range of contract types including temporary and part-time contracts. The General Teachers Council Scotland survey of April 2009 on which the TES Scotland report was based indicated that 89.4% of post-probation teachers were teaching in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I apologise for the delay in responding to this parliamentary question but I am now pleased to advise that the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding setting out the process whereby police officers may enter the Holyrood complex in execution of a search warrant in the course of a criminal investigation have been agreed between the main relevant parties. The memorandum will have effect immediately so far as the Chief Executive of the Scottish Parliament, on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB), the Procurator Fiscal for Lothian and Borders and the Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders Police are concerned. To facilitate its more general operation it will be put before the next committee meeting of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPOS) on 25 September 2009 to have a Scotland-wide effect. The memorandum will therefore be immediately operational so far as Lothian and Borders police are concerned and, with regard to other forces, when the ACPOS ratification is confirmed.</p>

  <p>A copy of the memorandum will be published in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre.</p>
