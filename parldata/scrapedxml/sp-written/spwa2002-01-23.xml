  <p>The Scottish labour market is dynamic. The monthly labour market statistics from the Office of National Statistics give employment changes from quarter to quarter. There are large shifts between employment, unemployment and inactivity each month/quarter. Any attempt to measure job loss figures is likely to be swamped by these large flows.</p>

  <p>The Labour Force Survey (run by the Office of National Statistics) provides data on a quarterly basis for redundancies. The information collected on redundancies relates to whether an individual was made redundant in the three months prior to the survey interview. The data, however, is not sufficiently large to disaggregate reliably below an all-Scotland level.</p>

  <p>Jobs are constantly being created and lost across the country as firms start-up, expand, contract, close or merge. It would be a substantial burden on business &#8211; and indeed all employers &#8211; to require notifications of all job changes.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the on-going nature of the impacts, the Economic Impact Assessment Group continue their work. They last met in November and have maintained a regular dialogue since. Their next meeting will coincide with the availability of the results of their case studies into the economic and social impacts on communities and key sectors.</p>

  <p>The next stage of their work will involve a full ex-post assessment of the outbreak. It will be taken forward in collaboration with the other Devolved Administrations and Whitehall Departments; the Impact Assessment Group will be represented on the steering group by SEERAD officials. The project is currently out to tender and will publish in the summer.</p>

  <p>The figures contained in the answer to question S1W-20044 were the official figures of Family Mediation Scotland (FMS). In the light of the information supplied in that answer, I caused further enquiries to be made. I understand a new monitoring system was introduced by FMS during 2000-01 in order to standardise the recording of referrals throughout their centres in Scotland. As a result, previous year&#8217;s figures cannot be considered comparable. In addition, due to organisational change the figures from Grampian have not been included in those for 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Allowing for this, it appears the number of referrals in recent years have remained broadly similar and have not declined.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to implement the 1987 Scottish Law Commission (SLC) <i> Report on Child Abduction</i> . The law in this area has developed since 1987. The common law crime of abduction has been used more frequently to deal with the taking of children, and Section 2 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 makes it clear that a parent cannot remove from Scotland a child habitually resident in Scotland without the appropriate consent.</p>

  <p>Within the European Union, member states are currently discussing a proposed regulation on the mutual enforcement of judgements on rights of access to children, and a European Commission working document on mutual recognition of decisions on parental responsibility. The Scottish Executive is fully represented in these discussions and has consulted the Justice 2 and the European Committees about future developments in this area.</p>

  <p>The Remote and Rural Areas Initiative (RARARI) sub-group on maternity services is chaired by Mrs Brenda Thorpe, Head of Midwifery Services in Dumfries and Galloway. It draws its membership from professional groups, especially from remote and rural areas, including midwives, neonatal nurses, obstetricians, paediatricians, anaesthetists, and also has lay and user representation.</p>

  <p>The sub-group will consider remote and rural issues concerning maternity services, as identified in <i>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland</i>. The group will meet for the first time in February 2002. Detailed reporting arrangements are a matter for RARARI.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the NHS complaints procedure which was carried out on a UK basis during 2001 considered the operation of the procedure in all parts of the NHS, including dental services. The report of the independent researchers can be found at: www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/health/nhscomplaints.pdf.</p>

  <p>A pre-consultation exercise was carried out in the autumn of 2001 to inform the development of proposals to meet the Health Plan commitment of establishing a new complaints process which is &quot;credible, easy to use, demonstrably independent and effective&quot;. A working group, which includes patient representatives, is currently developing proposals for inclusion in a public consultation on the new procedure for issue in March 2002. The new procedure will continue to cover dental services.</p>

  <p>A small number of HRA PFI Pathfinder schemes have been set up in England, however, there are no plans to set up similar schemes in Scotland.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S1W-20257, S1W-20258 and S1W-20816 by Lewis Macdonald on 7 January 2002, what the legal barriers were, broken down by particular Act and section, that prevented it, as the author of the trunk roads maintenance contracts, from (a) requiring that the Statement of Practice guidelines associated with TUPE transfers be an obligation during the transfer of staff and (b) improving the contractual protection of the pension rights of local authority staff in its tender process in each case.</p>

  <p>TUPE is the UK Regulation which transposes the EC Acquired Rights Directive. The application of TUPE is a matter of law. The Scottish Executive were unable to state that a Transfer of Undertaking would occur on the award of the new contracts. Regulation 3 of TUPE requires the occurrence of a relevant transfer as a precondition of the application of the regulations.</p>

  <p>Further to the answer given to question S1W-20816, the contracts are silent on the pensions position. There are no powers within the contract which would have allowed ministers to require the new operating companies to improve the levels of pension.</p>

  <p>The obligation in the Landfill Directive to reduce the proportion of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill applies to member states, based on 1995 levels. Scotland will be expected to meet a proportion of this. There are a number of potential methods for dividing the overall figures between local authorities, which do not depend on knowing the actual amounts of waste for each authority for that year. We plan to publish a consultation paper later in 2002 setting out proposals on how we shall establish the baseline and target figures for each authority.</p>
