  <p>Organic production methods can deliver environmental benefits through reductions in the use of inorganic fertilisers and pesticides. There are no environmental benefits from consumption of organic foods: on the contrary, as with non-organic foods, there could be environmental disbenefits where these are imported.</p>

  <p>Endodontics is the specialty of treatment of root canals. The majority of root canal treatment work is undertaken by primary care dentists, both in the community and in general dental practice, with over 140,000 such treatments undertaken annually in Scotland. Also, as those patients requiring specialist endodontic care are normally referred to a Consultant in Restorative Dentistry, Endodontic Specialists are not the sole supplier of this type of treatment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is reviewing the role of all dental specialties and their contribution to future dental services in Scotland.</p>
