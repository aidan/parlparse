  <p>Funding to tackle alcohol problems is provided within NHS boards' and local authorities' general allocations and cannot be separately identified. The Executive is providing &#163;1 million in 2002-03 to Alcohol Action Teams to assess local needs and draw up local strategies to address these. A breakdown of this funding by NHS Board area is given in the following table:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, whether the working group to develop lifelong services for people with autistic spectrum disorders as recommended in the Public Health Institute of Scotland&#146;s <i>Autistic Spectrum Disorders Needs Assessment Report</i> of December 2001 has been set up and, if so, (a) when it was established, (b) what its membership is, who appointed them and what the selection process was, (c) on what dates it has met and whether the minutes of any of its meetings are publicly available, (d) whether it has a timetable for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report and (e) what its achievements have been to date.</p>

  <p>We propose to deliver this recommendation through the working group established by the Public Health Institute for Scotland for the development of the <i>Autistic Spectrum Disorders Needs Assessment Report</i> . Membership is as stated on the inside cover of that report. The Scottish Executive held a first meeting with the group on 24 June 2002. This initial meeting focused on the identification of priorities for implementing the report&#146;s recommendations. There is no minute of the meeting.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-18178 by Malcolm Chisholm on 28 September 2001, whether the definition of personal care contained in its guidance circular CCD 4/2002, which states that &quot;food preparation and provision of meals are not included&quot;, contradicts the recommended definition in the Care Development Group&#146;s report, <i>Fair Care for Older People</i> , which includes &quot;assistance with preparation of food&quot; and, if so, what action it is taking in respect of this matter.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive do not believe that there is any discrepancy between the Care Development Group Report, the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 schedule 1 and the subsequent guidance CCD/4/2002 issued to councils on the implementation of the policy.</p>

  <p>The Care Development Group recommended that there should be sufficient flexibility in the definition and in turn application of personal care to ensure an individual's care needs can be properly met. &quot;Assistance with the preparation of food&quot; was therefore included in the definition to encompass those with severe physical and/or mental frailty who may need support for certain tasks. The Executive will continue to monitor the practical effect of the policy across all local authorities and keep the guidance under review.</p>

  <p>Most of these crofts were created from existing crofts by subdivision or through reorganisation. Only three cases (one in 1996 and two in 2000) involved land that was not previously recorded on the Register of Crofts.</p>

  <p>In seeking the information required to answer this question it has been established that since 1955 a total of 203 holdings of land on crofting common grazings that are linked to non-croft holdings have been deemed to be crofts for the purpose of crofting legislation. The figures in the preceding table do not include details of any such holdings established during the period 1990 to 2001. Data relating to these holdings is held by the Crofters Commission but mostly not on the Register of Crofts. If you wish further information about these holdings the Chief Executive of the Crofters Commission will be happy to provide full details.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that the identification of local priorities for economic development and the delivery of co-ordinated economic development activities is dealt with most effectively by partnerships of local organisations and agencies. Scottish Enterprise Fife, in following the Smart Successful Scotland strategy, is taking action to encourage the growth of businesses, improvements in skills and the creation of new employment opportunities. There are already in place effective arrangements for dealing with redundancy situations and the Fife PACE (Partnership Action For Continuing Employment) team provides a wide range of early interventions to alleviate job losses and assist those affected. The Fife Local Economic Forum provides a robust mechanism for driving forward an agreed economic agenda for the area and has the potential to deliver real results in terms of sustainable economic development. This largely fulfils the role that a task force might have.</p>

  <p>Based on the action plan that was originally submitted, the &#163;1 million (the grant) covered approximately 60% of the total cost of implementation. The percentages varied from project to project. Some projects were fully supported while others only needed around 30% support. The grant required for each project was determined in the first instance by the group that prepared the action plan (based on the other sources of funding that they were able to identify). The plan was then submitted to ministers who in turn took a view as to whether or not the percentage grant that was required was reasonable. In general terms, ministers wanted to be satisfied that there was sufficient third party support in terms of meeting the cost of what was being proposed.</p>

  <p>Planning Advice Note 61, <i>Planning and Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems</i> was published in July 2001.

  <p>The SUDS Monitoring Project, funded by the Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research (SNIFFER), shows 3,913 systems installed on 769 sites during the period between mid-1995 and the beginning of 2002.

  <p>Each regulatory authority has its own powers, and thus formal approval for a drainage system may be needed from the planning authority (planning permission); the building control authority (building warrant); Scottish Water (drainage construction consent); the roads authority (road construction consent); and from Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) (consent to discharge &#150; if required &#150; or conditional prohibition notice).</p>

  <p>The developer is responsible for the construction of a sustainable drainage system and for ensuring it meets the requirements of the design manual prepared by the Sustainable Urban Drainage Scottish Working Party.

  <p>No specific monitoring is carried out on crops situated in the vicinity of GM crop trials.</p>

  <p>Separation distances are in place around GM crop trials to minimise the potential for cross-pollination. They do not reflect any doubts about safety; they are used to maintain high levels of purity in adjacent crops and are a recognised method of enabling different crops to co-exist. The Executive&#146;s scientific advisers are satisfied that neither cross-pollination involving the variety of GM herbicide tolerant oil seed rape being grown in the farm-scale trials, nor the pollen itself landing on neighbouring crops, poses a threat to human health or the environment. The harvested GM crop and any sexually compatible crops grown within the separation distances surrounding GM crop trials will not enter the human food or animal feed chain.</p>

  <p>Postcode EH9 covers two water quality zones, one supplied from Alnwickhill water treatment works and the other from Fairmilehead.</p>

  <p>The August results for the zone supplied by Alnwickhill show that one sample contained 101.6 microgrammes per litre of trihalomethanes (THMs). However, the standard for THMs set in the Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 1990, of 100 microgrammes per litre, is based on a three month rolling average. The results for June and July were 95.1 microgrammes per litre and 98.5 microgrammes per litre, respectively. The THM standard, based on the three month rolling average, has therefore not been breached.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water carried out 484 tests for cryptosporidium on the treated water at Milngavie treatment works between January 2002 and August 2002. One hundred and sixty-seven of these test results were positive. The maximum level of Cryptosporidium detected in the treated water over the period was 0.353 oocysts per 10 litres and this was reported on Saturday 3 August 2002.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer what the current estimated total cost is of materials being fitted in the new Parliament building and how much of this material is (a) Scottish in origin or (b) from other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-09-20.39.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80277" speakername="Sir David Steel" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0920.htm#20">

  <p>Materials for the new Parliament building are included in Trade Contracts which are let under normal competitive tender procedures. The bids made by the competing Trade Contractors for each individual works package include the costs of labour and materials, but do not give a breakdown identifying the costs of each item of material involved. The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group is therefore unable to provide information on the cost of materials over the entire project, as it is not held in the detailed format requested. He has confirmed however, that Scottish timber and stone are being widely used across the site, and that a substantial number of contracts include other materials sourced in Scotland.</p>
