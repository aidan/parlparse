  <p>Defence research contract expenditure in Scotland is not available because the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s Defence Analytical Services Agency does not calculate the breakdown of research and development (R&amp;D) spending on a regional basis. Due to the increasingly complex nature of the sub-contracting and partnering arrangements that permeate defence expenditure in this field, it is not possible to provide authoritative data on the regional breakdown of R&amp;D spending without disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>Information on reconviction rates of offenders is available from the Scottish Offenders Index, a statistical database that covers all convictions in Scottish courts since 1989 apart from those where the main offence involved was a motor vehicle or minor statutory or common law offence. A statistical bulletin based on this information, <i>Reconvictions of offenders discharged from custody or given non-custodial sentences in 1995, Scotland</i> , was published in February 2001, and is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 11876).</p>

  <p>Information on re-incarceration rates for prisoners released from custody was published by the Scottish Prison Service in January in a research bulletin titled <i>Return to custody in Scottish prisons</i>, which is available from the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 10938).</p>

  <p>Research is currently under way on recidivism amongst serious violent and sexual offenders. The outcome of this research will be reported in 2002.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>A response to this, and the other points made in the association&#8217;s Annual Report, will be sent to the association shortly. A copy will be sent to the member.</p>

  <p>Most visiting committee costs relate to the travelling and other expenses of committee members. Most committee members are members of the local authority that appointed them, and their expenses are paid by their authority rather than SPS. The expenses of other members are paid by SPS, either by the relevant establishment or from a central budget. The functions of visiting committees are clearly laid down in section 8 of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 and in the Prison Rules, which include provision for committee members to visit prisons, hear complaints from prisoners and report any matters of concern to the prison governor and the Scottish ministers. Current funding arrangements allow for these functions to be carried out and committee members are in no way prevented from carrying out their duties by lack of funds. Current financial arrangements do not compromise the independence of visiting committees, and we therefore have no plans to change them.</p>

  <p>A response to this and the other points made in the association&#8217;s Annual Report will be sent to the association shortly. A copy will be sent to the member.</p>

  <p>Section 19(3) of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 (as amended) provides that the members of visiting committees for young offenders institutions shall be appointed by the Scottish ministers. In making these appointments, account is taken of the views of all relevant interests, including not only the governors of the institutions but the chairperson of each committee. I believe these procedures work well and have no plans to change them.</p>

  <p>Each visiting committee is required to submit an Annual Report to the Scottish ministers. In addition, a committee may at any time submit a report to the Scottish ministers on any matter which it thinks it expedient so to report. Such reports are usually submitted direct to ministers by the visiting committee concerned. There are no plans to review these arrangements.</p>
