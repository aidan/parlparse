  <p>Our published efficiency guidance is quite clear. Efficiency is about enhancing value for money, improving public service delivery and raising productivity. There are two types of efficiency:</p>

  <p>Cash-releasing efficiencies are achieved by delivering an actual resource efficiency because the organisation or function delivers the same service at a reduced cost which might be demonstrated by delivering the same outcome(s) or output(s) for a reduced input, for example costs, people, procurement, assets etc, or delivering a reduced unit cost allowing an increased volume of service for the same cost.</p>

  <p>Time-releasing or productivity efficiencies are defined as efficiency measures which do not release cash but allow public services to deliver better services with the same money (for example, through workforce reform or better support).</p>

  <p>Certain types of activity do not count as efficiency gains:</p>

  <p>Cuts that result in poorer or reduced public services.</p>

  <p>Increased income from higher fees and charges to the public.</p>

  <p>All efficiencies should be supported by quality based assessments to demonstrate they are efficiencies and not cuts.</p>

  <p>This guidance is reiterated in the introduction to our Efficiency Delivery Plans. Both of these publications are available on the internet at:</p>

  <p>I attended the meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee (Europe) on 17 June 2008 where Ireland&rsquo;s decision to reject the EU Reform Treaty was discussed. I presented the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on this matter to ministers of the UK Government and to ministers of the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland and Wales.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government takes the view that the UK Government should have held a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty. It believes that the Irish referendum outcome demonstrates the impact that small member States can have and that it is important for the European Union to respect the views of all countries no matter what their size. The Scottish Government has urged the UK Government to argue for the removal of the conservation of marine biological resources from the list of exclusive EU competences and to treat this as a red line issue in any renegotiation or amendment of the treaty.</p>

  <p>While dry stone dyking is without question a key part of the rural amenity, there are other areas of extreme skills shortage. Historic Scotland is actively involved in measures to assist industry in ensuring that there are suitably trained operatives to maintain both traditional and historic buildings, and the associated landscapes in which they sit. Over the last two years officials in Historic Scotland have facilitated development of a national progression award in the conservation of traditional masonry and intend to develop similar qualifications in other key traditional trades.</p>

  <p>Presently a qualification and curriculum authority approved dry stone dyking qualification is being delivered in Scotland as part of the lantra trade certification scheme. Present providers for this qualification include Banff and Buchan College, Glasgow Metropolitan University, Barony College and Oatridge College. It is hoped that other colleges with a rural focus will take up the delivery of this qualification. Historic Scotland is also working with the Dry Stone Walling Association to develop basic technical guidance on dry stone walling as part of the Historic Scotland INFORM publication series.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that it is unusual for clostridium difficile to be an isolated cause of death, as a range of contributory factors are normally involved. Data for 2007 and 2008 is not yet available. The following table shows data where clostridium difficile was recorded as the underlying cause of death on death certificates in 2006 only, broken down by NHS board and hospital.</p>

  <p>A local authority is under a statutory duty to determine and keep under review the maximum amount it can afford to allocate to capital expenditure. This requires a local authority to determine the maximum amount it can afford to borrow, irrespective of the type of borrowing. They are also responsible for adopting treasury management policies and practices to ensure effective treasury management arrangements that comply with statutory or other requirements that regulate types of borrowing. The current statutory arrangements, together with existing treasury management codes of practice, do not indicate a need for the Scottish Government to intervene.</p>

  <p>The Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 places a local authority under a duty to determine the maximum amount which it can afford to allocate to capital expenditure. Regulations issued in 2004 require a local authority to have regard to The Prudential Code for Capital Finance in Local Authorities issued by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy in determining the maximum amount it can afford to allocate to capital expenditure. The objectives of the prudential code are that the capital investment plans of a local authority are affordable, prudent and sustainable. Borrowing, by way of bonds or otherwise, therefore falls within the terms of the prudential code.</p>

  <p>Spend on dementia and other mental health services will continue to be drawn from the record funds allocated to NHS boards and local government overall. In this respect funding is set to rise to record levels with the overall Health budget increasing from &pound;10.6 billion in 2008-09 to &pound;11.5 billion in 2010-11. Similarly, Local Government funding will rise from &pound;11.2 billion in 2008-09 to &pound;12 billion in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>Information is not available centrally for 2002 to 2005. Figures for the year ending March 2007 are available from the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) of the new General Medical Services contract.</p>

  <p>Within the QOF, GP practices in Scotland maintain registers of patients that they know to have dementia. The total number of persons included on QOF dementia registers, across all Grampian general practices, for 2006-07, was 3,275.</p>

  <p>This figure may include non-Grampian residents who are registered with Grampian practices, and may exclude Grampian residents who are registered with a practice outwith Grampian.</p>

  <p>This count may be comprised largely of patients who have more severe dementia and/or who have been in secondary care with or because of their dementia. It will not include undiagnosed cases or sufferers that have not come to the attention of their general practice. This and evidence from elsewhere suggests that the total of 3,275 included on QOF dementia registers for Grampian practices is likely to be an undercount of the true prevalence of dementia in the Grampian population.</p>

  <p>Yes, the proposals for a Scottish oil fund were based on a model that works well in Norway and in other forms in other states and indeed some regions internationally. The SNP manifesto set out the concept and broad approach. This is now being taken forward in a more detailed study within government. We are currently pressing the UK government for a fair share of the estimated &pound;5 billion plus windfall revenues from Scotland&rsquo;s oil and gas resource which would provide us with &pound;500 million to establish an oil fund. This would see the concept set out in the SNP manifesto become a reality with significant benefits for the people of Scotland. The Scottish Government looks forward to support from all parties in the Scottish Parliament for our request to the UK government.</p>

  <p>There are no plans for the Scottish Government to underwrite the cost of the trial reintroduction of beavers should insufficient funds be raised by the project partners, the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland.</p>

  <p>This trial reintroduction of beavers is a project that was devised and proposed by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. It is right therefore that these organisations should bear the cost of the project. Scottish Natural Heritage are funding some of the costs associated with monitoring the project. There was no question of the Scottish Government funding the project itself.</p>

  <p>The licence given to the SWT and RZSS includes 31 conditions. A significant number of these conditions were included as a result of an appraisal of the beaver trial undertaken by Scottish Natural Heritage in relation to the special area of conservation (SAC) and the special protection area (SPA). If the beaver trial is undertaken strictly in accordance with the licence conditions, then the trial will not adversely affect the integrity of the SAC/SPA.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in view of the fact that the beaver is protected and cannot therefore be culled, how beavers would be removed if serious problems emerge during their trial re-introduction.</p>

  <p>Guidance from the European Commission makes it clear that small populations of an animal species introduced deliberately or accidentally by man to locations where they would not have spread to naturally in the foreseeable future should be considered to be outside their natural range and consequently not covered by the Habitats Directive. Similarly, the beavers would not be protected under Scots law as they are not considered to be ordinarily resident in the wild in the UK during the trial reintroduction period.</p>

  <p>Gyrodactylus salaris (G. salaris) is a parasite of fish which requires a fish host to survive. Beavers are considered to be only potential external carriers of the parasite (i.e. G. salaris does not parasitise beavers).</p>

  <p>While in the statutory six months rabies quarantine, the beavers will also undergo a series of health checks and health screening, tests. Additionally, while in quarantine, and as an extra precaution, the beavers will have access to baths for them to swim in, containing a solution of full strength sea water. The ectoparasite cannot survive in sea water, which is why infection cannot be spread through the natural migration of fish, through the sea.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, beavers will be taken from a Norwegian population which is currently reported as being in an area free of G. salaris.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s (SNH) participation in the beaver trial is set out in the conditions of the licence. SNH is currently identifying the core elements that need to be monitored during the trial. However, although it has the key role in coordinating such work, it does not necessarily have to provide all the resources. SNH therefore intends to hold further discussions with the licence applicants, together with other parties who may be involved with the monitoring, to discuss resourcing issues.</p>

  <p>Therefore, at this stage, details of the direct, staff and ancillary costs to SNH for each year of the beaver re-introduction trial have still to be worked out.</p>
