  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-34007 by Nicola Sturgeon on 18 August 2010, what the reason was for the number of inpatient and day cases treated in the independent sector having been underreported since May 2007.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-10-05.S3W-36445.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1005.htm#4">

  <p>In order for NHS boards to complete accurate records for NHS patients referred for treatment in the independent sector and submit them for central collation to ISD, independent hospitals are required to return information to the referring board for each episode of care.</p>

  <p>It was actually prior to 2007 that information received from the independent sector was under reported and was not sufficiently complete to allow boards to generate SMR returns covering all cases that have been handled in whole or in part through the independent sector.</p>

  <p>Since 2007, steps have been taken to improve the recording of this activity and the consequent effects of this on apparent activity can be seen in the answer to question S3W-34007 on 18 August 2010. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>You will note that, in order to further improve the current recording system we are actively considering asking NHS boards to link payment for treatment in the independent sector with completion of SMR records. Payments to the private sector would then be contingent on receipt of accurate and timely case records for each episode of care.</p>
