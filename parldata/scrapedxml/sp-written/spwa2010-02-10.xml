  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions the (a) First Minister, (b) Minister for Culture and External Affairs and (c) Minister for Public Health and Sport have had with the 2014 Commonwealth Games organisers since 1 January 2009; what topics were discussed, and what the arrangements are for co-ordinating plans across local and national government in the run up to 2014.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-02-10.S3W-31104.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0210.htm#1">

  <p>Both the First Minister and I meet the Glasgow 2014 Organising Committee frequently as part of the governance arrangements that are in place to deliver the 2014 games. These meetings have a strong focus on important games issues such as financial scrutiny, risk management, integrated planning and security.</p>

  <p>There have been three Ministers for Europe, External Affairs and Culture since 1 January 2009, none of whom have had meetings with the OC in that time. The Minister for Culture and External Affairs actively supports the development of a broad suite of cultural activity ensuring 2014 provides a lasting legacy and greater accessibility for all of Scotland&rsquo;s communities.</p>

  <p>Preparations for staging the games are co-ordinated across all of the games partners, including the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council. The planning arrangements and governance structure were explained in the report published by Audit Scotland in November 2009 (Bib. number 49708) although considerable progress has been made in implementing the recommendations since the time of the study. Separately, the Scottish Government is working closely with COSLA, the 2014 All of Scotland Group and through identified leads in each local authority to ensure that plans are in place to enable the whole of Scotland to benefit from the games being held in Glasgow in 2014.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the BBC&rsquo;s recent investigation, the crime reports from Strathclyde Police and the concerns being expressed in the United States of America regarding caffeinated alcoholic drinks, whether it has consulted anyone, in particular the Food Standards Agency, on the ill effects and safety of such products.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has reviewed the evidence on caffeinated alcoholic drinks and at present there is no evidence that these products cause particular ill effects or raise specific safety concerns. My officials are in touch with the Food Standards Agency who are of the same view.</p>

  <p>We are aware of the recent call for evidence from manufacturers on the safety of caffeinated alcoholic beverages by US Food and Drug Agency. We will review their findings should they be published and consider whether further research is necessary.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to address the legislative recommendations made in Professor Sir Patrick Bateson&rsquo;s report, <em>Independent Inquiry into Dog Breeding</em> .</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-02-10.S3W-31508.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0210.htm#3">

  <p>Prof. Sir Patrick Bateson&rsquo;s report makes a number of recommendations which would involve changes to the legislation on the breeding and sales of dogs, and the Dangerous Dogs Act. Rather that take action at this stage to legislate, the Scottish Government intends to work with the Kennel Club and its Dog Health Group, which now has a broader remit, additional independent experts and under an independent chairman, to make the changes necessary to improve the health and welfare of dogs.</p>

  <p>The Kennel Club will encourage all dog breeders to participate in the Accredited Breeder Scheme, which Prof. Bateson recognised as close to the ideal model.</p>

  <p>Only if the Kennel Club are unsuccessful in their attempts to improve the health and welfare of dogs, would the Scottish Government consider legislation.</p>

  <p>The Control of Dogs (Scotland) Bill is presently making its way through Parliament. This is a member&rsquo;s bill but it has been given government support. If passed it will go a considerable way in meeting the recommendation on dangerous dogs in the Bateman Report.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>The following table shows the number of charges under Section 52(1) of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 (wilfully or recklessly destroy or damage property), where the initial decision taken by the Procurator Fiscal was to deal with the offending behaviour by means of a direct measure from September to December 2009.</p>

  <p>Court proceedings were taken for 2208 charges during the same period.</p>

  <p>The figures include only those direct measures that were affected by the provisions in the Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) database does not contain information to identify local authority areas and individual jurisdictions do not always match such areas. As a result, the information has been split by Procurator Fiscal Offices.</p>

  <p>Landfill is at the bottom of the waste hierarchy, this is reflected in the draft of Scotland&rsquo;s Zero Waste Plan where waste prevention, minimisation and recycling are given greater prominence. Nevertheless, it is recognised that the journey towards a Zero Waste society in Scotland will not happen overnight and that landfill has a continued role to play in the short to medium term.</p>

  <p>In situations where landfill cannot be avoided, recovery and utilisation of gas is encouraged. A continued incentive to recover and utilise landfill gas for electricity generation is provided within the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2009 where generation of electricity from landfill gas attracts 0.25 SROCs (Scottish Renewable Obligation Certificates) per megawatt hour.</p>
