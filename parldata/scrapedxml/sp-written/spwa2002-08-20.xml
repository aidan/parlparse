  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided the Scottish Ambulance Service with an allocation of &#163;108.783 million for 2002-03, an increase of 7.4% on last year. This allocation supports the service&#8217;s priorities for investment which include improving its operations rooms functions, introducing priority based dispatch and converting from part-time to full-time the ambulance stations in Fraserburgh, Dunoon and Stranraer. There are no current plans to further increase the allocation for 2002-03.</p>

  <p>All new building work, including alterations and extensions, which is covered by the building regulations must comply with the Technical Standards for compliance with the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1990 (as amended).

  <p>Forestry Ministers have agreed the recommendations of the Forestry Devolution Review, a wide-ranging interdepartmental review of the administrative arrangements for forestry post-devolution, which I announced on 22 January. In particular we have accepted that the current arrangements need to be updated, and that this should be implemented by administrative action. The aim of the changes would be to achieve greater integration of forestry in Scotland with other rural policy work of the Executive whilst retaining desirable opportunities for a collaborative approach to common issues.</p>

  <p>There are no central records kept of courses attended by individual GPs. However, GPs are encouraged to look at their own personal learning needs (based on the principles of adult learning), and the needs of their patients. Each GP receives an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed amount of training in areas approved by the Postgraduate Deaneries. In the future, the GP appraisal process will assist GPs to identify their learning needs with the help of trained appraisers.</p>

  <p>Tuition fees have been abolished for all eligible Scottish domiciled and EU students undertaking a full-time course of higher education in Scotland. These arrangements were introduced in academic year 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The Graduate Endowment scheme was introduced as part of the new student support arrangements from academic year 2001-02. Under this scheme, graduates will make a payment in recognition of the higher education benefits they received while they were students. These benefits include the financial support paid to the student towards his/her living costs and the public funding paid by the Executive to higher education institutions.</p>

  <p>The Graduate Endowment arrangements are distinct from the free tuition which has been available to eligible students in Scotland since academic year 2000-01. Unlike tuition fees, the endowment does not involve any payment during the course in exchange for access to provision and is set at a flat rate for all liable graduates regardless of the duration of their course of study. If the Graduate Endowment had simply replaced tuition fees, all students eligible for free tuition would also be liable for the Endowment. Around 50% of students will, in fact, be exempt from liability.</p>

  <p>Audit Scotland advises that the Accounts Commission for Scotland report <em>Temporary Measures, Managing Bank and Agency Nursing Staff,</em> published in February 2000 <em>,</em> was designed to provide a baseline reading in order that areas for improvement could be highlighted. Managers have been given a suitable period in which to make improvements, and changes in performance will be included in a report on ward-based nurse staffing which is due to be published in November. Bodies will be named publicly at this stage. The Auditor General believes that this two stage process facilitates continuous improvement.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to amend National Planning Policy Guideline 9 (NPPG9), particularly in respect of the minimum spacing distance between motorway service stations, and what action it would take if a local authority did not take NPPG9 into account in granting a planning application.</p>

  <p>Following the Review of Strategic Planning the Scottish Executive announced that all National Planning Policy Guidelines (NPPGs) would be reviewed and renamed as Scottish Planning Policies (SPPs). The review of NPPG9 is scheduled for 2004.</p>

  <p>Sections 25 and 37(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 require that planning decisions be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Planning authorities dealing with applications for roadside facilities should also consider the policy in NPPG9 as a material consideration.</p>

  <p>The Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) (Scotland) Order 1992 (as amended) requires that before granting or determining any application for planning permission in respect of creating a new Motorway Service Area (MSA) or a new development within the boundary of such an area, a planning authority shall consult the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>If a local authority grants planning permission for a MSA there is no presumption that the establishment will be signed from the motorway. This is a matter for the Scottish Executive as Trunk Road Authority. The authority is required to conclude a Signing Agreement with the MSA operator covering the level of services to be provided. Only in very exceptional circumstances will an agreement be concluded for an MSA which does not comply with the requirements laid down in NPPG9, including spacing.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to open government. Under the <em>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</em> , the assumption is that information will be released except where disclosure would not be in the public interest as specified in Part II of the code. In the case of the Prison Estates Review, all the relevant material from internal Scottish Prison Service submissions was included in the three volumes of material published as part of consultation on the Review. Material not included was either irrelevant or is covered by Exception 2 to the code, which covers internal discussion and advice. The purpose of this exception is to maintain the frankness and candour of internal discussion including internal opinion, advice, recommendation, consultation and deliberation.</p>

  <p>The Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001 offers an additional, and important, form of protection for individuals at risk of abuse. We issued press releases at the passing of the bill and the coming into force of the act, so as to give widespread publicity to the new measure. However, our main aim has been to ensure that those giving advice to the public should be aware of the Act and be able to give balanced advice on the circumstances in which it may be of help. To that end we have liased with bodies such as Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid and Citizens&#8217; Advice Scotland to ensure that they are able to give accurate advice, and have asked local multi-agency partnerships on domestic abuse to disseminate information locally. The legal professions were also alerted to the new act.</p>

  <p>We have commissioned research into the use of the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001. We do not yet have figures for court actions initiated under the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001, nor where a power of arrest has been attached. However, the research is due to report later this year and we will provide the findings to the Parliament at this time.</p>

  <p>The information provided in the answer given to question S1W-24724 was derived from a dedicated database of Social Inclusion Partnership budget allocations and expenditure. Subsequently, Finance staff in Communities Scotland discovered through routine checks as part of an overall review of procedures that there were a number of administrative errors in the database. The corrected figures have been advised to the member, the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and the Official Report.</p>
