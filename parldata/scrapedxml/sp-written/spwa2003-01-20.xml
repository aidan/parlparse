  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is a standard for accessibility to taxis for people with disabilities and whether it has any powers under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 or other legislation that can be used to require a percentage of taxis in each local authority area to be accessible to disabled users.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-01-20.S1W-33007.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80223" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0120.htm#1">

  <p>There is no threshold at the moment in relation to the number of taxis operating in Scotland which are accessible for people with disabilities. Nor are there any powers under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 or other legislation at the present time which would provide Scottish ministers with the powers to introduce such a threshold.</p>

  <p>The powers to determine the technical specifications for accessible taxis are contained in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and are reserved to the Westminster Parliament under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998. The 1995 act provisions have not yet been commenced. Once they are commenced, the Scottish Executive will consult widely on the proposals and will introduce the provisions by means of regulations using their powers under section 20 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 (as amended by section 39 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995), albeit subject to the approval of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>In the short term, section 10(2) of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 provides local authorities with the discretion to determine what vehicles can operate as taxis in their area. As such, the Scottish Executive has written to councils on two occasions actively encouraging them to consider improving the level of accessible taxis in their area.</p>

  <p>Executive officials have twice written to local authorities in recent years to update them on progress on the introduction of the taxi provisions contained in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. This is a reserved matter for the Westminster Government and as yet no implementation date for these provisions has been set. In writing to local authorities, we have taken the opportunity on both occasions to encourage them to improve the accessibility of taxis to people with disabilities in advance of the regulations coming into effect and offering advice as to how they could proceed if they decided to do so. There are no immediate plans to send out a further letter although the position will be kept under review.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why organic egg production is not currently eligible for Farm Business Development Scheme funding given that such funding has previously been available for this type of production.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-01-20.S1W-33001.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0120.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>The purpose of the Farm Business Development Scheme (FBDS) is to provide financial support to farming families to create new income generating opportunities, or to expand or improve existing diversified activities, either within or outwith agriculture. As part of this, the FBDS can support diversification into "alternative agricultural production". The FBDS does not support mainstream investments in non-diversified agricultural activities.</p>

  <p>Organic egg production is not considered to be diversification into "alternative agricultural production". Eligible projects under this measure are required to be novel or aimed towards a niche markets e.g. worm farming, or an alpaca enterprise.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the approval of FBDS applications was clarified recently to ensure equity between the treatment of organic and non-organic projects, and this revised guidance is clear that organic egg production is not an eligible measure. Conversion of agricultural land to organic status is supported by the Executive&rsquo;s Organic Aid Scheme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what additional work the closure of the accident and emergency services at the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh will create for the Scottish Ambulance Service and what additional resources will be provided to deal with any such additional work.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-01-20.S1W-32932.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0120.htm#3">

  <p>The Lothian University Hospitals Trust and the Scottish Ambulance Service have been working closely together to ensure (i) that there is a smooth transition for both emergency and non-emergency ambulance services and (ii) that the impact of the re-location of services to Little France is matched by increased resources should that be necessary to maintain the quality of patient care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service does not know what additional work will be created for it by this re-location of services. Its planning assumptions are that there will be an increase to the time spent by ambulances in dealing with some accident and emergencies and that there will be an increase in the demand on the service from some patients who may have previously "self-presented" at the old Royal Infirmary. The service will increase its accident and emergency resources in Edinburgh from 1 May 2003 - the date of the transfer of the accident and emergency services to the new location. The performance of the service in the Lothians and elsewhere in Scotland shall continue to be monitored by the service and the Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive commissions an annual report from the Chartered Institute of Housing on use of ASBOs. The latest report was published in December 2002 and is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre. The report does not include information on the time taken by local authorities to prepare an ASBO application or the costs incurred.</p>

  <p>Information is available on the time taken for the court to grant or reject ASBO applications. In the period 1 December 2000 to 30 November 2001, eight ASBOs were granted in less than four weeks, 23 were granted in one to three months, 15 were granted in four to six months and 14 were granted in six months or more. In the period 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2000, 14 ASBOs were granted in less than four weeks, 26 were granted in one to three months, seven were granted in four to six months and five were granted in six months or more.</p>

  <p>The Executive has introduced interim ASBOs in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill to provide more immediate protection from anti-social behaviour.</p>

  <p>The Executive has commissioned research from Stirling University to compare the costs of mediation and legal remedies for tackling anti-social behaviour. This is expected to report in spring 2003.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the benefits of the central heating installation programme and the Warm Deal were in 2001-02; when a report will be published on this matter, and what benefits from the programme are expected in 2002-03.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-01-20.S1W-33260.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80211" speakername="Des McNulty" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0120.htm#7">

  <p>2001-02 was the first year of the central heating programme. Central heating and insulation were installed in just over 8,500 houses. This led to an increase in the average energy rating (NHER) of the dwellings from 3.1 to 6.6. Those aged 60 or over in the private sector should benefit from annual average savings on fuel bills of over &#163;290. There should be annual average savings of over &#163;350 for local authority and housing association tenants. The measures provided will reduce CO <sub>2 </sub> emissions by 19,200 tonnes. The programme has created 150 places to provide employment opportunities for those taking part in the New Deal.</p>

  <p>The Warm Deal insulated over 40,800 homes in 2001-02, bringing the total number of houses improved under the programme since July 1999 to over 128,000. The dwellings benefited from increases in average energy rating (NHER) ranging from 0.9 for tenants of private landlords to 0.4 for housing association tenants. Estimated reductions in annual average fuel bills range from &#163;126 for tenants of private landlords to &#163;30 for tenants of housing associations. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will have been reduced by 28,900 tonnes. The programme provided around 200 places for those taking part in the New Deal. A full report, including case studies, is published today and copies will be placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and housing associations will spend around &#163;16 million in 2002-03 and will install central heating in a total of 6,400 homes. Eaga will spend around &#163;14 million this year and will install around 5,400 heating systems.</p>

  <p>The two programmes, particularly the central heating programme, are central to our aim that a warm, dry and affordable home is within the reach of all Scotland&rsquo;s households. They provide warmth and they tackle dampness, so threats to health from cold and damp are reduced. They tackle fuel poverty. We provisionally estimate that three quarters of pensioner households that have benefited from the central heating programme will no longer be at risk from fuel poverty. More detailed research has been commissioned by the Executive to determine the precise effect on the extent and level of fuel poverty. The programmes also make a significant impact on the effects of climate change by reducing emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>. They also provide quality training and work experience for those taking part in the New Deal.</p>

  <p>In summary, the central heating programme and the Warm Deal make a real difference to many people&rsquo;s lives.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is any merit in Inverness being given status as a separate local authority area within the Highlands and whether it has any plans to review the Highland Council boundary.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-01-20.S1W-32938.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80223" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0120.htm#8">

  <p>As stated in the White Paper <i>Renewing Local Democracy: The Next Steps</i> , published in March 2002, there are no plans to review local authority boundaries or the number of councils in the foreseeable future. The <i>Review of Scotland&rsquo;s Cities</i> published on 9 January 2003 identified that the prospects for Inverness&rsquo;s future are better than ever before, the city having established itself as the principal administrative and service centre for the Highlands. The wider Highlands benefits by having access to an unrivalled set of services in the region and the city benefits by the local jobs and growth its Highland Capital status brings. There is a clear and strong interdependence between the wider Highlands and the City of Inverness. The <i>Review of Scotland&rsquo;s Cities</i> made clear that cities can only be successful as part of a successful city-region and emphasised the importance of all city and regional stakeholders working in partnership. Inverness and the wider Highlands has the great advantage of having no artificial administrative boundaries to impede the development of a cohesive city-region. In that context the Scottish Executive has very strongly welcomed the recent establishment by local stakeholders, including Highland Council, of a City Partnership to address the particular needs of Inverness and its relationship with the surrounding region.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Court Service to respond. His response is as follows.</p>

  <p>The discussions between the Scottish Court Service and Scottish Borders Council on the possible use of the court buildings in Rosetta Road for court purposes are continuing. The Scottish Court Service believes that with appropriate modifications the council buildings could be used for the sheriff court. However, agreement has still to be reached with the council on the modifications required. Alternative options are under examination but it is not possible to say when the discussions will be concluded. Agreement on certain key issues has yet to be reached.</p>

  <p>Since it is hoped that court services can be retained in Peebles, the consultation exercise envisaged previously would only commence if the outstanding issues between the Scottish Court Service and Scottish Borders Council cannot be agreed. If agreement can be reached the means by which the administrative services of the sheriff court would be delivered in Peebles will be subject to discussion with interested parties.</p>

  <p>No information is held centrally on any additional costs arising since the closure of Peebles Sheriff Court. Given the low level of business transacted in the sheriff court any additional costs are unlikely to be significant.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has a range of funding programmes available to voluntary organisations, including dyslexia organisations. The Executive is currently funding two specific projects, through the Special Educational Needs Innovation Grants Programme 2002-04, to provide practical support to teachers and parents in the inclusion of children with dyslexia. The Dyslexia Trust have been allocated &#163;102,875 for a project entitled, Count Me In. This project will build on current best practice and will deliver to schools a range of tools and materials in a variety of formats. Dyslexia Scotwest have been allocated &#163;79,356 to finance a Development Officer as part of their Dyslexia Friendly Schools project. These projects aim to improve understanding and develop skills in order that the needs of young people with dyslexia may be better addressed in schools.</p>

The regulation specifies when such reports must be made, but it does not specify a timetable for any associated decommissioning. In practice, the adequacy of the progress made by each of the reporting deadlines would therefore be a matter for discussion between the Commission and member state concerned.</p>

  <p>Castle Tioram was open to the public until its ownership changed hands in 1997. The question of allowing public access rests with the owner of the monument, not with Historic Scotland. Public access could be restored were consolidation works to the monument to be undertaken and the owner permitted such access.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-01-20.S1W-32937.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80219" speakername="Dr Elaine Murray" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0120.htm#21">

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Director and Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Most listed buildings already have a contemporary use and listed building consent is the process by which necessary changes to allow on-going use are managed. The process is managed primarily by local authorities, with advice as requested, from Historic Scotland. Difficulties arise when listed buildings go out of use. In such circumstances the Scottish ministers&rsquo; <i>Memorandum of Guidance on Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas</i> encourages local authorities to display the greatest possible flexibility in considering alterations necessary to ensure a continuing future in a new use. This includes conversion to contemporary domestic use.</p>

  <p>In the case of a scheduled monument it is usually expected that the monument will be conserved in the state in which it is found. Restoration for whatever use, be it domestic, commercial or interpretative is a major departure from this. In assessing any such major intervention, consideration is given to the impact of the proposals on those aspects of the monument which lend it significance. A monument may be so outstandingly important for the evidence it embodies that nothing should be done which might compromise the integrity of that evidence. A monument may also be a significant source of artistic or literary inspiration, or may have particular resonances at a national or local level in its ruined state. The production of a Conservation Plan should identify those aspects of a particular monument&rsquo;s significance which should be safeguarded. Restoration, for whatever function, is considered acceptable in cases where such an action is compatible with this significance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to reducing the number of households, particularly households with children, living in temporary accommodation including bed and breakfast accommodation. At the end of June 2002 there were 105 families with children temporarily accommodated in bed and breakfast.</p>

  <p>As recommended by the Homelessness Task Force, existing guidance, developed in consultation with COSLA and others, requires councils to identify in their homelessness strategies how they will eliminate the use of bed and breakfast as temporary accommodation for families. The <i>Code of Guidance on Homelessness</i> makes clear that bed and breakfast accommodation should be used only as a last resort.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 introduced a requirement on local authorities to have regard to the best interests of dependent children in exercising their homelessness functions and the Homelessness etc (Scotland) Bill strengthens this reference to make clear that the accommodation provided must be suitable for occupation by such children so far as is consistent with their best interests.</p>

  <p>Through these measures we expect all local authorities to end the use of bed and breakfast for families with children and their progress towards this will be monitored closely.</p>

  <p>We will continue to discuss the delivery of this policy with COSLA and others.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-32998 today. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href-="href-"></a> <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> href=" <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> ""> <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>In 2003-04, the amount specifically earmarked for delayed discharges will rise to &#163;30 million across Scotland. This is recurring funding. No decision has yet been made about the distribution of the money for 2003-04, nor about any future years.</p>

  <p>Following recommendations made by a working group of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) in 1996, improvements have been made in the training and deployment of special constables. The eight police forces in Scotland are actively engaged in recruiting special constables. The Executive and ACPOS are also considering the recommendations in the thematic report <i>Narrowing The Gap</i> by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary published in December 2002, on how recruitment and retention of special constables could be further enhanced.</p>

  <p>Whilst the national rail network does not run into or through the Banff and Buchan parliamentary constituency, travellers from that constituency do make use of the rail network from Aberdeen station.

  <p>The Scottish Executive and Communities Scotland are funding various initiatives in Paisley to enhance community capacity building and self-sufficiency in order to make progress towards social inclusion among communities.</p>

  <p>For example, over the next two years the social inclusion partnership (SIP) has committed in excess of &#163;650,000 to fund a range of projects that will engage with SIP residents, gather information and feedback.</p>

  <p>Under the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund Renfrewshire Council is running a number of projects aimed at enhancing capacity building and self-sufficiency in Paisley. These include the provision of additional computer-based learning packages, flexible learning sessions and computer-led and internet courses in the Community Learning Centre, Shortroods.</p>

  <p>Many of the activities funded by Communities Scotland through the Wider Role programme are also aimed at enhancing community capacity building and self-sufficiency.</p>

  <p>Specific action by the Executive includes providing an additional &#163;3 million to increase the number of money advisers in Scotland and &#163;500,000 for increased central support for money advice including training, information and quality assurance. The Executive has also allocated &#163;1.5 million over three years to help credit unions with capacity building, to extend their membership and the services they offer. The Executive is also working with parties in the financial sector and others to encourage the development of new and alternative means to deliver financial services as well as ensuring existing services are accessible to people at risk of financial exclusion.</p>

  <p>Treasury figures suggest that there were over 5.4 million basic bank accounts at the end of June 2002. This is an increase over the figure of 3.3 million at the end of 2000. However, an estimated 3.5 million adults in the UK still do not have a bank account. The Executive has regular discussions with the Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers to explore what can be done to provide more appropriate and accessible products and to encourage a greater uptake of services, such as basic bank accounts.</p>

  <p>The Executive has been working closely with the insurance industry and the Association of British Insurers (ABI) in recent months on the issue of flood cover. The Executive welcomes the statement from the ABI that its members will continue to provide flood insurance to homes and businesses on flood plains. The Executive looks forward to a positive and constructive relationship in the future so that affordable insurance remains widely available.</p>

  <p>We established the Scottish Textile Forum in June 2000 to develop measures to support the textile sector and to provide an opportunity for regular consultation on issues facing the Scottish textile industry. The Scottish Textile Forum launched a three-year action plan for the sector in January 2001. Scottish Textiles is the team within Scottish Enterprise responsible for delivery of the plan and good progress is being made, for example, on training, industry image and marketing/brand development.</p>

  <p>A rough estimate of the cost of the accommodation that the media will occupy in the new building at Holyrood amounts to approximately &#163;9.7 million. I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that media companies are not presently contributing to the capital cost of the construction of the new building but one organisation has agreed to pay for late changes made to the specifications that the organisation itself instigated. Broadcasters will also contribute towards elements of the fit-out costs relating to specific communication requirements they have requested. There are at present no plans to charge commercial rent to media companies at Holyrood.</p>
