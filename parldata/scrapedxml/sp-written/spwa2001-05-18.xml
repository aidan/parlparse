  <p>I, together with Nick Brown, MAFF Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, represented the UK at this meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers.</p>

  <p>We informed the Council of the actions taken to combat foot-and-mouth disease and explained that these measures are bringing about a significant decline in the number of new cases. The Council also heard reports on FMD from the Commission and from the Dutch Agriculture Minister. In response to a UK/Dutch initiative there was a collective agreement to hold a conference later in the year to discuss the lessons to be learned from the outbreaks.</p>

  <p>The Council also heard a report from the Commission on the results of the EU-wide testing programme for BSE, and agreed conclusions inviting the Standing Veterinary Committee to extend the temporary ban on meat and bone meal beyond the end of June. With the support of several other member states, the UK secured agreement from the Commission that they would re-examine the use of fishmeal in ruminant feed in the light of their current evaluation of cross contamination risks.</p>

  <p>Turning to market-related measures, the Council considered a compromise text from the Presidency and Commission on reform of the EU sugar regime, extending the duration of the quota system for a further four years but with a review before end-2002. Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark and the UK were able to support this compromise, but others were strongly opposed. The issue will be re-examined in May.</p>

  <p>The Council reached unanimous agreement on measures to reform the cotton regime, within strict budgetary limits. The Council also adopted by qualified majority a proposal to permit organic producers to grow fodder legumes on set aside land; only France abstained in the vote on this small but worthwhile measure.</p>

  <p>The Council agreed conclusions on the integration of environmental concerns into the common agricultural policy; these will form part of a report on environmental sustainability going to EU Heads of Government in June. The Commission also reported to the Council progress with the setting up of the proposed European Food Authority.</p>

  <p>Sufficient stocks of reusable instruments are available but, with the reported risk of surgical transmission of vCJD, ENT surgeons decided to wait until supplies of single-use equipment are more readily available unless, in their professional judgment, the delay presented a significantly high degree of patient risk.</p>

  <p>A contract for the future provision of single-use tonsillectomy instruments was placed for all UK Health Departments at the end of April. It followed a competitive tendering exercise that included extensive field testing of equipment by ENT specialists across the UK. The suppliers will be Rocialle Medical and Trust Sterile Services.

  <p>Applications for consent for any new electricity generation plants over 50MW in capacity are considered by Scottish Ministers under the Electricity Act 1989, rather than under Town and Country Planning legislation. Any application for a new nuclear power station would be considered in this way, and therefore the series of National Planning Policy Guidelines does not include any advice on the development or location of such power stations.</p>

  <p>Our broad energy policy is to ensure secure, diverse, sustainable supplies of energy at competitive prices. As with other forms of generation, it would be for nuclear generators to bring forward proposals for new nuclear plant if they regarded the technology to be competitive with other forms of electricity generation.</p>

  <p>At present, around 11% of Scottish electricity demand is met from Scotland&#8217;s established hydro schemes. We expect that projects awarded contracts under the previous Scottish Renewables Obligation, once more are built over the next two years, will raise the portion of Scottish electricity supply accounted for by renewable energy to around 13% by 2003.</p>

  <p>We intend, under the new Renewables Obligation (Scotland), that this figure should increase by a further 5%, to 18% by 2010. Decisions on the yearly profile of the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) target will be taken in due course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Renewables Obligation will remain in place until 2015, while the new Renewables Obligation (Scotland) will remain in place until March 2026. The latter obligation on all electricity suppliers will be for a specified proportion of their total electricity supply, so the amount of renewable energy needed to meet it will grow if the electricity market as a whole increases.</p>

  <p>The target set for the Scottish Renewables Obligation (SRO) in 1994 was to support the development of 150 megawatts of new renewable electricity generation capacity. The latest projections from the energy regulator (Ofgem Scotland), based on feedback from SRO developers, indicate that this target should be achieved by 2003.</p>

  <p>The new Renewables Obligation (Scotland), or ROS, will place an obligation on all electricity suppliers to have a rising proportion of their electricity accounted for by renewable sources. We intend to use the ROS to raise this proportion from around 13% in 2003 to 18% by 2010, a similar increase to that planned for the UK as a whole. Previous studies have indicated that there is enough potential renewable energy in Scotland to meet economically the 2010 target, even allowing for growth in Scottish demand.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally, but the Social Work Information Review Group will consider collecting data on refuges as part of the current data standards review. The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 gives local authorities powers to provide short-term refuge for children who appear to be at risk of harm and who request refuge. Refuge may be provided in a local authority home, a home run by a voluntary or private agency or by a foster carer. In all cases the refuge must be designated as suitable by the local authority.</p>

  <p>EU nationals who leave the UK after graduating will be subject to the same collection arrangements as are used at present for Scottish graduates who leave the UK after graduating. There are procedures currently in place for the Student Loans Company to collect payments directly from graduates who are outwith the UK tax system because they live and work abroad. Under this system, graduates must provide details of their annual income to the company who will then issue a payment schedule. The company may apply penalty interest charges if payments are not made or information not supplied when required.</p>

  <p>Compulsory Purchase Procedure is statutorily prescribed. The main legislation is the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 and the Compulsory Purchase of Land (Scotland) Regulations 1976. The 1976 Regulations prescribe that notice shall be served on all owners, occupiers and lessees of the land to be acquired. Further, the proposed order is required to be advertised on consecutive weeks in a newspaper circulating in the area of the land to be acquired.</p>

  <p>Although there is no prescribed consultation procedure, there is a statutory period for the submission of objections to the Scottish Ministers as confirming authority. Any objections are considered in the overall context of the compulsory purchase order. Objections were received to this compulsory purchase order and these are presently being considered by the Scottish Ministers.</p>

  <p>In addition, last month, further final representations were sought and received from objectors and current owners, lessees and occupiers of the land comprised in the compulsory purchase order. These are also currently being considered by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer <a name="QuestionText">why the official reports for meetings of committees of the Parliament are not published within seven days of a committee&#8217;s last meeting and how the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body will ensure that committee members and interested parties have the <i>Official Report</i> before a committee&#8217;s next meeting to allow all evidence to be considered.</a></p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-05-18.37.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80277" speakername="Sir David Steel" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0518.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>The Official Report makes every effort to meet its target of publishing committee <i>Official Reports </i> as quickly as possible and to agreed deadlines. The date of the next meeting is the first determinant of priority.</p>

  <p>The importance of timely publication is appreciated, but there are periods of more intense committee activity when the number, frequency and/or duration of meetings exceed the capacity to produce the <i>Official Report </i>in time for a committee&#8217;s next meeting. To address such situations, the following order of prioritisation was devised by the directorate of clerking and reporting and endorsed by the conveners group in April:</p>

  <p>Stage 2: Executive bills</p>

  <p>Stage 2: non-Executive bills (including committee bills and members&#8217; bills)</p>

  <p>Consideration stage: private bills</p>

  <p>Major inquiry (e.g. SQA)</p>

  <p>Evidence at stage 1: Executive bills</p>

  <p>Evidence at stage 1: non-Executive bills (including committee bills and members&#8217; bills)</p>

  <p>Preliminary stage: private bills</p>

  <p>Other evidence</p>

  <p>Details of publication dates are in the official report&#8217;s production schedule, which is available on SPEIR and updated daily.</p>

  <p>There were 120 committee meetings in the 12 weeks between the Christmas and Easter recesses: the <i>Official Reports </i>of all 120 were produced in time for the next meeting of the committee. There have been 59 meetings in the four weeks from 23 April to 18 May, during which time there was a heavy schedule of stage 2 meetings. The public holidays on 7 and 28 May cause significant delays in publication, but some Official Report staff will be working on the privilege holiday on 25 May to reduce the backlog.</p>

  <p>The SPCB addressed official report resourcing in February 2000. The consequential recruitment and training processes are on target to be completed by September.</p>
