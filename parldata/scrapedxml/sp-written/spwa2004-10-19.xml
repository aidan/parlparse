  <p>The Public Sector Comparator (PSC) used in the value for money evaluation for the Prisoner Escorts and Court Custody project is given in the following table.

</table></p>

  <p>In this table, the direct SPS costs are those given separately in the answer to question S2W-9015; other direct costs are the equivalent figures for the police; overheads represent a proportion of the costs of training, headquarters functions and other central costs; and the risk adjustment results from analysis conducted in line with Treasury guidance and taking account of a range of quantifiable risks in the design, development, transition to and operation of the new service and the extent to which these are transferred by the contract. The annual total differs from the sum of the PSC components because of rounding.</p>
