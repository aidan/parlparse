  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied with the operation of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and what difficulties have been encountered since the act came into force.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-03-07.S2W-14714.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80046" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0307.htm#1">

  <p>The Scottish Executive funded a two year project to monitor the implementation of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. This was carried out by Alzheimer Scotland &ndash; Action on Dementia, working in partnership with the Scottish Development Centre for Mental Health. The project report was published on 28 October 2004. It highlighted that the act is yielding benefits &ndash; for instance, over 30,000 powers of attorney have been registered with the Public Guardian.</p>

  <p>The report also suggested that there are possible legislative, procedural and practice issues which may inhibit the full realisation of the objectives behind the legislation. The Executive has already addressed a number of issues, including agreeing in principle that free legal aid should be made available for welfare guardianship proceedings.</p>

  <p>I responded to the project report in a letter of 28 October 2004 to the Justice 2 Committee which can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1097/0005082.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1097/0005082.pdf</a>. The letter describes work in hand and in prospect to facilitate effective implementation of this major piece of legislation. It contains a link to the project report itself.</p>

  <p>We are currently taking forward two changes to section 47 of the act. The legislative vehicle for making these amendments is the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Bill. The changes will extend the authority to grant a certificate under section 47(1) to health professionals other than &quot;registered medical practitioners&quot;, provided they have received relevant training and to extend the maximum duration of a section 47 certificate from one year to three years. We hope these changes will not only reduce the workload on doctors but also ensure that all patients, regardless of whether or not they can consent, are afforded the same level and quality of treatment.</p>

  <p>There are 20 Common Agriculture Policy subsidy payments being processed outside the payment window, arising from farmers in Aberdeenshire. Of these, six are under the Arable Area Payment Scheme 2004, and 14 under the Sheep Annual Premium Scheme 2004. The payment window for the 2004 cattle schemes runs until 30 June.</p>

  <p>Recognising that some complex cases will arise, the European requirement is to process 96% of cases within the payment window and this target has been exceeded for both schemes.</p>

  <p>The review is currently underway. The review group is holding its first meeting today, with a membership assembled from relevant interests. The group is chaired by Mr Robert Brodie CB, and its remit is:</p>

  <p>&quot;To review the Cremation Acts of 1902 and 1952 (and the Cremation (Scotland) Regulations 1935, as amended) and the Burial Grounds (Scotland) Act 1855 as amended, and to make recommendations on how the legislation could be changed in order to better serve the needs of the people of Scotland. This would, where appropriate, recognise the established role of the Procurator Fiscal Service, and take account of policy developments in England (specifically the Shipman Inquiry&rsquo;s work on death certification) and international good practice.&quot;</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive funding has enabled councils and their partners to set up community warden schemes throughout Scotland which are now helping to deal with many of the problems faced by deprived neighbourhoods. The impact of these schemes is being assessed through a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation programme. Earlier pilot schemes have shown a positive impact on factors such as vandalism and fear of crime. Wardens are contributing to closing the opportunity gap by improving the quality of life in deprived neighbourhoods.</p>

  <p>To date, the Scottish Executive has provided &pound;12.8 million to 162 transport projects through its Rural Community Transport Initiative, Urban Community Transport Initiative and Rural Demand Responsive Transport Scheme to help support transport services for people who do not have access to regular public transport. Types of services supported include community minibuses, voluntary car schemes and dial-a-ride which provide door-to-door transport. These services are of particular benefit to elderly and disabled people, enabling them to be included in rural and urban community life and reducing their isolation.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are able to include community transport services in their concessionary fares schemes. They can also run taxicard schemes to help people who cannot use conventional public transport.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Scottish Executive is currently carrying out research to look at the transport needs of disabled people, collate information on their travel patterns, identify travel priorities, investigate barriers to using public transport and assess the impact of concessionary fares.</p>

  <p>Students with dyslexia in further and higher education courses may receive both practical and financial help. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requires institutions to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that students with disabilities are not placed at a substantial disadvantage. The support needs of individual students will vary and institutions strive to provide the most appropriate support to meet those needs.</p>

  <p>Disabled students in further education who have extra costs arising from their attendance at college may apply for additional support towards study and travel-related expenses (an Additional Support Needs for Learning Allowance) as part of their bursary application. All further education student support is discretionary and is administered by colleges on an individual basis, taking account of the Scottish Funding Council&rsquo;s Bursary Policy.</p>

  <p>Eligible higher education students who incur additional expenses whilst undertaking their course because of their disability are eligible to apply for additional support in the form of the non means-tested Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowance.</p>

  <p>Section 100 of the Scotland Act does not impose such a duty. The purpose of this section is to ensure that, so far as possible, there is compatibility between the Scotland Act and the Human Rights Act 1998 with regard to who would have title and interest to bring proceedings on the ground that an act of a member of the Scottish Executive is incompatible with the Convention rights and the amount of damages which may be awarded if such an act is incompatible.</p>

  <p>This section provides that the only persons, apart from the Law Officers, who can bring proceedings on the ground that an act of a member of the Scottish Executive is incompatible with Convention rights or rely on Convention rights in proceedings are victims for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention. This is similar to what is provided by section 7(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998. Article 34 requires applications to the European Court of Human Rights to be from &quot;any person, non-governmental organisation or groups of individuals claiming to be a victim of a violation of a Convention right.&quot;</p>

  <p>Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 makes it unlawful for public authorities, including the Scottish Executive, to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right. It therefore places a legal obligation on the Scottish Executive not to act in such a way, but that obligation only applies in respect of the Executive&rsquo;s own acts and does not oblige the Executive to prevent actions by third parties.</p>

  <p>The courts are responsible for enforcing compliance with Convention rights. Under the terms of the Human Rights Act 1998, all public authorities are required to act in a way that complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. Individuals whose rights have been breached by a public authority can take their case before the Scottish courts and ultimately to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>

  <p>In addition, under the terms of the Scotland Act, the Scottish Parliament and Executive are bound to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. If they do not comply, and if a Scottish court upholds a challenge, actions of the Scottish ministers and the Scottish Parliament can be struck down as being unlawful.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-12959 by Tavish Scott on 28 January 2005, what its policy is in relation to provisions to allow criminal convictions on the evidence of a single witness, in particular what criteria it uses to determine to which offences such provisions should apply, and whether the single witness provisions of the Game (Scotland) Act 1832 are consistent with this policy.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-03-07.S2W-14168.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80109" speakername="Tavish Scott" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0307.htm#16">

  <p>The Law of Scotland provides that no person can be convicted of a crime or statutory offence unless there is evidence of at least two witnesses implicating the person accused with the crime or offence with which he is charged. The rule does not require every circumstance of the crime or offence with which the accused is charged to be proved by two witnesses. The basic requirement is that the crucial features of the crime or offence, namely that the crime or offence was committed and that it was committed by the accused must be established by evidence from at least two sources.</p>

  <p>There are, however, several Acts of Parliament which provide that persons accused of contravening their provisions may be convicted on the evidence of one credible witness. These include the Game (Scotland) Act 1832 Act. In those circumstances it was thought at the time the offence was created that the public interest was best served by waiving the usual rules of corroboration. There are a number of more modern Acts where a similar conclusion has been reached, for example section 21 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988.</p>

  <p>On each occasion where consideration is being given to disapplying the normal rules of corroboration, it is for those responsible for the introduction of the statute to demonstrate why it is in the public interest that this should be done. There is no set list of criteria as the public interest will have to be considered in the particular circumstances concerned.</p>

  <p>Any review of the Game (Scotland) Act 1832 will provide an opportunity to examine the continuing requirement for this waiver.</p>

We are currently considering that analysis with a view to introducing reforms that will improve the operation of all aspects of the summary justice system, including the collection of outstanding fines.</p>

  <p>In certain types of employment, violent incidents feature as a regular and inevitable part of the work and there is a need to use physical restraint to prevent self-harm, violence to staff or property being damaged. Employment where restraint equipment is used includes police forces; prison and prisoner escort services; certain social care and mental health services; the Immigration Service; HM Customs and Excise, and the military. Airlines operating long-haul flights to and from UK airports also carry <strong>handcuffs</strong> or other forms of passenger restraint.</p>

  <p>To date, &pound;67,000 has been spent specifically on the work to bring Constructs up to accreditation standards. A further &pound;500,000 per annum has been set aside to extend the provision of the Constructs programme, once it is accredited.</p>

  <p>Prior to this work, a number of local authorities, notably West Dunbartonshire which developed Constructs initially, have resourced the programme from within the funding allocation provided by the Scottish Executive for the delivery of criminal justice social work.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. Expert advice is that it is difficult to establish diagnostic criteria for organophosphate poisoning, other than acute poisoning cases which are rare.

  <p>These cattle are registered on the Cattle Tracing System (CTS) database and issued with a Notice of Registration (NoR). These cattle can only be used for breeding purposes and milking if appropriate. Any properly registered offspring will be issued with cattle passports. In some cases the keeper will decide to destroy non-passported animals because they are of little economic value. This is regrettable, but the responsibility lies with the keeper to meet the EU deadline for registering cattle. NoR cattle are not allowed into the food chain and can only be moved under licence to be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department inspectors, as part of the Cattle Identification Inspection Regime, have a list of all NoR cattle from CTS and are inspecting holdings to ensure that any abuse is identified.</p>

  <p>The Executive is always prepared to consider well developed proposals to improve Scotland&rsquo;s railway system. Proposals should be operationally viable, offer value for money and accord with the Executive&rsquo;s wider strategic objectives. The Executive is supporting a number of projects that offer opportunities to improve rail linkage between Ayrshire, Glasgow and Edinburgh. These include increased investment under the First ScotRail franchise, possible capacity relief on the Ayrshire lines as a result of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link and the on-going Glasgow Crossrail feasibility study.</p>

  <p>Approximately 13% of the GB railway track and 14% of GB railway stations are located in Scotland.</p>

  <p>UK and Scottish ministers announced on 18 January 2005 a financial settlement of approximately &pound;325 million to support the devolution of new powers in relation to railways to Scotland. Around &pound;302 million of this financial settlement will fund Network Rail&rsquo;s Operation, Maintenance and Renewal activities in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The calculation of Scotland&rsquo;s share of GB rail network funding is based on a package of measures. One element is the Scottish share of the GB Regulatory Asset Base. There are a number of allocation methodologies which could be employed. The Office of Rail Regulation will make the final determination by the end of 2005. Based on that determination, the Scottish Executive will receive funding precisely sufficient to support the rail network in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Since 1999, women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; football has benefited directly by the amounts set out in the following tables. As with other sports supported by the Executive through <strong></strong> sportscotland, no allocations are made. Funding is awarded against set programmes and applications received. Funding under the National Coach Support programme was awarded to support the appointment of Vera Pauw, who relinquished her post in 2004. Women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; football will also have benefited from many other facility awards and the significant investment in initiatives such as Active Schools.</p>
