  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will report on the outcome of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council held in Brussels on 16-19 December 2002.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-01-15.S1W-32729.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0115.htm#1">

  <p>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels from 16 to 20 December 2002, together with Margaret Beckett, Elliot Morley (DEFRA) and Ian Pearson (Northern Ireland Office).</p>

  <p>The main fisheries business before the Council centred on three subjects: reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP); a cod and hake recovery plan, and the total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for 2003. Regulations covering all three subjects were agreed as a package.</p>

  <p>On CFP reform, three new regulations were adopted: a new framework (or basic) regulation, a regulation establishing an emergency Community measure for scrapping fishing vessels, and a regulation amending the detailed rules and arrangements on Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector.</p>

  <p>The new framework regulation allows for the continuation of the 6- and 12-mile territorial limits, relative stability (including Hague Preference) as the method for allocating quotas, and the Shetland Box. It also paves the way for the introduction of Regional Advisory Councils and multi-annual management plans. The other regulations now require the phasing out by end-2004 of subsidies for the building of new fishing boats, and adjust the payments available for scrapping of vessels.</p>

  <p>On cod and hake recovery plans, the Council deferred a decision on the Commission&#8217;s draft regulation from last December. As a consequence of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea advice calling for a total moratorium on cod and cod related fisheries, the Commission proposed an interim regulation (as Annex XVII to the TAC and quota regulation) as an alternative cod recovery plan.</p>

  <p>The centrepiece of Annex XVII is an effort control regime based on a limitation of days spent at sea by vessels catching cod in the North Sea, west of Scotland and Skaggerak and Kattegat. The regulation imposes different limitations on different vessels according to the type of gear in use. The aim is to exclude certain vessels altogether (for example pelagic trawlers) and to impose variable restrictions on other vessels according to how much cod they are deemed to catch. For example, most nephrops vessels will in practice have a 25-day limit per month, while whitefish demersal trawlers will be restricted to seven days per month. As a result of negotiations on such matters as the use of technical measures, decommissioning and steaming days, the UK's demersal trawlers will in practice be allowed 15 days per month rather than seven. The regulation also makes allowance for some flexibility in the use of such days. It allows some movement of days between months and between vessels.</p>

  <p>The intention is that this should be an interim measure, and that a more sophisticated regime (based on the earlier cod and hake recovery plan) should be agreed by the end of March for implementation by 1 July 2003. Declarations to that effect are recorded.</p>

  <p>On TACs and quotas, the Council agreed to broadly stable pelagic quotas (a reduction on mackerel but a significant increase on herring), stable nephrops TACs, and significant reductions in key whitefish TACs (such as cod, haddock, whiting, and anglerfish). The TAC reductions on cod and associated stocks of interest to the Scottish industry were of the order of 50% as compared to the Commission&#8217;s original proposals of around 65%.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Council agreed to provide financial support to Spanish fishermen and mussel and oyster growers affected by the <i>Prestige</i> oil spill. No new money is involved: the agreement involved a re-allocation of existing Spanish structural funds.</p>

  <p>The Council also agreed the conclusions of the Commission&#8217;s action plan for the Mediterranean, which will pave the way for the presentation of specific management measures for the area.</p>

  <p>In addition, the already agreed regulations for the management of deep-water fisheries were adopted as an &quot;A point&quot;.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Commission also presented its proposal for a new management regime to limit fishing effort in Western Community Waters. No decision was taken on this.</p>

  <p>On agriculture, the Council agenda covered two main areas, food safety and animal welfare.</p>

  <p>The Council reached political agreement on measures to update food hygiene rules for products of animal origin (unanimous) and EU rules covering the use of additives in animal feed (by qualified majority).</p>

  <p>Conclusions were also agreed on animal welfare in third countries and on mutual assistance between member states regarding animal welfare. The Commission reported progress on developing further proposals for the protection of animals in transport.</p>

  <p>The Council was unable to reach agreement on a proposal for new rules governing feedstuffs for organic livestock. Under the relevant comitology procedures, the Commission will adopt the new measure under its own powers in January 2003. The Commission reported on the progress of its work to develop an EU level Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming and was remitted to continue its efforts and report further by the end of 2003.</p>

  <p>The Council approved, by qualified majority, arrangements to protect the EU market from a surge in low priced cereals from Russia and the Ukraine. The Commission reported on the agreements reached with the US and Canada to establish reduced tariff quotas for certain cereals, and the Council authorised the Commission to implement the deal from the beginning of 2003.</p>

  <p>Over lunch, the Commission presented a paper proposing a number of specific reductions in tariff levels, export subsidies and domestic support which it intends to submit to the World Trade Organization in the context of the Doha Round negotiations on agriculture. The UK welcomed the paper as an important first step in the process leading up to the Cancun Ministerial meeting in September but warned that our negotiating partners were likely to press for a more ambitious outcome.</p>

  <p>Under other business, Germany reported national action it had taken to reduce levels of acrylamide in food, and Italy raised concerns over the co-existence of genetically modified and conventional agriculture.</p>

  <p>Greater numbers of people are being recognised as having autistic spectrum disorders. Comprehensive information on the number of people identified with this condition is not available. The information which is available nationally from general practices is based on a small sample only of practices, and estimates of the prevalence of relatively uncommon conditions such as autistic spectrum disorder cannot be reliably derived. As such, this information cannot be used to provide accurate projections for the immediate future.</p>

  <p>Advice on each application received is sought from Fisheries Research Services (FRS) Freshwater Laboratory, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), and Scottish Agricultural Science Agency (SASA) Pesticide Usage and Wildlife Management Group.</p>

  <p>In the last three years, there have been seven occasions when a licence has been issued in cases where SNH has advised against. In each of these cases, the advice from FRS and SASA has been to issue a licence.</p>

  <p>Extensive research on the impacts of piscivorous birds on migratory salmonids has been undertaken by Fisheries Research Services and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Results were published in <i>Fish-eating Birds and Salmonids in Scotland</i>, published in 1998.</p>

  <p>We do not have any such formal evidence. However, we know that significant predation by piscivorous birds occurs towards the end of the freshwater phase of the life cycle of migratory fish. The effect of this is to reduce the numbers of juvenile fish that emigrate <strong> </strong> to sea which, in turn, will reduce the numbers of adults that return. A reduction in predation by birds may therefore be assumed to lead to an increase in migratory fish stocks.</p>

  <p>Personal life plans were proposed as a new form of assessment in <i>The same as you?</i> review of services for people with learning disabilities. The review recommended that everyone with a learning disability who wants to, should be able to have a personal life plan, and that the local area co-ordinator will be responsible for making sure this happens.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued advice on the appointment of local area co-ordinators to all local authorities and NHS boards in October this year. This set out a framework of key outcomes for local area co-ordination, one of which is the availability of personal life plans.</p>

  <p>Aspects of transition should be addressed within current arrangements for Future Needs Assessment for Children with Records of Need so that provision for social and health care or therapies is agreed with adult services when necessary. The Scottish Executive is collecting data on all young people with disabilities to identify need and to consider potential approaches.</p>

  <p>Specific work is being done on a number of fronts to ensure smooth transition.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provided funding of &#163;180,000 through its Innovation Fund for Children's Services for projects in Ayrshire and Arran, Forth Valley and Lanarkshire designed to smooth the transition from child to adult health services for people with disabilities. The Forth Valley project produced guidelines for health professionals on smoothing the transition between child and adult services for people with a learning disability, which are available on SHOW (Scottish Health on the Web).</p>

  <p>The answer given to question S1W-32408 today, also gives an outline of initiatives in respect of people with learning disabilities. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>Yes. The over-arching review had included a series of small-scale best value reviews covering most back office services delivered by police forces. While these best value reviews have resulted in a number of efficiencies, the initial conclusion is that a wider ranging study covering all back office services is now needed. Ministers have therefore agreed that consultants should be commissioned to undertake such a study and preparations are currently in hand to issue tenders.</p>

  <p>The detailed specifications of the new Scottish Parliament building conform to Cabinet Office guidelines for a public building of this type. These guidelines, drawn up by the security services, have not changed. Heightened awareness of security issues following recent world events has made it necessary for all those responsible for applying the guidelines to follow them particularly stringently. A number of complex components of the building have been re-designed in order to satisfy the existing guidelines and in some cases it has been only possible to prove compliance conclusively through carrying out blast tests.</p>
