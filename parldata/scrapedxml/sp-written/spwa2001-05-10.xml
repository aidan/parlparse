  <p>Allocations from the Better Neighbourhoods Services Fund were announced on 15 January 2001. They were made on the basis of proportions of income support recipients in the population of local authority areas.</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council, which has the highest proportion and also the largest number of claimants, will receive additional resources of &#163;6.00/9.00/12.00 million over the coming three-year period to run three pathfinder projects. Other authorities with more than 12% IS claimants will receive &#163;2.00/3.00/4.00 million each, authorities with between 10-12% &#163;1.50/2.25/3.00 million and those between the average and 10% &#163;1.00/1.50/2.00 million. Each of these authorities is expected to run one pathfinder.</p>

  <p>To ensure that the lessons learnt from the pathfinders can be rolled out across Scotland, a further three rural authorities&mdash;those with the highest proportion of IS recipients of those authorities with a high level of population dispersal&mdash;have also been selected to operate pathfinders. These three authorities will run five smaller scale pathfinders at &#163;0.30/0.45./0.60 million each, in view of the smaller scale of deprivation in their areas. Argyll &amp; Bute will operate two pathfinders, Dumfries &amp; Galloway two pathfinders and Eilean Siar one pathfinder.</p>

  <p>The Central Heating Programme is targeted at 40,000 pensioners in the private sector and 101,000 tenants in the public sector.</p>

  <p>In the private sector priority will be given to those over 75 years of age, the elderly living alone and the disabled and the long-term ill.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and housing associations will also be expected to build priority groups into the programme for their tenants. However, as their part of the programme affects other vulnerable groups, such as families with young children, priority should not just be restricted to those same groups for the private sector. Priority will be for each public sector landlord to determine and should be structured in accordance with the varying needs of their tenants.</p>

  <p>The problems of dental access in rural and remote areas have been well documented and are well understood. Where future proposals are developed to improve the situation, account will be taken of the many comments and views already put forward. Since any proposals of this type will relate to activity by dentists, views will be sought from the British Dental Association in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Steps taken include:</p>

  <p>Scottish Dental Access Initiative grants to encourage practitioners to set up or expand NHS practices in areas of unmet patient demand or high oral health need, including rural areas and the most deprived areas where dental health is generally poor;</p>

  <p>approval of salaried dentist posts in areas where island health boards or Primary Care NHS Trusts have indicated that there are difficulties with NHS dental provision or oral health needs;</p>

  <p>a scheme whereby fees may be paid to dentists travelling to rural areas for loss of remunerative time spent on travel and to compensate the dentist where visits are cancelled at short notice; and</p>

  <p>the early years enhanced capitation scheme to encourage dentists to register and provide preventive advice and treatment to 0-2- and 3- to 5-year-olds, with payment on a sliding scale depending on the level of deprivation.</p>

  <p>My officials are also developing a scheme in collaboration with the British Dental Association for dentists to register and fissure seal the molars of those 6- to 8-year-old patients most at risk of decay and problems of NHS dental access are being examined by the Implementation Support Group for the Action Plan for Dental Services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive, like the UK Government, is strongly committed to the development of CHP. Advice and financial support is available for the development and installation of residential CHP. This assistance is available from the Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme and the Energy Saving Trust, whose activities in Scotland are funded by our Scottish Energy Efficiency Office.</p>

  <p>In addition, the UK Government has just announced a UK-wide &quot;Community Energy&quot; programme. This &#163;50 million programme will support the installation of more community heating schemes over the next two years, and the Scottish Energy Efficiency Office will be working to ensure that Scottish projects will benefit.</p>

  <p>I intend to bring forward legislation in autumn this year that will improve the energy efficiency of new buildings. Currently subject to EC scrutiny, the draft legislation, The Building Standards Amendment (Scotland) Regulations 2001, will introduce more onerous thermal insulation standards within Part J (Conservation of fuel and power) of the Technical Standards for compliance with the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1990.</p>

  <p>Energy efficiency improvements will cover the building fabric of new buildings, air conditioning, mechanical ventilation and lighting.</p>

  <p>1. The data for Scotland were published on 7 February 2001. Revised estimates were published on 2 May 2001.</p>

  <p><i>The Way Forward: Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</i>, published last June, describes the Scottish Executive&#146;s approach to improving the performance of the Scottish economy, including the service sector. This has been supplemented by the enterprise strategy set out earlier this year in <i>A Smart, Successful Scotland</i>, which emphasises the central issues for economic success: growing businesses; ensuring Scotland is globally connected, and lifelong learning and skills development.</p>

  <p>The public health impact of the fires necessary for the disposal of certain culled animals has been considered by government health departments and I would refer the member to the parliamentary announcement made on 25 April. Preliminary assessments in relation to off-farm burn sites in Scotland have ensured that the siting and size of fires as well as the nature of the combustibles used has minimised the impact on the surrounding area.</p>

  <p>The First Minister is writing today to the Convenor of Dumfries and Galloway Council, setting out the Executive&#146;s interim response to the recovery plan. This interim response reiterates the Executive&#146;s commitment to doing what it can to assist Dumfries and Galloway recover from the impact of the foot and mouth outbreak. It confirms that the special needs of Dumfries and Galloway will be recognised in the delivery of policy and in the allocation of resources.</p>

  <p>The Dumfries and Galloway recovery plan includes short, medium and long-term recovery measures. It is important that the recovery in Dumfries and Galloway is taken forward in the context of national recovery strategies. The Executive has already begun to plan for medium- and longer-term recovery across Scotland, and our approach at the local and national levels will be driven by our commitment to the development of thriving rural communities and a competitive rural economy.</p>

  <p>However, we recognise that there remains a need for further short-term relief measures to help those in Dumfries and Galloway worst affected by the outbreak. The interim response therefore acknowledges Dumfries and Galloway&#146;s special needs, and sets out a further package of measures offering both short-term hardship relief and assistance to help businesses begin to move towards recovery, which will benefit Dumfries and Galloway:</p>

  <p>A payment to Dumfries and Galloway Council of &#163;2 million &quot;on account&quot; to pay for costs incurred in controlling the disease;</p>

  <p>Additional funds of &#163;5 million, out of Scottish Enterprise&#146;s existing budget, to be allocated to Scottish Enterprise Dumfries and Galloway to assist economic restructuring;</p>

  <p>A commitment from VisitScotland to meet the ATB and other industry representatives in Dumfries today, in advance of their formal board meeting. They will discuss additional support requirements;</p>

  <p>Develop with the farming community small-scale capital investment measures designed to provide environmental and landscape benefits, which also offer work to farm employees and local contractors;</p>

  <p>Sympathetic consideration of applications from Dumfries and Galloway under European Structural Funds and other schemes; and</p>

  <p>Appointment of a Woodland Development Adviser in South West Scotland to advise on how woodland development might assist farmers and other land managers recover from the effects of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>

  <p>In addition to these short-term measures, the Executive is also already engaged in dialogue with Dumfries and Galloway to develop many of the medium- and longer-term measures contained in the recovery plan, with a view to providing a fuller response in the coming months.</p>

  <p>The main objectives of the proposed HAI surveillance system, which is the subject of work by a sub-group of the Scottish Executive&#146;s Advisory Group on Infection, are to gather and present systematic information about a range of hospital-acquired infections so that our understanding of the factors which contribute to these infections can be increased and more effective control action taken. Such action will contribute to reduced length of stay, more effective treatment, and improved health for patients moving through hospital. There are no plans at present to gather further information on the relationship between HAI and mortality: HAI is not recognised as a certifiable cause of death; there can be considerable clinical uncertainties about the degree to which an infection contributes to death, and there can also be uncertainty about the source of infections which cause or contribute to death, especially in very ill patients with a number of concurrent conditions.</p>

  <p>I am of course aware that the National Audit Office&#146;s report <i>The Management and Control of Hospital Acquired Infection in Acute NHS Trusts in England</i> gave an estimate of the numbers of deaths which it believed were attributable to hospital-acquired infections in England.</p>

  <p>There are considerable difficulties about estimating the number of deaths caused by HAI: hospital-acquired infection is not recognised as a certifiable cause of death; there can be considerable clinical uncertainties about the degree to which any one infection contributes to death, and there can also be uncertainty about the source of infections which cause or contribute to death, especially where prior to death very ill patients have suffered from a number of concurrent conditions.</p>

  <p>A number of actions are already being taken across NHSScotland, and more are planned, to increase surveillance of HAI, to establish further standards on infection control and to review compliance with these standards. These measures will help improve the ability of the NHS to counter infection, and thus to reduce the health impact of HAI.</p>

  <p>During financial year ending March 2000, 26,522 patients received inpatient hospital care in mental illness specialties in Scotland. Some of these patients will have received more than one episode of care throughout this period.</p>

  <p>Costs for the provision of inpatient health care in mental illness (general psychiatry) services are published annually in the <i>Scottish Health Service Costs</i> publication. The treatment of patients in mental illness specialties varies and is a combination of long-stay and short-stay patients. For this reason, costs are not shown per patient but as a cost based on the number of inpatient beds occupied per week.</p>

  <p>The average cost per inpatient week of mental health care was &#163;917 for the year ending March 2000 (page 28, <i>Scottish Health Service Costs - 2000</i>). These data are published on Scottish Health on the Web (SHOW) at:</p>

  <p>Information relating to the calendar years 1997, 1998 and 1999 is given in the table &quot;Drugs Most Commonly Used for Mental Health Problems&quot; published by the Common Services Agency, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 13286). The data refers only to drugs dispensed in the community and does not take into account drugs dispensed by hospital or hospital-based clinics, details of which are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Mental health problems vary widely in nature and severity and not all require the services of psychiatric or specialist mental health services. It is therefore not possible to group drugs into the category of psychiatric. The data is, however, based on British National Formulary chapters and sub-sections dealing with Hypnotics &amp; Anxiolytics, drugs used in psychoses and related disorders, antidepressant drugs, drugs for dementia and antimuscarnic drugs used in parkinsonism and related orders as these concern drugs most commonly prescribed for mental health problems.</p>

  <p>Aberdeen City Council has received &#163;2 million from the Modernising Government Fund - the maximum grant payable under the scheme.</p>

  <p>The funding will help support the AccordLink project, and in particular the Accord Card, which will provide citizens with a smartcard (a citizens&#146; service card) which simplifies access to council services. The aim is to reduce administration and improve the responsiveness and convenience of these services for the consumer.</p>

  <p>The Accord Card has already been successfully piloted in two Aberdeen schools, delivering:</p>

  <p>cashless catering, i.e. children do not have to carry money;</p>

  <p>anonymity of free school meals provision, i.e. removing any stigma attached to free meals;</p>

  <p>healthy eating reward &quot;points&quot; for children who choose healthy meals;</p>

  <p>access to library, sports and leisure facilities.</p>

  <p>Two further significant developments from the project during this year will be the issue of the card to all school pupils and, subject to commercial agreement, the facility of paying for all Aberdeen City bus journeys with the card.</p>

  <p>This is a pioneering project and the aim is to ensure that other councils in Scotland benefit from Aberdeen&#146;s experience and the support they have received.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s detailed plans to enhance Scotland&#146;s research base are set out in <i>Working together for Scotland, The Framework for Economic Development</i> , <i>A Smart, Successful Scotland</i> and the <i>Report of the Knowledge Economy Cross-cutting Initiative</i> . The first comprehensive Science Strategy for Scotland will be published later this year.</p>

  <p>As announced in November 2000, over the three-year period from April 2001 the Executive will increase funding for higher education institutions in Scotland by 14%. This will help address three key challenges:</p>

  <p>maintaining and enhancing the excellence of our research base;</p>

  <p>maximising the economic benefits of publicly funded science; and</p>

  <p>making it much easier for companies to access and use our research base in order to increase levels of research and development spending in Scottish companies, which currently lag well behind UK and international benchmarks.</p>

  <p>Further, we have committed &#163;18 million over the next three years to the Proof of Concept Fund, administered by Scottish Enterprise.</p>

  <p>In addition, research matters will be a major element of the planned Higher Education Review. That work will be informed both by advice from the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and by the outputs of the Inquiry currently being undertaken by the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee.</p>

  <p>The development of local area waste plans by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency involves consideration of the environmental impact of various management options (landfill, recycling, recovery) for municipal waste in order to identify the best practicable environmental option. This process includes an assessment of the proportions of different materials (e.g. plastics, glass, metals and paper) in the waste stream, but it does not involve a specific assessment of individual items such as disposable nappies.</p>
