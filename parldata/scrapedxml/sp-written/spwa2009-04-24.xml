  <p>School Development Scotland have contracted for 1,517 modern apprenticeship places in Ayrshire and they are currently working with training providers and employers in the area to ensure that these opportunities are made available to young people and adults who wish to undertake a modern apprenticeship.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is hosting an Apprenticeship Summit on 28 April 2009 involving a wide range of employers and other partners, including a number of representatives from Ayrshire. The aim of this event is to ensure that we work together to create and maintain flexibility and agility within the apprenticeship programme and to remove barriers to opportunity.</p>

  <p>Between October and December last year, I undertook a programme of visits across Scotland meeting with key stakeholders to discuss our national drugs strategy <em>The Road to Recovery</em> . As the EU Drugs Action Plan for 2009-12 is consistent with our strategy many of the issues discussed, such as reducing future demand for drugs, were also relevant to the action plan. I intend to report to Parliament shortly on the key messages raised during my visits and what action the government is taking in response.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The 2007-08 figures for NHS Lothian, Borders, Dumfries and Galloway and Forth Valley are for the year to end December 2007 only (see note 2 below), all others are for the fiscal year April 2007 to March 2008.</p>

  <p>2. Because monthly data are not available for January to December 2008 for NHS Lothian, Borders, Dumfries and Galloway and Forth Valley the 2008-09 figures include full calendar year January to December 2008 as well as the period January to March 2009. For these boards the figures for this period therefore under report the actual activity for 2007-08 and inflate the total for fiscal year 2008-09.</p>

  <p>3. Data on the total number of scans undertaken by NHS Grampian in March 2009 are included, but a breakdown by NHS board is not yet available, therefore the total for NHS Grampian for 2008-09 will be slightly less and the total for some other boards slightly higher, however the grand total represents the totality of scans undertaken throughout the year.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are statutory bodies with democratically elected members responsible for their administration. It is the responsibility of the elected members to ensure that decisions concerning an authority&rsquo;s expenditure plans are in accordance with good professional practice and are consistent with local strategic planning.</p>

  <p>Statute places a duty on local authorities to manage their capital expenditure and to determine and keep under review the maximum amount they can afford to allocate to it. Regulations issued by the Scottish ministers require them to have regard to the CIPFA Prudential Code. The Prudential Code sets out the responsibility for a local authority to decide how much they can afford to borrow based upon a prudent assessment of their capital expenditure requirements, and with regard to affordability and sustainability. The code specifies a range of indicators that have to be calculated to inform the judgement on affordability which includes the ratio of financing costs (repayment of principle and interest) to net revenue stream. The code does not set a maximum level as this is a matter for local decision.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are subject to inspection and regulation which includes scrutiny of the extent to which they are meeting their obligations and duties towards looked-after children. A self-evaluation guide, <em>How Good a Corporate Parent Are You?</em> by HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) will be published shortly. There is on-going engagement with HMIE, the Social Work Inspectorate Agency and the Care Commission to ensure that their inspections raise corporate parenting and gather information on each authority&rsquo;s fulfilment of its responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Since January 2007, the Scottish Government has employed a champion, to work directly with local authorities to raise awareness of corporate parenting and challenge them to improve through frequent meetings with councillors as well as the senior management teams of local authorities and partner bodies to support strengthening of their corporate parent role. Other examples of Scottish Government action include:</p>

  <p>An event on 19 March 2009 for local authority elected members to raise awareness of their corporate parent responsibilities and role in providing effective scrutiny and community leadership</p>

  <p>A recent seminar on Care Leavers and Accommodation where 24 local authorities participated in addressing the local and national barriers and solutions to the housing issues faced by young people leaving care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Enterprising Third Sector Action Plan recognised the contribution to economic growth that third sector organisations make and acknowledged that there is a need to help organisations compete effectively for public contracts. The action plan included funding for training in preparing tender documents to help third sector organisations compete for contracts. The latest phase of this training took place in February and March 2009.</p>

  <p>The action plan will also support training for public sector purchasers in the need to involve all sectors (including the third sector) in design of services, the need to use community benefit clauses within contracts where appropriate and the need to advertise contracts appropriately.</p>

  <p>A secondee from a local authority is working with the Third Sector Division of the Scottish Government and the Scottish Procurement Directorate to take this work forward over the next two years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government plan to identify the extent to which reserved contracts are being used by public bodies at present, through engagement with their representative organisations. We will then commission research to identify any barriers preventing use of the reserved procedure by public bodies and engagement with the public sector by supported businesses, in order to identify what can be done to reduce such barriers.</p>

  <p>We have engaged with Department for Work &amp; Pensions(DWP) to discuss how we can work together to increase public procurement opportunities for support businesses and how DWP can support future activity in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Following a recent video conference between the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism and Jonathon Shaw, UK Minister for the Disabled, Mr Mather has asked for an event to enable buyers from the public and private sector to have a dialogue with supported businesses, social firms and other commercially active organisations in the third sector business opportunities. We will be in discussion with British Association for Supported Employers (BASE),Scottish Union of Supported Employment (SUSE) and Remploy to arrange this event.</p>

  <p>The potential for a new railway station at Bonnybridge was specifically considered as part of the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR). However, no proposal for Grangemouth emerged from the initial option generation exercise, nor was it proposed by any stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The recommendations of the STPR are based on the most robust analysis and evidence available taking the future needs of Scotland&rsquo;s strategic transport infrastructure into account. This concluded that there was no case for additional stations to meet the strategic transport needs in the area.</p>

  <p>In addition, recent consideration by Transport Scotland found that reopening either railway station could potentially have an adverse impact on the existing rail network, such as the Grangemouth Freight Hub and the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvements Programme which are included in the STPR recommendations.</p>

  <p>As part of the meeting between the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism and the Royal Mail on 16 March 2009 the minister took the opportunity to express the Scottish Government&rsquo;s concerns about the withdrawal of postbus services in the Highlands. Royal Mail subsequently provided the minister with a copy of their earlier statement on the issue a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47923). If Royal Mail does not wish to continue with these services then Highland Council can put these routes out to tender for other bus operators to run them. Highland Council has arranged for short-term replacement services to operate until a longer term solution can be found.</p>
