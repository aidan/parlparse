  <p>The availability of psychological interventions in general needs to be increased. Work is in hand to increase the number of clinical psychologists, improve the training of other professionals who can contribute and develop best practice for the most effective delivery structures. A new 'pathfinder' workforce group for mental health will assist with developing capacity and skills on a multi-agency basis. The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme review of child and adolescent mental health services provides a timely foundation on which to base development of support for children with mental health problems. The Scottish Executive Health Department has asked the national advisory Child Health Support Group to work with the NHS and partner agencies to act on the findings and implement recommendations in that report.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the implications of the judgement by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in the case of <em>Fawcett </em> v <em>McRoberts</em> that it is acceptable within the law for a Scottish child to be taken to reside in the United States of America by a parent with residence rights and without the consent of a parent with contact rights or Scottish court approval.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of this appeal decision. The case arose following an abduction to the USA from Scotland following which the Scottish child was ordered to be returned to Scotland under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980. An appeal against this was allowed on grounds which have given rise to concern. The appeal court has since denied an application from the Scottish mother against this appeal judgment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive shares the concerns about the terms of this appeal judgment and, as Central Authority in Scotland under the Hague Convention, is doing all it properly can to support the efforts of the Scottish mother and her attorney in the USA.</p>

  <p>Normally, when an application is submitted under the Hague Convention, the requested state will arrange for the applicant to receive cost free legal and administrative advice and assistance. The United States has, however, made a reservation to this and so when an application is submitted to the USA the Central Authority in the USA will arrange for <em>pro bono</em> representation for the applicant. I understand it can become more difficult to secure <em>pro bono</em> assistance when appeals are made. Scottish Legal Aid can only be made available for proceedings in the Scottish courts and does not cover proceedings raised in the USA or other countries.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the "Stats 19" statistical report format. These returns cover only accidents in which one or more people were injured - they do not cover "damage only" accidents.</p>

  <p>The statistical system is not designed to provide the precise numbers of injury accidents at particular locations. However, estimates can be produced from the information in the "Stats 19" returns. The following table gives the numbers of injury accidents which are "at or within 20 metres of a junction" (including the relevant roundabouts), according to the "Stats 19" code for "Junction Detail".</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at a local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>Approximate numbers of injury road accidents that have occurred at, or within 20 metres of, the specified roundabouts or junctions, as recorded in the central statistical database.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have considerable powers and flexibility with regard to the introduction of 20 mph speed limits at suitable locations, including outside schools. They have power to introduce mandatory 20 mph zones, in which engineering measures are a standard feature to ensure that the zones are self enforcing; mandatory 20 mph speed limits with or without traffic calming measures, and advisory 20 mph speed limits.</p>

  <p>Local authorities also have power to introduce variable 20 mph speed limits. These can be used at times when children are going to and from school. The Executive is working with the Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland on trials of non-standard lower cost signs for variable speed limits. Trials, mainly involving variable 20 mph speed limits, are currently proceeding outside a number of schools in Aberdeenshire, Angus, Glasgow and West Lothian.</p>

  <p>The Society of Chief Officers of Transportation is evaluating the trials and a report is expected in July. The society will thereafter discuss with the Executive the way forward in the light of the evaluation.</p>

  <p>Complete main ground investigation - July 2004</p>

  <p>Publish draft road and compulsory purchase orders for public consultation (showing proposed line of the road and necessary land purchase) - spring 2005</p>

  <p>The most recent detailed estimate of this cost dates back to 1994 and totalled &#163;281 million.

  <p>On 20 March 2003 we announced funding of &#163;20 million to support development of 10 new road improvement schemes over the next three years. Three of these schemes will benefit the A9 by providing an extension of the dual carriageway section at Crubenmore; a new climbing lane at Bankfoot, and carriageway widening to provide overtaking opportunities between Kincraig and Dalraddy.</p>

  <p>In addition, we will carry out a Route Improvement Strategy Study for the southern section of the A9 to consider longer term options for improvements between Perth, Dunkeld, Pitlochry and Blair Atholl.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to conduct a public inquiry into the issue of landfill of toxic materials around Fauldhouse.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) carries out monitoring of surface water, groundwater, landfill gas and emissions in respect of various waste disposal installations around Fauldhouse, and advises that at the present time at no site falling under SEPA&#146;s jurisdiction is there an adverse impact to be ameliorated. In the case of sites for which the waste disposal or management licence expired before 31 March 1996, and which are not therefore a matter for that agency, the local authority, West Lothian Council, is responsible for carrying out inspections, and detailed investigations if these are necessary.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the local authority have responsibilities for carrying out a level of monitoring and investigation of waste disposal activities that is appropriate to the level of environmental risk, including the risk of environmental degradation hazardous to human health. For these responsibilities I refer the member to the answer given to question S2W-355 today.

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency makes an assessment of the environmental effects of waste disposal as a matter of course when exercising its regulatory duties in respect of landfill installations.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the local authority. Waste management activities are controlled by the land use planning process, operated by the local authority, and by the landfill permitting process operated by the agency. In terms of ensuring that existing or closed sites do not have adverse impacts, I refer the member to the answer given to question S2W-00355 on 6 June 2003.
