  <p>The Scottish Government is working with its delivery partners to reduce carbon emissions from the games. Specific measures include the innovative modification and re-use of venues, along with a new generation of lower carbon buildings. With the extensive promotion of active and sustainable transport and resource use minimisation, the Scottish Government intends that the 2014 Commonwealth Games will act as an exemplar for good green event management.</p>

  <p>Under the current trial refurbishment contract, 4.5 spans of the Cromarty Bridge are being repaired, with an expected cost of &pound;800,000.

  <p>Sixty-three and a half spans of the Cromarty Bridge remain to be repaired after the current trial refurbishment contract is complete. The estimated cost of the remaining repairs is approximately &pound;21 million, if the works were undertaken as a single contract lasting approximately 36 to 48 months. Alternative options may be looked at in the future to split the remainder of the refurbishment work into smaller duration contracts to avoid traffic delay over the longer period required for a single contract and to spread the overall cost over a number of years.</p>

  <p>An assessment of these costs has already been made by our operating company, Scotland TranServ and presented to Transport Scotland. The estimated cost of the remaining repairs is approximately &pound;21 million and the overall scheme cost of replacing the structure is approximately &pound;100 million. A cost comparison can be made with the new Clackmannanshire Bridge, which had an approximate final cost of &pound;120 million. Value for money has therefore been sought for Cromarty Bridge.</p>

  <p>The planned repairs at Cromarty Bridge have a design life of approximately 20 to 30 years, depending on the nature of the repair. Modern designed structures have a design life of 120 years, however regular maintenance and remedial works will be required throughout this period. Following the refurbishment repairs at Cromarty Bridge, the need for future maintenance will be significantly reduced due to the use of cathodic protection that slows down the rate of corrosion of steel used in reinforced concrete.</p>

  <p>No assessment of the economic impact to traffic delay has been made. The planned repair works are necessary to ensure the longevity and safety of the bridge and its users. Postponing the works would exacerbate the repair requirements and increase future costs. Traffic delays on the trial refurbishment contract were around 20 minutes at peak times and if journeys are planned in advance taking this into account the impact on the economy should be minimised.</p>

  <p>The &pound;70 million funding established for 2011-12 is subject to parliamentary approval of the draft budget. The Reshaping Care Change Fund will be allocated to partnerships to enable them to make better use of the total combined resources for older people. Guidance to local health, housing and social care partnerships on accessing the fund was issued on 23 December 2010. The guidance asks all partnerships to submit local Change Plans to the Scottish Government by 28 February 2011. It sets a clear expectation on partnerships to include carers and carers&rsquo; organisations, as well as other third and independent sector partners, in preparing and agreeing their Change Plans.</p>

  <p>The &pound;5 million for Carer Information Strategies (CIS) in 2011-12 is also subject to parliamentary approval of the draft budget. In the meantime, we have written to NHS health boards and to the National Carers Organisations seeking their views on the use of the &pound;5 million. The funding will however be directed towards support for carers and young carers.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to disaggregate the spend on insulation and heating, with most jobs including both types of measure. In addition to those measures funded by the EAP budget under Stage 4, there are Stage 3 insulation measures which are funded by the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not commissioned any studies looking specifically at the effects of milder winters. Climate change is one of three cross-cutting themes embedded in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &pound;50 million annual investment in strategic research programmes. These make a significant contribution to climate change issues. An additional sum of at least &pound;1 million is also invested annually in more specific climate change initiatives, including a collaborative partnership with the UK Research Councils on the Living with Environmental Change programme and the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment, which is led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on behalf of all parts of the UK.</p>

  <p>Police forces in Scotland report cases to procurators fiscal. Changes in the reporting of crime over the past five years have been driven by Lord Advocate&rsquo;s Guidelines.</p>

  <p>In terms of the actual recording of crimes, the Scottish Crime Recording Standard (SCRS) was introduced throughout all Scottish police forces on 1 April 2004. The main aim of the SCRS is to provide a more victim orientated approach that ensures greater consistency and uniformity in crime recording standards throughout Scotland. Further to this, the list of crime codes used to record crimes is consistent across all police forces in Scotland, and allows Scotland-level statistics to be created. This ultimately ensures a greater degree of comparability between forces than there was previously.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Crime Recording Standard (SCRS) was introduced throughout all Scottish police forces on 1 April 2004. The main aim of the SCRS is to provide a more victim orientated approach that ensures greater consistency and uniformity in crime recording standards throughout Scotland. Further to this, the list of crime codes used to record crimes is consistent across all police forces in Scotland, and allows Scotland-level statistics to be created. This ultimately ensures a greater degree of comparability between forces than there was previously.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Crime Registrars Group (SCRG), created to oversee change in all forces, has helped achieve a standardised approach to recording. The group consists of the eight police force crime registrars, as well as representatives from British Transport Police, the Ministry of Defence Police and the Justice Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government. The group meets every two months to review, maintain and improve the SCRS and its use and implementation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continually strives to improve the way in which crimes and offences are recorded in Scotland, and will work with all police forces across Scotland, the SCRG and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) to ensure that the rules in place ensure as much consistency and uniformity as possible.</p>

  <p>During the last five years, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland (HMICS) has undertaken a thematic inspection to review how the SCRS has developed within the police service in Scotland since 2005, and more recently, has conducted crime audits in each police force. The SCRG has responded to any recommendations published in these reports which relate to the recording of crimes and offences. In the last five years, the list of crime codes will have been updated to reflect new legislation which has been introduced within that time period. A recent example of this would have been changes to codes which relate to crimes of indecency, following the introduction of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 on 1 December 2010.</p>

  <p>The National Strategy for Self-directed Support (SDS) sets out the core values and principles of SDS. Implementation of the strategy should deliver improved outcomes for people who need support and should not lead to a deterioration in the care they receive. I have recently written to those with a role in implementation, including Directors of Social Work, outlining the importance of the values and principles of SDS. A copy of this letter is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/adult-care-and-support/independent-living" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/adult-care-and-support/independent-living</a>.</p>

  <p>A National Implementation Group is currently developing an action plan that will include consideration of the need for further SDS guidance. The 2007 Scottish Government guidance on self-directed support states that, when arranging an SDS package, a local authority should meet the cost of providing a service which is of an equivalent standard to that which it would otherwise provide. The Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 places a firm duty of care on local authorities, and SDS does not remove that.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also consulting on a draft Self-directed Support Bill. The bill seeks to enshrine choice and control through general principles that enable the citizen to choose how they wish to receive their care and support.</p>

  <p>Whilst some decisions have been taken about the allocation of the &pound;57.2 million budget published in the draft budget 2011-12, further decisions remain to be finalised. Therefore, it is not possible at this stage to confirm which aspects of the draft budget will be affected by the proposed reduction between 2010-11 and 2011-12. Final budget decisions, of course will depend on the Parliament&rsquo;s consideration of the 2011-12 Budget Bill.</p>

  <p>Food safety controls on materials and articles in contact with food are harmonised at European level and Scottish Ministers are advised on such matters by the Food Standards Agency in Scotland. European Law currently allows the use of bisphenol A (BPA) up to certain permitted levels in many plastic food packaging materials.</p>

  <p>Since 2000, the FSA has undertaken two research projects and one survey on BPA in food contact materials. In all cases the levels of BPA identified were unlikely to be of concern to health. The agency continues to keep the published evidence on BPA under review and will act to protect consumers if the evidence shows that it is necessary to do so.</p>

  <p>In November 2010, a precautionary measure proposed by the European Commission was adopted which will introduce, from 1 March 2011, a phased European Union-wide prohibition on polycarbonate feeding bottles intended for infants of up to 12 months of age manufactured using BPA. The agency has recently completed a public consultation on a draft Scottish Statutory Instrument which would give effect to this new measure, along with an associated draft Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment, and is currently considering the responses.</p>

  <p>ISD Scotland has historically classified Emergency Departments as either core or non-core sites. Core sites include all Emergency Departments within large hospitals. It is important to note that, according to this classification, some core sites are large minor injuries units, such as the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. Non-core sites include minor injuries units, small hospitals with paper-based administration systems and health centres in rural areas that carry out Emergency Department related activity. ISD Scotland has confirmed that there are 37 core Emergency Departments in Scotland, and 59 non-core Emergency Departments.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally due to the number and complexity of both core and non-core sites, as indicated in the response to S3W-38462 on 20 January 2011. It should be noted that many emergency departments work in local and regional networks to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to address demand in unscheduled admissions. As such, emergency departments may close to admissions for short periods with relevant referrals directed to a nearby facility. NHS boards have established and robust protocols in place for such activity which is largely linked to increased demand for the service, as opposed to a shortage of appropriate staff. NHS boards also have effective strategic plans in place to ensure that services are appropriately staffed and remain fit for purpose.</p>

  <p>Paediatric intensive care units in Scotland follow the Paediatric Intensive Care Society Paediatric Intensive Care Standards for staffing ratio per bed as a minimum guide. The PICS Standards state the ratio should vary from 1:1 to 2:1, depending on the level of care required. The actual level of qualified nurse per bed is set following an assessment of individual patient nursing needs.</p>

  <p>The number of new council houses started and completed in each financial year since 1996-97 is published by local authority area on the Housing Statistics for Scotland pages of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Housing-Regeneration/HSfS/NewBuildLA" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Housing-Regeneration/HSfS/NewBuildLA</a>.</p>

  <p>With regard to council houses planned by each local authority, the Affordable Housing Securing Planning Consent Survey collects data from planning authorities on planning applications that have been granted consent. Table 1 shows how many new council houses were granted consent in each financial year from 2005-06, the earliest date for which these data are available.</p>

  <p>As there is no comprehensive mechanism for monitoring planning applications, it is possible that some applications that should be recorded in the survey are not recorded at the time they are received. They may be recorded in subsequent years.</p>

  <p>NHS boards working with their statutory and voluntary partners, have primary responsibility for designing and delivering services to their local population. Psychological therapies will be delivered by different groups of staff including psychologists, nurses and allied health professionals, and NHS boards are responsible for ensuring that their workforce is trained and competent to deliver a range of appropriate therapies as part of the preparation for the target.</p>

  <p>Delivery of good quality psychological care requires that the correct numbers of well trained staff are available for career posts in psychology services across NHSScotland. NSS Information Services Division (ISD) and NHS Education Services (NES) have collaboratively collected and reported psychology services workforce information since 2001 and will continue to do so.</p>

  <p>In collaboration with Skills for Health, NES has also produced psychological therapy competence frameworks to ensure that training equips staff to deliver therapy safely and effectively. We have also funded NES to support the training of a range of staff in a number of evidenced based therapeutic approaches.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government engages regularly with a range of ratepayers and business organisations on the operation of the business rates system.</p>

  <p>As part of that engagement, at a rate payers forum meeting on 16 December 2010 involving a range of rate payers and business organisations it was agreed that the Scottish Government would remind local authorities of the need for prompt repayment, particularly when the rates liability reduces as the result of a successful valuation appeal. This led to the issue of Local Government Finance Circular No 15/2010 on 20 December 2010.</p>

  <p>As set out in that finance circular, the Scottish Government considers that any repayment of business rates should be made as soon as possible, particularly in the current economic climate.</p>

  <p>The Directorate for Planning and Environmental Appeals which handles planning appeals made to Scottish Ministers takes a number of steps to ensure that procedural errors in relation to appeals are kept to a minimum and that on the rare occasions when they happen, lessons are learned, corrective action is taken where required, and any changes required to procedures are implemented quickly. Steps taken to keep errors to a minimum include regular training for professional and administrative staff, professional peer group review, checking of letters by senior reporters, and thorough induction and mentoring of all new staff to the directorate.</p>

  <p>Statutory requirements under the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2008 (the DMR) oblige planning authorities to carry out neighbour notification and, in certain circumstances, local advertisement of planning applications.</p>

  <p>Planning authorities are required to send notice of a planning application, addressed to &quot;the Owner, Lessee or Occupier&quot;, to premises on &quot;neighbouring land&quot;. The term &quot;neighbouring land&quot; is defined as &quot;an area or plot of land which, or part of which, is conterminous with or within 20 metres of the boundary of land which the development is proposed&quot;. Local advertisement of a proposal is required where there are no such premises to which notification can be sent, it is of a type listed in the DMR as likely to have impacts over a wider area or it is a departure from the development plan.</p>

  <p>Prior to the changes in August 2009, notification was required in relation to land which was conterminous with or within four metres of the boundary of the land, excluding the width of any roads, for which development was proposed. The current requirements aim to strike an appropriate balance between having notice served on those most immediately affected by a proposal and ensuring that requirements are clear, easy to interpret and do not undermine the efficient processing of applications.</p>

  <p>The research report <em>Community Policing: A review of the Evidence</em> by Mackenzie and Henry, demonstrates that effective community policing is associated with a reduction in crime and disorder. This report was published by the Scottish Government in 2009, and is available at:</p>

  <p>There are now 17,371 police officers in Scotland. This is an increase of 1,137 since March 2007. This government&rsquo;s investment in police officer numbers has enabled chief constables to deploy significant new resources towards making our communities safer. This has helped to reduce Scotland&rsquo;s crime rate to a 32 year low.</p>

  <p>Article 81 of European Directive 2001/83 requires the maintenance of appropriate and continued supply of medicinal products by marketing authorisation holders and distributors so that the needs of patients are met. Article 81 has been implemented into UK medicines legislation through the Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations etc) Regulations 1994 (Statutory Instrument 1994/3144, as amended) and The Medicines for Human Use (Manufacturing, Wholesale Dealing and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2005 (Statutory Instrument 2005/2789).</p>

  <p>A person who has a Community Health Index (CHI) number, or who is the holder of a valid entitlement card, is eligible to buy a Prescription Pre-payment Certificate (PPC). The people most likely to benefit from buying a PPC include those with long-term medical conditions who may need regular prescribed medicines, and who are not exempt from prescription charges.</p>

  <p>Four hundred and thirty-seven thousand, eight hundred and seventy-three PPCs were sold in 2009-10, broken down as 375,627 four-month certificates and 62,246 12-month certificates. However, patients can buy up to three four-month PPCs each year and as a result we do not hold data which shows how many individuals bought those certificates.</p>

  <p>Since 2007-08, the year prior to the introduction of our policy of phasing out prescription charges, the cost of a four-month certificate has been reduced from &pound;35.85 to &pound;10, and the cost of a 12-month certificate has been reduced from &pound;98.70 to &pound;28. The number of PPCs bought has increased over that period by 160%, benefitting all that buy them, particularly those with long-term conditions, for whom the cost of prescriptions may act as a barrier to maintaining good health.</p>

  <p>This barrier will be removed in Scotland when prescription charges are abolished on 1 April 2011, subject to parliamentary approval.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce publication today of the policy for higher activity radioactive waste arising in Scotland and also the Post-Adoption Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Statement. The documents can be accessed at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/hawpolicy" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/hawpolicy</a> and <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/hawpostadoption" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/hawpostadoption</a> . Copies of the documents have also been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52310 and Bib. number 52311).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government position remains that it does not support deep geological disposal of radioactive waste. The Scottish Government policy is that the long-term management of higher activity radioactive waste should be in near-surface facilities. Facilities should be located as near to the site where the waste is produced as possible. Developers will need to demonstrate how the facilities will be monitored and how waste packages, or waste, could be retrieved. All long-term waste management options will be subject to robust regulatory requirements.</p>

  <p>The policy is not prescriptive in its approach, recognising that it applies to waste which may not be produced for decades and for which long-term management options may not be feasible at present or have yet to be developed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has worked closely with a wide range of stakeholders to shape the final policy. We will continue to engage with stakeholders in developing the strategy to implement the policy.</p>

  <p>ScotRail provides more seating capacity on the network in any year than the number of passengers travelling.</p>

  <p>ScotRail&rsquo;s obligation in the Franchise Agreement with Scottish Ministers is to allocate its train fleet and resources in the most effective way to provide passengers with a reasonable expectation of a seat within 10 minutes of boarding a train, with the exception of non-stop trains operating between Glasgow Central and Paisley Gilmour Street.</p>

  <p>ScotRail passenger numbers for each year since 1999 are published in the Scottish Transport Statistics No. 29 2010 edition (Table 7.1). A copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52250).</p>

  <p>For passenger carrying capacity I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-38371 on 20 January 2011. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>There are no set criteria for the number of daily crossings by pedestrians on trunk roads with a 60 mph speed limit related to introducing road safety interventions.</p>

  <p>Safer road design, improved speed management, continued maintenance and a better provision for vulnerable road users are amongst the steps being taken to reduce numbers of injuries and fatalities on Scotland&rsquo;s roads. Transport Scotland assesses the safety performance of the trunk road network on an annual basis by screening all locations where three or more injury accidents have occurred in a three year period and this includes pedestrian injury accidents. Further investigations are carried out and where appropriate, mitigation measures are installed.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of NHS Tayside&rsquo;s Quit 4 U project is still ongoing and a final report is due in spring 2012. Agreement was reached with the Scottish Government, NHS Health Scotland and NHS Tayside to fund Quit 4 U as a national pilot project with robust evaluation arrangements in place, to enable learning from it to be fed into policy/practice elsewhere in Scotland if appropriate. Any continuation of the initiative beyond the pilot period is a matter for NHS Tayside.</p>

  <p>The effectiveness of NHSScotland smoking cessation services is monitored via statistics published annually by ISD Scotland. There were a total of 69,882 quit attempts made/quit dates set in 2009. This compares with 51,621 quit attempts during the previous calendar year (revised 2008 figures), representing an increase of 18,261 (or 35%). Of the 69,882 quit attempts made in 2009, 26,485 were recorded as a successful quit at one month after the &quot;quit date&quot;&lsquo;, up from 20,188 in 2008 (revised 2008 figures), a rise of 6,297 (or 31%). Specific information on the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions is available from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), including health economic appraisals which emphasise the high cost-effectiveness of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions and that the cost per life year saved is well below the NICE benchmark.</p>

  <p>The monies for 2010-11, which are in local authorities&rsquo; baselines, allow local authorities to put in place support to enforce the smoke-free legislation and is specifically put towards the cost of enforcement officers who ensure compliance with the law. These officers are responsible for taking action against those managers and owners of premises, as well as individuals, who do not comply with the smoke-free legislation. However, the officers also offer support and assistance to businesses to ensure they comply with the legislation.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>With reference to my response to question S3W-37464 the budget for the smoke-free laws has not been applied separately from the budget for smoke-free legislation. This budget allows local authorities to enforce the smoke-free laws.</p>

  <p>Separately identified in my response to S3W-37464 was the specific budget for the new Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010. This budget in the main will be used to raise awareness of the measures contained in the new act, specifically among tobacco retailers but also the general public. It will also be used to produce guidance materials for the trading standards service and to set up a national register of tobacco retailers.</p>

  <p>Yes - following the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget statement on 17 November, a funding contribution has been set aside for Fastlink in 2011-12. The Scottish Government remains committed to Fastlink and are willing to contribute to the costs of a core scheme which improves bus services between the city centre, the Southern General Hospital, and the SECC, with obvious benefits for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.</p>

  <p>As a local public transport scheme, however, it is for SPT and its project partners to determine next steps. Ministers will consider properly how and when to contribute on receipt of advice from the consortium about how, and to what extent each of them can provide or source funding for their preferred scheme.</p>

  <p>Central Scotland is one of only eight UK regions to be successful in joining the Plugged-in Places programme, which will provide match funding for the installation of electric vehicle charging points. This Scottish scheme, led by Transport Scotland, is currently under way, and will result in the installation of 375 charging points across areas such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, Fife, Falkirk, Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire.</p>

  <p>The installation of these points will incentivise businesses to purchase electric vehicles, by ensuring that they have the confidence to drive and know that they are in close proximity to an accessible charging point.</p>

  <p>The &pound;3.9 million Low Carbon Vehicle Procurement Support Scheme, also led by Transport Scotland, is making grant funding available to all 32 Community Planning Partnerships in Scotland for the purchase of low carbon vehicles. This scheme is expected to see the roll out of over 100 electric vehicles in to the public sector fleet, with this increased volume of sales capable of contributing to lower capital costs for businesses and private owners through increased economies of scale.</p>

  <p>A letter was issued on 14 December 2010 to NHSScotland boards from the Scottish Government, advising on the approach to be taken where staff were unable to attend work during recent adverse weather conditions.</p>

  <p>This letter advised as follows:</p>

  <p>&quot;I expect that you will be applying your board&rsquo;s Adverse Weather Policy as usual where your staff have been unable to get to work. However, I would urge you to ensure that staff are not penalised for being genuinely unable to attend their place of work due to recent unprecedented travel disruption in certain parts of the country.</p>

  <p>I am well aware that many staff make enormous efforts to attend their work despite the atrocious conditions. However, there will be circumstances where, despite their best efforts, staff will be unable to overcome the challenges posed by travel disruption. In these extreme circumstances I would expect you to avoid penalising staff by, for example, utilising their annual leave to cover the period of absence...&quot;</p>
