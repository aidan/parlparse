  <p>We have commissioned a detailed economic and engineering study into rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports. The report is expected in September. Dependant on the outcome of that study, it will be for the local authority and/or for example BAA, which owns the airports, to seek the necessary parliamentary powers to build any railway links. The Executive hopes this can be progressed quickly. This could make it possible to move to design and construction by 2005, subject to suitable resources being available at the time.</p>

  <p>NHS local management has advised that:</p>

  <p>all clinics currently serviced by consultants based at the Beatson have been reviewed. Over the next six months, prior to substantive appointments being made, interim arrangements will be put in place so that new patients will be a priority to be seen at outreach clinics taking place within their local NHS board area;</p>

  <p>there is no formal waiting list for medical oncology and it is not envisaged there will be an impact on this, and</p>

  <p>radiotherapy waiting times are currently reducing as the new machines funded by the Scottish Executive come on stream.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to confirm that the radiotherapy equipment modernisation programme continues and it is hoped this downward trend will continue. Two new, additional, linear accelerators are expected to be commissioned during the course of 2002.</p>

  <p>Interim arrangements for the provision of oncology clinics in the west of Scotland serviced by the Beatson Oncology Centre consultants were announced by NHS Greater Glasgow on 18 January 2002. These arrangements seek to ensure that services for patients with newly diagnosed cancer, and those with recurrence of active disease, are preserved and importantly, that the timescale within which these patients are seen will not lapse.</p>

  <p>The central role of the National Waiting Times Unit is to ensure that the Scottish Executive's policy of acting to reduce waiting times and to achieve waiting times targets across the patient's journey of care is implemented successfully by NHSScotland. Patients are not currently experiencing waits for treatment at the Beatson which exceed targets and guidelines. There is no waiting time for chemotherapy treatment, and at present, radiotherapy waiting times are approximately four weeks - a reduction from seven to eight weeks over the past year. It is hoped that further waiting times reductions will be delivered as the radiotherapy equipment modernisation programme continues, with a further two additional linear accelerators in place during 2002.</p>

  <p>Local authority staff, including managers, working in residential childcare hold a variety of qualifications. Social care staff may have for example Diploma in Social Work, SVQs, relevant HNCs or the Certificate in Residential Care of Children and Young People. In addition staff might have teaching, nursing or nursery nursing, play or youth work qualifications. Some staff have no formal qualifications. Decisions about the right mix of skills and qualifications are based on the needs of the children in the different types of residential units. In future the Scottish Social Services Council will lay down such qualifications as part of its work to register staff.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made the training of staff working in residential childcare a priority for development. In addition to establishing the new Scottish Social Services Council, the Executive has established the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care to improve the training and qualification of staff and to work with the residential units to promote effective organisational development.</p>

  <p>In session 2001-02 there is a substantial increase in the numbers graduating from primary teacher training who will be able to teach in the Gaelic-medium. This is as a result of the funding 10 additional student places at Strathclyde University specifically to support primary Gaelic-medium provision.</p>

  <p>The position in relation to secondary teachers is that teacher education institutions take the positive approach of interviewing all course applicants who would be able to teach in Gaelic-medium education.</p>

  <p>Regular feedback from the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) to NHS boards and hospitals of centrally analysed local and national data about hospital infections is a key component of the new national surveillance framework announced in July 2001. Information began to be collected in October 2001. Analysed information will begin to flow from SCIEH to NHS boards and hospitals from the beginning of April this year. Local NHS managers are responsible for ensuring that information is reviewed and where necessary acted on. The new standards for NHSScotland for infection control, cleaning services and decontamination of reusable medical devices which are being introduced by the Clinical Standards Board will help ensure this happens.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for South Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning of 1998, a number of upgrading programmes have been carried out at the VI. These include the creation of improved accommodation for the Haemato-Oncology Inpatient Unit; the creation of a dedicated Breast Care Unit and new theatre accommodation and the upgrading and installation of new radiology equipment. In addition, in December 2001 a &#163;250,000 upgrade of ward 17, an acute medical ward, was completed.</p>

  <p>treated fairly and consistently, and</p>

  <p>Performance against the standard will be assessed by the Scottish Partnership Forum and local partnership forums and form an integral part of the new performance and accountability framework. Boards will be expected to demonstrate that they are exemplar employers. Employers' progress towards meeting the standard will also be informed through staff surveys, the first of which requires to be completed by the end of March 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive regards the report on the use of police stop and search powers as an important contribution to the understanding of police practice in this area. While the findings provide reassurance that the powers are being used appropriately, they also identified areas of concern including anecdotal evidence that minority ethnic and white youths appeared to be alienated from the police. We are, therefore, together with the Scottish Police Service, carefully considering the findings and recommendations in order to determine what action is necessary.</p>

  <p>This is primarily a matter for Chief Constables to consider. However, under the direction of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the Scottish Police Service is considering the research findings and what improvements it could make to improve its practice, particularly in regard to young people.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Visitor Identity Systems have been introduced to prevent prisoners escaping and to prevent prohibited visitors from entering prison. In terms of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 and the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 the Scottish ministers have a duty to ensure that prisoners are only released in accordance with the provisions of these acts. In terms of rule 78 of the Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 1994 (as amended) the Governor is responsible for the supervision of the whole prison and the control of prisoners confined therein. The Visitor Identity System is being carried out in pursuance of these duties.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why the outside lane of the dual carriageway between Tomatin and Inverness remained covered with snow and ice for the whole day on Saturday 29 December 2001 and why, on that day, the road at Daviot was blocked by jack-knifed lorries unable to negotiate the hill.</p>

  <p>Due to heavy snowfalls during the weekend of 29-30 December 2001, BEAR deployed gritters and snow ploughs on the A9.</p>

  <p>The first priority on dual carriageway roads is to keep one lane open in each direction and once this has been achieved the gritters treat the outside lanes. However, due to the heavy prolonged snowfall on 29<sup> </sup>December 2001 the gritters were fully deployed keeping one lane open. Consequently, it was not possible to keep the outside lane between Tomatin and Inverness free from ice and snow.</p>

  <p>With regard to the problems experienced by lorries on the hill at Daviot, I understand that a lorry overtook a gritter and became stuck in the outside lane. However, it did not block the road and other vehicles were able to pass safely using the inside lane. The lorry was removed soon after the incident.</p>

  <p>The variances in departmental allocations from one year to the next are due to restructuring and transferring of functions, creation of a Finance and Central Services Department, and the transfer of HM Inspectors of Schools to agency status.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Departmental allocations for 2003-04 have not yet been finalised.</p>

  <p>2. Accountant in Bankruptcy and External Relations will become the responsibility of the Justice Department and FCSD respectively from 2002-03 onwards.</p>

  <p>UK membership of the European single currency is a reserved matter. Any referendum on UK membership would be held in accordance with the provisions of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.</p>

  <p>Although the Executive would not have a formal role, bodies within its general responsibility &ndash; Scottish local authorities &ndash; would. There would be a Chief Counting Officer who would be responsible for the UK as a whole. He/she would formally appoint counting officers for each relevant area in the UK. In the context of Scotland, this is a local authority area.</p>

  <p>There are 48 Social Inclusion Partnerships operating in Scotland. The Partnerships have provided the following information on their staffing and costs for the last financial year, 2000-01. This information excludes project staff and costs and &quot;in kind&quot; provision of resources from partners but includes support staff and in some instances, development workers. In many cases costs are met from a variety of sources.</p>

  <p>There has been no discussion with teacher education institutions to improve the number of people with special needs taking part in training. The Scottish Executive is in discussion with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) regarding whether there is a need to make changes to the council's Medical Standards and the requirement to undergo medical examination to ensure medical fitness to teach. A Disability Equality in Scottish Teaching sub-group has been set up by the GTCS which will review this issue along with exploring the difficulties faced by disabled people already in teaching and those who wish to enter the profession and propose strategies for meeting these difficulties.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water Authority. The Chief Executive&rsquo;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>West of Scotland Water commissioned a survey of visitors to the reservoirs at Milngavie over a four-day period in August 2001. This showed that some 3,250 recreational users visit the reservoirs in a week, therefore suggesting between 150,000 and 170,000 visitors every year.</p>

  <p>The authority is committed to maintaining public access to the existing walkways around the reservoirs following completion of the new water treatment works such that the development will have no significant impact on the footpaths or other public areas.</p>

  <p>The authority has made considerable efforts in its planning of the new treatment works to ensure that the amenity value of the reservoirs will not be adversely impacted by the works, which will be well screened from the public walkways by trees and will be designed to have minimum visibility from footpaths used by visitors.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water Authority. The Chief Executive&rsquo;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>West of Scotland Water has been extremely proactive in its liaison with the local community regarding the Katrine Water Project - both in the consultations which have been crucial to the whole option selection process, and in the preparatory work which is proceeding ahead of the construction works.</p>

  <p>Consultation and communications activities have included a series of briefing meetings with local community organisations and groups, a series of public meetings (comprising presentations and question and answer sessions), the use of a mobile information unit sited within the community (which attracted over 3,000 visitors), the provision of regular press releases to local press and use of local press advertisements. A Community Forum comprising representatives of community councils and local interest groups has also been established to further involve the community and this recently held its inaugural meeting.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water Authority. The Chief Executive&rsquo;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>A large number of different criteria were used to consider all of the selected sites. For each criterion, the sites were measured or assessed so that they could be ranked in order of preference.</p>

  <p>The option appraisal information was used in a series of Value Management workshops to present complex information in a manageable form. Decisions were made by comparing options, identifying key trade-offs and reaching consensus on the preferred options through discussion and debate between the different disciplines in the project team (engineering, environmental, construction, operations, finance).</p>

  <p>When trying to balance the different criteria there is no analytical matrix which can simplify the site selection process. Annex D of the Environmental Statement submitted with the Planning Application for the project notes: &quot;for a project of this complexity, with its many different components and different, often conflicting, criteria, it would be difficult if not impossible to develop a robust, numerical, multi-criteria decision method which would meet the rigorous standards required&quot;. Accordingly, a variety of tools including simple ranking, rating, scoring and weighting, trade-off graphs and pair-wise comparisons were utilised to compare options and allow overall ranking of options.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water Authority. The Chief Executive&rsquo;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Water management practices have been changed within the Loch Katrine catchments. Loch Arklet and Glen Finglas are only used when possible contamination risk is low. Water is drawn from these lochs when cryptosporidium levels are below 0.03 oocysts per 10 litres for seven consecutive days.</p>

  <p>Recommended farm management improvements within Loch Katrine and Loch Arklet direct catchments have been implemented. These have been audited by the Scottish Agricultural College. Since then, however, the authority has taken the decision to remove sheep from the Loch Katrine catchment as a precautionary public health measure to minimise the risk of possible contamination of water supplies by animals. The operation of the new water treatment works at Milngavie will ensure the removal of the cryptosporidium bacteria.</p>

  <p>Recommendations made by the Scottish Agricultural College relating to the aqueducts would involve changes in farming practices in the area and we are in contact with the relevant landowners.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water Authority. The Chief Executive&rsquo;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>West of Scotland Water commissioned an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Katrine Water Project. This was undertaken by Environmental Resources Management (ERM), an internationally respected environmental consultancy.</p>

  <p>ERM followed the good practice guidance of the Scottish Executive (1999) Planning Advice Note 58 and Scottish Executive Circular 15/99. In cases where guidance was unavailable, ERM&rsquo;s considerable internal experience was utilised.</p>

  <p>Performance across a range of environmental, technical and financial criteria was assessed to identify the best overall options for the project at the Value Management workshops. The environmental team was represented at all of these workshops. The process is described in Chapter 2 and in Annex D of the Environmental Statement submitted with the Planning Application.</p>
