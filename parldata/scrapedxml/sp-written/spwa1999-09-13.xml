  <p>Maximising the take up of free school meals by entitled children is for each local authority to pursue in the light of local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>There may be a variety of reasons why entitled children do not take up the free meal offered. Each local authority or the schools themselves are best placed to investigate and rectify problems within their area.</p>

  <p>Each education authority is responsible for the nutritional standards in the school meal service which they administer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Diet Action Plan <i>Eating for Health</i> made a large number of recommendations and included nutritional guidelines for catering specifications for the public sector, targeted primarily at pre-school and school age children.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has initiated discussions with Directors of Education and progress in this area is being monitored through inspections by HM Inspectors of Schools. We will be considering the need for any further action in the light of inspection reports.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the delivery and management of the curriculum rests with education authorities and school managers. Advice is provided by the Scottish Executive which seeks to ensure that health education, including nutritional education, has a secure place within the curriculum and is included in all schools.</p>

  <p>HMI monitor school and pre-school provision and their published reports cover health education as well as various aspects of health promotion within the school. The report <i>Drug and Nutrition Education</i> <i>A Study of Provision in Schools and Community Education </i>published in January 1999 identifies good practice and areas where action is needed.</p>

  <p>What the Member suggests is essentially an insurance scheme, similar to that proposed by the fish farming industry, to be run by The Scottish Executive. We have considered this matter very carefully, and we have had discussions with representatives of the insurance industry. We have concluded that such a scheme would not be an appropriate call on public funds. Instead, as announced on 6 September, we shall be making available through Highlands and Islands Enterprise &pound;3 million per annum for three years to assist those operators directly affected by the disease.</p>

  <p>We greatly value the contribution that informal carers make to the care of vulnerable people, including those with dementia. Without their contribution, many people would need support - or more support - from the statutory services. It is not, however, possible to estimate the cost of this.</p>

  <p>The Courts already have discretion to supersede (that is, postpone) extract of decrees to repossess property if either or both parties to an action request that this be done and in considering this option, and where asked to, we would expect the Courts to take into account all the circumstances, including those of any family involved. However, I have made it clear that we are also willing to consider the case for further legislation to protect those facing repossession in Scotland should that prove necessary.</p>

  <p>Having recently received the report of the Commission on Local Government and the Scottish Parliament, we have announced the establishment of a Renewing Local Democracy Working Party. This will consider, amongst other things, what form of electoral system would be most appropriate for local government elections in Scotland. Since that has a fundamental bearing on the work of the Commission, we will await the report of that group before considering any changes to the legislation governing the Boundary Commission.</p>

  <p>The provision or otherwise of an official residence for the Secretary of State for Scotland is a matter for the United Kingdom Government. Any expenditure incurred by the Secretary of State, for whatever purpose, comes from the United Kingdom Consolidated Fund. This is in accordance with the terms of the Statement of Funding Policy, published by HM Treasury on 31 March 1999, whereby such expenditure has to be found from within the overall provision voted by the United Kingdom Parliament to the Secretary of State. This provision is intended to cover expenditure relating to the Secretary of State&#8217;s own Department and expenditure on grants that he may pay into the Scottish Consolidated Fund.</p>
