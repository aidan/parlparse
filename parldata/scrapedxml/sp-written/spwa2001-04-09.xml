  <p>The number of new staff employed by the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and the Scottish Social Services Council will depend on the number of existing staff who choose to transfer to these bodies. However, we expect that the commission will employ around 500 staff, approximately 50-70 of whom will be new, and the council will employ 30 staff, at least 14 of whom will be new.</p>

  <p>The local government settlement allocations we announced in December provided for a 6.4% increase in total Scottish Executive grant support for local authority expenditure on services between 2000-01 and 2001-02 with further above-inflation increases for the following two years. The Grant Aided Expenditure allowances for social work services for adults, including residential and nursing home care, increased by 10% to over &#163;1 billion this year. It is for authorities to determine how these resources are used consistent with legislative requirements, government priorities and achieving best value. In advance of these increases, we have provided local authorities with an additional &#163;15 million in 2000-01 for community-based services which help reduce pressure on hospital beds. We have provided health boards with an additional &#163;19 million for similar purposes.</p>

  <p>Existing guidance provided by the Scottish Executive Education Department and Learning and Teaching Scotland to education authorities and schools already emphasise the benefits to pupils&#8217; health and general well-being of providing a balanced and varied programme of sport and other forms of physical education within the school curriculum.</p>

  <p><strong></strong>Sportscotland works closely with education authorities in a number of programmes, targeted at primary and secondary schools, which aim to promote and increase the level and range of sporting and physical activity of school-aged children during and after school hours.</p>

  <p>The need to encourage positive healthy lifestyles, which would include sporting activity, is highlighted in the Scottish drug strategy, and in a range of initiatives designed to encourage positive school ethos and health promoting schools.</p>

  <p>Manufacturing industry is already supported extensively by the Executive and the Enterprise Network and we are anxious to avoid duplicating this role. However, as a result of the work in Renfrewshire, I have asked Scottish Enterprise to review whether the needs of the sector are being fully met, in particular the support provided through the Small Business Gateway. Scottish Enterprise Renfrewshire will also work in partnership with the local Chamber of Commerce to map areas of existing support against those required by manufacturers. Based on this work, Scottish Enterprise will then be able to develop remedies where gaps in provision or in communication of existing support are identified.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans for a formal national strategy. The Executive&#8217;s policies on healthy lifestyles, like smoking and diet, along with the measures being taken to improve life circumstances, will all help prevent many lung diseases.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-11657 by Susan Deacon on 5 March 2001, what action it will take to reverse the increase in hospital-acquired infections in the Ayrshire and Arran Health Board area since 1996.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-04-09.25.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0409.htm#16">

  <p>Information provided in response to question S1W-11657 relates to numbers of laboratory isolates of methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i> (MRSA) over the last five years. MRSA is one of the causes of hospital-acquired infection (HAI).</p>

  <p>Preventing and controlling HAI, including infections attributable to MRSA, is a key priority for the NHS in Scotland. The Scottish Health Plan, <i>Our National Health: A</i> <i>plan for action, a plan for change</i>, published in December last year, makes clear that every local health care system is expected to combat HAI by achieving service standards to be established by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland on infection control, cleanliness and other matters.</p>

  <p>Comprehensive guidance on infection control in hospitals &#8211; the <i>Scottish Infection Manual</i> &#8211; was issued by the Scottish Office Health Department in 1998. It recommends that Infection Control Teams should be in place in every NHS Trust. Infection control teams are responsible for ensuring that action is taken to reduce the risk of HAI, and for investigating and recommending action on incidences of hospital-acquired infection, within the overall Trust policy on infection control.</p>

  <p>It is for each NHS Trust to ensure that guidance and standards are applied effectively. Following the implementation of standards in the area of infection control within the NHS, compliance with these standards will be independently assessed under the guidance of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The work of the LHCC Best Practice Group has identified a substantial range of service improvements. Audit Scotland has also carried out an evaluation of LHCCs&#8217; range of activities. Reports from both pieces of work are expected shortly and will, together with other related work, inform what the Executive does next on this issue.</p>

  <p>LHCCs are supported through their local Primary Care Trust. When fundholding ended, the &#163;13.5 million used to pay fundholding management allowances was transferred to local unified budgets to facilitate that support. The GP fundholding scheme covered 50% of GP practices, whereas 97% of GP practices are covered by LHCCs.</p>

  <p>The &#163;8 million investment package announced last month, which is being funded from the Capital Modernisation Fund, covers two major initiatives promoted by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland. The first is to share intelligence information across the eight Scottish police forces and the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency, in line with the National Intelligence Model. This will be facilitated through the Scottish Intelligence Database. The second is to implement a Management Information System that will facilitate the tracking of key performance indicators and decision-making in response to crime pattern analysis. Both of these initiatives will be implemented on a secure national computer network, also funded within this package. An implementation team is currently studying the requirements of individual forces and the SDEA. Whilst the breakdown by police force and project is an operational matter for chief constables, the Executive will seek confirmation on the business case so that Best Value in relation to each can be assessed and subsequent performance following implementation evaluated against an agreed specification.</p>

  <p>The operation of the Glasgow Underground railway system is the responsibility of Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive (SPTE). Under Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998, the provision and regulation of railway services, which includes railway safety, are reserved matters. This covers both surface and underground railways. I understand that the Health and Safety Executive is currently conducting a full investigation into the cause of the recent accident on the Underground, and I have no plans to discuss it with SPTE.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is maintaining close contact with the UK Government about the arrangements for this conference. Executive officials attended one of two consultative seminars that were recently held in Scotland, organised by the UK Government. These were intended to inform Scottish non-governmental organisations (NGOs) about the conference and to seek their views.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also discussing with the UK Government emerging United Nations&#8217; proposals to support NGOs&#8217; contributions to the proceedings. There are no plans for the Scottish Executive to provide direct funding for attendance at the conference.</p>

  <p>We are asking the Black and Ethnic Minority Infrastructure in Scotland, as part of their advisory work in partnership with others such as SCVO, to assist with the provision of advice on the conference, potential sources of financial assistance and longer term sharing of the outcomes from Durban more widely in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The question of representation from the Scottish Executive will be considered following decisions by the UN on the overall size of government delegations and the final conference programme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the total cost was of the services provided by Deloitte and Touche in connection with <i>Proposals for a Highlands and Islands Integrated Transport Authority</i> and why the remit given to them did not include a requirement to present a case for the creation of a Highlands and Islands Integrated Transport Authority for consideration by consultees or to make any recommendations on the form of any such authority.</p>

  <p>The total costs incurred by Deloitte and Touche were around &#163;125,000. This represents good value, given the comprehensive consultation exercise and the need to analyse a very complex set of issues.</p>

  <p>The remit given to Deloitte and Touche was prepared in partnership by the Scottish Executive, the six local authorities involved in the study, and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. All the partners agreed that it was not for Deloitte and Touche to recommend a single way forward, but instead to advise on the issues to be considered by the partners in reaching such a decision.</p>

  <p>Consistent with this, Deloitte and Touche set out the case for and against establishing a Highlands and Islands Integrated Transport Authority (HIITA) and make recommendations about the form a HIITA might take; for example, that Shetland should not be included in any authority.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, <a name="QuestionText"> further to the answer to question S1W-13418 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 20 March 2001, what the results were of the consultation exercises and, in particular, whether a majority of respondents, in each case and overall, favoured or opposed the withdrawal of water rates relief.</a></p>

  <p>In June 2000, the water authorities consulted those customers benefiting from the full level of relief on water and sewerage charges in relation to their plans to withdraw those reliefs. Those customers who do not benefit from reliefs were not consulted. 11,173 letters were issued. 7,938 (71%) of those contacted did not respond. Of those who did respond, 1,682 (15% of the total contacted) believed that relief should be granted to all those in the group whose relief is to be phased out with effect from 1 April 2001, and 1,166 (10% of the total contacted) believed that relief should be granted to some members of the group. The remaining 387 either believed that none of the group should receive reliefs, or did not respond to the question.</p>
