  <p>There are a range of programmes/activities available for offenders to enable them to address their offending behaviour. Although not all offence specific, they would be suitable for domestic violence, e.g. Cognitive Skills, Anger Management, Problem Solving and Relationship Skills.</p>

  <p>The <i> National Strategy to Address Domestic Abuse in Scotland</i> , prepared by the Scottish Partnership, is applicable to NHS services in Scotland and includes a detailed plan of action and guidelines for all agencies involved in tackling domestic abuse. This sets out the expectation that health services will participate in local multi-agency groups charged with preparing local strategies and developing practice guidelines and service standards.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> set out the Scottish Executive&#146;s commitment to developing guidelines to help health professionals recognise when women are experiencing domestic abuse and to ensure that they are given sensitive support and advice.</p>

  <p>A short life working group is currently preparing this guidance, which is aimed at all health care workers. The guidance will acknowledge domestic abuse as a major public health issue and recognise its impact on the health of women and their families, particularly children. It will outline the role and responsibilities of NHS Boards and assist health care staff in recognising indicators of domestic abuse and responding appropriately. The guidance will help health boards and health professionals discharge their responsibilities to implement our national strategy on domestic abuse.</p>

  <p>The most relevant information available is given in Table 1 of the statistical bulletin <i>Domestic abuse recorded by the police in Scotland, 1 April - 31 December 1999, </i> a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17267). Incidents of domestic abuse are defined as those involving &quot;any form of physical, non-physical, or sexual abuse which takes place within the context of a close relationship, committed either in the home or elsewhere. This relationship will be between partners (married, co-habiting or otherwise) or ex-partners.&quot; The figures therefore exclude other crimes of violence committed against women.</p>

  <p>The bulletin does not present information on those convicted but Tables 1, 14 and 15 give information on the numbers of perpetrators referred to the Procurator Fiscal by police force area.</p>

  <p>The statistics collected centrally on crimes recorded by the police and persons proceeded against at court do not include information about the victims and cannot, therefore, distinguish crimes of violence against women.</p>

The report sets out progress across all strands of our Drugs Strategy, from April 2000, and it outlines further action for the future. I am pleased to say that we are making solid and steady progress in tackling this blight on Scottish communities, although it will take some time for our record levels of investment to translate into new and expanded services for drug misusers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-19385 by Sarah Boyack on 8 November 2001, how much it would cost to modify the proposed A1 expressway between Haddington and Dunbar to incorporate slip roads to and from East Linton prior to it being completed.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-18697 on 26 October 2001. If slip roads could be included within the proposed contract as the result of a successful promotion of a further Variation Scheme, then the costs of including the work in the new contract could fall in the range of &#163;2 to &#163;6 million, depending on the impact of the change of contract specification on the contractors operations.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-18695 by Sarah Boyack on 26 October 2001, whether the delay to the start of the construction of the proposed A1 expressway between Haddington and Dunbar would be any longer than it currently is expected to be if a local public inquiry was held.</p>

  <p>Yes, a public local inquiry would result in a 12 to 18 month delay to the present rate of progress.</p>

  <p>The A8000 is a local road and therefore the responsibility of City of Edinburgh Council. I understand that the council will be holding public exhibitions of its plans beginning on 4 December at Kirkliston, and moving on to South Queensferry and Edinburgh before Christmas. Progress thereafter will depend on public reaction to the plans and the necessary Compulsory Purchase and Roads Orders.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the latest estimates are of the increase in traffic flows on the A8000 that will result from the opening of a ferry route from Rosyth to the continent in each year from its opening until 2010.</p>

  <p>Expected traffic flows on this local road will be a factor considered by City of Edinburgh Council as part of its plans for improvement of the road. However, information provided to the Executive in confidence as part of the application for freight facilities grant suggests that ferry traffic will have a minimal impact on this road.</p>

  <p>The A90 between the Forth Road Bridge and Barnton is classified as a local road. Plans to improve or upgrade that section of road are therefore matters for the City of Edinburgh Council.</p>
