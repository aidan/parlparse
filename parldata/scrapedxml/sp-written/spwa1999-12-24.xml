  <p>The Hamilton Child Safety Initiative was launched in October 1997 by Strathclyde Police in partnership with South Lanarkshire Council in three areas of Hamilton. Following a positive response from the local community supported by research, Strathclyde Police extended the Initiative in 1998 to cover the rest of Hamilton. The Scottish Executive endorses the previous administration&#8217;s strong support for this and other initiatives which are intended to increase the protection of our children and communities. As with the Hamilton Initiative, decisions to undertake initiatives of this kind in other areas of Scotland would be made by Chief Constables in consultation with local authorities and others with an interest.</p>

  <p>Meat products are defined in EC law and the current labelling requirements are largely harmonised at EC level. These requirements are implemented in Scotland by the Food Labelling Regulations 1996. While it is not compulsory to provide the particulars of country of origin or provenance of the food, this information is required if failure to give it might mislead the purchaser to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the food. Catering establishments are, however, exempt from this requirement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued a consultation paper on 27 October seeking views from interested parties on a proposal to amend the Guidance Notes on the Food Labelling Regulations. The consultation aims to clarify and strengthen the guidance on labelling to allow the true origin of foodstuffs to be traceable. No change to the Regulations themselves is proposed. Responses to the consultation exercise, which ended on 14 December, are now being considered.</p>

  <p>Oil revenues, like other taxes and duties, are pooled at a UK level and the aggregate pooled revenues are then distributed in accordance with relative need. As is clear from the latest edition of <i>Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland</i> , covering the years to 1997-98, (published on 13 December), Scotland benefits significantly from this pooling arrangement and the Executive has no plans to propose changes to it.</p>

  <p>Mr Rafferty will receive what he is due under the terms of his contract of employment. A copy of the model contract for Special Advisers is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICE).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the accommodation booking module of the Ossian Project was originally planned to be introduced in February 1999; when it will be introduced; whether there will be a consequential delay in the implementation of the proposed Tourist Information Centres (TICs) accommodation booking system, and when all TICs will become operational to employ the Ossian accommodation booking system.</p>

  <p>It has been possible to book accommodation using the Ossian database since August 1999. Pre-payment using e-commerce will be piloted during the first quarter of 2000. The full system will then be available to all ATB members who wish to use it. TICs will also be able to provide a booking and payment service to their customers. Each ATB is responsible for their own TIC connection schedules, therefore timescales for delivery in each area will vary.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it will issue a formal response to <i>The Road Ahead</i> consultation process about the review of future management and maintenance arrangements for Scottish trunk roads.</p>

  <p>As part of the process of considering how the Scottish trunk road network should be managed and maintained when the current contracts come to an end in April 2001, a consultation document <i>The Road Ahead</i> was issued on 14 April 1999. This sought the views of local authorities, and private sector and other interested bodies, on how effective the current arrangements had been, and on future options. 175 copies of the document were issued and 71 responses received by the closing date of 30 June 1999.</p>

  <p>Having considered carefully the views expressed, I have decided that four new generation Operating Company contracts will be put in place to cover the full Scottish motorway and trunk road network. The contract period will be five years 2001-06, with the option of a two year extension.</p>

  <p>The tendering process for these contracts will be commenced immediately.</p>
