  <p>I will bring forward a revised draft Order taking account of the responses to the consultation earlier this year. The draft Order which will be subject to further consultation will be accompanied by draft guidance and a regulatory impact assessment.</p>

  <p>The greatest issue raised in the November 2006 consultation concerned the holding of agricultural shows and the land used for these shows to lie vacant for a period of 27 days both before and after the event. Whilst the veterinary rationale for this proposal is soundly based, I acknowledge that any new arrangements must be both practical and flexible enough to accommodate the needs of these rural events. Accordingly, this proposal is to be revised to allow farmers who let their land for such events the option, after the show, of either observing this clear period or, alternatively, of restocking the land immediately after the show subject to the returned livestock complying with a 13 movement day standstill. This proposal has already been conveyed to the industry.</p>

  <p>Dementia is a national priority and we place great importance on support services for dementia sufferers.</p>

  <p>Following publication of the Mental Welfare Commission Report Older and Wiser - Findings from our unannounced visits to NHS continuing care ward (Bib. number 42946). I have asked the NHS boards to provide action plans that set out how they will ensure that all services meet the standards of the best service as identified in that report. Dementia is a national priority and we place great importance on support services for dementia sufferers.</p>

  <p>We also have two timetabled commitments directed at further improving services for those with dementia and their carers. These include a pilot programme on how best to improve dementia services (2008) and the development of standards for an Integrated Care Pathway for dementia (end 2007). Additional general mental health timetabled initiatives including work on reducing readmissions, improving physical health; better crisis responses and improving the physical health of those with mental illness will also have a positive impact.</p>

  <p>In addition, we provide financial support for a range of voluntary sector dementia services, including the Dementia Services Development Centre and Alzheimer Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 places a duty on health boards and local authorities to secure the provision of appropriate independent advocacy services for all people with mental disorders, including those with dementia. Through the implementation review process the Scottish Government is actively monitoring the provision of advocacy services for all client groups. We also fund the Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance, which promotes and supports advocacy services throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to review this decision. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) is the body which reviews decisions by National Institute and Clinical Excellence (NICE) with regard to their applicability in Scotland. In this case, NHS QIS endorsed the position stated by NICE that these drugs are recommended for the treatment of moderate dementia in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>

It will be important to consider the findings of the review, which is expected to report in late summer, before taking any decisions on the basis of funding of the Care Commission.

As part of that work, guidance was issued in April 2007 to local authorities and their partners, with specific reference to identifying and meeting the needs of people who are deafblind. Local authorities have been asked to provide information about identification, assessment and service provision by 1 September 2007.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are expected to implement the NICE guidance on the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (NICE Technology Appraisal Guidance No.57). The Diabetes Action Plan (June 2006) included a commitment to publish figures on the extent of insulin pump usage in Scotland and placed a requirement on each NHS Board&rsquo;s Diabetes Managed Clinical Networks to produce an &quot;insulin strategy&quot; for their area.</p>

  <p>The following table, which has been compiled from information supplied by the Diabetes Managed Clinical Networks, sets out the number of people with diabetes using an insulin pump in February 2007 in each NHS board area. An earlier survey undertaken in June 2006 reported a total of 160 people in Scotland using a pump.</p>

  <p>The SIGN Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults (Guideline 70) and in children and young people (Guideline 81) set out the best evidence relating to the management of epilepsy. NHS boards are expected to implement these Guidelines through local protocols.</p>

  <p>Epilepsy is one of the conditions covered in the Quality &amp; Outcomes Framework of the new GMS contract, and this incentivises general practices to maintain a register of people with epilepsy and to review their management on a regular basis.</p>

  <p>In conjunction with Epilepsy Scotland, we have encouraged the development of epilepsy Managed Clinical Networks as a way of promoting the integration of services across primary, secondary and tertiary care. The Networks use the SIGN Guidelines as their evidence base, and also give a strong voice in the development of services to those with epilepsy and their families and carers.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland has been undertaking preliminary work on the provision of neurological services in Scotland which will lead to the development of standards for services for all neurological conditions, including epilepsy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government understands the importance of providing the best possible information to people with epilepsy, especially at the time of diagnosis. Improved access to better information and education on epilepsy helps to achieve our aim of making people, together with their families and carers, equal partners in their own care, especially by promoting self-care. Such information can also be used to help to promote understanding and tolerance and combat the prejudice that people with epilepsy can experience.</p>

  <p>We have provided funding to enable Epilepsy Scotland to develop and publish a wide range of literature to inform and educate people with epilepsy and help them manage their condition more effectively. Most recently, Epilepsy Scotland used part of this funding to develop a series of accessible leaflets written for people with learning difficulties, or for people for whom English is not their first language.</p>

  <p><em>A</em> <em>Guide for Teachers on How to Manage Epilepsy</em> and a <em>Parents guide to epilepsy</em> were distributed to all Scottish schools to raise awareness of the condition in October 2006. These leaflets are also available on Epilepsy Scotland&rsquo;s website.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 places duties on education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of children for whose school education they are responsible and introduces new rights for parents and young people.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has also provided Epilepsy Scotland with funding to develop a new information leaflet for employers which aims to give them a better understanding of epilepsy in the workplace and outlines their legal responsibilities in terms of supporting employees with epilepsy.</p>

  <p>The Sex Discrimination (Public Authorities) (Statutory Duties) (Scotland) Order 2007 places a specific duty on Scottish ministers to set out priority areas for the advancement of gender equality by public authorities in Scotland. In order to meet this duty, the Scottish Government is considering the process for formulating these priority areas. This process will include consulting all relevant stakeholders including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, individual public authorities, voluntary sector, trade unions and organisations for women and men. We will also work with the Equal Opportunities Commission and, from October 2007 the Commission for Equality and Human Rights, in consulting on and subsequently setting out Scottish ministers&rsquo; priority areas for gender equality.</p>

  <p>NHS Borders is responsible for providing out-of-hours primary care services in its locality. Out-of-hours services must meet the standards and criteria laid down by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS). These require the new out-of-hours arrangements to be accessible, available and acceptable to patients or their representatives. NHS QIS works closely with NHS boards to ensure that services are delivered against these standards.</p>

  <p>Disclosure Scotland, who carry out criminal record checks on behalf of Scottish ministers, do not have access to information about the criminal records of foreign workers before they enter the United Kingdom. It is the responsibility of the person concerned to provide information from her or his home country if that is sought by an employer.</p>

  <p>From 1 January 2008 it will no longer be possible to operate a livestock improvement scheme for crofters which complies with the State Aid guidelines. However, it may be possible to take advantage of the <em>de minimis</em> provisions for aids to agriculture to enable support to continue and I am actively pursuing that issue. Expenditure which is <em>de minimis</em> does not need to comply with the guidelines.</p>

  <p>The present <em>de minimis</em> limit would require that the cumulative total amount of unapproved aid per agricultural enterprise should not exceed 3,000 Euros (around &pound;2,000) in a three year period. The European Commission proposes to double that limit to 6,000 Euros in a three year period from 1 January 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not have plans in place to legislate to establish a commissioner for older people. However, as set out in <em>All Our Futures; Planning for a</em> <em>Scotland with an Ageing Population</em> we will establish a broadly based National Forum on Ageing. The forum will act as a champion for older people by progressing an agreed vision including;</p>

  <p>Age is not used to define or make assumptions about the role, value or potential of an individual</p>

  <p>Older people have access to public services which are people-centred, accessible and joined up, and can access quality services appropriate to their needs, when and where they are required.</p>

  <p>The Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) will be established in October 2007, bringing together the six equality strands, including age, into a single equality body.</p>

  <p>At 10 June 2007, there were 135 people in the NHS Lothian area registered with UK Transplant as waiting for an organ. The figure includes 25 people who are currently suspended from the list, which means that they have been removed from the list temporarily, for a reason such as having become too ill to undergo the operation, or being away on holiday.</p>

  <p>The most common organ requirements are kidney, liver and lungs.</p>

  <p>For the 296 Lothian patients registered on the waiting list between 2000 and 2003, the median waiting time for kidney transplant was 1,472 days, compared to a median waiting time of 836 days for the whole of the UK for the same time period.</p>

  <p>The Lothian figures for other organs are too small to allow for the calculation of meaningful averages. For the UK as a whole, the waiting times for adult first transplants, based on registrations between 2000 and 2004, are as follows:</p>

  <p>Heart: 103 days;</p>

  <p>Lung: 406 days;</p>

  <p>Liver: 95 days;</p>

  <p>Organ transplantation services are commissioned either regionally or nationally. The transplant unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) undertakes liver, pancreas and simultaneous kidney/pancreas transplantation on a national basis, and kidney transplantation on a regional basis. The unit also participates in the work of the Scottish Organ Retrieval Team. The total running costs of these services in 2006-07 were around &pound;6.9 million. It is not possible to calculate the proportion of these costs which relate to NHS Lothian residents.</p>

  <p>NHS Lothian residents are also able to benefit from the other transplantation services commissioned nationally and undertaken in units other than that at RIE, but again it is not possible to calculate the proportion of these costs which relate to NHS Lothian residents.</p>

  <p>Section 1 of the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006 places a duty on the Scottish ministers to promote, support and develop programmes of transplantation. It also places a duty on us to promote information and awareness about the donation for transplantation of parts of a human body.</p>

  <p>For many years, the Scottish Government has funded advertising campaigns aimed at raising awareness of the need to increase organ donation numbers. The main focus of these campaigns has been to encourage people to add their name to the NHS Organ Donor Register. The 2006 act recognises these registrations as forms of authorisation, and is designed to ensure that these wishes are respected after death.</p>

  <p>As a significant contribution to discharging our duties under the 2006 Act, we intend to make sure that full advantage is taken, in terms of raising awareness of organ donation and encouraging people to sign up to the register, of the launch in Edinburgh next month of Transplant Awareness Week, and the holding of the British Transplant Games in the city from 26 to 29 July. A budget of &pound;60,000 has been allocated to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s advertising and PR activities associated with the games.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has funded a teaching resource pack aimed at raising awareness amongst senior school pupils of the issues associated with organ donation and transplantation. The pack, which we expect to be in use in schools across Lothian as well as the rest of Scotland, has the potential over time to produce a population with a heightened awareness of the benefits of transplantation.</p>

  <p>Following publication of the Mental Welfare Commission Report <em>Older and Wiser</em> - <em>Findings from our unannounced visits to NHS continuing care ward</em> (Bib. number 42946), I have asked the NHS boards to provide action plans that set out how they will ensure that all services meet the standards of the best service as identified in that report. Dementia is a national priority and we place great importance on support services for dementia sufferers.</p>

  <p>We also have two timetabled commitments directed at further improving services for those with dementia and their carers. These include a pilot programme on how best to improve dementia services (2008) and the development of standards for an Integrated Care Pathway for dementia (end 2007). Additional general mental health timetabled initiatives including work on reducing readmissions, improving physical health; better crisis responses and improving the physical health of those with mental illness will also have a positive impact.</p>

  <p>These commitments are monitored and discussed with NHS boards and their partners through the Implementation Review process and visiting programme.</p>

  <p>We are also developing an Outcomes Framework for Community Care that will provide another monitor on joined up care for vulnerable people (including those with dementia). It includes four national outcomes, 16 performance measures and, for the present, five targets that will drive joint performance. It will start in 2007-08 and be fully implemented in 2008-09. It covers areas such as user satisfaction, waiting times for assessments and service delivery, quality of assessments and reviews, emergency admissions, carers&rsquo; well-being, etc.</p>

  <p>Work on benchmarking (identifying national common service definitions and measurable outcomes in health and social care) is also well underway. This work will provide outcomes allowing the benchmarking and comparison of services across Scotland, including those for people with dementia.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 and its associated regulations require a care home provider to ensure that at all times suitably qualified and competent persons are working in the care home to meet the individual needs of care home residents.</p>

  <p>Staff registering with the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) are required to meet specific criteria, one being having an appropriate qualification for the job they are employed to carry out. The level of, and range of, acceptable qualifications is set by the SSSC. Registration of staff working in adult care home services commenced in January 2006 with managers of the service and further groups from October 2007.</p>

  <p>Access to emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) in community pharmacies is through one of three routes: as a prescription-only medicine prescribed for a patient by a suitably qualified prescriber; purchased by a patient as a pharmacy medicine; or through a patient group direction under a health board scheme. All three routes are available depending on local agreements and the pharmacist&rsquo;s moral and ethical stance.</p>

  <p>Pharmacists who choose not to supply EHC on the grounds of religious beliefs or personal convictions are bound by their Code of Ethics to advise the patient of alternative sources of the service.</p>

  <p>As I announced during the Debate on the Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13 on 31 May 2007, the new programme will cost approximately &pound;1.6 billion.</p>

  <p>(a) &pound;338 million will be used to honour existing agreements in respect of these schemes;</p>

  <p>(b) approximately &pound;49 million will be used to maintain existing levels of entry to the Axis 2 elements of &quot;Land Managers Options&quot; of Rural Development Contracts (previously the Tier 2 Menu Scheme under Land Management Contracts), although given the demand-led nature of these payments it is not possible to be precise about the final level;</p>

  <p>(c) &pound;233m has been earmarked for agri-environment payments;</p>

  <p>(d) &pound;148 million will be available for new forestry expenditure under Axis 2 of Rural Development Contracts;</p>

  <p>(e) &pound;15 million will be available for new Natura applications and in addition there will be significant on-going spend by SNH on existing management agreements over the SRDP period, and</p>

  <p>(f) &pound;427 million is available to fund the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS).</p>

  <p>The main factor in attracting new entrants to farming will be the development of a vibrant and profitable industry and this is a key aim of our rural policy. It is also important, however, that new entrants are supported in the critical early stages and the New Entrants measure could potentially provide this support to up to around 500 new entrants over the life of the Scotland Rural Development Programme.</p>

  <p>Tackling traffic congestion in the Edinburgh city region is the responsibility for SESTRAN and the relevant local authorities. The Scottish Executive will continue to work closely with those bodies in meeting the transport needs of Edinburgh and its surrounding area.</p>

  <p>I met with many representatives of the voluntary sector yesterday, at a reception here in Parliament. I discussed with them the important contribution they make to our strategic purpose of focusing government and all public services on creating a more successful country. I also took the opportunity to signal our intention to renew our engagement with the sector.</p>

  <p>The nomination to the Parliament of a chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission will be made by a selection panel of members of the Parliament in line with Rule 3.11 of Standing Orders. Whilst the panel is not a matter for the SPCB, I do understand that the process for appointing a chair of the commission will commence before the summer recess.</p>
