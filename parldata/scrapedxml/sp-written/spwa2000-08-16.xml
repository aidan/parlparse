  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following expenditure of &pound;600,000 by Scottish Enterprise Borders (SEB) on securing premises in Selkirk for a call centre and &pound;70,000 on retraining redundant workers specifically as call centre operators, what efforts are being made by it and SEB to ensure that call centre companies are located in the Borders.</p>

  <p>The Selkirk call centre is being actively promoted by Scottish Enterprise Borders and the Rural Unit of Locate in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Locate in Scotland has considerable experience in attracting call centre operators to Scotland and this expertise is being used in relation to Selkirk. Confirmation of the inclusion of Selkirk in the recently approved Assisted Areas Map for Scotland will be an additional marketing advantage in favour of Selkirk.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the &pound;600,000 spent by Scottish Enterprise Borders on securing and adapting premises in Selkirk specifically as a call centre and the further &pound;70,000 spent retraining redundant workers as call centre operators was an appropriate expenditure of public funds given the failure so far to secure a call centre.</p>

  <p>In its Final Report in March 1999, the Borders Working Party highlighted a shortage of readily available industrial premises as being a major impediment to the attraction of inward investment into the area.</p>

  <p>The Borders Working Party also highlighted the success which Scotland is enjoying in the attraction of call centres and proposed that an advanced build call centre facility be created in the Borders. That facility was created at Selkirk.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the important work of lone parent families support groups. However, the Executive receives a large number of applications for funding from voluntary organisations and we are unable to meet all of them.</p>

  <p>Gingerbread&#8217;s application for core funding in 1997-98 was rejected on the basis that the application provided insufficient information about the organisation&#8217;s proposed activities and proposals for evaluating their performance. Gingerbread submitted a further application for core funding in 1999-2000 but this was unsuccessful due to the large volume of applications, the need to prioritise and to avoid duplication of funding for similar organisations.</p>

  <p>Funding for the police is provided annually through the Grant Aided Expenditure process, which, for the current year, was based on estimates supplied by police forces. Funding is allocated in its entirety and not on the basis of specific operational requirements or policing tasks.
