  <p>Taking pride in a strong, fair and inclusive national identity is one of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s national outcomes. This is supported by a range of policies, programmes and initiatives across sectors and in partnership with a range of organisations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not provided literature or guidelines to specifically encourage a sense of national identity amongst young people.</p>

  <p>In education, developing knowledge and understanding of Scotland and our place in the world is among the entitlements of a broad general education within Curriculum for Excellence. Within broad curricular guidance teachers are empowered to deliver creative, challenging and relevant learning experiences to meet the needs of young people in a modern Scotland and fast changing world.</p>

  <p>Resources have been provided to support learning about Scotland&rsquo;s history, for example, and Homecoming Scotland 2009 offered children and young people exciting opportunities to celebrate and explore Scotland's rich culture, history and heritage. Homecoming was also celebrated at the 2009 Scottish Education Awards.</p>

  <p>The allocation of the baselined ring-fenced Supporting People funding of &pound;383.620 million for 2007-08, broken down by local authority, is provided in the following table. It should be noted that an additional &pound;17.276 million in respect of Supporting People funding was also distributed in 2007-08 as one-off, non-baselined, payments.</p>

  <p>With effect from 1 April 2008 the baselined former ring-fenced Supporting People funding was rolled-up into the general local government finance settlement and distributed as part of the block grant which the Scottish Government provides to local authorities. There are, therefore, no separate Supporting People allocations of funding for the years 2008-12, although the distribution of the baselined provision of &pound;383.620 million has been retained within the needs-based formula.</p>

  <p>The distribution of this provision for the years 2008-11 was based on a number of needs-based indicators agreed in 2004. These indicators were, at COSLA&rsquo;s request, and as agreed at the Council Leaders&rsquo; meeting on 19 November 2010, updated for the 2011-12 distribution. The effects of using the 2004 indicators were dampened by an interim adjustment, introduced for the period 2005-08, which ensured that no local authority would lose more than 18 per cent of its funding over the period 2005-08 compared with it&rsquo;s allocation in 2004-05. This adjustment was not retained in the 2011-12 calculations.</p>

In recognition of the impact that the dampening had on individual local authority funding allocation for 2011-12 I announced as part of the debate on the 2011-12 Scottish Budget on 9 February 2011 that I intend to allocate an additional &pound;5 million to tackling the problem and have invited COSLA to match that amount. The distribution, once agreed with COSLA, will be included in the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011 to be tabled March 2011.</p>

  <p>The draft budget for the 2011-12 financial year reflects the first year of a new spending review period and, as such, the level of capital available is primarily dictated by the allocations made to the Scottish Government. For 2011-12 the capital budget of &pound;2,606.6 million is made up of a capital allocation of &pound;2,506.6 million plus &pound;100 million of resources carried forward from 2010-11.</p>
