  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why Scottish farmers wishing to convert to organic farming have access only to a telephone advice service, given that in England and Wales farmers receive advice in the form of one full day and one half day visit.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-10-18.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80172" speakername="Mr John Home Robertson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa1018.htm#1806">

  <p>Detailed advice for Scottish farmers wishing to convert to organic farming is available from a wide range of sources, including the Scottish Agricultural College Advisory Services. The initial telephone contact funded by the Department at SAC is intended to enable farmers to be directed towards the most suitable sources of advice for their particular needs. This may include relevant literature being sent to the farmer free of charge or a recommendation to have an individual on-farm visit, although farmers are expected to pay for the visits. Where the advice is of direct commercial benefit for individual farmers&#8217; businesses, it is considered appropriate for them to be charged for it, as they would be if they sought such advice from private consultants. In addition, SAC is funded by the Department to hold organic farming awareness meetings and demonstrations for farmers and crofters.</p>

  <p>We recognise the value that the social economy can play in regenerating communities and tackling social exclusion. In our efforts to strengthen the social economy we are encouraging Scottish Enterprise and Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise to offer support and advice to social and community based enterprises as well as to mainstream business. My Ministerial colleague, Henry McLeish will ask Scottish Enterprise and Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise to contact Ms Eadie with a view to discussing the issue of co-operatives in the context of business development.</p>

  <p>It remains the case that the overwhelming majority of sea fisheries legislation allows for prosecutions to be taken at any court in the United Kingdom. Scottish courts have not dealt exclusively with prosecutions for alleged fishing offences which occur in the Scottish zone of British fishery limits.</p>

  <p>No prosecutions have been made in any court during the last 5 years relating to offences in the area between the newly established Scottish zone and 55&#186; 48&#186; north latitude.</p>
