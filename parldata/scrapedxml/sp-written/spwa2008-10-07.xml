  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) is working on clinical standards for all neurological conditions including neuromuscular conditions such as muscular dystrophy. NHS QIS expects the draft standards to be ready for consultation in autumn 2008, with publication in summer 2009.</p>

  <p>The previous International Development Policy did not specifically highlight development education and therefore this has not been removed. The Scottish Government fully recognises the importance of development education and this is being delivered in schools through &quot;Curriculum for Excellence&quot;.</p>

  <p>Nuclear safety is a reserved matter for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) who regulate safety at civil nuclear installations. Safety at specific sites such as Hunterston are a matter for the site operator and HSE. On nuclear contingency planning arrangements, the Scottish Government has regular dialogue with operators and other stakeholders via the UK led Nuclear Emergency Planning Liaison Group (NEPLG) and the Scottish Nuclear Emergencies Group (SNEG). In addition, officials liaise with site operators via the Site Stakeholder Groups (SSGs) for each site. The SSGs allow representatives from the local community to discuss issues of public interest, including safety, with the site operator.</p>

  <p>I intend to appoint non-executive Directors to the Board of the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) to support Sir Angus Grossart in his role as Chairman as soon as possible. These initial appointments will &ndash; along with Sir Angus&rsquo; appointment &ndash; be for a one year period and are outside the scope of the Code on Public Appointments published by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland (OCPAS) because SFT is not a regulated body. Our intention is that SFT will become a regulated body in due course, after which future appointments will be governed by the OCPAS Code.</p>

All news releases to national media are published on the Scottish Government website. A note of each Scottish Government briefing to parliamentary journalists is published on the website.</p>
