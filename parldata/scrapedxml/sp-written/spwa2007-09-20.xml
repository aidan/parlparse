  <p>At present, new entrants to farming and crofting who wish to access Single Farm Payment support may only do so, in accordance with EC Regulation 1782/2003, by purchasing entitlements on the open market or through inheritance of entitlements. Recognising the difficulties faced by new entrants, we have included in the proposed Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP) a measure that will make an additional &pound;10 million available to them, and I have also asked the Tenant Farming Forum to consider other ways in which we can help new entrants.</p>

  <p>The SRDP also includes a range of business development measures to support modernisation, diversification, restructuring and skills development, under which young farmers will generally be eligible for a higher rate of grant.</p>

  <p>We continue our discussions with the Ministry of Defence and NHS boards on improving structured care and support for former service personnel whose mental health is assessed to have suffered as a result of their operational deployment.</p>

  <p>Inpatient care is provided and fully funded by NHS boards through normal referral processes, subject to terms on the priority to be attached for treatment for those veterans in receipt of a service related pension.</p>

  <p>Hollybush House, the short stay residential treatment centre run by Combat Stress, also provides assessment treatment and support for former service personnel with mental health problems (including post traumatic stress disorder) related to operational deployment.

  <p>In addition (between 2005-07) the then Scottish Executive provided a total capital grant of &pound;100,000 toward the refurbishment of Hollybush House. The grant was provided on the understanding that Combat Stress would work toward service redesign following the recommendation of the Health and Social Care Advisory Service (HASCAS) report into their services.</p>

  <p>Total revenue grant funding of &pound;54,000 over 2004-07 was also provided to help support the Combat Stress welfare team in its community outreach work.</p>

  <p>The majority of Alba Biosciences business and income, over a number of years, has been derived from overseas markets outside the NHS. It was not, therefore appropriate to retain Alba Bioscience as part of NHS Scotland, with responsibility for investment and associated risks involved.</p>

  <p>The sale will have no impact on the provision of medical products used in the treatment of patients. There are a number of alternative suppliers of the products that NHS Scotland requires, which will continue to be procured under existing arrangements in the same way that most modern pharmaceutical products are bought by the NHS.</p>

  <p>The sale has provided stability for the vast majority of staff, who have transferred to Quotient BioResearch. This will retain the skills of the workforce and will provide opportunities for the further growth and development of a Scottish-based business.</p>

  <p>The pace and scale of delivery are dependent on discussions with local authorities and with the Universities, who will be delivering the additional teachers needed.

  <p>Water charge levels are set by an independent process of economic regulation led by the Water Industry Commission for Scotland. The commission sets limits on the charges that Scottish Water will apply during any given period at lowest reasonable overall cost. These must be sufficient to deliver ministers&rsquo; strategic objectives for the water industry in Scotland. A benefit of this regulatory framework is that water charge levels are set to rise by less by than inflation until 2010.</p>

  <p>Section 31(2) of the Crofting Reform etc Act 2007 amended part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 to allow crofting community bodies the right to acquire any interest in the land, thus preventing the use of interposed leases as a means of circumventing the Crofting Community Right to Buy. That section came into force on 25 June 2007 and no further action is therefore required.</p>

  <p>The Pairc Trust may now amend their application to buy crofting land on the Pairc Estate to include acquisition of the interposed lease over the estate, should they wish to do so.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is considering how best to deliver the custodial sentences elements of the 2007 act within our overall objective of a coherent penal policy.</p>

  <p>I announced at the debate on Penal Policy on Thursday 20 September that I am setting up an independent Prisons Commission to look at the use of prison. This, together with the work being done in tandem on revitalising community penalties, will assist in informing the approach we take.

  <p>The number of dentists providing general dental services has increased from 2,301 in March 2006 to 2,474 in March 2007.</p>

  <p>In Scotland we have introduced a bursary scheme which allows students studying from year 2 at the two Scottish Dental Schools to apply for a dental undergraduate bursary. Students receiving this bursary require to commit that their NHS earnings will represent not less than 80% of their total earnings for up to five years following graduation. In 2006-07 approximately 440 dental students were in receipt of a bursary. One hundred and twelve of these were final year students representing 90% of that year&rsquo;s graduate cohort.</p>

  <p>A number of other financial recruitment and retention measures are in place to attract dentists to work in the NHS and remain in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have recently confirmed that installed renewables capacity in Scotland exceeds that of nuclear power. The Scottish Government is focussed on supporting rapid increases in this renewables capacity across a range of sources, including wave, tidal, biomass and hydro as well as wind. We also believe there is capacity for significant advances in other areas, such as cleaner coal and carbon sequestration.</p>

  <p>Following the election, we have a small streamlined Cabinet of six and this requires each Cabinet Secretary to take a shared responsibility in delivering all of the Government&rsquo;s Strategic Objectives. This approach will ensure that sustainability issues are addressed at full Cabinet level, rather than such a fundamental issue being dealt with by a sub-committee. The Cabinet will engage fully with a broad range of interested parties to ensure that Government pursues an ambitious agenda on Greener Scotland including climate change issues.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is firmly committed to treating the Scottish fishing industry as a priority, not only safeguarding its future, but ensuring that it thrives. We are taking action on many fronts to ensure that our fisheries are both profitable and sustainable. Actions include:</p>

  <p>developing a greater role and influence for Scotland in European fisheries policies,</p>

  <p>leading the way in fisheries conservation measures, such as real time closures, to protect vulnerable cod stocks;</p>

  <p>developing Inshore Fisheries Groups to manage local fisheries, putting the interests of stakeholders at the heart of decision making;</p>

  <p>establishing a Scottish Fisheries Council which will provide a comprehensive consultative and advisory body, comprising fishermen and other marine stakeholders, and</p>

  <p>ensuring that for the first tome the interests of fishing communities are at the heart of our policies and actions.</p>

  <p>I believe that our long association with, and commitment to, fishing communities makes this Scottish Government uniquely placed to promote fisheries in Scotland, the UK and Europe.</p>

  <p>I recognise the importance of the fishing industry in Eyemouth and Eastern Berwickshire. I will of course be making the strongest possible case at the forthcoming international fisheries negotiations to protect the vital catching opportunities for Scotland&rsquo;s fishing fleet. Aid to the fisheries sector will also be available through the European Fisheries Fund programme. A draft operational programme will be published for public consultation in the near future and I encourage all in the Eyemouth and Berwickshire area with a fisheries interest to engage with the Scottish Government in delivering this important European funded assistance scheme. I shall also be placing fishing communities at the heart of our fisheries policies and practices and will be convening in early 2008 a convention on the how best to safeguard their future.</p>

  <p><em>Delivering Care, Enabling health</em> is the key delivery and outcome evaluation mechanism for Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Professionals in Scotland. The strategy document contained a 26 point action plan to be taken forward by NHS Scotland, higher education institutions, the Scottish Government and linked agencies.</p>

  <p>The action plan is still in the early stages of implementation. However, indications are that steady progress is being made. Already underway is a review of the role of the senior charge nurse in NHS Scotland; the development of clinical quality indicators which will ensure the delivery of safe and effective care; the first Early Clinical Careers Fellowship programme for nursing and midwifery is being piloted from October 2007, to provide funded access to clinically focussed Masters level education for newly qualified nursing and midwifery graduates. In addition, the first Nursing Officer for Vulnerable Adults, including older people, has been appointed to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Chief Nursing Officer Directorate.</p>

  <p>The National Accommodation Strategy for Sex Offenders (NASSO), which came into force on 2 April 2007, provides for the Responsible Authorities under the Management of Offenders etc. (Scotland) Act 2005 to risk manage meeting the accommodation needs of sex offenders. The NASSO specifies that some types of accommodation are unsuitable for sex offenders, including mainstream hostels or houses in multiple occupation, and bed and breakfasts, due to the risk to fellow users and particularly children. It notes that placing a sex offender in temporary accommodation where there are households with children could constitute a significant risk to those households, and it goes on to say that such placements might mean that the temporary accommodation did not meet the standards required for homeless households with children. These are set out in the Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order 2004, which requires that temporary accommodation for households with children must be suitable for children.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers have made the first Commencement Order under the 2007 act, bringing into force provisions relating to knife dealers&rsquo; licences, offensive weapons, swords and crossbows and establishing a new offence of having offensive weapons in prison. These measures will come into force on 1 October and 1 November 2007.</p>

  <p>The number of crimes and offences recorded by the police are shown in the following tables. The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year. Thus the available statistics on court proceedings and recorded crime cannot be combined in any meaningful way, for instance to show what proportion of recorded crimes lead to a custodial sentence.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The local authority breakdown of the recorded crime figures from 1992 to 1994 and 1995-96 are based on the data held at a district level. For those authorities which were formed from &quot;parts&quot; of districts, the figures were pro-rated using population figures.</p>

  <p>2. Data from 2004-05 onwards shows the impact of the implementation of the Scottish Crime Recording Standard (SCRS), which was expected to increase the numbers of minor crimes recorded by the police, such as minor crimes of vandalism and minor thefts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s system which records receipt of property recovered or preserved, and expenses from opponents, does not record whether the opponent was the pursuer or defender in the case. SLAB summarises in its annual report, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41341), information on the amount of expenses and awards recovered from opponents, whether pursuer or defender.

</table></p>

  <p>It will be noted from the table that in four of the last five years, over 70% of the sums recovered by the board from opponents relate to reparation cases. The vast majority of legally aided parties in such cases are pursuers, meaning that the vast majority of these sums will have been paid by defenders. In judicial review, all of the expenses will have been paid by defenders (or, more accurately, respondents). For other types of case, including family cases, legal aid may be granted to either the pursuer or defender and so it is not possible to say how much of the amounts recovered in these cases comes from defenders.</p>

  <p>There are undoubtedly important linkages between the planning and health systems, including the implications of major proposed developments on the delivery of health services. The involvement of health boards in the development plan process is therefore desirable, and how this is best achieved is under on-going consideration as part of the process of implementing the Planning etc (Scotland) Act 2006.</p>

  <p>The 2006 act allows ministers to specify, through regulations, a number of &quot;key agencies&quot;. The intention is that proposed key agencies will be set out within the draft development plan regulations which we hope to issue for consultation in October this year. It will be a duty of these agencies to co-operate with planning authorities at various stages in the preparation of the development plan, so it will be vital that the agencies have the resources to fully engage in the process.</p>

  <p>As well as referring to key agencies, the act requires the forthcoming regulations to secure, so far as practicable, that those who may be expected to want to make representations on the plan are made aware that they can do so. The guidance accompanying the regulations is likely to include a list of those bodies that planning authorities should consult in this context, allowing the bodies such as health boards to respond to plans which impact on their interests. We consider this to be an appropriate way to encourage more effective engagement with NHS boards.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering what, if any, changes should be made to the list of statutory consultees who are required to be consulted on certain types of planning application. We would be need to be reassured that any additional statutory consultee has the capacity and resources available to them to engage fully with the planning authority and developer on each application that required their input.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Government believes that a plan-led system is the key to a modern, efficient planning system. Early dialogue is crucial and it may be that the most appropriate time for Community Health Partnerships to become involved in the planning process is at the development planning level. It is at this stage where consideration should be given to the impact of large scale development proposals on the delivery of health care services in the plan area. These plans set the policy context within which individual planning applications are determined and decisions must be made in accordance with the development plan for the area unless material considerations indicate otherwise.</p>

  <p>Annual housing land audits are a key tool for local authorities in monitoring their development plans and ensuring that an adequate supply of land for housing is maintained. As set out in <em>SPP3,</em> where such monitoring indicates that the availability of housing land, and/or completions, is not keeping pace with identified requirements, planning authorities may prepare an alteration or review of their plan as necessary.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has commissioned research into the effectiveness of housing land audits, the aim of which is to provide advice on the potential effectiveness of housing land audits as a tool in measuring and monitoring housing land supply across Scotland as a whole. The need for this research was driven by Scottish ministers&rsquo; concern to ensure a sufficient supply of land for housing. The results of the study will help to inform the current review of <em>SPP3</em> and related guidance, and will also be relevant to the current planning reforms.</p>

  <p>Officials are currently in the process of establishing a system that will allow the information collected by local authorities in housing land audits to be used by the Scottish Government to monitor the amount of affordable housing that is being built, and are in the early stages of discussions with local authorities about the best way to take this forward.</p>

  <p>The average cost of employing police officers within Scottish police forces is:</p>

  <p>Around &pound;20 million per year for 500 officers.</p>

  <p>Around &pound;40 million per year for 1,000 officers.</p>

  <p>Around &pound;60 million per year for 1,500 officers.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Government using the Stats 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured and which become known to the police. The returns do not cover damage only accidents or accidents of which the police are unaware because they were not reported by the public.</p>

  <p>The following table gives the total number of reported injury road accidents which were identified in the Stats 19 returns as occurring on the A835, A836, A837, A838, A894, A897 and A9 (North of the Dornoch Bridge Roundabout) between 1999 and 2006, and for which at least one motor vehicle driver or rider was coded as being resident outside the UK.</p>

  <p>The specification of the Stats 19 returns includes a code which the police can use to identify as non-UK residents any drivers or riders, of vehicles involved in reported accidents, whose homes are outwith the UK. However, this information is not available in all cases - for example, the police will have no knowledge of the areas of residence of &quot;hit and run&quot; drivers. The true number of foreign motorists involved in accidents will therefore be higher than would appear from the Stats 19 data, and the true number of accidents involving foreign motorists will therefore be higher than the figures given in the following table. In addition, it should be noted that several changes were made to the Stats 19 specification with effect from the start of 1999, including the introduction of the code which is used to identify drivers or riders who are non-UK residents. As some police forces&rsquo; returns for 1999 were affected by difficulties connected with the implementation of the new specification, the figures for 1999 could be lower than they should have been.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given in the following table are based upon the data which is held in the central statistical database and which was collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the government. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-3517 by Stewart Stevenson on 6 September 2007, for how many road traffic accidents on the (a) A835, (b) A836, (c) A837, (d) A838, (e) A894, (f) A897 and (g) A9 north of the Dornoch Bridge Roundabout foreign motorists have been deemed to be responsible in each year since 1999.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-09-20.67.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0920.htm#30">

  <p>Data about injury road accidents is collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Government using the Stats 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured and which become known to the police. The returns do not cover damage-only accidents or accidents of which the police are unaware because they were not reported by the public.</p>

  <p>Statistics about the factors which may have contributed to the occurrence of an accident are only available with effect from the start of 2005, when the Stats 19 specification was expanded to include such information. The following table therefore gives the total number of reported injury road accidents in 2005 and 2006, which were identified in the Stats 19 returns as occurring on the A835, A836, A838, A894 and A9 (North of the Dornoch Bridge Roundabout), and which involved motor vehicle drivers or riders who were coded in the Stats 19 returns as being non-UK residents. There were no such accidents reported as occurring on the A837 and the A897 in those years.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given in the following table are based upon the data which is held in the central statistical database and which was collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Scottish Government. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>

  <p>The specification of the Stats 19 returns includes a code which the police can use to identify as non-UK residents any drivers or riders of vehicles involved in reported accidents, whose homes are outwith the UK. However, this information is not available in all cases - for example, the police will have no knowledge of the areas of residence of hit-and-run drivers. The true number of foreign motorists involved in accidents will therefore be higher than would appear from the Stats 19 data, and the true number of accidents involving foreign motorists will therefore be higher than the figures given in the following table.</p>

  <p>The contributory factors shown in the returns reflect the reporting officer&rsquo;s opinion at the time of making the report, and are not necessarily the result of extensive investigation: subsequent enquiries could lead to a change in the opinion of the reporting officer. The factors are largely subjective, and depend upon the skill and experience of the reporting officer in reconstructing the events which led directly to the accident, based upon the information available at the time of making the report.</p>

  <p>In the case of many accidents, contributory factors are recorded for more than one of the parties involved in the accident. For example, in the reporting officer&rsquo;s view, one driver may have been &quot;travelling too fast for the conditions&quot;, another may have been &quot;impaired by alcohol&quot;, and a pedestrian may have &quot;failed to look properly&quot; - if so, the Stats 19 returns will show contributory factors for three of the parties involved in the accident. In such a case, the returns do not identify one participant as responsible, since it appears more than one person&rsquo;s actions (or lack of action) contributed to the occurrence of the accident. However, if contributory factors are recorded for only one participant, it would appear that the reporting officer&rsquo;s view is that that particular person was responsible for the accident. The following table therefore distinguishes between:</p>

  <p>(a) accidents for which all the contributory factors were recorded for non-UK resident motorists, as they may be regarded as responsible for such accidents;</p>

  <p>(b) accidents for which some of the contributory factors were recorded for non-UK resident motorists, and other contributory factors were recorded for other participants (such as UK motorists, cyclists and pedestrians), as it appears that, in each such case, responsibility should be split between the non-UK motorist(s) and one or more of the other participants in the accident; and</p>

  <p>(c) accidents for which none of the contributory factors were recorded for non-UK resident motorists, as it appears that they were not responsible for such accidents.</p>

  <p>(contributory factors were recorded for all of the reported accidents involving non-UK resident motorists in 2005 and 2006.)</p>

  <p>More information about contributory factors is given in an article on pages 53 to 74 of <em>Road Accidents Scotland 2005</em>, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41118).</p>

  <p>Safety is an integral part of the assessment of all trunk road schemes. Transport Scotland is the national transport agency for the Scottish Government and has responsibility for the trunk road network. Details and timescales for our major and important planned road projects, including dualling schemes, can be found on the Transport Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/defaultpage1221cde0.aspx?pageID=50" target="_blank">http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/defaultpage1221cde0.aspx?pageID=50</a> .</p>

  <p>Local roads are the responsibility of local authorities.</p>

  <p>During 2006 a study was carried out to examine a range of potential alterations to improve road safety along the length of the A96 within the A96 Route Accident Reduction Plan (RARP). This study examined accident records within all communities on the A96, considering traffic speeds, levels and movements and also considering potential measures which may be implemented to improve effectiveness of traffic control and pedestrian facilities within urban areas, including Nairn.</p>

  <p>The RARP report was submitted in February 2007 to Transport Scotland by the Operating Company for the North East Unit, BEAR Scotland Ltd. Following consideration, approval has now been given for BEAR to progress a number of measures during the current financial year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is very aware of the need to ensure a safe environment for all road users, including international visitors. Roads are designed to national standards and these standards have been developed through research, which often includes information from international authorities. The majority of road signs are designed to similar standards to those adopted abroad and drivers are therefore presented with information that is readily understood. In addition, the opportunity is often taken to provide safety messages in a variety of languages.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is required to meet the full cost of exam delivery from charges. Every year the SQA prepares a draft budget and, as part of the budgeting process, reviews its charging levels. The SQA&rsquo;s draft budget and its proposals for charge increases are then considered by ministers for approval. In each of the two most recent years, 2006-07 and 2007-08, SQA&rsquo;s charges have increased by 3%.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Flood Defence Asset Database is a register of fluvial and coastal defences constructed in Scotland under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, containing detailed records of the assets, the defended areas and number of properties protected. It was constructed to provide an assessment of the structural condition and performance of flood defence schemes and to establish the current standard of protection.</p>

  <p>The next meeting of the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime was scheduled for the 28 September 2007. However, I have asked for this to be changed to enable me to attend and chair. The principal topic for discussion will be how to improve the investigation and prosecution of wildlife crime.

  <p>Records are not kept about the quantities recovered in illegal baits. Small samples are taken for investigation, which then form the basis of the data held by the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme. The list of chemicals used in cases of illegal poisoning over the last 10 years can be found in the answer to question S3W-4143 on 20 September 2007.
