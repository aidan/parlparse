  <p>The Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland has been commissioned by the Scottish Executive to undertake an annual exercise to determine the effectiveness of the new eviction grounds for anti-social behaviour and the use being made of anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) brought in under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.</p>

  <p>At the moment the court has a discretionary power to grant special measures when an application is made. The current procedure for making applications to take evidence by television link is governed by rules 22.1 and 22.2 of the Act of Adjournal (Criminal Procedure Rules) 1996. The application is to be lodged 14 days before the trial diet (except on special cause shown). The court will then fix a diet to hear the application at the earliest practicable date.</p>

  <p>On 27 February 2003 we published proposals to give children an automatic entitlement to use special measures when giving evidence, and to introduce a streamlined notification procedure. These are part of a wide range of proposals aimed at helping child and other vulnerable witnesses. The proposals are set out in more detail in <i>Vital Voices - Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence - Policy Statement</i>, which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26600) or on the Scottish Executive website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/justice/vvps-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/justice/vvps-00.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>New measures have been introduced in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, which was approved by the Scottish Parliament on 20 February 2003, to tackle anti-social behaviour more effectively. We have introduced interim Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs), extended the power to apply for ASBOs to registered social landlords and created a new duty on police and local authorities to jointly prepare and publish anti-social behaviour strategies.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 gives social landlords the power to give a &quot;probationary&quot; style short Scottish secure tenancy to persons who have been evicted for anti-social behaviour (in any part of the UK and from any tenure). This can also be offered to tenants where they are subject to an ASBO. This new power came into force on 30 September 2002.</p>

  <p>It is too early to assess the impact of these measures.</p>

  <p>Midlothian Council currently estimate that, by 8 March 2003, only eight dwellings in their stock will remain without central heating. All of those dwellings should have central heating by 31 March 2004. There is insufficient data from which to estimate the number of owner-occupiers and private renters in the Midlothian Council area who are eligible for the Central Heating Installation Programme. However, every effort will be made to ensure that the programme is widely publicised and that all eligible households are encouraged to apply before the closing date of 31 March 2006.</p>

  <p>The Warm Deal as currently constituted was introduced in July 1999. Under the programme, Midlothian Council insulated 322 dwellings in 1999-2000, 225 dwellings in 2000-01 and 520 dwellings in 2001-02, the last year for which figures are currently available. We do not know how many of those dwellings are occupied by pensioners.</p>

  <p>The part of the Warm Deal administered by Eaga covers all sectors of the housing stock. Eaga say that in the EH postcode area 3,106 dwellings were insulated in 1999-2000 and 4,869 in 2000-01. The main postcode area for the Midlothian Council area is EH. We do not know how many of these dwellings are occupied by pensioners.</p>

  <p>The council installed 21 heating systems in 2001-02, the first year of the Central Heating Installation Programme and expect to install 37 heating systems in 2002-03. They further expect to install eight heating systems in 2003-04 and at the end of that year all council stock should have central heating, except where the tenant has refused the offer or the building is due to be demolished. We do not know how many of these dwellings are occupied by pensioners.</p>

  <p>Eaga run the Central Heating Installation Programme for owner-occupiers and private renters. They collect statistics on a cumulative basis, by main postcode area. The main postcode area for the Midlothian Council area is EH. Eaga say that they have installed 1,375 heating systems in that postcode area between autumn 2000 and 28 February 2003. In each case the applicant will have been aged 60 or over, but we do not know how many are pensioners.</p>

  <p>There is no estimate of how many people in the Midlothian Council area will benefit from the Warm Deal or Central Heating Installation Programme in future years.</p>

  <p>Eligibility for the Central Heating Installation Programme is dependent on a number of factors, including whether there is any form of heating in the house already. In September 2002 the Scottish Executive announced that the programme would be extended from April 2004 to elderly people over 80 living in homes with partial or poorly functioning systems. However, the case raised in the question does concern me and I will investigate further and write to you.</p>

  <p>Eaga do not collect statistics on the number of applications refused. They collect cumulative statistics on the number of installations by main postcode area, not constituency area. The main postcode area covering Motherwell and Wishaw is ML. Eaga tell us that they have installed 216 central heating systems in the ML postcode area between the autumn of 2000 and 28 February 2003.</p>

Sport and art are devolved matters.

  <p>The 3% estimate given by my predecessor in April 2002 was based on the results of validation fieldwork carried out between January and March 2002. The further validation work carried out since March 2002 indicates that the 3% quoted last April remains a reasonably accurate estimate of the incidence of possible fraud.</p>

  <p>Compliance with the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 is a matter for the Care Commission itself. The Care Commission&#8217;s complaints procedure, which is published on their website at: www.carecommission.com, aims to encourage openness and transparency. It confirms that the final decision will be communicated to the complainant and to the party complained against. The final written report itself must, of course, remain confidential in terms of the Data Protection Act as it inevitably contains references to third parties.</p>

As with all roads investment, this scheme will depend on a positive economic case being made and the outcome of the Public Local Inquiry (PLI) into objections received to the statutory orders for the scheme.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has a long-term target to make sure that older people are financially secure. Underpinning that, there is a social justice milestone to reduce the proportion of older people living in low income households.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also set a target to eradicate fuel poverty, as far as is practicable, by 2016. Whilst this target covers all households, older householders are particularly vulnerable to the effects of fuel poverty. The Central Heating Installation Programme, which is available to pensioners without any central heating or with irreparable systems and covers all tenure types, is saving an average of &#163;290 on bills. According to the managing agent, over 8,300 pensioner households have benefited from the programme so far.</p>

  <p>The standard conditions that attach to grants awarded from the Social Inclusion Partnership Fund adhere to the principles of "Following the Public Pound". These cover matters such as financial probity and the application of public funds. Specific conditions applying to individual grant awards, for example, if the grant is conditional on co-financing being secured are a local matter.</p>

  <p>The Executive launched the National Waste Plan on 24 February 2003, which establishes the direction of our policies for sustainable waste management to 2020. This plan provides an integrated summary of the 11 Area Waste Plans, which were prepared by groups including local authority representatives. Implementing this plan will achieve 25% recycling and composting of municipal waste by 2006, and 55% by 2020.</p>

  <p>The Executive has allocated over &#163;230 million over the next three years alone for local authorities to implement the Area Waste Plans. I announced funding of almost &#163;110 million to eight local authorities over 17 years on 3 February. I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-33419 on 3 February 2003. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. Further bids from local authorities to the Strategic Waste Fund are currently being assessed.</p>

  <p>The Local Government (Scotland) Act 2003 places a new duty on local authorities to prepare integrated waste management plans for ministers&#8217; approval. The Executive will use this provision to direct authorities to establish mandatory recycling targets which will be based on the Area Waste Plans.</p>

  <p>Under section 172 of the Water Act 1989, the Scottish ministers' may grant indemnities to Scottish Water in respect of:</p>

  <p>liabilities incurred by Scottish Water in connection with anything done by them to increase fluoride in water supplied;</p>

  <p>costs or expenses incurred by Scottish Water (or for which Scottish Water is liable) in connection with proceedings brought with respect to things done for the purpose of increasing the fluoride content of any water, or a proposal to do so, and</p>

  <p>expenditure incurred by Scottish Water in complying with an order made in any such proceedings.</p>

  <p>As with any other discretionary power, it would be for the Scottish ministers to determine, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, whether to exercise the power and, if so, to what extent.</p>
