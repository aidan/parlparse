  <p>In 1999, HM Treasury published a consultation paper entitled <i>Review of Charity Taxation</i> dealing with many aspects of the tax system as it affects charities, including rates relief for charity shops. The principle of rate relief for charity shops remains but the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions is preparing a consultation document focussing on aspects of definition and guidance for issue later this year. The Executive will have regard to the position and will consider whether similar action should be taken in Scotland.</p>

  <p>No. However, as announced by the then Health Minister Sam Galbraith in August 1998, significant action is already being taken to reduce the theoretical and unquantifiable risk of transmitting variant CJD through the blood supply:</p>

  <p>on the advice of Spongiform Encephalophalogy Advisory Committee (SEAC) all blood for transfusion has the white cells removed through a process called leucodepletion. This is because current research indicates that infectivity from transmissible spongiform encephalopathies appears to be mainly linked to white blood cells;</p>

  <p>on the advice of the Committee on the Safety of Medicines all blood products used in the UK are made from imported plasma from countries where there is no evidence of variant CJD.</p>

  <p>Many public sector bodies already make extensive use of high speed communications links to facilitate dealings with the public and businesses; to provide access to information sources on intranets and the world wide web; and to speed up internal public sector processes. It is a matter for individual public bodies to decide whether such communication services represent an appropriate investment for them. The Executive&#8217;s response to the Digital Scotland report made clear that where public sector investment in communication services is taking place we are keen to see closer collaboration between the public sector bodies involved where this will help to reduce costs or improve services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been connected to broadband services through the Government Secure Intranet (GSI) for two years, and has had active discussions with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and individual local authorities about the possibility of their organisations joining the GSI.</p>

  <p>The Higher Education sector already has communications links with capacity many times larger than ADSL or ISDN can provide. All Scottish Further Education colleges will have high capacity communication links by April 2001. Over half of all Scottish secondary schools and nearly 40% of primaries are already using ISDN communications. PricewaterhouseCoopers are concluding an investigation for the Scottish Executive into how broadband communications will be provided to all Scottish schools.</p>

  <p>The total current and projected future costs of high-speed communications services for the public sector are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>I refer you to question S1W-5433 which provides details of the additional resources allocated to the Scottish budget from the UK Reserve since 1 July 1999. In addition, the Scottish Budget will increase by &pound;288.3 million in 2000-01 as a result of Scotland&#8217;s share of the Chancellor&#8217;s pre-budget announcements. This funding will be met from the UK Reserve.</p>

  <p>The rules governing access by the devolved administrations to the UK Reserve are set out in the Statement of Funding Policy. A revised version of this was published by HM Treasury on 18 July 2000. A copy of the publication can be found on the HM Treasury Internet site at <u><a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pdf/2000/sfp4.pdf">www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pdf/2000/sfp4.pdf</a></u>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the important role which victims play in our criminal justice system and is committed to a policy which ensures that they have access to the support, information, protection and redress which they need. Recent announcements on the establishment of a victim and witness service in the Crown Office, and on our future plans for support services provide clear evidence of the priority which we attach to these matters. The Scottish Executive has already met many of the recommendations in the report R (85) 11 and we are taking its principles fully into account in the development of our overarching strategy for victims.</p>

  <p>The Occupational Health and Safety Strategy <i>Towards a Safer Healthier Workplace</i> committed the NHSiS to provide a safe working environment for staff based on risk assessment. To back that up the Scottish Executive made &pound;0.5 million available to the NHSiS for the introduction of safety and security measures, such as the provision of access to mobile phones for community nurses, midwives and health visitors. A guideline and model policy, prepared under the auspices of the Scottish Partnership Forum, on <i>Dignity at Work: Eliminating Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace</i> has recently been issued for consultation and can be seen at the website, www.show.scot.nhs.uk/spf/. This is expected to be published this autumn <i> </i> and will be recommended for use across the NHS in Scotland, including the wider NHS, such as <i> </i> GP Practices. Work will begin shortly on further guidance covering <i>Employee Health at Work</i> which will include personal safety and a model policy for the management of violence and aggression. Occupational health minimum datasets which NHSiS Trusts and health boards will be required to collect and publish are also in preparation and data on violence against staff will feature in these.</p>

  <p>In addition, in July new Regulations came into force to help GPs, health boards and Primary Care Trusts to cope with violent patients. Previously boards and Trusts did not have the power to direct patients to doctors who are geared to dealing with them. Now, as a result of the National Health Service (Choice of Medical Practitioner) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2000, when assigning violent patients to a GP, health boards and Trusts must take into account which GP is best placed to deal with the patient. The Regulations open the way for boards and Trusts to work with GPs to ensure that treatment is provided at appropriate premises.</p>
