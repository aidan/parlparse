  <p>The Large Combustion Plants Directive is being implemented in two phases in line with the directive&rsquo;s time provisions. For post-1987 plant, tighter emission limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and dust were introduced in 2002 through regulations agreed in the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>For pre-1987 plant, the directive provides the choice of tighter emission limit values at individual plants or a UK national plan for all such plant, both to take effect from 1 January 2008. The UK has submitted a draft national plan to the European Commission. We expect to reach a conclusion on which implementation route to take by the spring of 2005 at the latest.</p>

  <p>The Financial Services Strategy Group (FSSG) is charged with developing a vision and strategy to support the future success of the financial services sector in Scotland. Building on its earlier work, it has identified three areas around which it will build its strategy, namely:</p>

  <p>the need to support firms in Scotland to be at the forefront of technical and market opportunities;</p>

  <p>the need to ensure Scotland has in place the infrastructure to sustain, develop and attract a quality workforce, and</p>

  <p>above all, the need for closer partnership working between the public and private sectors, allied to a greater clarity of communication, in and beyond Scotland, about the Scottish financial services sector.</p>

  <p>At its meeting on 14 September, the FSSG discussed a number of specific measures and actions which, taken together, should contribute to the delivery of these aims. These include capitalising on Scotland&rsquo;s research base, including the work of the Intermediate Technology Institutes; ensuring that current labour market interventions are delivering the skilled workforce that the industry needs to prosper, and developing a robust means of ensuring that the voice of the industry in Scotland is heard where decisions may have specific Scottish impacts. A number of additional areas were also identified by the group and thinking on these will be developed over the next weeks and months.</p>

  <p>The calibre of those involved in the FSSG has enabled high-quality, detailed and wide ranging analysis to be carried out and this will be reflected in the final strategy, to be published in early 2005.</p>

  <p>Information is provided by practices themselves. Any patient who has moved to a new location and wishes to join the list of a practice, or who wishes simply to change doctor, is free to apply to any local practice. A practice is required by the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 to state the reasons for the refusal of any application. A patient whose application is made to a practice with a closed list will be informed accordingly. The procedure for the closure of a list is set out in the regulations and a practice is required to give notice to its health board prior to consideration of the proposal.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive already supports extensive preventative screening activities across Scotland, for example the Scottish Executive recently announced a further three well man clinic pilots in the Borders, Lanarkshire and the Western Isles which brings the total to 10 well man pilots across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>The boards&rsquo; spending is taken to be the gross total revenue expenditure figures from their published Annual Accounts for each respective financial year. The amount spent on administration is taken to be management and administration costs reported in their published Annual Accounts plus management and administration expenditure incurred by trusts in their area. Trust management and administration expenses are taken from Scottish Financial Return (SFR) 5.2, which is completed by each hospital, as disclosed in answering parliamentary question (S2W-8040).</p>

  <p>*Due to a change in reporting requirements, the 2002-03 figures of the Island Health Boards (Orkney, Shetland and Western Isles) are not directly comparable with the preceding four years. Their 2002-03 figures shown therefore only include the hospital management and administration costs but not board management costs, which are not available for that year. This situation has been rectified in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-9957 by Malcolm Chisholm on 6 September 2004, whether the &pound;9,882,454 cost of negligence claims in 2003-04 was met by NHS boards or by insurers and, if the cost was not met by insurers, how much has been paid in premiums (a) by each NHS board and (b) in total.</p>

  <p>In 2003-04 the cost of &pound;9,882,454 for clinical negligence claims was met by the Clinical Negligence and Other Risks Indemnity Scheme (CNORIS) and NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The cost of clinical negligence claims is generally met from (CNORIS) which is a risk management scheme for NHSScotland that came into operation on 1 April 2000. The scheme was established by the Clinical Negligence and Other Risk Indemnity Scheme (CNORIS) Scotland Regulations 2000, as amended.</p>

  <p>Membership of CNORIS is mandatory for all health bodies in Scotland. The arrangements cover both clinical and non-clinical liabilities and are funded by contributions from the members. At the outset there were two aims in establishing the scheme, firstly, to provide cost-effective claims management and financial risk pooling arrangements for all of Scotland's NHS bodies. Secondly, to encourage a rigorous and logical approach to risk management in both the clinical and non-clinical sectors of NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>In 2003, the special health board, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) was formed and the Health Department decided that the CNORIS risk management standards, should become part of the work of NHS QIS. It was decided to combine the CNORIS standards with the former Clinical Standards Board&rsquo;s generic standards to form Healthcare Governance standards. The process of establishing the new standards is on-going.</p>

  <p>CNORIS operates as a risk pool, meeting the cost of negligence cases arising in any one year (subject to a deductible payable by the member (i.e. NHS body)). The pool operates on a pay-as-you-go basis with members' contributions for any one year based on the expected level of demand on the pool in that year. Further information on the scheme can be found at <a href="http://www.cnoris.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cnoris.com/</a>.</p>

  <p>In managing the scheme two actuarial reports are commissioned each year. The main report is undertaken in November each year and is used to assess the likely demand on the scheme and determine contribution levels for the coming year. The second report is undertaken each September and assesses the claims to be settled in the remaining six months of the year, the level at which claims have settled in comparison to the amount claimed, the likelihood of new claims and existing funds. This allows the Department to manage the level of funds held centrally and assess if the scheme can return unspent resources in-year.</p>

  <p>The scheme actuaries assessed that the potential liability in 2003-04 was &pound;13.68 million. The Department off-set this amount by &pound;4 million, from a carried forward balance leaving &pound;9.68 million to be collected for 2003-04. After the application of risk management discounts &pound;8.49 million was collected. The amounts collected were as follows:</p>

  <p>The decision by the Scottish Executive to make available funding of up to &pound;750,000 for a new footbridge at Lockerbie rail station, allowing disabled access to the southbound platform, was taken largely because of the station&rsquo;s isolation within the rail network, and the infrequency of stopping passenger services. Passengers with disabilities who cannot access the existing footbridge at Lockerbie must make a return journey of an additional 50 miles to Carlisle, which has obvious significant impacts on both length of journey and the times of day when such a journey can be made.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Rail Authority intends to consult shortly on its proposed Access for All programme, which seeks to identify stations that are a high priority for access improvements. It will consider &ndash; amongst other things &ndash; station usage, geographic criteria, and a project&rsquo;s interaction with initiatives by third parties. Additionally, there are a number of on-going projects in Scotland which will enhance access to stations and their services. These improvements include better provision for disabled people and enhanced public transport, cycle and pedestrian access.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to tackling the causes of climate change and to ensuring that Scotland makes an equitable contribution to the UK Kyoto target. The white paper of June 2004, <em>Scotland&rsquo;s transport future</em> , is a strategic document which sets out the principles which inform our transport policy; our objectives for transport; the major deliverables for the next 10 years, and changes to the delivery mechanisms at national and regional level for transport.</p>

  <p>All significant transport projects are subject to a form of environmental assessment through the Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance (STAG). The guidance provides advice to planners and decision-makers on the appraisal of transport projects where the Executive&rsquo;s support or approval is required. One of the key criteria is the impact of the proposed transport project on the environment. The Executive has also introduced regulations to comply with the UK commitments stemming from the EU Directive on Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). SEA is a systematic process for taking into account environmental concerns, including climate change, at the earliest stages of development of public sector plans and programmes, including those relating to transport. To implement the Partnership Agreement commitment on SEA, a SEA Bill is being progressed. The bill seeks to extend the scope of SEA to ensure that every public plan and programme with significant environmental implications will be assessed. STAG is currently being reviewed to ensure compliance with SEA.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports a range of transport interventions, intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the Executive has commissioned research to help us develop new guidance for local authorities on road traffic reduction which will contribute towards the reduction of transport emissions. We are also putting significant resources in a wide range of measures, including major public transport infrastructure investment, which are intended to improve travel choices, encourage modal shift towards public transport, cycling and walking and to reduce road traffic growth and transport emissions. The Scottish Executive fully supports the UK Government <em>Powering Future Vehicles</em> strategy which promotes the development, introduction and take up of cleaner fuels and is funding programmes to help the market for cleaner, low carbon vehicles and new technologies.</p>

  <p>We will evaluate transport policies as part of the formal review of the <em>Scottish Climate Change Programme</em>, due to commence later this year. The programme review will provide an opportunity for the Executive to consider whether new policies and measures are required, or if existing ones need to be strengthened.</p>

  <p>As set out in the Executive&rsquo;s White Paper <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Transport Future</em>, the proposed regional transport partnerships will carry out such transport functions as their constituent councils decide to delegate to them. The Executive will shortly be consulting on three draft models of partnership functions.</p>

  <p>To date, the following numbers of people have still to attend Fire Safety training:</p>

  <p>SPCB Staff - 193</p>

  <p>MSPs &ndash; 12</p>

  <p>MSP staff &ndash; see below</p>

  <p>Contractors &ndash; none</p>

  <p>The SPCB recommends that all regular users of the Holyrood building attend this training. We cannot give a meaningful figure as to how many members&rsquo; staff have not completed the training since we have no record of how many of these staff are regular users of the building. We can confirm, however, that 98 members&rsquo; staff have completed the training. MSPs are expected to identify whether this training is relevant for their staff as only they know whether their staff work on campus, in their local office or both. We are similarly unable to provide a definitive number of media workers still to complete this training, although 39 of them have attended to date.</p>

  <p>No individuals have been prevented from working at Holyrood as a result of not attending Fire Safety training. The SPCB recommends that all users of the Holyrood building attend this training but, with the exception of SPCB staff, does not compel them to do so. Fire safety legislation requires relevant training to be provided, but not necessarily prior to occupation of a building. Fire training courses were rolled out prior to our occupying the Holyrood building, and are still on-going.</p>
