  <p>Employers wishing to re-employ apprentices whom they have made redundant may be able to claim support under the Adopt an Apprentice scheme. However, they would need to demonstrate that the circumstances which led to the redundancies have changed and that the jobs are now sustainable. The evidence provided will be considered by Skills Development Scotland on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Government has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and healthcare needs in Scotland. CSO does not ring fence funds for specific areas of research but supports projects of a sufficiently high standard initiated by the research community in Scotland. This role is well known and advertised throughout the healthcare and academic community.</p>

  <p>In the last five years 9.6% of CSO&rsquo;s cancer research expenditure of &pound;3.5 million on directly funded research projects was spent on skin cancer.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a statutory duty under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to provide voluntary throughcare which consists of advice, guidance and assistance to people who request such a service within 12 months of their release from custody, including those released following an appeal against conviction and/or sentence.</p>

  <p>Further to this, the Miscarriage of Justice Organisation Scotland (MOJOS) has received funding under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 since 1 April 2005. The grant for 2009-10 is &pound;66,000. The grant funds MOJOS to provide a one-stop service to assist clients to gain access to benefits, housing, health services, and to provide access to counselling, reintegration and financial advice. Priority is given to supporting individuals who have had their case referred to the High Court by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, individuals released by the High Court following such a referral and individuals coming from other UK jurisdictions in similar circumstances who intend to settle in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 will come fully into force on 1 September 2009. Under the act, it will be possible for representatives of voluntary organisations to apply for an occasional licence. The Licensing Board must refuse the application if it considers that granting it would be inconsistent with one or more of the licensing objectives, which include protecting children from harm and protecting and improving public health. Where alcohol is to be sold for consumption on the premises, and children or young persons are to be allowed entry, the licence must set out the terms on which such entry is allowed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Alcohol Framework for Action sets out our next steps in tackling alcohol misuse in Scotland. The framework includes both specific legislative measures designed to effect change in the short term and actions which focus on creating and building an environment that supports cultural change in the longer term.</p>

  <p>The framework includes a commitment to continuing to work with partners to develop and promote workplace alcohol policies, noting that the workplace can be a key point of connection with individuals in the promotion of a healthier relationship with alcohol.</p>

  <p>The Standards Commission for Scotland is the body responsible for enforcement of the codes of conduct for NDPB members and investigates any complaints made.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-24192 by Roseanna Cunningham on 8 June 2009, whether it will confirm what estimated cost to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) was stated in <em>Flooding Bill Financial Implications Assessment</em> , published in September 2008; whether this figure differs from the &pound;3.34 million stated in the answer; what the explanation is of any difference, and from what source any balance of costs incurred by SEPA will be funded.</p>

  <p>I am happy to confirm that the estimated figures of &pound;3.34 million (for Directive work) and additional &pound;0.1 million (for the transfer of reservoir work) that were stated in the answer to question S3W-24192 on 8 June 2009 are the same figures that appear in the Financial Memorandum.</p>

  <p>Given that the figures provided in the above referenced answer are the same as the figures in the Financial Memorandum, there is no balance of costs to address. However, as you will be aware from the answer to question S3W-24193 on 8 June 2009, the Scottish Government intends to make available to SEPA additional funding of &pound;0.6 million in 2009-10, subject to approval by the Parliament at autumn Budget Revisions, to assist with costs incurred as a result of Directive work.</p>

  <p>Both the beavers referred to in the answer to question S3W-21047 and the wallabies on Inchconnachan Island are considered to be living outwith their natural range but for different reasons. In the case of the beavers this is because, although the species was formerly present in Scotland, they are a small population introduced deliberately for a trial to locations to which they would not have spread naturally in the foreseeable future. Wallabies are native to Australia.</p>
