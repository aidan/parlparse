  <p>There are no community care co-operatives in Scotland. There are however 79 Local Health Care Co-operatives (LHCCs).</p>

  <p>LHCCs are voluntary groupings of GPs and other local care professionals which will strengthen and support individual practices in delivering care. LHCCs are part of the internal management structure of Primary Care Trusts: they are not separately constituted bodies and they will collectively manage the resources for primary and community care. Bringing together these services is an important element of the broader strategy to promote more joined up working at local level.</p>

  <p>During my summer visits programme I visited a number of Primary Care Trusts and met with, among others, a number of LHCC Chairs. I plan to make more such visits in the future.</p>

  <p>LHCCs have only been in existence since 1 April 1999 and yet 95% of Scottish GPs are involved. The last few months have seen LHCCs deal mainly with operational issues but I hope that over the next few months we will see them become more involved in the planning and delivery of services to patients.</p>

  <p>We are keen to address financial exclusion by a variety of means and we are interested in credit unions as a possible vehicle to improving access to financial services. We are tracking the Taskforce on credit unions and we are keen to see how we can act on its recommendations. I will be meeting with the Chair of the Taskforce, Fred Goodwin in the near future. The Social Inclusion Network action team looking at the impact of local anti poverty action, including the activities of credit unions, will be reporting very shortly with ideas for the way ahead. We recognise that while there are many successful credit unions in Scotland more needs to be done if the movement is to grow significantly.</p>

  <p>Delays in discharge from hospital care can arise for many reasons. A data recording trial currently underway identifies some 40 circumstances that can contribute to a delay. It is for the care agencies to work in partnership to remove or at the very least reduce the cause of such delays.</p>

  <p>Guidance on this was issued to the NHS and local authorities in 1996 and 1998. I am arranging for copies to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. The guidance indicates that decisions on whether to discharge patients from NHS care and on how their continuing care needs can best be met should only be taken following multi-disciplinary assessment of the patient's health, social care and housing needs, and consultation with the patient's relatives or carer. The guidance also stresses that the patient's needs are paramount and that no discharge should take place until all the arrangements are in place for the continuing care of the individual in the alternative care setting proposed.</p>

  <p>A total of &pound;13.5 million, formerly paid as GP Fundholding Management Allowances has been redistributed on a weighted capitation basis to support the work of LHCCs in 1999-2000. In future years this funding will form part of Health Boards&#8217; unified budgets.</p>

  <p>The introduction of Primary Care Trusts was part of the overall reconfiguration of NHS Trusts in Scotland that is expected to yield net savings of &pound;6 million per annum. With mergers having taken place in all 12 mainland Health Board areas, the saving per Board area will be &pound;500,000 on average.</p>

  <p>The percentage of total income attributable to management costs as reported by each NHS Trust for 1997-98 and 1998-99 is given in the table below. The data relates to NHS Trusts prior to reconfiguration at April 1999. The definition of management cost upon which the Trusts base their calculations was revised in April 1998. However, the 1997-98 figures have been rebased to the revised definition and the two sets of data are therefore comparable.</p>

  <p>Fixed payments for summary criminal legal aid cases were introduced on 1 April 1999 to control a significant area of public expenditure, while maintaining access to justice.</p>

  <p>Statistical information on the effects of the introduction of fixed payments is reported to the Tripartite Consultation Group which comprises representatives of the Law Society of Scotland, the Scottish Legal Aid Board and the Scottish Executive. The Tripartite Group has been asked to monitor closely all aspects of the introduction of fixed payments.

  <p>The Home Office is currently considering the outcome of a review of police pensions undertaken last year. The review had two main objectives; to modernise the police pension scheme; and to reform aspects of the existing arrangements for retirement on medical grounds. The Scottish Executive will consider the conclusions of the Home Office review, including any measures to reduce the cost of retirements on medical grounds.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is pursuing a variety of initiatives to promote more sustainable and integrated transport in the rural areas. On 15 September, I announced grants to three community transport projects in the South of Scotland totalling nearly &pound;92,000. Other initiatives include Rural Public Passenger Transport Grants, Social Inclusion Partnerships and the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund. The Executive is also looking forward to the outcome of the feasibility study exploring the potential for the reinstatement of the rail link between Edinburgh and the Borders let in April 1999.</p>
