  <p>As agrimoney payments must be made on a UK-wide basis, I have raised the matter with my counterparts in the other UK administrations. I strongly supported the case for payment both in principle and on practical grounds. However, the decision to pay or not is a reserved matter and can only be made by the UK Government who took the view that further agrimoney expenditure could not be justified, bearing in mind the many competing demands on the public purse.</p>

  <p>Since 1997 Scottish farmers have received agrimoney compensation worth some &#163;140 million, including &#163;30 million in 2001-02.</p>

  <p>&#163;21 million was spent on the programme in 2001-02. The budgets for 2002-03 and 2003-04 are &#163;30 million and &#163;40 million respectively. The budget for the two years 2004-05 and 2005-06 will be announced later in the summer when the Executive publishes its spending plans for that period. Additional resources, which cannot be quantified at present, will come from fuel companies.</p>

  <p>The benefits of installing central heating in dwellings which lack it have long been established. They accrue to the household which receives central heating and to the taxpayer. Warm homes can lead to better health. In particular they can reduce the likelihood of cold and dampness related illnesses and the incidence of excess winter deaths. This in turn reduces demands on the health service. Warm homes are less likely to suffer from condensation dampness and so central heating helps maintain the condition of the housing stock. When central heating is coupled with insulation it can lead to lower energy consumption, hence lower fuel bills. Central heating therefore tackles fuel poverty. Lower energy consumption reduces emissions of greenhouse gases, principally CO<sub>2</sub>, and so helps combat the threat of climate change.</p>

  <p>Before the central heating programme was introduced our research showed that the households to benefit were mainly on low incomes and so would not have been able to install central heating themselves. The precise benefits, and their extent, will differ between households and cannot easily be quantified on an individual basis. But, taken as a whole, the benefits of the central heating programme are likely to far outweigh the cost.</p>

  <p>We have commissioned research linked to the central heating programme. One project will determine the extent to which beneficiaries of the programme have been taken out of fuel poverty. Another will examine health impacts. Reports on both projects will be published. We will also be publishing an annual report.</p>

  <p>There is no inaccuracy that we are aware of in the estimate that one in five women experience threats or force from a partner during their lifetime, which was used in the recent campaign. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) did, however, rule that this statistic did not justify the inference that one in five women lived with a "constant threat" which was made in some of the campaign material. All local multi-agency partnerships on domestic abuse have been informed of this ruling. They have been requested to ensure that the new wording approved by the ASA, which is "A recent survey suggests that one in five women in Scotland will experience domestic abuse within their lives", is provided in any situations in which the Executive's domestic abuse advert is used.</p>

  <p>In December 1999 the UK Government announced its four-point plan on organophosphates (OPs). This included funding a comprehensive series of research studies into areas of uncertainty that had been identified in the 1999 report from the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment. The first of these studies - commissioned by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - is due to report its findings later this year.</p>

  <p>The public services listed in the annex to the European Commission communication, <em>e-Europe 2002: Impact and Priorities</em> which fall within the Scottish Executive's responsibilities are as follows:</p>

  <p>Application for building permissions (planning and building control)</p>

  <p>Declaration to the police (e.g. in case of theft)</p>

  <p>Certificates (birth, marriage): request and delivery</p>

  <p>Health related services (e.g. interactive advice on the availability of services in different hospitals; appointments for hospitals)</p>

  <p>Submission of data to statistical offices</p>

  <p>Environment-related permits (incl. reporting)</p>

  <p>Public procurement</p>

  <p>Local authorities have statutory responsibility for public libraries. Enrolment in higher education/university is, in Scotland, the responsibility of the universities and colleges themselves. There is no compulsory requirement in the UK to notify central government of a change of address, and the UK is not therefore measured against this target. These services therefore do not feature in the above list.</p>

  <p>All other services on the list are reserved with the exception of "Job search services by labour offices" which is reserved, subject to some exceptions. The exceptions are specified in section H3 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

  <p>Scientific evidence that might lead to the withdrawal of a consent and thereby the termination of a current farm scale evaluation of genetically modified crops may be presented to the Scottish Executive from any source. The Scottish Executive would take expert advice on the credibility and relevance of any such evidence which would have to demonstrate that the release of these crops on their respective sites would represent a threat to the safety of human health or the environment. Scottish ministers have consistently stated that if they were satisfied that scientific evidence demonstrated such a threat to either human health or the environment they would withdraw consent.</p>

  <p>Since April 1996 the amount set aside for improvement and repair grants has been for each local authority to determine. No expenditure figures are yet available for the current year, 2002-03. The latest confirmed figure available for expenditure on statutory and discretionary grants for housing across the whole of Scotland is &#163;38.944 million for 2000-01.

  <p>Electronic monitoring does not have a direct effect on an offender's housing entitlement. The court is required to request a social work assessment of the suitability of the place of restriction and information as to the attitude of persons likely to be affected by the enforced presence of the offender.

  <p>There are over 3,800 Justices of the Peace in Scotland. The pro forma used to recommend someone for appointment as a justice asks for a statement of that individual's political views, if known, so that the local Justice of the Peace Advisory Committee may avoid making recommendations for appointment to ministers that would result in a disproportionate number of justices of any one party in that commission. It would not be appropriate to publish the information provided in response to this question since the individuals concerned have not been asked for permission to do so.</p>

  <p>Some justices are members of local Justice of the Peace Advisory Committees and, since these are non-departmental public bodies, the appointment procedures must comply with the UK Commissioner for <em>Public Appointments' Code of Practice</em>. The code requires that all non-executive appointees to public bodies must be asked to declare whether they have been politically active in the five years prior to their appointment. Details of those members who have declared political activity are included in the list published recently in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 20841).</p>

  <p>Some justices are local authority councillors appointed ex officio by their council. However, an effect of the Bail, Judicial Appointments etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 is that councillors may be appointed only as signing justices, that is, they may not sit on the bench of the district court.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each trust, as the employer, to recruit appropriately and to ensure that individuals have the training required to provide effective patient care.</p>

  <p>Core clinical training for professionals such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and clinical psychologists encompasses autistic spectrum disorder. Continuing Professional Development provided locally by trusts for the treatment of specific conditions will differ according to local needs.</p>

  <p>NHS Education for Scotland will bring a strategic multidisciplinary approach to education and training for staff in NHSScotland providing a useful overview in many contexts including autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

  <p>Guidance on family friendly policies including flexible working, childcare, breast-feeding and career breaks has been issued to NHSScotland as part of the new Staff Governance Standard.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive will shortly be issuing a Strategy for the Allied Health Professions which will address recruitment and retention at a strategic level and play into the proposals already announced earlier this year for workforce development.</p>

  <p>With regard to Educational Psychologists the Scottish Executive is increasing both the level of support available to each trainee educational psychologist, and the number of training places available. Scottish Executive support in this area will total over &#163;1 million each year. Trainee educational psychologists cover autism in their training and once in post have opportunities to update their knowledge through Continuing Professional Development.</p>

However, the Executive has provided funding under the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund for a pilot to explore the use of neighbourhood wardens in part of Paisley. The role of these wardens, who will be employed by Renfrewshire Council and work closely with Strathclyde Police, will be to observe and report incidents with the aim of reducing vandalism and anti-social behaviour.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The net present value calculation was made using the formula as follows:</p>

  <p>Net present value of the stream of cashflows = CF<sub>1</sub>/(1+r)<sup>1</sup> + CF<sub>2</sub>/(1+r)<sup>2</sup> + CF<sub>3</sub>/(1+r)<sup>3</sup>&#8230;..CF<sub>N</sub>/(1+r)<sup>N</sup></p>

  <p>Where:</p>

  <p>CF = Cashflow in the period</p>

  <p>r = Discount Rate</p>

  <p>N = Last period in the stream of cashflows</p>

  <p>The stream of cashflows is expressed in cash value real terms, i.e. net of inflation. The net present value (NPV) calculation has been calculated on the basis of the cashflow occurring at the end of the time period in question. Discount rates of 6% and 5% were applied to the cashflows to derive the NPVs.</p>

  <p>The cash value real figures have been calculated by determining the equivalent annual cash value real balance which, if discounted back to Cash Value Real would give a NPV equal to the figure provided by Her Majesty's Prison Service. This calculation assumes a 6% discount rate, a 25 year operating concession and a two-year construction period.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Full structural surveys, which are expensive, are not normally commissioned unless indications from visual inspections, settlement or other problems indicate that they are necessary. A visual survey was carried out in August 1994 to ascertain the extent of the problem of rain penetration through the numerous cracks in the mass concrete walls. This survey also included investigation of external wall foundations at four locations. We do not believe a full structural survey now is necessary or would be good value for taxpayers money, as we already know that the cells are too small for integral sanitation; there is no access to night sanitation; there is no electrical power in cells or in cell fire detection system; the windows are below SPS security standards and non-compliant with the current building regulations in terms of daylight factor and natural ventilation, and site services for electricity, gas, water and drainage are at full capacity, indeed at times overloaded, or in need of replacement. The term "state of exhaustion" is a brief summary of the factors which make the current accommodation not in our view fit for purpose.</p>

  <p>The Pricewaterhouse Coopers report explains why the information is not available:</p>

  <p>Para 4.2:</p>

  <p>It is clear that it is not possible to construct a detailed financial model of the PPP Private Build Public Operate model with the same degree of confidence in cost estimates as it is for the PPP Private Build Private Operate and PSC options because of the absence of any benchmark data. To have an equivalent level of certainty in such a model, there would need to be a fully worked up definition of how the model would be implemented, stating where the boundaries of risk transfer would lie, with assumptions regarding the private sector's response to the brief.</p>

  <p>Consequently, for the purpose of this initial assessment of the PPP Private Build Public Operate Option, PwC's approach has been:</p>

  <p>(a) to consider in conjunction with SPS the key issues of risk transfer and operational interface involved in implementing a PPP Private Build Public Operate Option and the implications of these for the definition of the PPP Private Build Public Operate Option and for its deliverability;</p>

  <p>(b) to undertake an outline financial assessment of the PPP Private Build Public Operate Option based upon scenario analysis of possible financial outturns relative to the PPP Private Build Private Operate and PSC options.</p>

  <p>Para 4.6.5:</p>

  <p>Unless the PPP Private Build Public Operate option is more fully specified it is not practicable to develop cost estimates which provide significantly more accuracy than the scenarios outlined above.'</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the requested calculation could not be meaningfully undertaken and would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

To have an equivalent level of certainty in such a model, there would need to be a fully worked up definition of how the model would be implemented, stating where the boundaries of risk transfer would lie, with assumptions regarding the private sector's response to the brief.</p>

  <p>Consequently, for the purpose of this initial assessment of the PPP Private Build Public Operate Option, PwC's approach has been:</p>

  <p>(a) to consider in conjunction with SPS the key issues of risk transfer and operational interface involved in implementing a PPP Private Build Public Operate Option and the implications of these for the definition of the PPP Private Build Public Operate Option and for its deliverability;</p>

  <p>(b) to undertake an outline financial assessment of the PPP Private Build Public Operate Option based upon scenario analysis of possible financial outturns relative to the PPP Private Build Private Operate and PSC options.</p>

  <p>Para 4.6.5:</p>

  <p>Unless the PPP Private Build Public Operate option is more fully specified it is not practicable to develop cost estimates which provide significantly more accuracy than the scenarios outlined above.</p>

  <p>In addition, the report also concludes in para 4.6.5:</p>

  <p>However, the above analysis demonstrates that any PPP Private Build Public Operate model has a very substantial value for money gap to bridge compared with the PPP Private Build Private Operate option and also a requirement for major changes in the approach to prison operation and staff terms and conditions within SPS to reduce its costs significantly below the PSC. The lowest cost option, Scenario 4, which assumes the possibility of replacing completely the SPS requirements for a prison design together with a 20% reduction in operating costs, will still be significantly more expensive than a PPP Private Build Private Operate option.</p>

  <p>On that basis, the work carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers fulfils the obligation to secure best value.</p>

  <p>The Secure Accommodation Advisory Group has provided a report on the availability and use of secure accommodation. I am considering the report's findings and will make an announcement on this shortly. However, in order to assist in the better strategic management of the secure estate, local authorities were asked in September 2001 to provide an estimate of their need for secure places. Borders Council indicated that their need for secure accommodation was steady annually, at one place and this need was being met.</p>

  <p>All local authorities have been asked to submit youth justice action plans to the Scottish Executive outlining the nature of offending in the area and what measures are being put in place to address this.</p>

  <p>The timing and circumstances of offending is an important factor to be taken account of in putting programs in place at local level.</p>
