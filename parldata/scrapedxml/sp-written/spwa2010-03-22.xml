Curriculum for Excellence guidance also states that every child and young person in Scotland is entitled to experience a broad general education, which includes learning modern languages, to the end of S3.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is determined to ensure that all young people have opportunities to develop a knowledge and understanding of the world and Scotland&rsquo;s place in it, a thread which runs through Curriculum for Excellence for all young people at all stages of their learning, and on into lifelong learning.</p>

  <p>The British Council is the United Kingdom National Agency for the Comenius and Erasmus Programmes, and the Scottish Government works closely with them and other international education and outward mobility organisations to promote these programmes in a coherent and joined-up manner. For example, we are currently providing funding for a three year project, led by the National Union of Students Scotland, to promote the outward mobility of Scottish students, including through the Erasmus programme.</p>

  <p>School Partnerships: pupils, teachers and other staff collaborating with partner schools and colleges in Europe</p>

  <p>Regio Partnerships: local authorities across Europe working together</p>

  <p>In-service Training: professional development in another European country</p>

  <p>Assistants: intending and trainee teacher placements in schools across Europe</p>

  <p>eTwinning: support to find partner schools in Europe and work on joint projects.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Numbers are estimated based on average involvement of 12 teachers per school.</p>

  <p>2. 2007 was the first year of the new EU Lifelong Learning Programme. Numbers of partnerships appear to be significantly lower due to a change in award structure from single-year to multi-year grants.</p>

  <p>3. The Regio strand was launched in 2008 and the first applications were submitted on 20 February 2009. Numbers are estimated based on average involvement of 6 teachers per school.</p>

  <p>4. Based on actual teacher numbers attending in-service training in another European country.</p>

  <p>5. Based on one teacher co-ordinating Comenius Assistants per host school in Scotland.</p>

  <p>6. Based on actual number of Scottish teacher registrations to the eTwinning online portal.</p>

  <p>7. The eTwinning programme was first launched in 2005 and there was a much lower uptake in its first full year than in subsequent years of the programme.</p>

  <p>The proposed Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP) for 2010-11 is lower due to the accelerated funding made available in 2008-09 and 2009-10 which came from the 2010-11 budget. It was widely known that the AHIP would be lower in 2010-11 due to this accelerated funding.</p>

  <p>At present, the &pound;9.2 million assumed for Fife is simply a Resource Planning Assumption for programme development purposes. Ministers will consider the allocations further once detailed programmes are available.</p>

  <p>Over the last three years - including the 2010-11 Resource Planning Assumptions - Fife will have had access to &pound;43.513 million of Scottish Government AHIP funding, an annual average of &pound;14.504 million. In addition, Fife has also been allocated funding from the Scottish Government for new Council House Building, funding from the Open Market Shared Equity Pilot scheme, and the Rural Homes for Rent scheme, highlighting the Scottish Government&rsquo;s support for affordable housing in Fife.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following a reduction from &pound;16.9 million to &pound;9.2 million in the funding allocated to Fife from the Affordable Housing Investment Programme, how it will support jobs in the construction industry in Fife.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has already made available &pound;120 million of accelerated funding in 2008-09 and 2009-10, which came from the 2010-11 budget, in order to support affordable housing across Scotland during the economic downturn, providing vital work for the construction industry. Fife benefited from a share of this funding.</p>

  <p>The result is that over the last three years &ndash; including the 2010-11 Resource Planning Assumptions &ndash; Fife will have had access to &pound;43.513 million of Scottish Government Affordable Housing Investment Programme funding, an annual average of &pound;14.504 million. In addition, Fife has also been allocated funding from the Scottish Government for new Council House Building, funding from the Open Market Shared Equity Pilot scheme, and the Rural Homes for Rent scheme, highlighting the Scottish Government&rsquo;s support for affordable housing and the construction industry in Fife. The only way to increase housing investment further would be for the UK Chancellor to make more money available in 2010-11 in the budget on 24 March 2010.</p>

  <p>In addition, as part of the Fife Housing Association Alliance preferred developer agreement that operates in Fife to deliver the Affordable Housing Investment Programme, the Key Performance Indicators used to monitor performance include a Training and Employment indicator. In the last two years, 145 beneficiaries of the Fife Works project are undertaking additional training not covered by mainstream provision. In addition to this, 118 individuals have secured employment opportunities and 21 work placements have been secured to date, with a number of additional placements due to start in the near future. The Fife Works project undertakes a job brokerage service which links emerging training and employment opportunities from major capital projects and procurement packages in Fife.</p>

  <p>LAS was set up in April 2008 with the aim of promoting best practice and professionalism in the private rented sector. LAS support tenants and landlords through provision of advice, guidance and training.</p>

  <p>The redundancy announcement is the result of changes to student finance service delivery for English students attending English universities, between the Student Loans Company (SLC) and the UK Government Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and is therefore a matter for the UK Government, not the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>However, whilst the Scottish Government has no powers to intervene, following the redundancy announcement I discussed the possibility of compensation for the loss of the 45 Hillington jobs with David Lammy, the UK Minister for Higher Education, by moving jobs in the Student Loan Company from England to Scotland.

  <p>However, whilst the Scottish Government has no powers to intervene, I met with the Chief Executive of the SLC on the evening prior to the redundancy announcement being made public. We discussed the help the government could provide, and I gave a commitment that the government would assist the SLC in managing this difficult situation.</p>

  <p>At an early stage my officials discussed PACE support with the SLC&rsquo;s management &ndash; PACE is our national strategic partnership framework for responding to redundancy situations. PACE is working in partnership with the SLC&rsquo;s outplacement agency to provide a wide range of support to SLC personnel including benefits information, career planning, access to government funded training, financial advice and long term support.</p>

  <p>I am regularly updated by my officials on the situation and met the chief executive again on 17 March 2010 for an update on the voluntary redundancy programme.</p>

  <p>The Code of Practice on the Use of Temporary Contracts for Teachers, developed by the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers, of which the Scottish Government is a member, states that employees on temporary contracts should not be treated any less favourably than those on permanent contracts. The Code takes into account the Employment Rights Act 1996, as amended by the Employment Relations Act 1999 and Employment Act 2002, as well as the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) and Fixed Term Workers Regulations (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) 2002.</p>

  <p>In addition two of the recommendations of the <em>Teacher Employment Working Group</em> report published last year referred to post probationers and supply work. These are:</p>

  <p>Recommendation 4: Local authority employers should wherever possible use post-probation teachers to fill supply vacancies</p>

  <p>Recommendation 5: Local authorities should consider making more use of permanent supply pools to ensure stable employment opportunities are available to post-probation teachers.</p>

  <p>The purpose of these recommendations is to help to develop more opportunities for those newly qualified by reducing the use of retired teachers in supply. The recommendations on supply are for local authorities as the employers of teachers to take forward while bearing in mind both employment and age legislation.</p>

  <p>Local authorities as employers have statutory obligations under current employment and equality legislation to promote open and fair competition. They also, however, have statutory obligations in relation to existing employees and their advertising strategy for individual posts, including access to supply lists will reflect their staffing needs and circumstances at the time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not monitor these policies. Local authorities are distinct corporate bodies whose powers and duties are set out in statute. They are responsible for ensuring that they act lawfully in managing their day to day business, which includes their employment policies in relation to teacher supply lists.</p>
