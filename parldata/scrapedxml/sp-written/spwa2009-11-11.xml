  <p>The Scottish Government is working with the Violence Reduction Unit, Association of Chief Police Officers, local Community Safety Partnerships and other partners to tackle knife crime in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Through CashBack for Communities, we will invest at least &pound;13 million through to 2011 in youth diversionary activities to help keep young people out of trouble and away from knives. We are investing &pound;1.6 million between 2008-10, through the Violence Reduction Unit, to support the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV), an innovative gang violence reduction programme in the east end of Glasgow, which will also impact on knife crime. We are investing &pound;500,000 in &quot;No Knives, Better Lives&quot;, a young engagement campaign launched in May 2009. This year we have invested &pound;400,000 in the Safer Streets programme, to support Community Safety Partnerships in delivering crime reduction measures, including knife crime.</p>

  <p>The implementation of the Disabled Persons&rsquo; Parking Places (Scotland) Act 2009 is a matter for local authorities, not the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The provisions of the act state that local authorities have until 30 September 2010 to initiate the statutory process for disabled parking spaces that they wish to make enforceable, and to remove those advisory disabled spaces that are no longer needed. In 2011, local authorities must report to Scottish ministers outlining their completed implementation process and then on an annual basis thereafter.</p>

  <p>The full financial contract value of the contracts issued to training providers based in Dumfries and Galloway is &pound;319,725 for skillseekers and &pound;750,566 for modern apprenticeships.</p>

  <p>This may differ from end year values based on performance/uptake in-year. These figures include the costs for trainees who are trained by Dumfries and Galloway-based providers but live outside of the area, but excludes the value of contracts for other providers not based in the Dumfries and Galloway area, who have Dumfries and Galloway resident trainees.</p>

  <p>External flooding can be caused by insufficient capacity of the sewers to take the required volumes of sewerage or by operational issues such as blockages. In 2008-09, Scottish Water removed over 6,000 blockages, many of which were caused by customers disposing (illegally) of cooking fat down their sink or by flushing away sanitary waste. In most cases, instances of external flooding due to blockages are resolved through operational measures. For capacity issues, Scottish Water deals with some external sewer flooding as a consequence of investing to address internal flooding problems. In addition, where possible, Scottish Water speaks to local authorities about external sewer flooding when there are issues of surface water entering the sewers, as there can be practicable alternatives which divert this water away from the sewers in a safe manner.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has had discussions with the BMA about the decision to change the split of duties in new NHS consultant posts from 7.5 direct clinical care and 2.5 supporting professional activities to nine direct clinical care and one supporting professional activity.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-11-11.S3W-28216.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1111.htm#9">

  <p>Section 4.2.2 of the current Consultant Grade Terms and Conditions of Service states that, &quot;unless otherwise agreed, a full-time consultant will devote 7.5 programmed activities per week to direct clinical care, and 2.5 programmed activities to supporting professional activities&quot;. Flexibility around that mix of programmed activities has always been available under those terms and conditions of service and has been, and remains, a matter of negotiation between an employing NHS board and a prospective consultant employee. There has been no single decision in relation to that flexibility or to the ultimate split between direct clinical care and supporting professional activities for new consultant posts.</p>

  <p>That flexibility had resulted in new consultant posts being advertised on different bases between NHS boards in Scotland. In the interests of consistency of approach, the management steering group representing NHS Scotland employers issued guidance to all NHS boards earlier this year to the effect that all new consultant posts should be advertised on a starting basis of nine direct clinical care programmed activities to one supporting professional activity. I understand that this guidance is intended to maximise direct clinical care activity while ensuring that necessary supporting professional activity still takes place. The actual split of activity for any individual post is finally agreed between the service and the new consultant appointed; taking into account local circumstances and needs. Current experience shows that, where those circumstances and needs require it, the actual split will vary from the starting 9/1 position.</p>

  <p>I have received and responded to written and face-to-face representations from the BMA regarding the employer guidance on the consultant contract, as have my officials. In all of those discussions, the Scottish Government has made clear that the guidance was issued by the NHS employers, not the Scottish Government, and that any issues which arise from it are matters for NHS boards and the BMA.</p>
