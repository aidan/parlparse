  <p>It is estimated that cost penalties of around &pound;14 million would be incurred if the Holyrood Project were to be cancelled. Some of this might be recouped if the vacant site could later be sold.</p>

  <p>Early estimates of the likely running costs of a Parliament building at Holyrood made in March 1998, produced a figure of around &pound;10 million per annum. These estimates will be refined, as more information on building systems, rateable value and capital charge becomes available.</p>

  <p>No. I understand however that the City of Edinburgh Council has received a report on the management, structure and role of organisations and projects in Craigmillar. The council is following up points arising from this report.</p>
