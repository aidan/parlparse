  <p>A new charging regime was introduced on 5 April 1999 through Regulations made under the terms of the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999. Under the new arrangements, individuals are no longer charged an emergency treatment fee for hospital attendances following a road traffic accident in which they were involved. NHS charges only become payable when an insurance company pays compensation under a personal injury claim in respect of a road traffic accident.</p>

  <p>In practice, NHS charges are met by insurance companies and not passed on to the individual concerned. Neither the individual&#146;s entitlement to personal injury compensation or the amount awarded is affected by the charge recovery.</p>

  <p>The new charging arrangements apply to all cases where compensation is or has been paid in respect of accidents from 2 July 1997. The charges are:</p>

  <p>Treatment without inpatient admission: flat rate charge of &pound;354</p>

  <p>Treatment with admission: daily rate of &pound;435 subject to a ceiling of &pound;10,000</p>

  <p>The charges have been set to reflect the actual costs to the NHS as a whole for treating road traffic accident victims.</p>

  <p>Information on hospitals which provided acute inpatient paediatric services in each Health Board area during the year to 31 March 1999 is provided in the Table.</p>

  <p>Health Service strategies are kept under review as part of the Health Improvement Programme process introduced in 1998. Every Health Board must set out its intentions annually for service developments in its area for the following five years. Where a planned development represents a significant change of use of a hospital or contains proposals for hospital closure, there must be full public consultation. Health Boards currently carrying out a review of acute paediatric services are shown in the Table.</p>

  <p>Until the contract for a PFI funded project has been signed, and the development is available for use, no revenue costs fall on the NHS Trust concerned.

  <p>The 3 Health Boards and 6 Trusts serving Central Scotland (Ayrshire and Arran, Forth Valley and Lanarkshire) are refining their established clinical audit systems to reflect the new Trust configurations and their strategies for clinical effectiveness and patient/client focussed care. This is a high priority for all General Managers and Chief Executives in the NHS in Scotland and is signalled clearly in Health Improvement Programmes (HIPs), copies of which can be obtained from health Board Headquarters.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will seek to ensure that all people in Scotland, irrespective of ethnic origin, benefit from its housing policies and the housing programmes of Scottish Homes and local authorities. The new Race Equality Advisory Forum will advise on a strategy dealing with broader racial equality issues, including housing. It will also encourage the creation of long term partnerships across communities to address such issues effectively.</p>

  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government which therefore takes the lead on the funding and delivery of the New Deal throughout Great Britain, although in close consultation with its partners, including the Scottish Executive. Many partner organisations at local level also provide New Deal services under contract or provide funds and other resources, including training funds to enhance the quality of New Deal in their areas. The public and voluntary sector organisations which contribute to the New Deal in this way fall within the remit of the Scottish administration.</p>
