  <p>In 2007-08 the Scottish Government granted the Edinburgh Interfaith Association &pound;12,500 to develop two youth &quot;identity projects&quot; one for Muslim young men and the other aimed at Sikh young men. The funding allowed the project to develop 15 week workshops which enabled participants to develop a sense of &quot;self&quot; and belonging.

  <p>Ministers have no plans to convene such a meeting. Ministers met with both Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) and the Glasgow and West of Scotland Forum in June. Both have committed to discuss the issues raised in the Mazars report and explore the areas identified in the Scottish Housing Regulator&rsquo;s assessment. Their agreed objective is to make SST happen. Ministers welcome the fact that these meetings are now underway and that a positive start has been made.</p>

  <p>The grant allocation at the beginning of each financial year is a single figure which includes provision for all relevant elements of the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP). In addition to Housing Association Grant, this includes grant mechanisms such as Rural Home Ownership Grant, Rural Empty Property grants, Grant for the Physical and Social Environment and Special Needs Capital grants. Housing Association Grant allocation is not recorded separately.</p>

  <p>The amount of AHIP funding allocated to South Lanarkshire Council at the beginning of each year from 2002-03 onwards is set out in the table below. Records are not held prior to 2002-03 in the manner requested.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government through sportscotland invested &pound;71,463 in Scottish Amateur Rowing Association in 2007-08 to increase participation and improve performance in the sport. A participation manager was appointed in 2006 to ensure young people across Scotland have access and opportunities to take up rowing.</p>

  <p>There are currently three indoor rowing projects in Aberdeen, Glasgow and Inverness which link into schools and are designed to get young people interested in the sport.</p>

  <p>This funding has also been used to supply adaptive rowing equipment to ensure accessibility of the sport for participants with a disability.</p>

  <p>Funding for upgrading and developing new rowing facilities can be applied for through sportscotland&rsquo;s Building for Sport programme. Funding is also available for rowing clubs to attract young people through the Awards for All and Sportsmatch lottery programmes.</p>

  <p>Rowing is also now eligible for support from the Area Institute network and work is currently underway to develop the performance selection criteria for athletes to receive additional support provision.</p>
