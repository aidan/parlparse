  <p>I understand that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) has no plans at present to develop clinical standards for services for adults with asthma, to complement those for children and young people with asthma which it published in March 2007.</p>

  <p>In 2008, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) published jointly with the British Thoracic Society SIGN Guideline 101, <em>British Guideline on the Management of Asthma</em>, covering adult as well as paediatric treatment and care.</p>

  <p>Through our encouragement, each NHS board now has a respiratory managed clinical network (MCN). It is one of the core principles of all MCNs that they should use a documented evidence base, such as SIGN Guidelines. Accordingly, SIGN Guideline 101 forms part of the respiratory MCNs&rsquo; evidence base and this will inform standards of care for adults with asthma.</p>

  <p>The asthma guideline is updated annually, and work is presently under way on the revision of the 2009 version.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of current restructuring in preparation for the formation of Creative Scotland, what discussions it has had with the Scottish Arts Council on the continuing concerns of small organisations regarding their funding for the forthcoming year.</p>

  <p>No specific discussions have taken place. The Scottish Arts Council is continuing with &quot;business as usual&quot; until Creative Scotland is established, and the legislation makes it clear that Creative Scotland will honour all funding arrangements entered into by the Scottish Arts Council. We have specifically preserved the level of funding for Creative Scotland, despite the difficult financial settlement this year.</p>

  <p>The Joint Board of the Scottish Arts council and Scottish Screen announced on 15 December 2009 that &pound;7.98 million would be available for organisations to apply for flexible funding of over &pound;50,000 from 2011 to 2013. The deadline for organisations to apply was 5 March 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council&rsquo;s first open application funding round will start soon and details of the funds available will be published on 23 April 2010. Creative Scotland will honour all these commitments.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to ensure that people with type 1 diabetes are aware of the impact of not taking their medication.</p>

  <p>For people with type 1 diabetes, insulin regimes are essential for good glucose control, to ensure that the risks of diabetes-related complications are minimised. People with type 1 diabetes are made fully aware of the importance of taking insulin when they are diagnosed with the condition. This is followed up through regular clinical reviews, either within general practice, or with hospital consultants where appropriate, at which individual glucose control and adherence to medication are monitored. The 2009 Scottish Diabetes Survey shows that over 87% of people with type 1 diabetes had their blood glucose control recorded in the previous 15 months, mainly as a result of the diabetes domain in the Quality Outcomes Framework of the new GMS contract.</p>

  <p>The importance of controlling blood glucose levels, and the medications required to help people do so, are highlighted in the booklet for patients and carers issued to accompany the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 116 on the management of diabetes, published in March 2010. It also features strongly in the management and monitoring sections of the mydiabetesmyway website. We recognise that effective self management of this type requires access to high quality information and emotional and psychological support, and that will be reflected in the revised <em>Scottish Diabetes Action Plan</em> which we expect to be published in the near future.</p>

  <p>We recognise the importance of raising awareness of diabetes so that the condition can be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Raising awareness of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes is one of the issues that will be addressed in the revised Scottish Diabetes Action Plan. We have invested in the &quot;Keep Well&quot; and &quot;Well North&quot; programmes, which offer health checks in our most deprived communities to those at highest risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Much of type 2 diabetes can be prevented through the adoption of healthier lifestyles. This is something we are committed to promoting through our Take Life On campaign which is available at <a href="http://www.takelifeon.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.takelifeon.co.uk/</a> .</p>

  <p>The Institute of Physics&rsquo; Lab in a Lorry project is one of a number of initiatives that takes inspiring science activities to schools around Scotland. It plays a useful role in supporting the formal teaching of science in our secondary schools, and gives young people access to information about careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (the STEM subjects). The Institute of Physics has been awarded annual funding since 2007 for Lab in a Lorry, through the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Science Engagement Grants scheme. A further award of &pound;25,000 for the project was announced through a Scottish Government news release issued on 26 April 2010. This grant, for activity in the 2010-11 financial year, will support Lab in a Lorry visiting 70 secondary schools across Scotland, including the Highlands and Islands, and science centres in Glasgow and Dundee. The project will reach an expected audience of 16,000 people.</p>

  <p>On 21 January the First Minister was questioned in the Scottish Parliament about an exchange of letters between the Minister for Environment and the Home Office concerning the placing of paths across the Balmoral estate. The First Minister explained that the Scottish Government had asked the Home Office to institute a leak inquiry to establish how this breach in the principle of confidentiality of communications, particularly on sensitive matters such as Royal security, had come about.</p>

  <p>I can now report the following:</p>

  <p>i. an investigation was conducted by the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, with the full co-operation and assistance of Scottish Government staff, in parallel with the investigation by the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government;</p>

  <p>ii. the Scottish Government contribution to these investigations established conclusively that the source was not a Scottish Government civil servant, despite the allegations to this effect which were given prominence in the press at the time;</p>

  <p>iii. the First Minister has had constructive discussions with Sir Gus O'Donnell, Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Home Civil Service, about how to deliver their shared objective of preventing unauthorised disclosure of inter-Governmental correspondence, and</p>

  <p>iv. Sir Gus O'Donnell has assured the First Minister that he views such breaches of confidentiality as unacceptable and that he has ensured that appropriate lessons have been learned.</p>

Local authorities would be expected to fund 65% of the purchase price of any homes brought into the national housing trust initiative in their area.

  <p>The Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) plans to provide support for the national housing trust (NHT) initiative by setting it up and providing staffing to co-ordinate the management of the initiative. The SFT, along with participating local authorities, will play a key role in overseeing the progress of the initiative as a whole.</p>

  <p>Some of the likely tenants for homes provided through the national housing trust (NHT) initiative are already using short assured tenancy agreements in private rented housing. The 2009 Scottish Government Review of the Private Rented Sector showed that the majority of private tenants surveyed seemed generally content with the short assured tenancy regime.</p>

  <p>The NHT initiative aims to offer affordable, good quality homes for rent to tenants on low to moderate incomes who would struggle to afford private renting or to buy a home, but are unlikely to be able to access social rented housing in the near future. Properties would be let on renewable short assured tenancy agreements because the scheme has been designed to last between five and 10 years in order to attract private sector investment whilst securing high value for taxpayers&rsquo; money. Prospective tenants would be made aware that the NHT initiative was not offering a permanent home, but a viable alternative to waiting potentially years for a social rented home, so they would need to be comfortable with this before signing a tenancy agreement.</p>

  <p>In addition, many tenants may choose to move on before homes are sold or others could potentially be given the option to buy their NHT home.</p>

  <p>Services should be offered locally where possible, however both the highly specialist and unpredictable nature of neonatal services means they cannot always be provided locally. It is regrettable when babies and/or pregnant women have to be transferred to another unit but we recognise that on occasion this may be appropriate or necessary.</p>

  <p>We have a dedicated 24 hour neonatal transport system which surpasses arrangements in the rest of the UK, with dedicated and professional staff who provide high quality care to these babies and their families.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Neonatal Transport Service will only transport sick infants when there is a clear clinical need, such as the need for intensive care, a cardiac condition requiring surgery or ECMO. The team will also transfer infants back to the referring unit and this accounts for 40% of the team&rsquo;s annual activity.</p>

  <p>The number of neonatal transfers were fewer in previous years due to service limitations. As both specialist services and the Scottish Ambulance Service have continued to evolve, sick and premature babies can receive the most appropriate treatment and best possible care from this excellent system.</p>

  <p>A review of the Scottish Neonatal Transport System has recently been completed which concluded that the service is staffed appropriately to respond to current demands, however the demands on the service will continue to be monitored.</p>

  <p>We have a dedicated 24 hour neonatal transport system which surpasses arrangements in the rest of the UK, with dedicated and professional staff who provide high quality care to these vulnerable babies and their families.</p>

  <p>The Perinatal Collaborative Transport Study commissioned by Quality Improvement Scotland in 2008, captured information about in-utero transfers in Scotland not previously known. It provides reassurance that transfers are being managed in line with agreed pathways of care.

  <p>Neonatal transfers only take place when it is in the best interests of mother and baby. We would expect NHS boards to ensure that both the accommodation and transitional care facilities for parents of ill babies who are a distance from home is of an appropriate standard.</p>

  <p>The day-to-day management of NHS property, including accommodation issues related to service needs, is devolved to NHS boards to undertake and prioritise in line with their property and asset management strategies. This would include any necessary improvements associated with the outcomes of service reviews.</p>

  <p>Best practice guidance available to NHS boards is published by Health Facilities Scotland (HFS). The current guidance for the provision of maternity services is the English Health Building Note HBN 09-02: <em>Maternity care facilities</em>, which HFS are presently looking to adapt for use in Scotland.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland has developed, tested and begun implementation of a neonatal nursing workload and workforce planning tool that will identify the nursing needs of this vulnerable group of babies. This tool takes in account the British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM) staffing recommendations and will capture actual nursing workload on a real-time basis. The implementation of this tool will help to develop quality measures for neonatal care, and equip boards with valuable information that will inform their planning and provision of services. Neonatal units have been collecting the data for six months and the Nursing &amp; Midwifery Workload and Workforce Planning Programme are now analysing the data.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that this vulnerable group of babies receives the highest quality of care, by the most appropriate professional, at all times. We know that admissions to neonatal units are not always predictable, that the level of care a baby requires may change at any given time, and that units have the responsibility to look after safely all of the babies in their care. Staffing and levels of care provided must be flexible to cope with this change in demand.</p>

  <p>Since 30 September 2008, the number of paediatric consultants has increased from 218 to 288 an increase of 70 (whole-time equivalent) 32.5%.

  <p>The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA), which is reserved to Westminster, protects disabled people from discrimination in employment, access to goods, facilities and services, the buying, renting or selling of land or property, education, transport and the exercise of public functions. The (DDA) defines a disabled person as someone who has a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his or her ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. Enforcement of the DDA is a matter for the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the courts and tribunals</p>

  <p>Elections for membership of the House of Commons, the European Parliament and the Scottish Parliament are matters reserved to Westminster under Schedule 5, Head B3 of the Scotland Act 1998. Accordingly the Mental Health Act 1983, section 141(8), which was amended by the Scotland Act 1998 relates to Members of the Scottish Parliament suffering from mental illness.</p>

  <p>In such a case the Presiding Officer will arrange for two registered medical practitioners to be appointed to report back to him/her on whether a member is suffering from a detainable mental disorder. If the report is to the effect that the member is suffering from mental disorder and authorised to be detained the Presiding Officer will arrange for the member to be visited and examined by two registered medical practitioners six months after the date of the original report. If the second report is that the member is suffering from mental disorder and authorised to be detained the Presiding Officer will lay both reports before the Scottish Parliament, whereupon the seat of the member will become vacant.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to the principle of non-discrimination. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, which is the basis of Scottish mental health law, is based around a set of principles which provide for non-discrimination, equality and diversity and respect.</p>

  <p>FSA recommendations for milk consumption for children under five formed the basis of the Nutritional Guidance for Early Years for children aged one to five years in early education and childcare settings published in 2006.</p>

  <p>The Nutritional Guidance for Early Years advises that plain drinking milk should be available as an option every day. For one-year-olds, who are not still being breastfed, whole cow&rsquo;s milk should be the main milk drink until the child is at least two years old. From age two, semi-skimmed milk may be introduced as long as the child is eating well and getting enough energy and nutrients from a varied diet. The guidance states that fully skimmed milk is not suitable for children under five years.</p>

  <p>The guidance states that where only one type of milk is available (e.g. in the nursery setting) whole milk should be provided and that flavoured milks are unsuitable because of their high sugar content.</p>

  <p>Provision of services for people with learning difficulties and learning disability is increasingly based on the principle of improving access to mainstream services. Lip-reading courses are provided by a range of different community agencies, such as health, social work, and further education. The providers of the courses are responsible for making their services accessible to their local communities and classes across Scotland are locally determined and are variable.</p>

  <p>Individuals with learning difficulties or learning disability may join local lip-reading classes, but maybe more likely to have one to one sessions as part of an individual support package. Lip-reading is a difficult skill for adults who lose their hearing in later life to acquire. It will be even more difficult for those with learning difficulties and for learning disabled people, especially if they do not have an established language base. Speech and language therapists will often be involved in the assessment of the communication skills of a learning disabled person and would recommend strategies to improve these which would involve their carers.</p>

  <p>Information on waiting times for speech and language therapy is not currently collected centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has funded, as part of the National Workforce and Workload Programme, a project to develop an extension to the Allied Health Professions (AHP) data set. This will allow more detailed and accurate information to be captured in relation to AHP activity and workload.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it will ensure that care charities, such as Caithness Crossroads and East Sutherland Crossroads, continue to receive sufficient funding to enable them to continue to operate, in light of increasing demand for home-care respite services and the pressures on services from insufficient funding.</p>

  <p>In 2010-11 the Scottish Government is providing &pound;42,369 to Crossroads Caring Scotland under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. Crossroads helps develop local services throughout Scotland, providing practical support, including respite, for carers and their families.</p>

  <p>Under the 1968 Act, the Scottish Government funds Scotland-wide organisations, rather than locally-based ones. Crossroads Caring Scotland can support locally based Crossroads services to apply for funding from various sources.</p>

  <p>Following the concordat with COSLA, the Scottish Government provided extra funding of &pound;4.19 million between 2009 and 2011 to local authorities to help them deliver by 2011 the concordat commitment to an additional 10,000 respite weeks. Highland Council&rsquo;s share of these additional resources is &pound;0.175 million. It is a matter for Highland Council to work with partners to deliver flexible, personalised short breaks provision.</p>

  <p>We will be publishing the Young Carers and Carers Strategy in June this year. It will include a chapter on short breaks/respite provision.</p>
