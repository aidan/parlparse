  <p>All NHS boards have assured us that they are on track to achieve their interim performance indicators by December 2010. The HEAT target for reducing waiting times to drug treatment is to be achieved by March 2013.</p>

  <p>Prior to agreeing the HEAT target for reducing waiting times to drug treatment, Scottish Government officials consulted with all NHS boards to ensure that the target was realistic and achievable. In March 2010, every NHS board submitted local delivery plans to the Scottish Government outlining plans for delivery of the performance indicators.</p>

  <p>As part of the overall drug and alcohol HEAT project, an improvement support programme is being developed to proactively support NHS boards achieve the target. As part of an annual review process, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing and the Minister for Public Health and Sport hold NHS boards to account for the services they deliver. This involves meetings with each board which are held in public and at which any performance issues are raised as appropriate. Any follow-up action required as a result is formally recorded and subsequently monitored.</p>

  <p>As Minister for Community Safety with the remit for drugs rehabilitation and the national strategy, <em>The Road to Recovery</em> , I communicate to NHS boards through the mechanism of the joint partnerships of alcohol and drug partnerships. I have discussed the national drugs strategy, <em>The Road to Recovery, </em> with 11 alcohol and drug partnerships, as referred to in the following table, since May 2009 and there was a NHS board representative at all these meetings. This engagement is continuing through the summer period.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that UK public sector net borrowing should be returned to a sustainable level at the earliest opportunity. The management of the public finances by the previous UK Government means that a substantial period of fiscal adjustment is now unavoidable. This adjustment should be achieved by promoting economic growth which will increase tax receipts and reduce welfare spending. In contrast, the austerity measures proposed by the new UK Government risk undermining the recovery and doing further damage to the public finances by cutting public spending too fast and too deeply. This emphasises the urgent need for the Scottish Government to acquire significantly greater fiscal responsibilities, to ensure the planned fiscal consolidation does not damage Scotland&rsquo;s economic recovery.</p>

  <p>Ministers will continue to encourage institutions to look critically at the scope for efficiencies and other savings, whether through collaboration or merger or in other ways. Ministers engage closely with colleges and have a keen interest in all such initiatives. Their engagement with colleges sits alongside the statutory responsibility of the Scottish Funding Council for the delivery of a coherent system of higher and further education. Like all other non-departmental public bodies, the funding council is expected to secure the best value from the resources at its disposal.</p>

  <p>In addition the Scottish Government published a report on 14 May 2010 which provided information on the proportion of businesses which saw their rates increase or decrease. That report shows that following the 2010 revaluation almost 60% of ratepayers saw bills fall or remain the same and that the average saving was over &pound;1,300 in 2010-11. That figure of 60% is before the impact of reliefs and appeals, both of which will lower bills further. The report can be found at:</p>

  <p>For most contracts, there is no need to include clauses requiring a contractor to comply with legal obligations that govern the conduct of its business. In some cases, the purchaser may decide to apply such clauses to address particular concerns regarding compliance in relation to the type of product or service being bought.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to fluoridate the public water supply. The Water (Fluoridation) Act 1985 places the onus on NHS boards, based on local consultations and full support of the general public, to apply to Scottish Water if they wish to introduce a fluoridation scheme. The majority of people that responded to a 2002 consultation document were against the idea.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improving oral health, particularly in children, and widening access to NHS dentistry. On 20 March 2007, the Scottish Government launched the roll out of the school based dental service Childsmile School targeting the most deprived areas of Scotland. Recent statistics have also shown a rise in the number of NHS dentists and an increase in the number of patients, including children, registered with an NHS dentist. For example, we have met the 2008-09 dental HEAT target that 80% of all three to five-year-old children to be registered with an NHS dentist by 2010-11. In the period ending March 2008 the registration percentage of three to five-year-olds was 77.3%. This rose to 84.4% in the quarter ending March 2009.And one of the Scottish targets set for the year 2010 was that 60% of P7 children should be free of obvious dental decay experience. The recently published National Dental Inspection Programme report (2009) shows that the 63.6% P7 children in NHS boards across Scotland showed no signs of obvious decay experience in their permanent teeth.</p>
