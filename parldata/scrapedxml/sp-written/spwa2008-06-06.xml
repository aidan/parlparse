  <p>Local authorities have the power to make byelaws to prohibit drinking in designated public places under provisions contained in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, subject to confirmation by the Scottish ministers.

  <p>Note: 1. Registrations are based on the postcode of the practice as opposed to the postcode of the patient. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of registrations by the resident population for the particular area/age group etc. This has led to percentages greater than 100.</p>

  <p>As part of the development of the Scottish Futures Trust, a wide range of concepts was developed. The main concepts which were &quot;parked&quot; at stages 1 and 2 of the shortlisting in the options appraisal process for the Scottish Futures Trust, as outlined in Chapter 6 of <em>Taking Forward the Scottish Futures Trust</em> (Bib. number 45605) are given in the following tables. As the development work on Scottish Futures Trust continues, these concepts may be considered again.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, further to the answer to question S3W-12753 by Alex Fergusson, whether the process used was consistent with both the Scottish Parliament Corporate Body&rsquo;s procedures for advertising posts which state that &quot;The SPCB is committed to fairness of treatment in relation to the processes used for filling posts whether it is through open recruitment or by internal means&quot; and the SPCB&rsquo;s equalities framework which states that the senior management team is fully committed to &quot;equality of opportunity and treatment&quot;.</p>

  <p>As this post is not part of the SPCB staff complement the method of filling the vacancy did not fall under the agreed procedures for filling posts. However, in assigning a member of staff to this post, the approach was consistent with the SPCB&rsquo;s procedures for filling posts. They state that the Chief Executive may, in exceptional circumstances, make such appointments deemed necessary in the interests of the organisation without following the full procedures.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, further to the answer to question S3W-12753 by Alex Fergusson, whether the processes used to staff the Calman Commission were fully consistent with paragraph 5 of the procedures for the advertising of posts, and if so, what was deemed &quot;exceptional&quot;.</p>

  <p>I refer to my answer to S3W-13349. The exceptional circumstance was that the Chief Executive was acting under a general direction of the Parliament. It should be further noted that this is a short-term assignment and does not involve the creation of a new post within the parliamentary staff organisation.</p>
