  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has reviewed the use of neonicotinoid pesticides on crops, following their ban in Germany due to evidence that their use is connected to the reduction of the honeybee population.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-08-05.S3W-15182.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0805.htm#2">

  <p>All pesticides are subjected to a rigorous approval process before they are approved by ministers for use. In the case of neonicotinoid pesticides the risks posed to insects and bees were researched and assessed as part of that approval process.</p>

  <p>The situation in Germany appears to be the result of an error in the application of a seed treatment containing the active substance clothianidin, a neonicotinoid pesticide. Clothianidin is not widely used in Scotland and Scottish ministers are not aware of any problem affecting bees as a consequence of its use here. We will, however, keep a close watch on the situation with seed treatments and clothianidin in particular.</p>

  <p>The new entrants measure, along with other measures included within Land Management Contracts - Rural Priorities, opened for submission of proposals in July 2008. It is too early, therefore, for the measure to have had a quantifiable impact on the number of new entrants to farming.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not commissioned or undertaken any studies on the role of new <strong> </strong> nuclear power stations in helping to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that Scotland neither wants nor needs new nuclear power. We believe that improved energy efficiency measures, together with renewable energy generation and clean coal and carbon capture technology, will meet our energy requirements, while also contributing to our 2050 emissions reductions target.</p>
