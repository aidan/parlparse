  <p>Our guiding principles are the need to comply properly with EC regulations whilst ensuring that we do not impose any unnecessary or unreasonable burden on the agriculture industry.</p>

  <p>All EU regulations, which impact on producers, were the subject of detailed scrutiny by a recent Red Tape Review panel of industry representatives. The panel investigated the perception that the UK over-interprets EC regulations and applies them more stringently than other members states but concluded this was not the case.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of the threat to male health which prostate cancer can pose, but there is no clear consensus internationally on the best way to treat prostate cancer. The issues involved in improving the care of those with prostate cancer are being actively considered by the Lead Clinician for Cancer Services and the Scottish Cancer Group. Meanwhile, anyone worried about symptoms, which might be suggestive of this type of cancer, should seek medical advice.</p>

  <p>Improvements in survival from cancer are already evident. For example, five-year survival from breast cancer is now 75%, compared to 66% in the 1980s. In men with testicular cancer, more than 90% are alive after five years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is determined to continue to tackle the challenges posed by cancer in all its forms and cancer is one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A great deal of work is already underway ranging from health promotion, earlier detection, improved treatment and care through to palliative and terminal care.</p>

  <p>This includes a continuing commitment to breast and cervical screening and a pilot programme of colorectal cancer screening. Led by the Scottish Cancer Group, cancer-specific managed clinical networks are being set in place. Underpinned by robust quality assurance/prospective audit systems and committed to sharing good practice for the benefit of patients across the country, the focus of these networks is on continuous quality improvements in patient care. Additional one stop clinics are being established and the reduction of waiting times for cancer diagnosis and treatment is a high priority for the Scottish Cancer Group. Clinical standards for cancer services &#8211; developed in collaboration with patients and carers &#8211; will be piloted during spring/summer 2000 by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland.</p>

  <p>As I advised Dr Murray in my answer to S10-1175 and S1W-5979, spending on drug treatment services by health boards has been boosted by &pound;6 million over a three-year period to 2002, bringing the annual spend to &pound;11.352 million. This represents a 20% rise on previous levels. The level of funding available to health boards for drug misuse services beyond the current financial year will be decided within the context of this year&#8217;s spending round.</p>

  <p>Funding for services for drug and alcohol addiction is also provided via local authorities. They received increases of &pound;51.3 million (4.9%) for 1999-2000 and &pound;43.4 million for 2000-01, in each case over the previous year, for social work services. However, as I have previously indicated in response to earlier questions, funding to health boards for the provision of services for alcohol misuse, and to local authorities for either the treatment services of drug or alcohol addiction are not earmarked.</p>

  <p>Following the debate on 2 December 1999 and the Parliament&#8217;s endorsement of the Executive&#8217;s statement <i>Towards an Equality Strategy: a Framework</i> , the Executive undertook a consultation exercise to assist it in developing its strategy.

The Executive welcomes the interest taken and is grateful for all the responses sent in.</p>

  <p>A more detailed analysis of the responses is now being undertaken. Responses to the consultation will be made publicly available. This final report of the consultation will be made available to Parliament in June and submitted to the Equal Opportunities Committee for its consideration. The Executive would like to receive the views of the Equal Opportunities Committee prior to finalising its strategy and programme of action.</p>

  <p>The Executive also intends to hold further discussion with equality interests in the summer.</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued in March 1999 to the NHS and local authorities on <i>Services for Women with Postnatal Depression</i> . This offered advice on identification and the best organisation of multi-agency care and support for mothers and their families, and placed emphasis on the physical and mental well-being of mothers and children.</p>

  <p>I also announced on 1 February that the Scottish Executive intended to work with relevant interests in the development of a National Framework for Maternity Services. Work on this is now underway and will include consideration of post-natal care and support.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises and encourages the valuable contribution that the voluntary sector makes in raising funds for and in commissioning medical research. We are also committed to ensuring that our agencies, non-departmental public bodies and the NHSiS actively encourage and promote the work of the voluntary sector. As an example of this, the Chief Scientist&#8217;s office is currently funding a small research project to the value of over &pound;8,000 on enhancing the relationship between health voluntary organisations and the NHSiS.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans, however, for the integration of the NHSiS with the voluntary sector in relation to medical research.</p>

  <p>The capital spending of authorities would remain public expenditure even if the requirement for local authorities to have the consent of Scottish Ministers to undertake capital spending were abolished. This would have to be reflected in public spending totals, which would not themselves change. In these circumstances, an adjustment to the assigned budget to reflect the changed treatment of local authority capital spending may be appropriate, and consequently there may be no net benefit to the Assigned Budget or, ultimately, local authority spending.</p>

  <p>In our <i>Programme for Government</i> , we made a commitment to work across the Executive to promote modern government, of which one of the main themes would be customer-focused policy development and service delivery.</p>

  <p>We will put the citizen at the centre through our commitment to inclusive policy-making, and civic participation in all its forms. The public can make a real contribution to better policies at both local and national level. We are encouraging that contribution through our support for the Scottish Civic Forum, through the &pound;3 million Listening to Communities programme, through the &pound;10 million Working for Communities programme and through the increasing use of the possibilities offered by the Internet.</p>

  <p>We will also work across the public sector to deliver citizen-focused services that are provided in such a way as to meet the needs of the citizens, not the convenience of the service provider. In particular, we will seek to overcome obstacles to joined-up working through a variety of means, and will seek to involve and meet the needs of all different groups in society. For example, the First Minister announced on 30 March his decision that the Executive&#8217;s target for delivery of 100% of its services online by 2008 was being brought forward to 2005. At a practical level, I recently announced the &pound;25 million Modernising Government Fund, which is designed to help take forward projects involving the innovative provision of improved public services, and particularly encourages partnership working.</p>

These will be published as soon as possible, having regard to work demands in other high priority areas. The Notes on Sections will provide an update to the Notes on Clauses published in January and July 1998. Copies will be made available in SPICe once work is complete.</p>

  <p>Jackie Baillie, Deputy Minister for Communities, set out the policy position on repeal of section 2A to the Equal Opportunities Committee on 28 September 1999 and the Executive subsequently set out its case for the repeal in the consultation paper <i>Standards in Public Life: Consultation on the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Bill.</i></p>

  <p>Approximately &pound;1 million a year is spent by health boards on health promotion activities specifically aimed at reducing smoking. Following the publication of the White Paper on tobacco control <i>Smoking Kills</i> , an additional &pound;3 million over three years from 1999 was allocated to health boards to spend on smoking cessation services and Nicotine Replacement Therapy. These resources are targeted at areas of social deprivation.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is working with key agencies to implement the measures laid out in <i>Smoking Kills </i>and provides financial support to a range of other bodies, such as the Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS) and ASH (Scotland) who actively promote measures on smoking cessation.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-04-28.S1W-5700.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0428.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>North of Scotland Water Authority, in common with the other two Scottish water authorities, is committed to a significant capital investment programme to meet exacting standards of wastewater discharge and drinking water quality. This will deliver essential improvements to public health and the environment for the Scottish people.</p>

  <p>I am aware of the Scottish fish processing industry&#8217;s concerns over water and trade effluent charges made by the North of Scotland Water Authority. In relation to effluent charges, all of the water authorities have been moving towards full cost recovery, on the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle. To do otherwise would result in other water charge-paying sectors subsidising certain areas of industry, and that would be neither fair nor equitable. I understand that North of Scotland Water Authority has made a number of adjustments to its charges scheme in order to help the fish processing industry.</p>

  <p>The authorities&#8217; capital and operating costs are met by a combination of borrowing consents from central government and income from customer revenues. I do not consider that a new mechanism for capital investment cost recovery provides a means of addressing the fish processors&#8217; concerns.<br /></p>
