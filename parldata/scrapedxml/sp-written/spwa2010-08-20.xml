  <p>NHS Fife is responsible for working with the Scottish Ambulance Service to ensure that appropriate ambulance cover is in place. The NHS board has worked closely with the ambulance service on arrangements during the temporary overnight reductions in accident and emergency services at Victoria Hospital on the occasions when it has been necessary for the board to implement its contingency plan. NHS Fife has made funding available for additional resources at the appropriate times to allow for extra distances travelled. These arrangements, which will continue in the future if the need arises, have ensured that there has been no adverse impact on ambulance services or response times in Fife.</p>

  <p>We are committed to ensuring that remote and fragile communities have direct links to the wider Scottish economy. We launched the Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) pilot to consider the most effective and sustainable way to improve the affordability of ferry services to our islands. Since the launch of the pilot there has been a significant increase in the number of people and businesses using the Western Isles ferry services and visiting the area. We are currently reviewing the initial success of the RET pilot and will make an announcement in due course.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>* This ratio includes costs and benefits for the Shotts part of the programme which is already operational.</p>

  <p>** This is currently being revised in light of changes to operating costs. These will be confirmed once the franchise variation for the Airdrie to Bathgate line has been agreed.</p>

  <p>Following the cancellation of the GARL project Transport Scotland, in partnership with Network Rail and First Scotrail, is developing a new timetable for the Ayrshire and Inverclyde rail passenger services, to be introduced in May 2012. This timetable information is currently in development and is required to inform the strategic business case for the Paisley Corridor Improvements project in the context of the wider West of Scotland railway investment. It is expected that the revised business case and associated BCR will be available in the autumn of 2010.</p>

  <p>Information in the Scottish Health Service Costs publication is mainly derived from financial and statistical data compiled by Scottish Health Boards.</p>

  <p>Some of the larger NHS boards such as NHS Lothian and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which have a significant impact on the national average cost, have changed their costing methodology since 2006 to better reflect the true, fully absorbed cost of providing radiology services. This change, while providing more accurate figures, means current figures are less comparable with earlier years.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available by local authority area. Safety (speed and red light) cameras are operated by the eight local Safety Camera Partnerships that deliver the Scottish Safety Camera Programme, which has been operating in police force areas since 2000. Drivers caught speeding or failing to obey a red traffic signal are issued with a conditional offer fixed penalty notice (COPFN) of three penalty points and a &pound;60 fine. The total amounts received from payment of fines in each partnership area expressed in cash and real terms are listed in the following tables:</p>

  <p>Student teachers are invited to indicate the five local authorities in which they would prefer to serve their probationary year and are subsequently allocated to one of those authorities. Alternatively they can select the &lsquo;preference waiver&rsquo; option (and receive financial recompense for so doing) in which case they will be allocated to any Scottish local authority.</p>

  <p>The allocation process is jointly administered by the Scottish Government and the General Teaching Council for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Rather than bid for specific levels of funding in relation to the teacher induction scheme, local authorities offer teaching posts that are suitable for probationer teachers. The following table shows the number of probationer posts that Shetland Islands Council offered in each of the relevant years. Not all posts offered by local authorities are filled by the allocation process.</p>

  <p>The amount of funding that local authorities receive depends upon the number of probationers that are allocated to the posts offered in May and subsequently take up their allocations in August.</p>

  <p>Tbc = to be confirmed - probationer numbers will be confirmed once term has started and funding will be calculated thereafter.</p>
