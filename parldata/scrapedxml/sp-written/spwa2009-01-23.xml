  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-16417 by Richard Lochhead on 1 October 2008 and in light of the European Parliament&rsquo;s vote in support of new pesticides legislation, how this new legislation, if implemented, will affect the Scottish farming industry.</p>

  <p>The new legislation could adversely affect Scottish crop yields if certain pesticides were no longer available. However, it is not possible at this stage to determine whether the potential impact will actually be felt. This is because decisions will only be taken as individual products are assessed for re-authorisation when their current authorisations expire. This process will take some years, and the decisions will depend, among other things, on whether by that stage alternative products are available.</p>

  <p>Scientific work by the Pesticides Safety Directorate on behalf of the Scottish Government and other UK authorities suggested that a number of pesticide active ingredients, for which there is no conclusive evidence of a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, could nonetheless eventually be banned under the new legislation.</p>

  <p>The Council of Ministers has finalised its position on the proposals, after a prolonged period of negotiation during which the Scottish Government made active representations, including in collaboration with the UK authorities. However, the impact of the new rules will not be felt immediately. Rather, substances will be assessed over the next few years as they come up for review at the end of their approval under the existing authorisation regime. We will lobby the commission so that, when these decisions are taken, they are proportionate and take account of the impact on Scottish agriculture and on food production in general.</p>

  <p>The top priority of the Scottish Government is increasing sustainable economic growth. In achieving this priority we must address the long-term structural gap between GDP growth performance in Scotland, and both the UK, and the small independent EU countries. The Government Economic Strategy (GES) therefore established two ambitious economic (GDP) growth targets for Scotland. The long-term target is &quot;to match the GDP growth rate of the small independent EU countries by 2017&quot;. The intermediate target is &quot;to raise Scotland&rsquo;s GDP growth rate to the UK level by 2011.&quot;</p>

  <p>In the following table annual growth rates to each quarter are presented for Scotland, the UK, and the small independent EU countries over the period 2007 Q3 to 2008 Q2.</p>

  <p>There were numerous discussions with the Russian Government from April 2008 to lift the restriction. The First Minister met the Russian Ambassador to the United Kingdom on a number of occasions and discussed the ban. The Minister for the Environment met the Russian Deputy Ambassador to the European Union in April 2008. Scottish Government and Scottish Development International officials have been in direct and constant contact with the Russian Consul General in Edinburgh and directly with the Russian Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary Service in Moscow.</p>

  <p>The Getting Fit for the Future programme centred on the modernisation and sustainability of health care service delivery in the Borders. The need for community care housing and the best way of meeting this can only properly be addressed at local level. I have been advised by NHS Borders that the current and projected need for accessible housing was not an issue raised directly during the programme. However, NHS Borders works closely with their partners through joint planning and initiatives to support more people to lead independent lives in the community.</p>

  <p>Payments of LFASS 2008 were made into bank accounts from 16 January, some three weeks earlier than last year. Over 11,000 payments worth &pound;52 million, or 85% of the budget, had been made by 26 January.</p>

  <p>Steps taken to achieve the issue of these payments included:</p>

  <p>Prioritisation of inspection field work and redeployment of resource as appropriate, to ensure that the EC legislative requirement to complete the inspection process before starting LFASS payments, was met as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>Liaison with SFPS (Single Farm Payment Scheme) colleagues to ensure that LFASS development work did not adversely impact on the release of SFPS aid.</p>

  <p>Detailed testing of the complex IT systems that underpin LFASS payments, by the dedicated LFASS teams and others.</p>

  <p>Continual monitoring of essential changes to the IT processes to ensure that decisions were made and resources allocated appropriately.</p>

  <p>In addition, I took a keen personal interest in the issue of the LFASS payments and received regular reports on their progress.</p>

  <p>Officials are looking at the feasibility of making LFASS and SFPS (Single Farm Payment Scheme) payments at the same time. This is an operational issue, although there is a need to ensure that the different legislative requirements are met. We will seek the advice of key stakeholders once we have identified the risks and benefits of such an approach.</p>

  <p>Under the existing legislation there is no legal barrier to making LFASS and SFPS (Single Farm Payment Scheme) payments in the same year. However, they each have eligibility criteria that must be met before payments can issue. This is a legal requirement.</p>

  <p>A single outcome agreement (SOA) is the means by which Community Planning Partnerships agree their strategic priorities, either individually or jointly, while showing how those outcomes should contribute to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s relevant National Outcomes. Monitoring against targets and indicators in the SOA will therefore drive a range of decisions at local and national level to support delivery of the agreed outcomes.</p>

  <p>The most recent survey of teacher vacancies does not indicate a significant shortage of science teachers in Scottish schools. It shows that there were five vacancies for biology teachers, eight for chemistry teachers, two for general science teachers and five for physics teachers; of which three, two, zero and two respectively had been vacant for more than three months. These vacancy numbers represent only 0.06% of the total number of science teachers in Scottish schools.</p>

  <p>We do know, however, that some local authorities experience difficulty from time to time recruiting teachers to particular posts in particular schools. This will be born in mind in our continuing promotion of the teaching profession, for example at career and recruitment fairs, and in research we will be commissioning shortly into what might persuade teachers to move to teach in more remote parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The percentage of people most at risk in Scotland who received flu vaccination in each of the last three years is set out in the following table. Information is provided broken down by all NHS board areas and for those aged 65 and over (over 65s) as well as for those under the age of 65 who are at risk due to certain long-term medical conditions (at risk). Figures reflect uptake of flu vaccine to the end of December each year:</p>
