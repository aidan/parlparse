  <p>The key benchmark will be uptake. This is because the aim of the campaign was to educate businesses and households on the benefits of broadband in order to increase connections to the technology. It is estimated that business take-up has almost trebled since 2003, when the campaign began.</p>

  <p>This issue is reserved to the UK Government. EU Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable transport fuels requires member states to set targets for biofuel sales in 2005 and 2010. The Directive also set non-binding &quot;reference&quot; values for member states to take into account in setting their own sale targets; they are respectively 2% for 2005 and 5.75% for 2010. The UK Government has set a UK-wide renewable transport fuel target for 2005 of 0.3% of total fuel sales.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is involved, through my membership of the Ministerial Low Carbon Group (MLCG), in work at a UK level looking into ways to promote the development, introduction and take-up of low carbon vehicles and fuels. The MLCG published its second annual report in October 2004 and a copy is available from the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 35679).</p>

  <p>The Department for Transport has recently commissioned a feasibility study on the possible introduction of a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for biofuels and other renewable transport fuels, and is currently consulting with stakeholders at UK level. The Scottish Executive is closely following this work and considering its implications for Scotland.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the Executive is supporting Scotland&rsquo;s first large-scale biodiesel plant by the Argent Group. The plant is likely to increase biofuel sales in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have from time to time considered the possibilities of a ferry fares scheme for the Highlands and Islands based on RET, most recently in 2001. This followed the completion of an independent study of CalMac&rsquo;s fares policy which concluded that RET would require a very significant increase in subsidy. We have taken the view that the present fares structure represents a reasonable balance between the interests of island communities and those of taxpayers. However, we have indicated that further research on fares will be carried out in the next few years.</p>

  <p>The fisheries identified and considered by the DEEPNET project extend beyond the Scottish fishing zone, into other EU waters as well as Norwegian, Faroese and International waters. In order to reduce the amounts of abandoned fishing gear and high discard rates in these fisheries, the Scottish Executive engages actively in EU, NEAFC and bilateral negotiations, protecting Scottish interests and promoting good practice across a range of technical issues, including limits on gear soaking time and the effective marking of gear.</p>

  <p>Further, the Scottish Executive encourages and endorses voluntary co-operation on these matters between the different sectors of the various national fishing fleets concerned, such as that which produced the voluntary code of conduct agreed between Norwegian and Scottish industry representatives and signed at Banchory in 2002.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to concerns that victims of crimes such as vandalism, theft and breach of the peace will not consider themselves best served by the justice system if those accused and convicted of these crimes are issued with fixed penalty notices rather than summoned to court.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-03-29.9.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80053" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0329.htm#7">

  <p>No person convicted of a crime will be offered a fixed penalty notice. We consider that fixed penalty notices, correctly and appropriately used, are an important part of a modern criminal justice system. They offer a quick, proportionate and effective response to minor offending so that an offender, and the community he or she is part of, are aware that such behaviour will not be tolerated.</p>

  <p>The use of fixed penalty notices for Antisocial behaviour will be exercised in line with guidelines from the Lord Advocate and the list of applicable offences will be kept under review. Vandalism and breach of the peace are amongst the list of fixed penalty offences at section 128 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004, but theft is not. A pilot scheme testing the use of these penalties commenced in Tayside on 1 April 2005.</p>

  <p>The Office of Rail Regulation is the independent body responsible for the economic, and in future safety, regulation of the GB rail network.</p>

  <p>The Office of Rail Regulation will have the same responsibilities in Scotland as in England and Wales and will be under a duty to comply with the reasonable requirements of the Scottish ministers as regards information and assistance. Like the Secretary of State for Transport, Scottish ministers will be required to provide guidance to the Office of Rail Regulation on desired outputs from the rail network and the public funding available for this. The Office of Rail Regulation will determine the income Network Rail will require to deliver these outputs.</p>

  <p>No, there is no requirement for strictly modern equivalent renewals. The Scottish Executive will be responsible for specifying the outputs from the rail network in Scotland, which Network Rail, through the Office of Rail Regulation, will be tasked with delivering and for funding enhancements to the rail network in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Road Safety Campaign has not produced a resource called <em>Streetwise</em> . At least one copy of the Campaign&rsquo;s <em>Streetsense</em> resource, which was piloted in 45 schools, has been provided to every primary school in Scotland. The resource can also be downloaded from the Campaign&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.srsc.org.uk" target="_blank">www.srsc.org.uk</a> .

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that the determination of speed limit orders should continue to be dealt with by its Trunk Roads Network Management Division; whether it is satisfied that the division has sufficient local knowledge to be best placed to determine such matters, and whether there are any plans to devolve such matters to regional transport partnerships.</p>

  <p>The determination of speed limit orders is currently dealt with by the Trunk Road Network Management Division on behalf of Scottish ministers, as the Trunk Roads Authority. Consideration of such orders is progressed in consultation with other stakeholders including the police and local authorities and is also based on advice from the Trunk Road Operating Companies. The determination of speed limits is therefore based on information collected from a number of sources, using both local and detailed technical knowledge and experience.</p>

  <p>The functions of the Regional Transport Partnerships will be decided on their establishment and in light of their Regional Transport Strategies. In the longer term it may be possible for the partnerships to take on functions currently exercised by Scottish ministers.</p>
