  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its policy is with regard to exemption from congestion charging, road and estuarial crossing tolls and parking place levies for those disabled people who hold a valid disabled persons blue or orange parking badge; how it makes this policy known to all highway authorities and estuarial crossing operators, and how it monitors their implementation of the policy.</p>

  <p>Disabled people who hold a valid disabled persons blue or orange parking badge are exempt from payment of tolls at the Erskine, Forth Road and Tay Road Bridges. Disabled people who are exempt from payment of vehicle excise duty are exempt from payment of tolls at Skye Bridge. The details are set out in the relevant legislation for each bridge. Toll charges and entitlement to toll exemptions are displayed at the tollbooths of each bridge.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for the authority at each bridge to ensure that charges and exemptions are applied correctly. The Executive monitors statistics on the number of exempt crossings on a regular basis for the Skye and Erskine Bridges. For the Forth Road and Tay Road Bridges this is a matter for the Forth Estuary Transport Authority and the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board, respectively.</p>

  <p>Exemptions from road user charges under the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 will be the subject of regulations, a draft of which will be issued for consultation within the next few months.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any policy or recommendations with regard to the provision of parking facilities and level access close to the entrance areas of public buildings and facilities for able-bodied companions accompanying disabled passengers and whether it will seek to increase such provision.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, all new building work, including alterations and extensions, which is covered by building regulations must comply with the Technical Standards for compliance with the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1990, as amended. The issues of parking provision and access for disabled people are covered by Part S of the Technical Standards (Access to and movement within buildings, and protective barriers).</p>

  <p>National Planning Policy Guidance 17, paragraph 48, sets out guidance to local authorities and developers on access for disabled people and also considers the needs of older people and those travelling with children. It also mentions the special design requirements for wheelchair use.</p>

  <p>Paragraph 16 of the recently published draft addendum to National Planning Policy Guidance 17, which sets out maximum parking standards for new developments, also requires that councils continue to make provision for disabled parking and that the amount, location and design of this should be discussed with local disability groups. Comments and objections received to the draft are currently being analysed including those who have commented on the issue of meeting disabled parking requirements within the new maximum parking regime. The finalised addendum will be published towards the end of the year.</p>

  <p>The four UK administrations are currently undertaking a review of the Blue Badge Scheme and have received a report from the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) - the UK Government&rsquo;s statutory adviser on the transport needs of disabled people.</p>

  <p>The scheme, however, is a wholly devolved matter and the Executive is therefore currently considering how any changes to the scheme recommended on an UK-wide basis by DPTAC should be addressed. I hope to be able to announce, along with the other administrations, the way ahead for the Blue Badge Scheme later this year.</p>

  <p>It is for DPTAC to consider whether and, if so, when to publish its report.</p>

  <p>Both the total provision for Modernising the Teaching Profession and the distribution methodology were agreed with COSLA on behalf of local government.</p>

  <p>The distribution formula for these resources uses pupil numbers as an objective measure of councils&rsquo; relative spending needs but also takes account of the additional costs of serving small schools in rural areas and islands. Separate allowances are also made through the Special Island Needs Allowance and Gaelic-medium education specific grant. Highland Council benefits from these adjustments by over &#163;4 million this year &ndash; on top of its allocation based on pupil numbers.</p>

  <p>Currently, the Scottish Executive provides annual core funding of &#163;234,000 to Keep Scotland Beautiful, who run a number of anti-litter initiatives designed to raise awareness. In addition, since the beginning of the last financial year, an extra &#163;700,000 has been allocated for anti-litter campaigns such as the "Have some pride" poster campaign, which I launched in March.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recently made &#163;95 million available to local authorities as part of the First Minister's "Quality of Life" initiative. Around &#163;3 million has been committed towards litter reduction schemes. Councils may choose to use some of this money to raise awareness.</p>

  <p>Yes. However, the most recent data available indicates that this gap is narrowing. Between 1998-99 and 2000-01 the percentage of further education students from &quot;High Deprivation&quot; areas increased from 18% to 24% and from &quot;Above Average&quot; deprivation areas from 17% to 22%.</p>

  <p>Information available on entry into higher education institutions is found in the Performance Indicators on Higher Education (HE) in the UK, published by the Higher Education Funding Councils in December 2001. Copies are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 18498). Table 1a of these indicators shows that the proportion of young full-time first degree entrants to HE from low participation neighbourhoods increased from 16% in 1997-98 to 18% in 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>Napier University&rsquo;s plans for a Scottish Centre for Creative Industries were outlined to Mike Watson in the course of a brief meeting with its Dean of Arts and Social Sciences on 2 July 2002.</p>

  <p>The question of Executive support for such plans was not raised at that meeting, and has not been raised since. The allocation of funding to higher education institutions is a matter for the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. Ministers are prevented, in terms of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992, from framing the conditions of grant by reference to particular institutions.</p>

  <p>Ministers were invited to attend the launch on 18 October of Napier University&rsquo;s fund raising campaign, which has as one of its objects raising of funds for a Scottish Centre for Creative Industries. They have no plans to do so.</p>

  <p>We have not undertaken such an assessment. We have, however, assessed the potential renewable energy resource from all renewables sources throughout Scotland. This study, <em>Scotland&rsquo;s renewable resource 2001</em> , which we published in December last year, estimated that the total resource could be as much as 60 GW capacity.</p>

  <p>Wave and tidal power provides a significant opportunity for Scotland. The excellent resource off the coast of Orkney was one of the factors taken into account by Highlands and Islands Enterprise in reaching its decision to site the European Marine Energy Test Centre there. I have announced that the Executive will financially support the establishment of the centre. It is not, however, our policy to give locational guidance on the siting of developments, this is a matter for developers themselves.</p>

  <p>Shipping is one of the most environmentally sustainable means of transport available, and the Scottish Executive is keen to encourage a modal shift of freight transport away from road onto water and rail. A significant funding mechanism for encouraging such modal shift is the Freight Facilities Grant (FFG) Scheme that has funded three awards totalling almost 16 million to move freight onto water. This total includes the 11 million FFG funding of the Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry link which demonstrates the Executive's commitment to achieving modal shift in freight transport and to support short sea shipping as a means to this end. In addition, the Executive, in conjunction with the Department for Transport and the Welsh Assembly Government are looking at proposals to extend the scope of the FFG scheme in relation to maritime transport.</p>

  <p>The Executive has discussed with the research team the Marine Motorway Study, which is being undertaken by Heriot Watt and Napier Universities to establish the viability of freight ferry services on UK coastal routes as an alternative to long-distance road transport. The research was commissioned and partly funded by the Department for Transport which has responsibility for shipping, a reserved matter. We will consider the outcome of the study once it is completed.</p>

  <p>The Executive and the UK Government recognise shipping as providing environmental benefits. This is reflected in the support offered through the Freight Facilities Grant scheme. This provides assistance with capital expenditure costs to help make freight transport by water more competitive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided 80 million to local authorities through the National Grid for Learning programme of the Excellence Fund in order to help them achieve a number of ICT-related targets in their schools, including pupil:modern computer ratios of 7.5:1 in primary schools and 5:1 in secondary schools. Local authorities and schools decide how to deploy those computers.</p>

  <p>The provision of ICT facilities is one of a number of important inputs to education. However, success in closing the gap between deprived areas and the rest of Scotland is best determined by looking at the outcomes of education.</p>

  <p>&quot;Local authorities will be able to use the additional resources to enhance their own provision as well as independent sector advice services.

  <p>The main obstacles to volunteering in Scotland that we intend to tackle are poverty, disadvantage and social exclusion and we are doing this through our programme for government. However, there are also institutional and operational obstacles, principally relating to an individual&rsquo;s ability to access advice and guidance on volunteering.</p>

  <p>Volunteer training and support is provided through Volunteer Development Scotland, which offers a range of generic training courses and runs events for volunteer agencies. In this financial year, Volunteer Development Scotland has held 13 courses for volunteer managers, attended by 146 people. It has also undertaken peripatetic training for volunteer centre staff. These assist volunteer engaging agencies to apply best practice and meet standards for the planning and delivery of volunteering. Similarly, volunteer centres work with organisations making use of volunteers to ensure that appropriate training and support is provided both to engaging agencies and volunteers.</p>

  <p>We are raising awareness about volunteering through our investment in infrastructure and capacity at both the national and local level in the shape of Volunteer Development Scotland and the network of local volunteer centres. A central purpose of both is to encourage and facilitate volunteering opportunities for the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, we have introduced the Active Communities Initiative. Scottish Executive funding for the initiative in 2002-03 will amount to 2.2 million. The initiative is a five- to 10-year strategy for supporting volunteering in Scotland, which aims to involve people in their communities, improve society and the quality of life of people, change attitudes to volunteering and break down barriers to involvement. The initiative has the full support of the volunteering sector.</p>

  <p>There is a variety of ways in which we publicise volunteering opportunities. This includes an Active Communities newsletter, produced twice a year by the Scottish Executive and distributed to a wide range of organisations and groups, articles in the voluntary and volunteering sectors publications and the funding of various events such as Volunteers Week and Make a Difference Day. We also plan to launch a new Scottish Executive Voluntary Issues Unit website shortly.</p>
