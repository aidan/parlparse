  <p>A new question on national identity is proposed for Scotland&rsquo;s 2011 Census. This will complement the question on ethnic group and allow people to express their sense of being (for example) &quot;Scottish&quot;, &quot;Indian&quot; or &quot;Polish&quot; (or any combination of national identity, for example both &quot;Scottish&quot; and &quot;British&quot;). Testing of the question has not yet been completed and the exact wording and response options which will be proposed for use in 2011 have therefore not been finalised.</p>

  <p>The Creative Industries Framework Agreement, published on 5 February 2009, sets out how Creative Scotland will work together with Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and local authorities to deliver practical support for the creative industries. Those organisations are committed to the Framework and are now preparing implementation arrangements.</p>

  <p>The role for Creative Scotland described in the Framework Agreement will be reflected in the relevant provisions in the Public Services Reform Bill and accompanying Policy Memorandum which will be laid before Parliament in due course. Once established, it will be for Creative Scotland to decide in detail how to implement its remit to support and grow the creative industries.</p>

  <p>The Framework Agreement is available at:</p>

  <p>It is right and proper that ministers should have the power to give direction to Creative Scotland over its general functions, as with all public bodies. However, we will enshrine in legislation the &quot;arms length&quot; principle which is rightly valued by the arts community because it guarantees autonomy in respect of Creative Scotland&rsquo;s artistic and cultural judgement.</p>

  <p>Scottish Opera has received a 2% cash increase in its budget from the Scottish Government for each of the years 2008-09 and 2009-10 and also in the planned budget for 2010-11.

  <p>The Scottish Government is making important progress in improving energy efficiency. Measures that are currently being implemented include:</p>

  <p>The introduction of a new requirement, from 1 December 2008, for all houses put on sale to require a Home Report &ndash; including an EPC and Energy Report with recommendations on how to improve the energy efficiency.</p>

  <p>Announcement of proposals for the first stage of an ambitious area based home insulation scheme supported by &pound;15 million of new government funding plus &pound;15 million from other sources. The scheme is currently being developed and is expected to be launched in the autumn.</p>

  <p>A commitment to bring forward proposals for a significant loan mechanism. This will assist householders wishing to undertake more expensive measures, such as solid wall insulation and installing renewable technologies.</p>

  <p>A new Energy Assistance package [which commences 6 April 2009] will do more to help rural households by including a wider range of measures which will benefit rural homes including air source heat pumps for those off the gas grid and a wider range of insulation measures for homes which cannot take traditional measures such as cavity wall insulation. To ensure that these more expensive measures can be installed the grant maximum has been raised by &pound;500 to &pound;4,000 and the upper grant has been raised by &pound;1,000 to &pound;6,500 for homes which have particularly poor energy efficiency.</p>

  <p>The Energy Assistance Package will be backed by Scottish Government funding worth around &pound;60 million per annum &ndash; 30% more than the original fuel poverty budget and will help to lever in additional CERT funding from the energy companies worth up to &pound;100 million. The package will be delivered through the successful Energy Saving Scotland Advice network co-ordinated by the Energy Saving Trust.</p>

  <p>Working with energy suppliers, through the Scottish CERT Strategy Steering Group, to ensure that Scotland receives its fair share of CERT activity not only in terms of population, but also to meet our distinctive energy needs.</p>

  <p>Funding the Carbon Trust to support larger, energy intensive businesses and public sector bodies, to reduce their energy use. Through the Energy Saving Scotland advice network, Energy Saving Trust deliver sustainability living advice to consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

  <p>I have asked George MacKenzie, Keeper of the Records of Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to request The National Archives (TNA) to transfer the William Wallace document it possesses to The National Archives of Scotland (NAS). To make a successful claim, NAS would need to demonstrate that the document belonged to Wallace in an official capacity and was therefore a record of the early Scottish state. Experts in NAS do not believe that it is a safe conduct, nor is there clear evidence that it was taken from Wallace on his capture. It does not follow the form of a safe conduct, it does not say what a safe conduct of that time would have said, and it does not have an authenticating seal.</p>

  <p>Any request for return of a document to Scotland must be based on clear evidence about its provenance. The 1297 Lubeck letter was created in Scotland but was addressed to the city of Lubeck and it is correct that it remains there. In the case of the Wallace document in TNA, NAS genuinely does not have enough evidence to substantiate a claim that it should be returned to Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Wallace document is well looked after in TNA and there is a digital image on their website for anyone to view. NAS will shortly launch a website feature on documents which are of significant interest to Scottish history, but which, for good reason, have ended up outside the country, including the Lubeck letter, the Poppleton manuscript and this Wallace document.</p>

  <p>Nominations are received from a variety of sources, including members of the public, outside organisations and Lord-Lieutenants. Prior to May 2007, Scottish ministers added their own nominations to those from other sources. Nominations from all sources are initially assessed by Scottish Government officials who assist the Permanent Secretary in preparing recommendations for the UK-wide selection committees to consider. Since May 2007, the First Minister has chosen not to exercise the right to approve the recommendations by the Permanent Secretary. The UK-wide selection committees submit their recommendations to HM The Queen through the Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is an active member of the steering group to take forward <em>Health is Global: A UK Government Strategy</em> and officials have participated in meetings with colleagues in the relevant UK Departments involved in the strategy. This reinforces Scotland&rsquo;s commitment to tackling global health issues and meeting the Millennium Development Goals of developing countries, including that of maternal health.</p>

  <p>More specifically, as part of our international development programme maternal and neonatal health is an area which the Government of Malawi has highlighted as a priority for Scottish Government support. We have continued our support for this important area, working with key stakeholders in Malawi and Scotland, and in January this year we announced further funding for projects which will work to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The only establishment that currently operates a drug free area is HMP Kilmarnock.</p>

  <p>The SPS approach is the provision of a range of Addiction Support Services to prisoners, irrespective of their location with an establishment.</p>

  <p>Over recent years, SPS has moved from the operation of Drug Free Areas in prisons to integrated treatment care which provides individually structured support for prisoners from admission to liberation, including for those who wish to become drug free.</p>

  <p>For the month of February 2009, the Scottish Government paid 84.3% of transactions for which there were Scottish Government contracts within the payment target of 10 working days. Emerging results for March indicate that this performance is increasing towards 90%.</p>

  <p>As reported in the answer to question S3W-21183 on 20 March 2009, overall payment performance for the month of February 2009 was that 86.5% of transactions were paid within 10 working days. This includes one-off purchases that were not the subject of contracts. Emerging results for March show this performance moving to in excess of 90%.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold information relating to the payment performance of public bodies who do not use the Scottish Government&rsquo;s financial systems and processes. All public bodies should be working towards the 10 day payment target.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no such plans.</p>

  <p>Technical standards for connecting generators to the National Grid are regulated by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) under legislation reserved to the UK Government. The Scottish Government does, however, engage regularly with National Grid and Ofgem to ensure renewable generators in Scotland do not face significant connection delays, unnecessarily high costs or administrative burdens in applying for or obtaining connection to distribution networks.</p>

  <p>In addition, in 2008 we consulted on proposals to meet Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets from a wide range of sources. That will include increasing electricity generation from both onshore and offshore wind, proposals for which are put forward by private developers. We aim to publish our Renewables Action Plan this summer.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland has not conducted research on the likely effects on employment of the displacement of the wood processing industries by the biomass energy industry. To date, despite a threefold increase in the use of woodfuel since 2005 in Scotland, there have been no directly attributable negative impacts on employment in the wood processing industries. The wood fuel taskforce identified significant additional sources of woody biomass, which if brought to market will allow the biomass energy industry to develop alongside the existing wood processing sector.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made the following grant awards directly to the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), which includes both core funding and funding for specific initiatives. Funding has been awarded across a number of themes including: third sector; children, young people and social care; equalities; rural issues; regeneration; international and the national conversation.</p>

  <p>The following grant funding awards for 2007-08 and 2008-09 do not include funding that SCVO receives to wholly distribute to other third sector organisations or work secured under contract. Figures do not include funding from agencies, non-departmental public bodies or other public sector bodies. The financial year 2008-09 has not completed, so figures may be subject to change.</p>

  <p>SCVO publishes its annual report and financial statement on its website <a href="http://www.scvo.org.uk" target="_blank">www.scvo.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>We want Scotland to lead in the development of an enterprising third sector, including social enterprises. To support this we have increased direct investment in the sector by 37% to &pound;93.6 million between 2008 and 2011.</p>

  <p>We have announced support for third sector organisations, and for individuals who want to start up a new social enterprise. Information on the Enterprise Fund (&pound;12 million) and the Social Entrepreneurs Fund (&pound;1 million) is available on the Scottish Government website and through intermediaries such as First Port, SCVO, and the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition.</p>

  <p>There are no official statistics available on the number of social enterprises operating in Scotland because social enterprises do not have a separate legal status.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government provides direct funding for Volunteer Development Scotland, the national centre for excellence, and the 32 local volunteer centres across Scotland. In addition, third sector organisations draw extensively on the skills and capacity of volunteers and the many organisations we support, directly and indirectly, in the third sector will also contribute to the encouragement of volunteering.</p>

  <p>We believe that over 1.3 million people in Scotland volunteer in some way each year making a positive contribution to our communities at every level. It is not, however, possible to identify how many people volunteer as a direct result of individual volunteer support organisations. Individuals choose to volunteer for a wide range of reasons and their route into volunteering is a matter of personal choice.</p>
