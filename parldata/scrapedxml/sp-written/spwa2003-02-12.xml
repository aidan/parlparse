  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-33266 by Malcolm Chisholm on 24 January 2003, how many journeys were undertaken in 2002 by ambulances transferring patients between (a) the Garrick Hospital, (b) private homes in the DG9 postcode area and (c) GP surgeries and (i) Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, (ii) Cresswell Maternity Unit, Dumfries, and (iii) the Crichton Royal Hospital.</p>

  <p>This detailed information is not readily available. The Scottish Ambulance Service transfers many patients from the Stranraer area to hospitals in Dumfries and elsewhere, including Ayr and further afield. The general manager of the service&#146;s South West Division has advised me that he would be happy to meet with you to discuss ambulance provision in the area, together with the service&#146;s plans for future developments. I have asked him to contact you to offer such a meeting.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether organisations are still able to have criminal records checks carried out on prospective employees and volunteer staff at police stations and whether there are any plans to standardise procedures for such checks across all police forces.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-02-12.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80171" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0212.htm#3">

  <p>We are not aware of any arrangements enabling organisations to have criminal record checks on employees carried out at police stations. Under a non-statutory scheme introduced in 1989, local authority social work and education departments and health authorities were able to request criminal record checks through the Scottish Criminal Record Office on those being appointed to positions which would give them substantial access to children. The scheme was later extended to cover providers and managers of residential care services for adults, proprietors of independent schools and some voluntary child care organisations.</p>

  <p>The non-statutory scheme was replaced from April last year by new arrangements under Part V of the Police Act 1997. This provides all individuals on request with information on their convictions which have been recorded centrally, as well as additional criminal records information on those in positions of trust or with substantial access to children or vulnerable adults.</p>

  <p>Disclosure Scotland was established last year within the Scottish Criminal Record Office to discharge ministers&#146; functions under Part V of the Police Act 1997. Those functions are concerned with the issue of criminal record certificates.</p>

  <p>In December 1998 the administration of the day announced that it was the intention to implement Part V on a phased basis starting from December 2000.</p>

  <p>Following devolution we announced that we had reviewed the position and had decided to plan the phased introduction of the new criminal record certificates in Scotland from July 2001 in line with the plans for implementation in England and Wales. This was because we considered the two operations needed to be developed in parallel to allow for as much integration as possible.</p>

  <p>In the event, the necessary operational mechanisms and regulations were not fully in place by that date and the new certificates did not start to become available until April 2002.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to send any representatives to the EU conference, Towards an Effective Policy on Drugs: Policy Choices, Scientific Facts and Day-to-Day Practice, in Athens on 6 to 8 March 2003 and, if so, of what grade and department each such representative will be.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will not be sending representatives to the EU Conference in Athens on 6 to 8 March. The Home Office, which leads for the UK on international drugs policy issues, is sending a small delegation, which will represent UK interests. Although experts and some politicians will speak at the conference, the UK delegation will not include a ministerial representative. I understand that the conference, which will take the form of a series of presentations, will focus on evidence gathering rather than on high-level policy negotiations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is regularly consulted on, and fully involved in, discussions with the Home Office at official and ministerial level on the formulation of EU policies that touch on matters falling within the responsibilities of the Executive. The Home Office will feed back to the Executive the outcome of the conference in due course.</p>

  <p>Ayrshire constitutes South, North and East Ayrshire Local Authority areas. The number of unemployed for Ayrshire is only available quarterly from September to November 1998 and has been below the reliability threshold for single quarters of the Labour Force Survey. The Ayrshire data is therefore given from the annual local area Labour Force Survey for which 2001 data is the latest data currently available.</p>

  <p>Current Scotland Level Unemployment Estimates</p>

  <p>From November 2002 until mid-2003, unemployment for below UK level from the Labour Force Survey will be based upon pre-Census mid-year population estimates and will only be used to produce <em>seasonally unadjusted</em> data. It will not be possible to compare seasonally unadjusted Scottish data for the latest three-month period e.g. September to November with the preceding three-month period, June to August, due to seasonal factors influencing the unadjusted data. It is only possible to compare the Scottish figures with the same time period for previous years. The latest available seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate for September to November 2002 for Scotland is 156,000 (6.1%). Comparable data for September to November for previous years is given in the following table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring that further education opportunities are accessible by everyone no matter where they live or their personal circumstances. Our widening access policy aims to break down barriers and ensure that social prejudice plays no part in who gets to benefit from further education.</p>

  <p>We have delegated to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) the duty to secure adequate and efficient provision of further education in Scotland. We expect SFEFC to allocate budgets to individual colleges, and offer other support and guidance, in a way which takes account of that duty.</p>

  <p>The New Earnings Survey, which collects information on average gross weekly earnings for full-time staff on adult rates, does not have published information for Orkney and Shetland as the standard error of the gross earnings for this area exceeds 5%, which is outside the publication threshold.</p>

  <p>It was agreed in 2002, after consultation with Scottish ministers, that the selection of a UK judge should be by open competition. A public advertisement was placed in newspapers on 30 April 2002 and its terms were drawn to the attention of all Scottish judges. A selection board was convened to decide on the UK nomination and a senior Scottish judge was part of the selection panel. I believe these arrangements are appropriate and provide Scottish judges with the opportunity to put themselves forward for consideration.</p>

  <p>A number of actions are being taken to improve waiting times in accident and emergency departments. Since 1999, an additional &#163;12 million has been invested in new and refurbished units. In addition, a number of areas have plans for new minor injuries units, staffed by nurses, which will stream some of the &quot;walking wounded&quot; cases away from busy accident and emergency centres, leaving staff more time to treat ill and injured patients. Moreover, NHS 24 should have a positive impact on accident and emergency waiting times as it is rolled out across Scotland.</p>

This proposal did not contain any detailed plans of how such a system would be operated. The evaluation has shown that the proposal was unworkable. The Governor of Peterhead is now developing and costing alternative proposals for access to night sanitation in consultation with the local branch of the POA.

  <p>The Scottish Executive maintains close links with the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and works closely with the UK National Statistician. The Scottish Executive is a member of the New Earnings Survey (NES) users group and is being consulted on the Distribution of Earnings Review which may result in changes to the NES sampling frame in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>The ONS has given the following statement: &quot;The National Statistics Quality Review of the Distribution of Earnings Statistics (Report No.14) has made recommendations for improvements to the New Earnings Survey. These include extending the coverage of the sample frame for the survey, and reducing known response biases. A project within the Office for National Statistics to deliver these recommendations is now under way. This project allows key users to be consulted on all aspects of the redesign of the survey. Defining the particular needs of devolved administrations will be an important part of the consultation. The project will investigate the basis of sampling and estimation used for the survey and will then make recommendations for the most cost efficient approach to delivering quality estimates of earnings and hours of work.&quot;</p>

  <p>A number of local authorities have submitted applications for funding from the Strategic Waste Fund, and others have submitted draft bids for discussion with the Executive. Both categories include proposals for joint working, as follows.</p>

  <p>The authorities in the Forth Valley Area Waste Strategy Group (Falkirk, Stirling and Clackmannanshire Councils) have been awarded long-term grant support. Their project involves the development of joint working in procurement of waste management services.</p>

  <p>Aberdeenshire Council&#146;s bid to the Strategic Waste Fund has been assessed and accepted in full. The bid commits the Council to joint working with neighbouring councils in the North East Area Waste Group.</p>

  <p>North and South Lanarkshire Councils intend to implement a joint waste awareness campaign called Waste Aware Lanarkshire. This will involve the sharing of resources between the two councils.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, further to his answer to question S1W-25404 on 3 May 2002 and in the light of the appointment of the Scottish Information Commissioner, whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) will now make a voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner in respect of information that has been classed as commercially confidential if such information is the subject of a request to the Commissioner by, for example, a member of the Parliament and whether more information will be made public in 2003 than has been made public under existing arrangements and, if so, whether the SPCB will give details of any such information.</p>

  <p>The Parliament&#146;s position on the disclosure of commercially confidential information has not changed following the appointment of the Scottish Information Commissioner and remains as set out in my answer of 19 September 2000 to question S1W-9469. When the Freedom of Information Act comes into force, the SPCB will be subject to its provisions in the same manner as all other public authorities and claiming commercial confidentiality on material will require to be judged in the context of those provisions on a case-by-case basis.</p>
