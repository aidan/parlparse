  <p>The Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (the Care Commission) is already regulating a wide range of the services defined in Section 2 of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the Act), including care homes, support services (care at home and day care), housing support services and nurse agencies. Adult placements, some school care accommodation services and some independent health care services are not being regulated yet.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Requirements as to Care Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2002 (as amended) require providers of regulated services to employ only people who are fit to be employed, and make it an offence not to do so. These regulations also specify that a person who is not fit is one who is not physically and mentally fit for the purposes of the work to be undertaken; does not have the qualifications, skills and experience, or who is required to be registered with another body to perform the work but is not so registered. The Care Commission also expects providers to meet the associated National Care Standards. These standards expect providers to have in place safe recruitment practices which include taking up references, criminal record checks and cross reference to the registers of professional organisations. Care Commission inspections check that all of this is in place.</p>

  <p>These arrangements, and the fact that people can complain either to the provider or to the Care Commission direct about the provision of a care service, together give the Care Commission the teeth it needs to take appropriate action, including ultimately cancelling registration.</p>

  <p>Ministers are responsible through a management statement and financial memorandum for setting the policy, planning and financial framework within which the Care Commission must operate, including objective and target setting. In carrying out its functions, and in accordance with the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001, the Care Commission makes no distinction between its regulation of services in the independent sector and those in the public sector. The management statement requires the Care Commission to have a corporate plan agreed with Scottish ministers setting out targets covering a three-year period. The commission is required to make the plan available to the public on request. The plan includes targets relating to key regulatory functions such as inspections and complaints. I meet the Care Commission twice a year to discuss progress, and my officials meet the senior management team on a regular basis to monitor its performance against agreed targets. A copy of the Care Commission&#8217;s annual report on its activities and accounts must be laid in Parliament. The plan for 2002-03 was laid on 16 December 2003.</p>

Although this funding is not directly targeted at improving dental health it will have this effect by improving access to NHS general dental services.</p>

  <p>Information held by ISD Scotland shows that 96 public health consultants were in post at September 2003 from a total establishment of 104, a vacancy rate of 7.7%.</p>

  <p>The route to consultant posts is through specialist registrar training. We have increased the total number of specialist registrar training posts in public health medicine from 31 to 34 over the last two years. It is projected that eight training posts will complete specialist registrar training in 2004 and a further eight in 2005. This will help to ensure an adequate supply of public health practitioners at consultant level.</p>

  <p>The National Workforce Committee is leading on the work force development agenda and will be assisted in this by the new Workforce Numbers Group (WoNuG). This group will for the first time look comprehensively at the health care work force, including the public health work force. It will advise the committee on work force numbers and modelling across all staff groups and make recommendations on work force size and shape in a sensible and pragmatic way.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to reducing the number of women offenders needlessly sent to prison. We are taking forward a number of initiatives which follow up the conclusions made by the Ministerial Group on Women Offenders contained in its report, <em>A Better Way</em> .</p>

  <p>These include pilots in Glasgow and Ayrshire for the mandatory use of supervised attendance orders to help reduce the numbers imprisoned for fine default; arrest referral scheme pilots which offer access to drug treatment facilities at the point of entry to the criminal justice system; an investment of &#163;1 million per annum in bail supervision and information schemes to provide an alternative to custodial remand; plans to pilot structured deferred sentences to provide the courts with a lower tariff disposal to help avoid escalating women offenders quickly towards short custodial sentences; the development of a women offenders programme for accreditation, and the establishment of the 218 Time Out Centre in Glasgow. The centre opened in December 2003 and offers residential and detox facilities alongside drop-in day services plus programmes to reduce reoffending and access to a range of community and health services.</p>

  <p>For drug misusing offenders, the broad framework of community disposals which is now in place, provides alternatives to custody and access to drug treatment at different stages in the sentencing process. Criminal justice social work services give special attention to the needs of women for these and other services.</p>

Duties related to navigation are specified in that legislation, as is the jurisdiction for which the harbour authority is responsible.

  <p>Dumfries and Galloway&#8217;s application under section 75 of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 for construction of a public road over navigable waters in respect of the proposed footbridge over the River Nith is currently being considered.</p>

  <p>Before reaching a decision on this matter, the Scottish ministers must be fully aware of all the facts surrounding the case. Further information is still required and significant objections remain. It has been decided that the case should be referred to a public local inquiry. Given this, it would not be appropriate to make any comment on the timing of a decision on the scheme.</p>

  <p>A scheme to realign approximately 3km of the A7 at Auchenrivock is in the early stages of preparation.

  <p>Two major schemes are currently under consideration. Options to provide guaranteed overtaking at Glenairlie on the A76 are being examined. A preferred scheme has still to be identified and it is too early in the preparation process to be definite on funding and programme timing. The likely cost of the scheme is in the region of &#163;3.5 million at current prices.</p>

  <p>We have also examined a scheme between Gateside and Knockenjig. This failed to achieve value for money and attempts to develop the scheme to add value ran into difficulties over farm access arrangements. It became clear that a scheme which would be acceptable to both the Scottish Executive and landowners, and which would provide value for money, could not be achieved. A possible replacement scheme to provide overtaking opportunities between Gateside and Sanquhar is currently being investigated. Costs and programme timing have not yet been identified.</p>

  <p>Considerable effort is being undertaken within the Executive to ensure that all supplier invoices are processed promptly.

  <p>In accordance with the regulations made under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the act), care service providers are required only to employ people who are fit. Under the regulations, employees are not considered to be fit unless they have the qualifications, skills and experience necessary for the work that the person is to perform. The Code of Practice for Social Service Workers and Employers sets out guidance on issues such as recruitment, training and development of staff. The National Care Standards also provide guidance on training for staff.</p>

  <p>In terms of social care, the act also established the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC), its main purpose being to regulate the social service work force and promote its education and training. Registration of the work force will be carried out in phases and phase 1 commenced on 1 April 2003 with social workers being the first workers to register. The SSSC has published the qualifications criteria for the first two phases of registration and employers are already working to ensure that staff meet the qualifications criteria set. In recognition of the pressures on all sectors from regulation, the Executive has ensured that additional funding is available for staff training.</p>

  <p>Following consultation with stakeholders, guidelines setting out the principles and operation of the new restorative warning system will be issued to the police on Monday 21 June. The purpose of the new system which will apply to young people between the ages of eight and 15, and 16 and 17-year-olds under supervision is:</p>

  <p>to provide a rapid and effective way of dealing with young offenders by bringing home to them the impact of their actions and thereby help to reduce future offending behaviour;</p>

  <p>to address victim concerns by ensuring that victims are fully informed throughout the process and have the opportunity, if they so wish, to tell the offender about the impact of the offence on them, and</p>

  <p>to help address public concerns about youth disorder and minor offences.</p>

  <p>Researchers (Blake Stevenson) were commissioned to identify best practice in consultation with stakeholders. This found that restorative cautions are more effective in preventing re-offending than traditional warnings; that most victims do not want to attend restorative justice conferences where the offence is relatively minor (and therefore suitable for a warning) but that victims do want the offender to be made aware of their views, and to know how he/she is dealt with. Guidance has been prepared on the basis of these findings. It focuses on cautioning (where the victim is not present) and it will form an integral part of the wider programme to develop restorative approaches, including conferencing, for dealing with the range of youth offending. This work was overseen by a multi-agency steering group.</p>

  <p>&#163;410,000 has already been allocated to all Scottish forces and the police college to facilitate the roll out of training in restorative cautioning and we will provide further funding over the next two years to support the implementation of the new arrangements, which will replace the traditional senior officer warning throughout Scotland by April 2006. There will be an on-going monitoring and evaluation process to measure the impact of the new Police Restorative Warning system. A national recording system will also be put in place which will, for the first time, allow comparison across force areas.</p>
