  <p>Under the Childcare Strategy, the Scottish Executive allocated &#163;16.5 million to local authorities in the financial year 2002-03 to allow them to expand, develop and sustain accessible, affordable, quality child care, including outdoor play provision in child care settings. Over the period of the Scottish Budget 2003-06, funding for the Childcare Strategy will increase and will reach &#163;40.65 million for the year 2005-06. Local allocations of these resources are the responsibility of local authorities.</p>

  <p>As part of the Local Government Settlement, &#163;180 million of Quality of Life funding has been allocated to local authorities over the next three years. The broad policy theme of <em>Increasing Opportunities for Children &amp; Young People</em> allows scope for a wide range of local initiatives that will respond to local needs and priorities, including the development of outdoor play facilities for children with disabilities.</p>

  <p>This is in addition to the extra &#163;95 million allocated to local authorities this year to encourage children and young people to make healthy lifestyle choices and to improve the local environment. As part of this initiative, &#163;7.75 million was allocated to the improvement of organised play and play areas and to the promotion of outdoor recreation.</p>

  <p>Councils' budgeted spend on Special Education this year from Scottish Executive grant and council tax is &#163;260 million, an increase of 5.5% over last year. Local authorities have discretion to allocate money to support outdoor play facilities for children with disabilities.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also allocated &#163;600,000 to <strong></strong>sportscotland to set up a dowry for Scottish Disability Sport. This dowry will allow Scottish Disability Sport to provide specialist support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with special needs are addressed as the Active Primary Schools Programme is rolled out. One of the four areas covered by the programme is children&#146;s play (as well as active travel, PE and sport).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration the Physical Activity Task Force has given to outdoor play facilities for children with disabilities.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-03-13.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0313.htm#4">

  <p>The Physical Activity Task Force (PATF) recommended that all children, including those with disabilities, should have the opportunity to be physically active in their home, educational establishments and community. The task force formulated their recommendations having reviewed research and identified good practice on a worldwide basis.</p>

  <p>The PATF recognised play as an important element of physical activity, accounting for the greatest proportion of children and young people&#146;s physical activity pursuits. Membership of the PATF reflected a wide range of expertise and among those represented were play organisations, disabled groups, child health specialists and local authorities.</p>

  <p>The PATF proposed the development of policies and resources to support four broad strategic objectives, one of which involves providing supportive physical environments to enable inactive people to become active. All of these objectives will be taken into account in the development of the four implementation plans, Active Homes, Active Schools, Active Communities and Active Workplaces.</p>

  <p>Our workforce estimates of 120 graduates per year would be sufficient for Scotland, if we retained all our graduates in Scotland. Given the current recruitment and retention difficulties in some parts of Scotland, highlighted by a number of MSPs, we introduced incentives for graduates to stay in Scotland and we will continue to review workforce estimates for dental graduates.</p>

  <p>I published our broadband strategy update last December. It details the steps we are taking to promote broadband throughout Scotland in both public and private sectors. We are also pursuing a new initiative, worth up to &#163;24 million, which aims to accelerate and extend broadband access across Scotland. As part of this initiative the First Minister announced earlier this week that a further six exchanges in the Highlands are to be upgraded to provide ADSL services this summer.</p>

  <p>All of the recommendations from the <em> Final Report of the School Drug Safety Team</em> , published in January 2001 are being implemented. &#163;3 million over the three years from 2001-02 is being provided to support this. The recommendations cover all aspects of drug education in schools impacting on the curriculum, management and co-ordination within schools, quality assurance, teacher education and multi-agency training.</p>

  <p><em>Guidelines for the Management of Incidents of Drugs Misuse</em> was issued to all schools in June 2000. These guidelines contain clear advice on the procedures which should be in place within school, not only to deal with any incidents but also for protecting the welfare of the young person after an incident. All schools are expected to have policies and procedures in place in line with this national advice by the end of academic year 2002-03.</p>

  <p>The funding of &#163;3 million includes &#163;900,000 over 2002-03 and 2003-04 on drug-related training for teachers being provided by Scotland Against Drugs and the Scottish Training Agency for Drug and Alcohol.</p>

  <p>The method of measuring the tonnage of fishing vessels changed during the late 1990s following the phased introduction of tonnage measurements to standards agreed under the International Tonnage Convention of 1969 and implemented under EU Regulations.</p>

These decisions are taken on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the criteria set out in the directive. The Scottish Executive is consulted by the UK Government on all applications. The Executive&#146;s views, which must be based on scientific evidence, are taken into account in the formulation of the UK&#146;s position.</p>

  <p>The Executive considers that it would be premature to consent to applications in advance of the outcome of the GM public debate.</p>

  <p>A Scottish Framework for Nursing in Schools was launched by Cathy Jamieson and myself on Monday 3 March in Prestonpans Primary School. This framework sets out clearly the future role that school nurses will play. The focus on:</p>

  <p>an assessment of the health needs of each school and the development of school health plans;</p>

  <p>working with schools, children and parents to address identified needs;</p>

  <p>promoting healthy lifestyles and health schools;</p>

  <p>supporting children with chronic and complex health needs, and</p>

  <p>supporting vulnerable children and young people.</p>

  <p>The framework will be implemented alongside the roll out of New Community Schools approach.</p>

  <p>When we set out our proposals in <em>Partnership for Care </em> to dissolve the remaining NHS trusts, our primary objective was not to achieve financial savings, and nor have we identified any direct cost implications. Rather, changes to the governance of local NHS systems should be seen as part of our drive to develop integrated, decentralised health care services that devolve management authority to the front line of patient care.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, by consolidating around 15 NHS boards with minimal structural change and disruption, unnecessary bureaucracy will be reduced, and resources will be freed up and redirected towards improved patient care.</p>

  <p>Specifically, the removal of the remaining trusts will support a whole-system approach to financial management, accountability and planning which maximises the return on additional investment, simplifying the way money flows in the local NHS system and allowing greater flexibility for financial planning over the longer term.</p>

Delivery against those needs will be assisted by the development programme of Communities Scotland (including resources which may transfer, in due course, to local authorities), the New Housing Partnership and Community Ownership programme and the housing programmes of local authorities operating, from 2004-05, within the prudential framework for capital expenditure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking action to build capacity in NHSScotland. Return to Practice schemes are an important part of that and some examples are given:</p>

  <p>&#163;2 million has been allocated to NHS boards, spread over 2002-03 and 2003-04 to fund Return to Practice for nurses and midwives who have taken a break from their careers. This should allow between 400 and 600 nurses and midwives to return to NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>&#163;100,000 has been allocated for Return to Practice for the Allied Health Professions in the next financial year. Programmes to support this will need to be developed and funding will be reviewed thereafter.</p>

  <p>The on-going recruitment and retention package announced for dentistry includes the introduction of an enhanced "return to work" scheme under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative to encourage dentists who have taken career breaks to return to general dental practice and provide NHS dental services on a sessional basis. Under the previous scheme, a returning dentist could earn up to &#163;2,000 for working up to 200 NHS sessions in the year following return, with an equivalent payment for the practice owner. The revised scheme will enable the returner and practice owner to earn up to &#163;6,750 each where the returner works up to 450 sessions. The revised scheme is also open to dentists returning to NHS orthodontic practice.</p>

  <p>A large number of NHS patients in Scotland already receive treatment in hospitals outside their NHS board areas of residence. Arrangements are already in place for the planning and funding of these out of area treatments. The number of out of area treatments undertaken as a result of NHS boards ensuring that waiting guarantees are met is expected to represent a relatively small addition to existing patient flows.</p>

  <p>Individual NHS boards receive funding to enable them to meet their responsibility for forecasting and meeting the health care needs of their residents, including arranging and paying for treatment in neighbouring NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>The key objective is that the longest waiting times experienced by NHS patients in Scotland are reduced to meet the Executive&#146;s targets, as made clear in <em>Partnership for Care</em> published on 27 February.</p>

  <p>service, administer, and support the Paisley Partnership and it&#146;s objectives;</p>

  <p>deliver the training and employment strategy of the Paisley Partnership, and</p>

  <p>I have asked Bob Millar, Chief Executive, Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Paisley Partnership Regeneration Company provides the support team for the Paisley Partnership, and as such its strategic objectives and operational targets flow from the priorities of the partnership itself. In relation to the strategic objectives of the Paisley Partnership specifically, these are not set by the Executive or Communities Scotland centrally. Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) across Scotland are expected to formulate and implement their own strategies locally, based on their understanding of the particular needs of their own community. As a partner on the Paisley Partnership, Communities Scotland would be expected to contribute to the process of formulating and implementing SIP strategy in that area. This would also apply to any non-departmental public bodies on the SIP board.</p>

  <p>In relation to operational targets, this would be a matter for the Paisley Partnership and Paisley Partnership Regeneration Company with, as above, no central role for either Communities Scotland and the Executive, but with a local input as partners on the SIP.</p>

  <p>The value of consultancy work, the remit of such work and the outcomes achieved by it are matters currently under consideration by Renfrewshire Council as part of the financial health check they are carrying out in relation to Paisley Partnership Regeneration Company.

  <p>The review has been completed and I am publishing its report today. Copies of the report are available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 26789).</p>

  <p>I am delighted that the PFMR has concluded that, on the whole, SEPA is performing its duties well. But I want SEPA to do better still and I welcome the recommendations set out in this report as a means of helping it to do so.</p>

  <p>The First Minister outlined his commitment to environmental justice last year. The recommendations in the report will contribute towards delivering that objective in two ways. They will enable SEPA to improve the quality of environment protection that it provides to communities across Scotland and to respond more effectively to major environment protection challenges, such as tackling diffuse pollution and improving Scotland's performance in waste management. Just as importantly, they will ensure that SEPA becomes more responsive to the communities that it serves, by equipping it to engage more effectively with those who live and work in those communities.</p>

  <p>I have asked SEPA and my officials to complete by the end of July a plan for implementing the recommendations in the report.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, further to his answer to question S1W-9467 on 19 September 2000, whether the matter of the financial costs of the new Parliament building at Holyrood is of greater controversy than it was in March 2000; whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) will now provide to the public all available financial information; what the reasons are for the position on this matter in the light of the position given in the answer to question S1W-9467; whether it will continue to be the position that documents in relation to the package awarded to Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd will not be disclosed; if so, whether the SPCB will review this position and what the reasons are for the position on this matter, and, if such reasons relate to potential prejudice to any legal action, how any such action could be prejudiced or damaged by such disclosure, given that the legal liability will already have been set and cannot be in any way altered by such disclosure.</p>

  <p>It is not the responsibility of the Holyrood Progress Group (HPG) to manage project managers. The "construction management" method of procurement adopted for the new Parliament building project is a relatively new adaptation of more traditional procurement methods used in the UK construction industry. The method requires the Construction Manager, appointed on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, to put a framework in place for managing the construction process. The HPG, however, does include among its members two independent professional advisers, both of whom bring extensive experience of delivering major building projects.</p>

  <p>A full scheme of delegated authorities, both functional and financial, is in place for the Holyrood project. This covers, <em>inter alia</em> , the levels at which resources can be committed and expenditure incurred. The exercise of these authorities is monitored as part of day-to-day management and by both internal and external audit.</p>

  <p>The Holyrood Project Team regularly responds to a considerable number of enquiries regarding the Holyrood project. Some of these enquiries can readily be answered by drawing on material in existing reports and others can only be dealt with by carrying out additional research.</p>
