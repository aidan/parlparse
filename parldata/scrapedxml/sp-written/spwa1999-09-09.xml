  <p>We are committed to minimising the regulatory burdens on business. It is already the case that a Regulatory Impact Assessment must accompany any new legislation and any consultation papers on regulatory proposals that have an impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies.

  <p>The Scottish Executive believes that the present NHS pay system is outdated and needs modernising if it is to support the development of the modern, patient focused service we are determined to provide for the people of Scotland. In pursuing proposals to modernise the system we recognise the need to balance the benefits of UK pay mechanisms, such as the independent Pay Review Bodies, with the need for flexibility to implement new terms and conditions of service in ways that best meet the particular needs of the NHS in Scotland. We believe it is right and in the interests of the service in Scotland that we play a full part in the current talks aimed at developing a new UK-wide NHS pay system.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive fully supports staff who want to combine work with domestic responsibilities and has offered job sharing, part time work and other flexible working patterns for a considerable time. Job sharing involves identifying two members of staff with matching skills and abilities and work patterns which will complement each other and we strive to achieve a match in these areas which meets the needs of the staff and the manager involved.</p>

  <p>We have no record of a request to job share being refused.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports the thrust of the Agenda 2000 beef reforms which are designed to phase-out intervention as a means of supporting the beef sector, and by so doing eventually eliminating the various problems which arise when stocks have to be released on to the European market, or exported to third countries. In the short run, I think that it is important, wherever possible, to manage releases in a way which causes the minimum disruption to other farming and meat industries.</p>

  <p>I have already taken positive steps with the industry to encourage and promote increased sales of our lamb both at home and abroad. Extra money has been given to help find new markets too. Additionally, the European Commission has been asked to introduce private storage aids for lamb. I will be convening further meetings with the industry over the autumn to keep the position under review, and to look at any ways in which the present difficulties affecting the sheep sector might be relieved.</p>
