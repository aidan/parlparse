  <p>The current monitoring of the RSI target involves a three-stage assessment to be repeated annually. The stages are:</p>

  <p>1. A bi-annual (spring and autumn) prevalence assessment of the numbers of rough sleepers across Scotland, to be measured as a &quot;snapshot&quot; figure for a typical week.</p>

  <p>2. A bi-annual audit of direct access accommodation offered and available to rough sleepers. This work to be carried out alongside the prevalence assessment (above).</p>

  <p>3. A qualitative assessment of how demand and supply factors work together in various localities across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The first set of quantitative data was collected in one week in May. I am placing copies of the report on this exercise in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 15838).</p>

  <p>In summary the report indicates that during the study week an average 64 people each night were reported as sleeping rough in Scotland.<strong> </strong>The average in Glasgow was 23, with 19 in Edinburgh and 22 across all of the other<strong> </strong>26 participating local authorities. This assessment will be repeated in October and a full report, including a qualitative assessment of supply of and demand for services in key authorities, will be produced in March of 2002.</p>

  <p>The case was halted because one of the essential witnesses was deemed unfit to complete his evidence. The decision to do so was based upon an assessment by an experienced clinical psychologist. As is common in major cases, the Crown Office will consider whether any matters have arisen the further examination of which may be beneficial for future cases.</p>

  <p>In my reply to Mr McNulty&#8217;s question (S1W-12613) answered on 22 December 2000 we undertook to report quarterly on the numbers of letters received by ministers and our performance in answering them. In the quarter January to March 2001, 3,960 letters were received for ministerial reply, of which 60 per cent received a reply within 17 working days and 79 per cent received a reply within 25 working days.</p>

  <p><u>Quantitative targets</u></p>

  <p>Achievement of a target income of &#163;120,000 from new work or new customers.</p>

  <p>Completion of 95 per cent of all scientific tests and analyses within the timescales set by customers.</p>

  <p>Ensuring, as part of the agency&#8217;s rolling programme of consultation of customers, that 95 per cent of the customers for the services of the official seed testing station for Scotland are at least &quot;satisfied&quot;.</p>

  <p><u>Milestone targets</u></p>

  <p>Fulfilment of the agency service level agreement within the budget agreed with ERAD.</p>

  <p>No. The location of telecommunications apparatus is a matter in the first instance for the telecommunication companies, in line with their operational requirements. Their decisions on location are, of course, subject to the new planning controls.</p>
