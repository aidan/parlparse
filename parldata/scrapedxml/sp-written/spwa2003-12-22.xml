  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the value has been of consultancy contracts awarded by its department dealing with enterprise, and each of the department&#8217;s agencies, to Ernst and Young in (a) the current financial year and (b) each of the last three financial years, and what percentage of these contracts was awarded on a non-competitive basis, showing the total value of each such contract.</p>

  <p>The value of contracts awarded by the Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department to Ernst and Young in 2003-04 to date is &#163;415,798.23, for the provision of financial advice in relation to the renewal of the Scottish passenger rail franchise. This is a continuation of a competitively-awarded contract from the previous year. Of the total, &#163;341,791.23 was for advice under the original terms of the contract. The balance was the result of an extension of this contract, by means of a non-competitive action, to include a review of rail rolling stock leasing. This extension is equivalent to <em>22</em> % of the total value.</p>

  <p>In 2002-03, the value of contracts awarded by the Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department to Ernst and Young was &#163;34,538.00 for the provision of financial advice in relation to the renewal of the Scottish passenger rail franchise.</p>

  <p>The department awarded no contracts to Ernst and Young in 2000-01 or 2001-02.</p>

  <p>Information on consultancy contracts awarded by agencies of the department or by its sponsored non-departmental public bodies is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The interests of disabled people are an extremely high priority for the Scottish Executive and it is our aim that they have the same opportunities to travel as other members of society Although there are presently no plans for any formal assessment to be made of the progress of local authorities in making their streets and services accessible to disabled people we will continue to encourage local authorities to ensure that their facilities and infrastructure are accessible to all.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including the implications for devolved matters in Scotland of its legislative programme. This contact reflects the approach, set out in Devolution Guidance Note 1 in accordance with the principles set out in the memorandum of understanding, that the administrations normally consult each other from an early stage on the development of relevant legislative proposals.</p>
