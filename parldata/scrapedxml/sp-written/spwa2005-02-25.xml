  <p>Discussions have been held with Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (HIAL) on several occasions &ndash; at official and ministerial level - over the last year regarding the review of the PFI contract at Inverness airport terminal and the impact of a buy-out on the airport and the wider economy. With the support of the Executive, HIAL is now seeking to secure the buy-out of the contract. HIAL will be aiming to secure best value for the taxpayer in these sensitive negotiations and an announcement will be made at their conclusion.</p>

  <p>As part of the freight and business park development at Inverness airport, there are long-term goals to develop park and ride facilities and provide a rail halt at the airport. A study is currently being carried out into the upgrading of the A96 from the airport turn off to Inverness. HIAL will continue to discuss the improvement of public transport services to the airport with transport operators.</p>

  <p>The Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 received Royal Assent on 26 July 2004. Many of the measures came into force on 28 October, including antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) for under 16s, dispersal of groups and closure of premises. Other measures have either come into force since then, such as the ban on sales of spray paint to under 16s (5 November 2004) and fixed penalty notices for noise offences (28 February 2005) or will come into force in the coming months. Parenting orders and restriction of liberty orders for under 16s will become available in April, while commencement of antisocial behaviour notices is planned for November 2005.</p>

  <p>Information on use of the measures in the act will be collected and published on a regular basis as part of the monitoring and evaluation of the act. To end February 2005, there have been no antisocial behaviour orders made in respect of persons under 16 and the dispersal power has not yet been used, although we understand forces are planning to do so. The first closure order was made on 21 January 2005 and we know that at least three closure orders have been made to date.</p>

  <p>The management and operation of Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre is the responsibility of the Home Office.</p>

  <p>Outwith Dungavel, Scotland&rsquo;s police force, prison service or medical staff may use retraint on asylum seekers as they would for any other individual. Also, Scottish ministers have statutory responsibility for transferring mentally ill persons detained under the Immigration Act to hospital. These powers are contained in Section 71 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. The use of restraint under the mental health act would be the same for asylum seekers as for any other person.</p>

  <p>In respect of training, in 2004 a training needs analysis of panel members and a work load review of the training service were conducted. Subsequently the Scottish Executive has resourced additional capacity within the training units to ensure that training needs can be delivered.</p>

  <p>Consultation on Phase 2 of the review will begin shortly.</p>

  <p>There has been no correspondence with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) regarding any proposals to test a new electromagnetic supergun at the Dundrennan firing range. The MoD has advised the Scottish Executive that representatives of Dumfries and Galloway Council have visited the range at the invitation of the MoD and have seen the test firing and, as far as MoD is aware, are content.</p>

  <p>The MoD also advises that the existing gun hardware (rather than a new supergun) has been used for tests for the US Navy. Since there was nothing new in these limited tests, the MoD did not consider it necessary to consult with any external organisations, since the conditions were the same as have been used without incident for the past decade or so.</p>

  <p>1. Delay by reporting agency figures now also include those marked no-pro time-bar as being time-barred upon receipt.</p>

  <p>2. &quot;Reports resulting in a conviction&quot; includes cases where accused pleaded guilty before trial.</p>

  <p>3. &quot;Pending Cases&quot; includes cases which do not have a status of &quot;closed&quot; in our case management system as at 1 June 2004. It includes cases where criminal proceedings have started but not yet concluded, cases where there is an outstanding warrant and cases which have resulted in conviction but the sentence has been deferred or proceedings have been re-activated because of a breach of community order or a current appeal, It is therefore possible that a case will also be recorded in another column in this table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not <u>yet </u> produced any guidance for licensees on the responsible promotion of alcohol. The Licensing (Scotland) Bill was introduced <u>to</u> Parliament on 28 February. The bill contains a number of measures that support ministers <u>&rsquo;</u> objectives of tackling binge and under-age drinking. Specifically, it outlaws nationally those irresponsible drinks promotions that can lead to binge drinking.</p>

  <p>Ministers intend to issue guidance to licensees as part of their implementation of the new regime.</p>

  <p>Changing to Deliver Division was set up in late 2002 to take forward the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Changing to Deliver cultural change and reform programme.</p>

  <p>Changing to Deliver was launched as a two-year programme of centrally managed activities and projects, complemented by action at local level within departments to promote business improvement and improve communications. The programme has four broad themes: developing leadership; outcomes; outward focus, and corporate processes. Changing to Deliver Division provided an overall programme management function, as well as undertaking direct responsibility for a number of projects and supporting culture change activities within departments.</p>

  <p>The division has contributed to improving the Executive&rsquo;s operation through the key products and achievements of Changing to Deliver. These include:</p>

  <p>Improved leadership, through promoting better internal communications and the sharing of knowledge and information across the organisation. Staff&rsquo;s positive rating of leadership in the Executive is almost twice as high as in a benchmark group of other UK government departments and public sector organisations.</p>

  <p>Improved outcomes, through introducing a major new training programme on open, engaged and evidence-based policymaking, and developing networks to share good practice amongst policy makers and celebrate excellence and innovation.</p>

  <p>Improved outward focus, through promoting a culture of openness and information sharing, for example through better and easier-to-access policy consultations, a programme of internal and external secondments, and the publication of a &quot;Who&rsquo;s Who&quot; chart for external stakeholders. Over 70% of the 824 stakeholders surveyed in autumn 2004 were satisfied with their dealings with the Executive in the previous year and two-thirds considered that the Executive&rsquo;s approach to working with other organisations has got better since devolution.</p>

  <p>Improved processes, for example through initiatives to reinforce sound financial management across the organisation; the introduction of a new HR strategy; streamlining business planning processes, and introducing a balanced scorecard to support strategic planning and performance management.</p>

  <p>The centrally managed programme of activity was mainstreamed in autumn 2004. The division is now building on change activity already underway by focusing on performance management, improved approaches to corporate internal communications and continued development of policy-making and stakeholder engagement.</p>

  <p>The first debt sale was concluded in March 1998 being sold to Greenwich Natwest (GNW), a division of National Westminster, now Royal Bank of Scotland (RBoS). SLC were appointed to undertake the day-to-day administration. The original contract was for five years from March 1998 and SLC successfully negotiated renewal for a further five years administration period commencing March 2003. There are no variations in the contract.</p>

  <p>The second portfolio was concluded in March 1999 and the purchaser was a consortium comprising Deutsche Bank, AG London and Nationwide Building Society. SLC were awarded a five year contract to administer the portfolio. The original contract expired in March 2004 and the debt owners took the decision to award the contract for administration to another agency. The key terms and conditions of the loan are all protected.</p>

  <p>Student loans have been an integral part of an affordable student funding system since 1990. The most recent information from the Higher Education Statistics Agency and the Scottish Further Education Council, gives details over the five year period from 1998-99 until 2002-03.

  <p>The number of students aged 25 and over receiving support from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland has remained broadly unchanged since the introduction of a wholly loan based system of living cost support in 1999. This would suggest that potential mature students do not regard the current student loans arrangement as a disincentive.</p>

  <p>Loans have been an integral part of an affordable student funding system since 1990. We do, however, appreciate that some students from less affluent backgrounds may be concerned about accruing debt while they study. That is why, in 2001, the Executive introduced the non-repayable Young Student&rsquo;s Bursary (YSB) to replace part of the loan to which eligible young full-time students from low-income backgrounds are entitled. This will reduce the level of debt which such students would otherwise have on graduation.</p>

  <p>I recently announced that, from 2005-06, the maximum annual support provided through YSB will be increased by 11% to &pound;2,395. The parental income threshold has also been increased. These changes mean that approximately 3,000 additional students will now be able to receive the bursary and approximately 20,000 will receive the maximum bursary.</p>

  <p>Future repayments depend on a wide range or factors, and are therefore difficult to forecast. In the past year work has been carried out to improve the student loans repayment model. There has been extensive testing, though, as with all models, it will be subject to further analysis and refinement.</p>

  <p>The table summarises the model&rsquo;s results for the loan repayments, at different thresholds, from April 2006. From April 2005, the threshold will be &pound;15,000.</p>

  <p>Note: Student loans are treated as outwith total managed expenditure, which means that the net costs are met by HM Treasury (gross student loan advances less student loan repayments). This income is the repayment of a debtor balance within the balance sheet. This &quot;income&quot; (loan repayments) and the loan advances are shown in the Budget Act to meet the requirements of section 1 of the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000. At the year-end these figures are reflected within the balance sheet and not within the Operating Cost statement.</p>

  <p>The amount of student loan that a graduate repays each month and the period of time over which repayments are made are linked to the level of the borrower&rsquo;s income and the amount borrowed. Under the support arrangements introduced in 2001-02, many students who will be liable to pay the endowment when they graduate will have been eligible to receive the Young Students Bursary in place of part of their loan entitlement. Most liable graduates will have borrowed less under the current arrangements than they would have under the previous system. No student should have borrowed more.</p>

  <p>Student loans were accounted for on a cash basis until 2000-01. From 2001-02 they were accounted for entirely on a resource accounting basis. To facilitate the change, both cash and resource accounts were published in 1999-2000 and 2000-01.</p>

  <p>In the year ended 31 March 2000, student loans were accounted on the basis of the Scottish Executive share of the Student Loan Company loan book, giving a balance of &pound;458.554 million. In the year ended 31 March 2001 the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s share of these loans was accounted for on the basis of the loans balances of students domiciled in Scotland. This meant that the opening balance of student loans was recalculated to be &pound;420.880 million.</p>
