  <p>Disparity in the length of waiting times for IVF across NHS boards in Scotland is due, in part, to differences in criteria and funding being applied across NHS boards which is a long standing problem.</p>

  <p>We are funding Infertility Network Scotland to work with NHS boards to fully implement infertility guidance and ensure patients voices are heard in the future provision of this service. In addition, an Expert Group on Infertility Services will shortly be set up and the group will consider how best to ensure equity of access across Scotland.</p>

  <p>No. The Scottish Government does not support the cultivation of genetically modified crops in Scotland. In addition, the recent Health Check of the Common Agricultural Policy abolished the Energy Crop Scheme (ECS) since the rapid growth in the bio-energy market means that there is no longer sufficient reason to continue to grant specific support for energy crops.</p>

  <p>However, various forms of support are available, for example under the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP), to encourage the development of new farming ventures which could include renewable energy initiatives.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS recognises the importance of robust risk assessment and risk management of offenders, particularly when they are being considered for community access in preparation for release.</p>

  <p>Integrated Case Management is the multiagency process used to assess and manage offenders whilst in custody. All prisoners who are subject to statutory supervision will be discussed at an annual case conference with the involvement of both community and prison based social work partners. Those cases assessed as high risk will have further scrutiny as part of establishment risk management groups with senior management and psychology input.</p>

  <p>Prisoners being considered for community access are risk assessed and a community risk management plan is prepared. Suitability is determined by a multi-disciplinary group from a variety of agencies taking account of a wide range of prison and community generated case management information.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS applies a number of strategies to motivate suitable prisoners to attend offending behaviour programmes. The SPS operates an Integrated Case Management (ICM) process designed in such a way as to encourage participation and ownership from the prisoner. This integrated system includes referral to &quot;change&quot; programmes and is generally successful in motivating participation.</p>

  <p>The SPS constantly looks to improve what it does and it is currently in the process of reviewing its suite of sex offender programmes. Prisoner resistance to participation is higher for sex offender programmes that for other &quot;change&quot; programmes. The SPS is developing an amended programme that will encourage resistant offenders to participate in such programmes. This new programme will contain a preparatory motivational component.</p>

  <p>A majority of local authorities and their community planning partnerships (CPPs) set out plans for strategic deployment of the Fairer Scotland Fund (FSF) in Single Outcome Agreements (SOAs) for 2008-09. A smaller number of CPPs presented stand alone FSF plans for one year only. As requested in FSF guidance, all of these high level plans included information on the intended means of engaging communities in planning strategic investment of the fund.</p>

  <p>By the end of September 2009, the first SOA annual reports and stand alone FSF reports, covering 2008-09, will be shared with the Scottish Government. Information contained in these reports should demonstrate how local authorities and community planning partnerships have involved communities of place and interest in strategic investment of the FSF.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Centre for Regeneration will use this information to inform dialogue between community planning partnerships on sharing effective practice, as part of the facilitated Learning Network for Community Regeneration and Tackling Poverty.</p>

  <p>Final uptake statistics for the first year of the HPV vaccination programme will be published at the end of September and it is not possible to pre-empt what these will say. However, the provisional uptake statistics published in March showed that initial uptake amongst girls in school was very good and anecdotally we understand that this has continued to be the case. The September publication will also provide the first statistics available on the uptake of the vaccine by girls in the catch-up cohort who are no longer in school.</p>

  <p>Analysis of the HPV vaccination uptake figures has always been part of the planned public health monitoring and evaluation of the HPV immunisation programme. Where statistics indicate a significant problem in uptake of the vaccination we will look into that in more detail to understand what the reasons may be. This kind of analysis is routinely carried out for other childhood immunisation programmes in Scotland as part of public health monitoring activities.</p>

  <p>A roundtable discussion took place on the 14 April 2009 in St Andrews House, where ministers discussed with third sector leaders how the sector is responding to the downturn, its longer term resilience, and how to ensure the maximum alignment between government, the third sector, local authorities and other public bodies, in both weathering the downturn and making the most of the emerging opportunities.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers considered carefully the issues emerging from the roundtable discussion, and have agreed a set of actions to take forward the key issues. (The agreed set of actions can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/15300/ProposedActions)" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/15300/ProposedActions)</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently developing with it&rsquo;s third sector partners a Resilience Fund for third sector organisations providing front line services that have been affected by the recession, through either seeing an increased demand for their services or experiencing cash flow difficulties.</p>

  <p>Funding of &pound;1.6 million to &pound;1.7 million will be available and it is intended would be targeted at third sector organisations who can clearly demonstrate, and describe, how a shock caused by the recession has led to increased demand or significantly undermined their services.</p>

  <p>An announcement about the parameters for the fund will be made soon.</p>
