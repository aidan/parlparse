  <p>I have been fully involved with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Ministers in considering the impact of this review.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on concerns that the review of EU Directive 91/414/EEC, which restricts a number of pesticides currently used by farmers, will result in a significant reduction in crop production, especially in crops such as wheat, potatoes and brassica field vegetables.</p>

  <p>We share these concerns, and along with the UK Government will be continuing to make them known when the proposals return to the European Parliament. We will also seek clarification of the precise impact which the current proposals would have if they were to be adopted. We consider that any large-scale withdrawal of currently approved pesticides could have a significant effect on crop production in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on proposals, under the review of EU Directive 91/414/EEC, that might prevent the use of fungicides including triazoles, nematacides and the herbicide linuron.</p>

  <p>We consider that, taking into account the best scientific data on the safety of these products, the proposals go beyond what might be reasonably required to mitigate the risks which these substances pose under realistic conditions of use. The loss of triazoles, in particular, would present farmers in Scotland with severe difficulties in controlling barley and wheat diseases.</p>

  <p>The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 places a statutory requirement on Scottish ministers to compile and maintain a schedule of monuments of national importance. Once designated in this way, these monuments are protected under the provisions of that act.</p>

  <p>Scheduled monuments on farming land are further protected through the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition standards (GAEC) attached to Single Farm Payments. Under GAEC, farmers must avoid altering, damaging or destroying protected elements of the historic environment, including scheduled monuments.</p>

  <p>The Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13 (SRDP) offers financial support for the management of archaeological sites under the Conservation and Upgrading of the Rural Heritage set of measures. In addition, agri-environment funding under SRDP Rural Development Contracts is on condition that recipients avoid damaging any feature or area of historic or archaeological interest. This condition applies to both designated and undesignated archaeological sites on farming land.</p>

  <p>Under the 2007-13 Scotland Rural Development Programme, payments to land managers to protect archaeological sites are made under the Conservation and Upgrading of the Rural Heritage set of measures. The Scottish Government is aware that some stakeholders are in favour of moving some of these payments into the agri-environment set of measures, as was the case in the 2000-06 Scotland Rural Development Programme. The issue will be considered by the Scottish Government as part of its working towards a modification of the Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13 in 2009. Any changes to the programme will need to be agreed by the European Commission.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what benefits to agriculture it considers are derived from the set-aside scheme.</p>

  <p>Set-aside was introduced in 1992 as a tool for reducing surplus production in the arable sector, to permit better management of the market. Since then the Common Agricultural Policy has undergone significant changes which have largely removed the problem of surplus arable production. In addition to this primary function, set-aside has also produced environmental benefits.</p>

  <p>Land use decisions are a matter for individual land managers. Set-aside requirements have been suspended for 2008. If they are abolished as part of the EU&rsquo;s Common Agricultural Policy Health Check, then it is to be expected that arable land previously used for set-aside will be brought into or remain in production.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S3W-16043 and S3W-16044 by Richard Lochhead on 19 September 2008, what the difference is between the area claimed as set-aside in the table in the answer to question S3W-16043 and the area designated as set-aside (Ha) in the answer to question S3W-16044.</p>

  <p>The figures shown in S3W-16043 detail the set-aside land claimed on the area aid application 2003 and 2004 to support claims submitted under the arable area payments scheme and the set-aside land claimed on the single application form to claim payment on the set-aside entitlements allocated under the single farm payment scheme.</p>

  <p>The figures shown in S3W-16044 are from the June agricultural census (JAC). And are generally higher than the land claimed for subsidy because the JAC figures can include land that has been voluntarily set-aside and is not subject to support scheme rules.</p>

  <p>The Accountant in Bankruptcy maintains the Register of Insolvencies in Scotland and publishes statistics on personal insolvencies in Scotland by financial year, in their annual report.</p>

  <p>Details of the numbers of bankruptcies are not available by local authority area, but are recorded by Sheriffdoms as all petitions for bankruptcy, prior to 1 April 2008, were considered by the Scottish Courts.</p>

  <p>Since 1 April 2008, whilst creditor petitions are still considered by the sheriff, the Accountant in Bankruptcy has responsibility for debtor applications and records all awards of bankruptcy by Sherrifdom area.</p>

  <p>The following table provides the number of bankruptcies for the financial years 2006-07 and 2007-08, and for the first quarter of 2008-09 (1 April to 30 June). There has been a significant increase in the number of people becoming bankrupt in Scotland in the first quarter of this financial year compared to previous years. This increase is due to the bankruptcy reforms contained in the Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>

  <p>Further information including the annual reports is available on the Accountant in Bankruptcy&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.aib.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.aib.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Before Scottish ministers gave consent to the Section 36 application for the Gordonbush wind farm, the outline habitat management plan was made available as part of an addendum which was subject to public consultation. No representations were subsequently received from the Deer Commission for Scotland or the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>

  <p>As a statutory consultee in all section 36 applications, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) considered the outline plan and lifted their objection subject to mitigation conditions being imposed safeguarding nature conservation interests. A Section 75 agreement has still to be agreed with the local authority and other stakeholders and will incorporate the final requirements of SNH.</p>

  <p>Health and safety regulation and enforcement is a reserved matter. The Scottish Government is however aware of, and supports, the action taken by the Health and Safety Executive to improve safety at all Scotland&rsquo;s opencast coal sites following the tragic accident at a site in 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has been working with the Health and Safety Executive and other organisations within Scotland&rsquo;s health and safety system on the implementation of the <em>Scottish Action Plan on Health and Safety</em> which contains a range of measures to support improvements in health and safety in Scotland. Copies of the action plan are available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 46565).</p>

  <p>We are also taking forward proposals to transpose <em>EC Directive 2004/35/EC on the management of waste from the extractive industries</em>. The purpose of this Directive is to ensure that mineral waste is managed in a way that reduces as far as possible risk of damage to the environment or human health. However, the Directive&rsquo;s requirements in relation to on-site safety are already adequately covered by existing health and safety regulation.</p>

  <p>The Financial Services Authority (FSA) defines &quot;sub-prime&quot; mortgages as those &quot;targeted at consumers with impaired or low credit ratings who may find it difficult to obtain finance from traditional sources&quot;.</p>

  <p>Data are available for those with impaired credit ratings but not for those with low credit ratings. For Scotland as a whole, in the period April 2005 to June 2008, the FSA found that 21,130 mortgages arranged in Scotland were in cases where the main, second or other borrower had an impaired credit history. This represents 3.4% of the total number of mortgages (630,334) issued in Scotland over this period.</p>

  <p>Similar figures have been calculated for local authority areas. The proportion of mortgages to borrowers with impaired credit histories ranges from 1.4% (in Shetland) to 4.4% (in North Lanarkshire).</p>

  <p>We are committed to recruiting 1,000 additional police officers during the lifetime of this Parliament. 150 centrally-funded officers were recruited in 2007-08 and an additional 450 will be recruited during this financial year. A further 200 officers will be recruited in each of the two subsequent years. As the member knows, police numbers in Scotland are at record levels with some 16,339 whole time equivalent officers in post at 30 June, an increase of 118 since the previous quarter. It is not for the Scottish Government to dictate to chief constables what size their forces should be, but these figures are set to increase substantially as forces, such as Strathclyde, plan to increase their total complements to unprecedented levels.</p>

  <p>The key to the police service&rsquo;s ability to respond to the demands placed upon it is not just about its size, but its capacity. That is why we are working closely with our partners in COSLA, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and with police boards, to ensure that we have the right people with the right skills in the right place at the right time. Our focus has always been, and will continue to be, on building the capacity of the police service.</p>

  <p>OCPAS (Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland) regulated appointments and most unregulated appointments follow Nolan principles.</p>

  <p>Some bodies, both regulated and unregulated, require appointments to their boards to be made on a nomination basis. This is due to the statutory requirements of the founding legislation of these bodies. Nominations would be made, for example, by local authorities or relevant representative groups or bodies. Ministers will formally approve many of these appointments.</p>

  <p>The number of appointments that have been made without adherence to Nolan principles since May last year is thought to be small. Specific information on this is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Low cost improvements in this context would include measures aimed at improving the operation and safety at these junctions, for example signing, road markings, lighting, and visibility. I have asked the operating company, BEAR Scotland Ltd, to look at how both junctions operate and bring forward recommendations. It is not possible to estimate the cost until BEAR has concluded this study.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government staff handbook makes it clear that staff incurring car parking fines for parking illegally whilst on official business will not be reimbursed from official funds.</p>

  <p>However there are occasions when circumstances arise which are beyond the control of officials and which prevent officials returning to parked vehicles in time to avoid incurring parking fines. Such occasions are very rare but do sometimes arise. An example would be where there is a meeting between a minister and the public, supported by an official, which overruns the scheduled time allocated.</p>

  <p>Since May 2007, four occasions have arisen where the Scottish Government has reimbursed officials for car parking fines incurred, at a total cost of &pound;110. A clear audit trail outlining the individual reasons for applying for reimbursement is held on file for audit inspection.</p>

  <p>Information about parking fines is contained in the following table.</p>
