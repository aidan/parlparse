  <p>The following table provides information on how much funding the Scottish Executive has made available to each local authority over 2004-08 to tackle antisocial behaviour. The funding made available in 2004-05 and 2005-06 was allocated for community wardens and for services to support people affected by antisocial behaviour, for example helplines, neighbour mediation, victim support and specialised antisocial behaviour teams. From 2006, Executive funding will support the priorities identified by local authorities and their Community Planning Partners, in consultation with local people, as part of their antisocial behaviour strategies.</p>

  <p>A review of levels of morbidity associated with cancer treatment is underway by the Cancer Care Research Centre, University of Stirling in collaboration with the Information Services Division, National Services Scotland. This will not estimate how many cancer patients receive care at home, the number of carers supporting cancer patients remaining at home requiring support themselves, nor the financial costs faced by cancer patients as a result of their treatment and care.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated that the review will be completed by early 2006.</p>

  <p>The staff at Careers Scotland involved in the industrial action on pay are employed by Scottish Enterprise. My answers to the member&rsquo;s earlier questions about Careers Scotland pay matters (S2W-11800 and S2W-11801 answered on 10 November 2004) made clear that, as an executive non-departmental public body, Scottish Enterprise has delegated responsibility for conducting its own pay negotiations with the unions.</p>

  <p>It is therefore the case that any industrial action that may result from any breakdown in pay negotiations is similarly for Scottish Enterprise, as the employer, to deal with. I am aware however, that Scottish Enterprise is working towards resuming negotiations.</p>

  <p>The data available centrally relate to the number and cost of items dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors. These data are not patient-specific and cannot be used as a proxy for the number of patients receiving any particular drug treatment.</p>

  <p>In 2003-04, for methylphenidate (Ritalin), there were 5,281 items dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors in Fife NHS Board and 3,085 items dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors in Greater Glasgow NHS Board. These data relate to items dispensed for all age groups.</p>

  <p>We have not set any regional targets for attracting people to Scotland under the Fresh Talent initiative. That does not mean that we will not be seeking to monitor its overall success. However, Fresh Talent is a long-term initiative, and evaluation will take time. In the meantime, we are carrying out some more immediate evaluations that will give us some useful data.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>

  <p>We will know how many people successfully apply to live and work in Scotland under the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme, and we are currently in discussions with the Home Office to develop a robust and workable arrangement for monitoring and evaluating the scheme. The Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme goes live in summer 2005.</p>

  <p>We will also know the number of people interested in living and working in Scotland via the number of enquiries to the Relocation Advisory Service and the numbers visiting the website.

  <p><em>Bridging the Gap: Improving access to primary healthcare services for disabled people - </em> was commissioned and published by the Scottish Consumer Council (SCC) on 16 March 2005. Consequently, there have been no discussions as yet with SCC about this report or its recommendations. We would intend to progress the report&rsquo;s conclusions and recommendations in the context of an on-going three year project with the Disability Rights Commission, who are working with NHS Scotland to ensure services respond sensitively to the needs of disabled people.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive monitoring and evaluation programme has been in place since the launch of the healthy living campaign. We are tracking awareness and understanding of the TV adverts. We are monitoring the number and type of calls to the advice line and level of traffic to the healthy living website, as well as demand for these services in different socio-economic groups.</p>

  <p>The Health Education Population Survey 1996-2003, (2004) provided evidence of increasing public knowledge of healthy choices. For example:</p>

  <p>The Executives Health Department&rsquo;s White Paper <em>Partnership for Care </em> sets out our commitment to the training and development of qualified staff to Continued Professional Development (CPD) and the entitlement for training for all other health service staff in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Each NHSScotland board holds within their annual funding allocation a budget for nursing and midwifery post-registration education, and therefore they will be working in partnership with their nursing staff to ensure that they are supported and encouraged to develop and maintain their skills.</p>

  <p>NHS boards, as employers, will wish to ensure that all health care professionals, not just nurses, maintain their CPD to ensure that they continue to be registered with the relevant registration body as fit to practise. It is a requirement of continuing professional registration that qualified staff have CPD.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards will now be reviewing their arrangements for CPD and other staff development as part of their implementation of the pay modernisation scheme we know as <em>Agenda for Change</em>. This scheme through the Knowledge and Skills Framework encourages health service employers to provide development opportunities and career progression for their employees.</p>

  <p>Also, all NHS boards are required within the legislation for Staff Governance to ensure that all staff are appropriately trained. As part of this requirement they are obliged to ensure that all staff have a personal development plan. These development plans will inform a training needs analysis which in turn will assist the development of a local learning plan. This allows boards to ensure that they plan training and development in a considered and responsible way whilst meeting the learning needs of staff. It must be remembered that training and development can be provided in a variety of different ways not just the traditional method of training courses but in mentoring, coaching, reflective learning and peer review.</p>

  <p>The ever changing world of health care requires new and different skills to deliver health care in different ways. The investment in pay modernisation provides a mechanism to allow staff to augment their traditional roles in order to deliver the care packages required. The investment is not just about an investment in monetary terms but also in a Knowledge and Skills Framework which is a competency based framework for the continued development of staff.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards are required to undertake regular staff surveys as part of the Staff Governance legislation. This includes questions on training provision so that all NHS boards can gather a staff perspective if their training and development needs are being met.</p>

  <p>The Area Partnership Forums with local trade union representatives are at the centre of developing action plans in local boards to address local concerns on training provision.</p>

  <p>In addition to this <em>Facing the Future</em>, the Department&rsquo;s Nursing and Midwifery Recruitment and Retention Initiative has released &pound;1.75 million for additional CPD in 2002-03, and again a similar amount in 2003-04, and in 2004-05 &pound;1 million was given to boards for CPD for nursing staff.</p>

  <p>I refer you to my reply to question S2W-15461 on 18 April 2005, and the Executives Health Department&rsquo;s White Paper <em>Partnership for Care </em> sets out our commitment to the training and development of qualified staff to Continued Professional Development (CPD) and the entitlement for training for all other health service staff in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Each NHSScotland boards holds within their annual funding allocation a budget for nursing and midwifery post-registration education, and therefore they will be working in partnership with their nursing staff to ensure that they are supported and encouraged to develop and maintain their skills.</p>

  <p>Once NHS boards, as employers of NHSScotland staff, have determined that nurse prescribing is a requirement of the nurse&rsquo;s role and that patient care would benefit from this extension to the nurse&rsquo;s role, the nurse in question would make an application to undertake an academic course which appropriately meets their needs. This application would be made in partnership with the health service manager as part of service planning and development and who will be required to authorise any study leave. The Executive pay the course fees and make a contribution to the replacement costs involved while the nurse is on study leave.</p>

  <p>NHS boards, will wish to ensure that all health care professionals, not just nurses, maintain their CPD to ensure that they continue to be registered with the relevant registration body as fit to practise. It is a requirement of continuing professional registration that qualified staff have CPD.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards will now be reviewing their arrangements for CPD and other staff development as part of their implementation of the pay modernisation scheme we know as <em>Agenda for Change</em>.

  <p>We have three national surveillance tools for measuring activity levels in Scotland: the Scottish Health Survey, Health Education Population Survey and Health Behaviour in School-aged Children.</p>

  <p><em>Scottish Health Survey </em>is used to monitor overall levels of physical activity in Scotland and this was the data source used for the Physical Activity Strategy. The last published data was collected in 1998. This showed that two thirds of adults (aged 16 to 74) and half of all children (aged two-&lt;16) in Scotland do less than the minimum needed for health. The survey was repeated in 2002-03 and this new data will be published in late 2005. The results will indicate whether levels of physical activity have changed since 1998.</p>

  <p><em>Health Education Population Survey</em> is undertaken by NHS Health Scotland. This survey monitors changes in what adults (aged 16+) know about health, how they feel about it and what they do or intend to do about it. The last published data (Oct 2004) show that there has been an increase in the proportion of adults who are aware of how much activity they need for health as well as a small reduction in sedentary behaviour.</p>

  <p><em>Health Behaviour in School-aged Children</em> <em>(HBSC)</em> is a World Health Organisation 36 country survey which allows us to compare Scottish children aged 11, 13 and 15 with children of the same age in other countries. It was carried out in 1990, 1994, 1998 and in 2002. Questions about physical activity have been included in all surveys. However, 2002 was the first time that the current guideline for children (one hour a day) was measured. The HBSC trends over the past decade show increases in physical activity levels in all age groups and persistently lower rates of physical activity among girls compared to boys. The survey also shows that activity levels of children in Scotland are slightly above the overall average for the study as a whole.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Lord Advocate will pursue criminal action against those who allegedly falsified the information relating to suicide watches in HM Prison Kilmarnock, as reported in the BBC documentary broadcast on 9 March 2005 and in the findings of the fatal accident inquiry into the death of James Barclay in HM Prison Kilmarnock in January 2002 when it was stated in evidence that such watch logs were falsified regularly.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-15477, answered on 18 April 2005. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>I have considered the findings of the fatal accident inquiry into the death of James Barclay in HM Prison Kilmarnock on 11 January 2002. Two prison officers gave evidence at the inquiry in relation to falsifying watch logs. Prior to them giving evidence, the Procurator Fiscal granted both officers immunity from any future criminal prosecution arising from the circumstances leading up to the death of James Barclay. He did this as he could not conceive of a situation whereby they would face criminal charges arising from the circumstances surrounding the death of James Barclay, but wanted to ensure that the inquiry received the fullest account possible of relevant events. Although it would not be open to the Crown to bring criminal charges in light of that grant of immunity, the Procurator Fiscal was correct in concluding that there was no basis for criminal proceedings against them.</p>

  <p>In addition there is no basis for criminal proceedings against those prison officers alleged, in terms of a BBC documentary, to have falsified information relating to suicide watches in HM Prison Kilmarnock.</p>

  <p>The Invergarry-Kyle of Lochalsh Trunk Road (A87) Extension (Skye Bridge Crossing) Toll Order 1992 was made by the then Secretary of State for Scotland, as the statutory roads authority for the A87 trunk road. The Highland Regional Council did not have the power to make such an order.</p>
