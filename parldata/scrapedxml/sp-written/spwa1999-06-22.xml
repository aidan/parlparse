  <p>No. The contract was signed in March 1999 and construction is underway. The people of North Ayrshire are looking forward to the benefits of accessing a major new local FE facility by the middle of the year 2000.</p>

  <p>We attach high priority to tackling fuel poverty in Scotland. We are pursuing this through the new &pound;12 million Warm Deal which will come into effect on 1 July 1999 and will help low-income households in all sectors of the stock and provide work for unemployed youngsters. The investment programmes which will flow from the New Housing Partnerships initiatives and the resources available to local authorities for works to their own stock will also reduce the number of fuel poor.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to publish, as soon as possible after 1 July 1999, details relating to its liability to pay for the costs incurred in respect of building the M6 cross-border motorway link and any future running costs that may or will be incurred together with clarification as to whether any of the costs relate to parts of the motorway link located within England.</p>

  <p>An analysis of the liability and costs which fall to the Scottish Executive for the M6 Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) contract can be examined in the Report <i>The Contract to Complete and Operate the A74(M)/M74 Motorway in Scotland</i> published on 9 April 1999 by the National Audit Office. The DBFO contract included an option to construct to motorway standard the Guards Mill-Carlisle section of the A74 in England and to maintain and operate the section of road between the border and Carlisle. As the Report states, this option was not ultimately taken up, therefore the geographical limits of the contract lie entirely within Scotland.</p>

  <p>The traffic impact assessment carried out by Halcrow Fox and completed in early June 1999 did not identify significant traffic problems arising from the siting of the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood. Roadworks will be required as part of the landscaping design of the area surrounding the building. Cost estimates are not yet available and funding is a matter for the Scottish Executive.</p>
