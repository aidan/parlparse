  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what percentage of its research budget is allocated to prostate cancer.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), within the Scottish Executive Health Department, has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. The CSO does not allocate its funds to particular illnesses or conditions. Cancer is a research priority and in 2004-05 CSO spent 23% of its total budget on cancer research.</p>

  <p>In 2004-05, the CSO allocated &pound;34.74 million of its budget of &pound;49.21 million to health boards to meet the cost to the NHS of hosting, supporting and conducting non-commercial research (funded by Government, charities and research councils). The remainder of the CSO&rsquo;s budget is spent on directly funded research by responding to requests for funding research proposals initiated by the research community in Scotland. This role is well known and advertised throughout the healthcare and academic community.</p>

  <p>The CSO is not funding directly any research on prostate cancer. The CSO would be pleased to consider research proposals for innovative prostate cancer studies of a sufficiently high standard. These would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>The Executive has invested over &pound;200 million in our central heating and warm deal programmes installing over 60,000 central heating systems and providing insulation measures for a further 200,000 households. Our central heating programme provides pensioners with a number of free measures including central heating, and insulation along with a free benefits health check and advice on how to reduce energy use. In addition to this, the Executive provides grant funding to the Energy Saving Trust in Scotland to deliver a range of programmes and advice to promote energy efficiency in the domestic sector and to assist people to reduce their energy use.</p>
