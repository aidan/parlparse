  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions took place between it and the UK Government prior to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s Budget 2005 announcement regarding the establishment of a new agriculture inspectorate; which ministers participated in any discussions; whether it will place the minutes of any discussions in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre; whether the new inspectorate will have offices in Scotland; how it will report to the Executive and the Parliament; who will appoint its board; what role the Executive will have in such appointments, and how much of the inspectorate&rsquo;s budget will be for devolved functions.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for agricultural inspections in Scotland is devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The new agriculture inspectorate announced by the Chancellor will not operate in Scotland and consequently Scottish ministers were not involved in discussions about it. We will, however, monitor developments to see what lessons there may be for improving our farm inspection processes.</p>

  <p>I attended the one day Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on Monday 14 March with Margaret Beckett, Ben Bradshaw and Ian Pearson.</p>

  <p>The main item for discussion at this council was rural development. The presidency focussed discussion on a small number of issues in the current proposal to revise the Rural Development Regulation, principally focussing on financial matters including the minimum spend per axis and the LEADER reserve. The UK reiterated the importance we attach to devoting at least half of the financial resources under the Regulation to Axis 2; we expressed some doubt as to the level of the LEADER reserve proposed, and we supported others in giving a general welcome to the likely shape of the strategy framework.</p>

  <p>On fisheries, the council reached unanimous agreement on the proposal to establish the Community Fisheries Control Agency. The remaining issue of the scale of Commission representation on the agency's administrative board was resolved. A compromise was reached on six members (with a total of six votes) for the Commission, in addition to one for each member state. A joint Council and Commission statement makes it clear that this high degree of Commission representation is not a precedent for other any other possible agencies.</p>

  <p>The Community Fisheries Control Agency is intended to co-ordinate fisheries enforcement operations, known as joint deployment plans, to help provide equality of inspection standards across the community. All the major Scottish negotiating objectives for the agency were achieved, including a number of significant reforms to the Commission&rsquo;s original proposal. The agency will be based in Vigo and is scheduled to begin work formally within a year.</p>

  <p>On agriculture, the Commission presented proposals for EU measures to address market crises through risk management measures funded through modulation. This was a brief presentation, with substantial discussion planned for later in the year. The Commission made it clear that it opposed extending any kind of generalised safety net provision such as that found in the current beef regime. It also indicated that the use of any modulated funds would only be possible in the context of rural development programmes and measures that were compatible with the WTO Green Box.</p>

  <p>The Commission reported progress in negotiations with the Russian Federation to agree certain plant and animal health controls. While the UK has not so far been among the member states most affected by Russian requirements, it was encouraging that progress was being made to resolve the remaining differences.</p>

  <p>The Commission also presented a progress report on implementation of the EU forestry strategy. Member states took note.</p>

  <p>Under other business, Portugal drew attention to the difficulties that prolonged drought had caused in its rural areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have cases referred to it specifically because of concerns about asbestos disposal from brownfield sites. Local authorities are the competent authorities for land use planning matters in Scotland and they consult the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) on a broad range of planning applications. SEPA&rsquo;s responses are not, however, recorded in such a way as to identify applications where asbestos related issues have been raised.</p>

  <p>Detailed information on the cost of council tax discounts is not held centrally. The local government funding formula, which has been agreed with local authorities through COSLA, takes account of council tax levels by incorporating information on the forecast number of Band D properties in each local authority area, adjusted for the number of such properties which attract a discount.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what evidence it has of children contracting <em>E.coli </em> as a result of contact with farm animals and, if it has such evidence, how many cases there have been in each of the last six years for which figures are available.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-04-13.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0413.htm#5">

  <p><em>E.coli</em> O157 can be a serious infection and, in addition to causing gastroenteritis, is the most common cause of kidney failure in children in Scotland. Infections occur as either outbreaks, where a general outbreak is defined as involving members of more than one household or as sporadic cases where only one individual or household is affected with no apparent links to known outbreaks.</p>

  <p>Health Protection Scotland conducted a national case-control study of sporadic cases of <em>E.coli </em>O157 in Scotland from 1996 to 1999. This study found that contact with the faeces of animals found on farms or smallholdings emerged as the strongest single risk factor for <em>E.coli</em> O157 infection. This type of contact was most common amongst children aged four to seven.</p>

  <p>Between 1996 and 2003, in cases where the source of infection could be established, Health Protection Scotland identified;</p>

  <p>eight outbreaks of <em>E.coli</em> O157 located on farm premises, in which 20 children under 16 were infected.</p>

  <p>An additional 40 children were infected with <em>E.coli</em> O157 after camping on ground used for pasture, which was contaminated with farm animal faeces.</p>

  <p>A further 11 children were infected with <em>E.coli</em> O157 in outbreaks where the evidence suggested that water supplies were contaminated by farm animal faeces.</p>

  <p>In 1999, 29 children were infected with <em>E.coli</em> O157 infection in a single outbreak, after eating homemade goat&rsquo;s milk cheese prepared on a smallholding.</p>

  <p>In March 2005 the Scottish Executive launched a campaign to raise awareness of the risk of contracting <em>E.coli</em> O157 from animals/animal pasture and to advise of simple precautions which can be take to reduce this risk.</p>

  <p>There are a range of measures of inflation on the economy &ndash; the Consumer Price Index is one that is used for measuring the change in the prices of consumer goods and services. We will continue to use the appropriate measure for the individual issue being considered. We do not produce general guidance on the use of inflation measures, though we work closely with public bodies and agencies to ensure that best practice is followed when designing, implementing, and evaluating policies.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-04-13.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80097" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0413.htm#7">

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not commissioned any specific research on the cost of alternative arrangements for pupils excluded from school.</p>

  <p>Alternative arrangements for excluded pupils may be paid for from a wide range of funding streams within the National Priorities Action Fund and GAE expenditure. It is therefore not possible to conclude what local authorities have spent on alternative arrangements.</p>

  <p>For example, in 2005-06 through National Priorities Action Fund, the Scottish Executive is making available &pound;11 million for Alternatives to Exclusion; &pound;10 million for implementation of Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning; &pound;25 million for Inclusion; &pound;9.6 million for Support for Teachers; &pound;12 million for Study Support, and &pound;25.8 million for Integrated Community Schools. All of these strands of the National Priorities Action Fund may be used to support arrangements for pupils excluded from school and to prevent exclusions from school.</p>

  <p>With the publication of <em>Let&rsquo;s Make Scotland More Active</em> in 2003, a designated policy team for physical activity has been established within the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Health Improvement Strategy Division.</p>

  <p>Delivery of the physical activity strategy is facilitated by key partners including <strong></strong>sportscotland, NHS Health Scotland, COSLA, the NHS, Scottish Natural Heritage, Greenspace Scotland, Paths for All, Scottish Sports Association as well as other departments of the Scottish Executive such as education, transport, environment, planning.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the co-ordination of the efforts of all partners to progress implementation of the Physical Activity Strategy lies with the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Health Improvement Strategy Division.</p>

  <p>In 2005 the Scottish Physical Activity and Health Council was established. This council comprises of policy, evidence and delivery experts who will advise the Scottish Executive and its partners on strategic issues that affect implementation of the Physical Activity Strategy.</p>

  <p>Two websites have been developed to raise public awareness and knowledge of physical activity. One forms part of the Healthyliving national campaign and is available at <a href="http://www.healthyliving.gov.uk/physicalactivity/" target="_blank">http://www.healthyliving.gov.uk/physicalactivity/</a> . The other is a new physical activity section which has been added to the Scottish Executive website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/Introduction/Introduction" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/Introduction/Introduction</a> .</p>

  <p>We are also establishing a Scottish Physical Activity Alliance - a network of evidence providers, policy-makers and practitioners. One role of the alliance will be to compile local and national information on physical activity programs, projects and trends and to highlight and publicise current activities nationwide. Information will be disseminated through a range of communication channels such as an electronic newsletter, website and promotional materials. NHS Health Scotland are taking this work forward in 2005-06.</p>

  <p>We are seeking to ensure that every child in Scotland has access to services to support them in being active enough to meet the minimum activity level required for health. The Executive has invested &pound;24 million in Active Schools and over 600 Active School Co-ordinators will be recruited by 2007, with some of these in special educational needs schools. They will increase the levels of activity among school aged children, irrespective of ethnicity or ability, by developing programmes of high quality opportunities to enable them to participate in regular, frequent, safe and fun activities incorporating physical activity, sport, play and active travel.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is funding a national development officer for Play@Home, a physical activity programme for children from birth to five years. This programme provides parents with guidance on safe and beneficial ways of handling a child to stimulate motor and sensory development within the home.

  <p>As part of our efforts to raise Scotland&rsquo;s international image announced by the First Minister on 1 July 2004 international journalists from both Poland and the Czech Republic visited Scotland in Autumn 2004. The cost of the visit amounted to &pound;6,805.78 and resulted in a range of television and other media coverage in Poland and Czech Republic. We continue to work with these established links to ensure that Scotland and Fresh Talent continues to receive attention as the initiative goes forward.</p>

  <p>Officials recently attended the DNI Careers-Work Fair in Wroclaw and the Perspectives 2005 Careers and Education fair in Warsaw to promote Scotland as a destination of choice for migrants from Poland seeking new opportunities. A range of media activity was also included in the visit and we expect additional coverage in the Polish media to reinforce Scotland&rsquo;s Fresh Talent ambitions. The cost of the visit amounted to &pound;3,163.91. Poland is second only to the United Kingdom in terms of visitors to <a href="http://www.scotlandistheplace.com" target="_blank">www.scotlandistheplace.com</a>, which reflects the existing strong links between Scotland and Poland and the increased promotional activity we have undertaken. In recognition of these strong links with Poland we have asked First Public Relations to ensure that we continue to reinforce Scotland&rsquo;s strengths and to take advantage of suitable opportunities as they present themselves.</p>

  <p>In general, promotion to the accession states is an integral part of the wider international promotion of Scotland activity through our website and distribution of Fresh Talent information leaflets via the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, British Council and Scottish Development International. In addition, all ministers promote Scotland as a place to visit, study and work both during overseas visits and when receiving visiting foreign dignitaries.</p>

  <p>Source: Family Resource Survey Individual Incomes Analysis</p>

  <p>Note: 1. Excludes any income which is not accrued directly to the individual in their own right, but also excludes student loans, Social Fund loans and benefits in kind.</p>

  <p>Total income includes all elements of income that are accrued to the individual in their own right. This includes income from earnings, self-employment, occupational pensions, investments, social security benefits and tax credits. Elements of income that are generally accrued by a household rather than an individual are excluded, e.g. housing benefit and council tax benefit, and income from letting/sub-letting.</p>

  <p>(b)/(c) The Executive does not currently collect information on the debt of individuals. It is planned that the proposed ONS survey on wealth and assets will collect information on household debt. The survey is in its early development stages. If it goes ahead, some data for Scotland should be available from this source.</p>

  <p>1. Includes wages and salaries, self-employment income, pensioners income, all state benefit, payable tax credits and investment income, <u>net of:</u> income tax, National Insurance, Council tax, contributions to occupational pensioners and maintenance payments.</p>

  <p>2. A family (or benefit unit) is a single adult or a couple together with any dependent children, so a household can contain more than one family. It is assumed that all families in the household benefit equally from the combined net income of the household.</p>

  <p>3. Figures may not add up to the totals due to rounding.</p>

  <p>The figures are estimates based on a sample survey and are therefore subject to sampling variation.</p>

  <p>The 2003-04 figures are not comparable with the 2002-03 figures previously published, as the 2003-04 figures are based on the new grossing regime which was introduced this year - for more information on this, please see the Households Below Average Income, 2003-04: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/29170611/06123" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/29170611/06123</a>.</p>

  <p>The Proposal for a European Council Decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record for mutual legal assistance requests requires each member state to designate a single central authority for initial contact. It will be possible, however, to designate more than one central authority for on-going contact, for the exchange of information in connection with such requests and for sending information back to the state of nationality at the time of conviction in individual cases. The question of which authority should be designated for the exchange of Scottish criminal records is under consideration.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what involvement it has had in the decision to establish a UK Stem Cell Foundation; what the foundation&rsquo;s relationship will be with the Scottish Stem Cell Network; what funding the Executive will give to the foundation; how it will be represented directly, or indirectly, on the board of the foundation; which of its agencies will be involved with the foundation and what will be the nature of such involvement, and what potential the foundation has for the expansion of stem cell research and related activity in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The UK Stem Cell Foundation is being established by a prominent group of individuals, including Sir Chris Evans of Merlin Biosciences, Sir Richard Sykes of Imperial College, Sir Richard Branson, Professor Lord Winston and venture capitalist Jon Moulton. While it is a private organisation, the Scottish Executive is in touch with the Foundation to discuss the scope for joint working on the development of stem cell research in Scotland. The Scottish Stem Cell Network (SSCN) has had a very positive, informal relationship with the UK Stem Cell Foundation to date and it is likely that some members of the SSCN will have more formal roles with the foundation as it becomes established. Scottish Enterprise is also in direct touch with the organisation.</p>

  <p>I understand that the foundation is seeking to address the current limited funding available for translational research &ndash; i.e. clinical development activities. This complements the existing funding councils and bodies in the UK &ndash; such as Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Welcome Trust - who generally fund basic science development. The Executive is therefore very keen to work with the foundation in developing Scotland&rsquo;s undoubted strengths in stem cell research and related activity.</p>

  <p>NHS boards do not receive specific funding to operate community hospitals. Each NHS board receives an annual allocation of funds. It is for each board to decide how to utilise these funds to meet the health care needs of its resident population taking account of national and local priorities.</p>

  <p>No further guidance has been issued on this matter. Currently, conservation area consent is not normally required for the partial demolition of buildings (including unlisted gates, fences, walls or other means of enclosure) in conservation areas.

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The available information on prisoners who are currently serving a life sentence is given in the table:</p>

  <p>Information on Life Sentenced Prisoners in Custody on 25 March 2005</p>

</table></p>

  <p>The punishment part of a life sentence is the period imposed by the court at time of sentence which it considers is required for the purposes of retribution and deterrence. The prisoner will spend that minimum time in custody before being considered by the Parole Board for release on life licence. The expiry of the punishment part is not an automatic guarantee of release on licence. The Parole Board will not direct release unless it is satisfied that the prisoner no longer presents an unacceptable risk to the public.</p>

  <p>These figures are provisional and may be subject to amendments at a later date. They also do not include any life sentenced prisoners who are being held in the state hospital or any life sentenced prisoners who have been recalled to custody after being released on life licence.</p>

  <p>The report of the PFMR of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) was published by the Scottish Executive today. The report recognises the RBGE as a world class Scottish institution that holds a remarkable international reputation for its size. The RBGE is held in high esteem by the people of Scotland and is numbered amongst the most popular visitor attractions in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The report recommends greater prioritisation of the RBGE&rsquo;s activities, improved performance management, better communication between the Executive and the RBGE and a need for additional funding.</p>

  <p>The recommendations have been accepted by the RBGE and the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department. A key component of their implementation will be the development of a sustainable corporate plan for the RBGE. To assist with that process the Executive has confirmed its priorities to the RBGE and is increasing the garden&rsquo;s grant-in aid by &pound;0.5 million to &pound;7.088 million in 2005-06, by a further &pound;0.6 million to &pound;7.688 million in 2006-07 and by a further &pound;0.6 million to &pound;8.288 million in 2007-08 for the development of those priorities.</p>

  <p>The STSS is currently being reviewed in common with all public service pension schemes throughout the UK as a result of the UK Government&rsquo;s plans to raise the normal pension age for most public servants from 60 to 65.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers have already guaranteed that the pensions of existing teachers will be protected until 31 August 2013. Existing teachers will retain the right to retire at age 60, but pension rights accrued after 1 September 2013 will be subject to actuarial reduction as they will be calculated on a normal pension age of 65. Teachers joining the Scottish Teachers&rsquo; Superannuation Scheme will be subject of a pension age of 65 with effect from 1 April 2006.</p>

  <p>Consultation on the proposed changes ended on 14 January and the results are still being analysed. In addition, the UK Government announced on 18 March that it would enter into further negotiations with trade unions. No firm decisions have yet been made as negotiations are still on-going.</p>

  <p>Occupational pension policy is a reserved matter and HM Treasury directly fund most of the public service pension scheme costs. Scottish ministers are responsible for producing the detailed public service pension scheme regulations but this generally only extends to ensuring that scheme regulations are consistent with Scottish administrative and legal requirements whilst remaining in line with UK Government policy. In addition there is an underlying requirement to, where possible, maintain uniformity in public service pension schemes across the UK.</p>

  <p>Following agreement on public service pension scheme reforms at UK level, the Scottish Public Pensions Agency together with colleagues in the Department for Education and Science will review the pension arrangements for teachers taking account of the responses to the recent consultation exercise on the various options for a new scheme. Scottish ministers will then consider the final design of the new teachers&rsquo; scheme in Scotland and bring forward detailed draft regulations for consultation. It is likely to be later this year before final decisions are made.</p>

  <p>The Winding Down Scheme, which is a phased retirement option as proposed in the agreement, <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> was introduced to the Scottish Teachers&rsquo; Superannuation Scheme with effect from 1 July 2002. This scheme allows teachers to enter part-time winding down employment but to be credited with full service during the winding down period.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA), who are responsible for the administration and regulation of the Scottish Teachers&rsquo; Superannuation Scheme (STSS) provide information about membership of the scheme to the Government Actuary so that he can undertake the quinquennial review of the scheme. Data is provided on a number of aspects of the scheme, including ill-health and mortality. The Government Actuary&rsquo;s Report can be obtained from the SPPA.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not carried out any research on the effects of long service on teachers&rsquo; performance.</p>
