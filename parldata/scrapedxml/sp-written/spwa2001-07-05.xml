  <p>Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd is responsible for the level of individual fares within CFares, its general fare structure. It is required to seek approval by the Scottish ministers for proposed annual adjustments to average fares across its network. Under this requirement, the company was authorised to increase its average fares for 2001-02 by 2.5%, in line with our policy to protect fare levels on the company&#8217;s lifeline ferry services.</p>

  <p>Last year I asked the company to undertake a review of its present fare structure. It appointed independent consultants to carry this out and the review has recently been completed, following two rounds of consultation with interested parties.</p>

  <p>Strategies for the care of patients with a wide variety of conditions, including dyspraxia, are the responsibility of health boards, who are best suited to assess local needs. Ultimately, the decision on a diagnosis or whether to adopt a particular form of treatment is a matter for individual clinical judgement.</p>

  <p>Children with dyspraxia are usually treated by a combination of occupational therapy and physiotherapy. They may also benefit from educational support, and will therefore be among the children who will benefit from the Executive's &pound;12 million inclusion programme announced on 11 May 2000.</p>

  <p>The Discipline Task Group, which recently published its report <i>Better Behaviour - Better Learning</i> , considered a wide range of difficulties created by indiscipline in schools in both urban and rural areas. Members of the task group did have experience of rural areas, and views were sought from teachers and pupils across the country. Evidence is that exclusions and absence rates are lower in rural schools. Nevertheless, the task group acknowledged that some issues raise particular concerns for rural schools. For example, behaviour on school transport can be a problem, as can exclusions where the choice of alternative school is limited.</p>

  <p>Working with Highlands and Islands Enterprise, we have recently secured a significant inward investment from the Danish wind turbine company Vestas in a new manufacturing facility near Campbeltown which will provide over 150 jobs in the area. In addition, along with Scottish Enterprise Energy Group based in Aberdeen, we actively encourage companies in Scotland to diversify into the manufacturing opportunities which are arising from such renewable energy developments. A series of Scottish Enterprise roadshows on the subject attracted interest from a variety of companies and, as a direct result, several of them are now pursuing opportunities for new business.</p>

  <p>Our promotion of these developments will be further strengthened by our Renewables Obligation (Scotland). One of its aims is to assist the renewables industry to become competitive and thus to provide more employment.</p>

  <p>The Executive has committed &pound;22.6 million to implement the recommendations of the Beattie Committee which examined the needs of young people who require additional support to make the transition to post-school education and training or employment. The National Action Group chaired by Alisdair Morrison, the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning is providing a national lead and focus for implementing this inclusiveness agenda in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, we conducted a review of services for people with learning disabilities and published the findings in <i>The same as you? </i>in May 2000. The review considered ways to ensure that people with learning difficulties are included in community life, education, day opportunities, employment, and leisure and recreation. Change funds of &pound;36 million over the first three years have been provided to local authorities to assist with implementing its recommendations.</p>

  <p>In the further education sector, colleges may already claim extra funding from the Scottish Further Education Funding Council to reflect the cost of providing additional support to students with disabilities and other special needs.</p>

  <p>These measures support the Executive&#8217;s commitment to create an inclusive society and will have a positive impact on the lives of people with learning difficulties wishing to overcome barriers to accessing educational opportunities.</p>

  <p>New Deal for Disabled People will be extended nationally from July 2001, providing assistance with job-search techniques, work preparation, pre-vocational or occupational training and work placements.</p>

  <p>People with learning disabilities are entitled to immediate entry to Training for Work, the Executive&#8217;s training programme for unemployed adults.</p>

  <p>New Futures Fund supports projects aimed at developing work skills while providing intensive support to unemployed people in Scotland who face serious disadvantage in looking for work. Projects currently help clients suffering from mental or physical disability.</p>

  <p>Support is available under the 2000-06 Objective 3 European Social Fund Programme in Scotland for measures to improve employment opportunities and to combat and prevent unemployment. Minimising the effects of social exclusion is one of the main priorities under the programme and people with learning disabilities are specifically targeted for support. Organisations such as the Scottish Association for Mental Health, the Centre for Independent Living and Scottish Enterprise Fife have already been awarded grants under the programme.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s review of services for people with learning disabilities, <i>The same as you?</i> was published on 11 May 2000. Change funds of &pound;36 million over the first three years have been provided to local authorities to assist with implementing the review&#8217;s recommendations on including people with learning disabilities in community life, education, day opportunities, employment, and leisure and recreation. Answered on the 20 April 2000, question S1W-14328 and S1W-14602 provide details of the distribution of these additional funds.</p>

  <p>The Kelvin Hall in Glasgow stages indoor athletics events of international standard and is the only such facility in Scotland. As I said in my response to question S1O-03427, <strong></strong> sportscotland has ongoing dialogue with local authorities and the Scottish Athletics Federation about the provision of adequate national facilities for athletics.</p>

  <p>No. Economic factors condition the number of veterinary surgeons required. Veterinary qualifications are recognised throughout the European Union and there are reciprocal arrangements for recognition of veterinary qualifications of other countries, most notably Australia and New Zealand which allows the free movement of suitably qualified persons.</p>

  <p>The control of foot-and-mouth disease in Scotland was not adversely affected by any shortage of veterinary surgeons. The State Veterinary Service operates on a Great Britain basis and was able to take on veterinary surgeons from private practice, research, other government departments as well as many veterinary surgeons from overseas.</p>

  <p>The funding of veterinary training is a reserved matter.</p>
