  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on the interaction between housing benefit policy and policy on devolved matters. Discussions were held with DWP at official level on those aspects of closure orders which impact on housing benefit issues during the bill stages of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004. Those discussions covered eligibility for housing benefit under a range of scenarios where a closure order resulted in a claimant for housing benefit being excluded from the property to which their claim related. The outcome of those discussions informed ministers&rsquo; position on closure orders during stage 2 of the consideration of the bill; the stage 3 Executive amendment which required the sheriff to have regard to the vulnerability of an occupant who had not engaged in antisocial behaviour when considering an application for a closure order; and the guidance which has been issued to police and local authorities.</p>

  <p>The questions on numbers of carers and carers&rsquo; assessments are addressed in recent written answers. I refer the member to questions S2W-11761 answered on 9 November 2004 and S2W-12399 answered on 2 December 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="/webapp/wa.search" target="_blank">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 requires local authorities to offer direct payments in order to purchase services in lieu of those which a local authority would normally provide itself. Information about the number of carers in receipt of direct payments is not held centrally, but a total of 912 people received direct payments in the year to 31 March 2004. A breakdown of numbers receiving direct payments by local authority area can be accessed from table number 8 of the statistics release <em>Direct Payments Scotland 2004</em>, available at the following website:</p>

  <p>Funding will be available to local authorities from 2006 onwards to assist further roll-out.</p>

  <p>The Executive is not building a national database.

  <p>Building on the First Minister&rsquo;s speech on St Andrew&rsquo;s Day 2003, the Executive is committed to providing access to cultural excellence in pursuit of its wider objective to build a better Scotland. We have therefore set ourselves targets, within the <em>Building a Better Scotland Spending Proposals 2005-2008</em> , both for increasing access and maintaining the excellence of our cultural offering. As regards access, our target is to increase by 3% the numbers of people taking part in cultural activities funded by the Executive, by March 2008, maintaining the balance of participation across the population. As regards excellence, our target sets out to increase the number of cultural successes by 3%, by March 2008. Our agencies are committed to playing their full part in delivering these targets, and delivery will be monitored. The spending proposals also specify the funding that has been committed in order to meet our objectives.</p>

  <p>The Cultural Commission has been asked explicitly, in the remit for its on-going review, to take into account our top priority for &quot;both access and excellence to be a constant throughout cultural provision in Scotland&quot;. This imperative is also central to the ongoing cross-portfolio agenda which I am pursuing with cabinet colleagues further to the First Minister&rsquo;s statement that every ministerial portfolio would make a contribution, recognising its role and responsibilities in helping to strengthen and support the development of cultural activity in this country. Ways to celebrate and promote Scotland&rsquo;s cultural output, here and overseas, also feature in this broad agenda.</p>

  <p>The Executive issued a consultation document today. This is being sent to agricultural, horticultural, environmental and consumer groups; to those growers who are authorised to issue plant passports, and to those with current or recent outbreaks of quarantine pests. Copies of the documents pertaining to the consultation, which will run for 12 weeks, will also be placed on the Scottish Executive website. I have also made arrangements for a copy of the consultation to be placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34640).</p>

  <p>We announced in June the allocation of &pound;5 million for cleaning up derelict and contaminated land that is creating health risks or causing blight on local communities. I am pleased to say that I am able to allocate a further &pound;5.720 million to local authorities for this purpose in 2004-05, bringing the total to &pound;10.720 million. All councils were invited to submit bids. The distribution I am announcing today is aimed at supporting proposals for remediation of those sites considered highest priority in terms of risk to public health and the environment.</p>

  <p>The distribution of resources is shown in the table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working closely with UK Government to ensure that Scotland contributes fully to the UK Presidency of the EU &ndash; both in terms of identifying priorities in the UK-Luxembourg Operational Programme, which was adopted on 13 December, and in bringing related events and meetings to Scotland.</p>

  <p>The overall co-ordination of the UK Presidency is discussed at meetings of the Joint Ministerial Committee (Europe) which I attend, and at the regular meetings of the UK Presidency Co-ordinators Group at which the Executive is represented by officials from Europe Division.</p>

  <p>There are currently some 25 Presidency events planned to take place in Scotland, providing an excellent opportunity to showcase Scotland and to contribute positively to the development of EU policy initiatives.</p>

  <p>Information about the numbers of persons employed in the sea fisheries catching sector are compiled annually by the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. Each person employed is classified as regularly employed if employment in the catching sector is their main or only source of income. All other persons employed in the catching sector are classified as being irregularly employed. The geographical location of those employed is associated with the port that they work from as opposed to their place of residence.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows employment in the catching sector over the period 1979-2003 (inclusive) and also presents catching sector employment as a percentage of the working age population. These latter statistics are based upon the mid-year population estimates produced by the General Register Office for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Source: Number of persons employed in the catching sector: Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>There are a number of sources of employment data for the fish processing industry in Scotland although very few allow the examination of employment regionally.</p>

  <p>The Sea Fish Industry Authority periodically conducts a survey of the entire fish processing sector in the UK. The survey specifically aims to capture information about those persons who are employed seasonally or casually in the industry and uses this information to calculate a full-time equivalent employment figure for each company surveyed. An additional benefit of this survey is that it is possible to differentiate between companies primarily involved in the processing of either marine fish or salmon.</p>

  <p>Table 3 shows employment in companies primarily involved in marine fish processing in 2004 at the county level. To protect the confidentiality of individual companies, it has been necessary to group together a number of counties containing less than five fish processing companies. These statistics may not be released at the constituency level.</p>

  <p>This includes: working with Scotland's key business organisations on summit planning; providing information for businesses about the summit on scottish-enterprise.com; working with Foreign and Commonwealth Office consultants on possible sponsorship opportunities; alerting companies to summit procurement opportunities advertised in the Official Journal European Union (OJEU) and identifying companies who may be in a position to tender for services which fall under OJEU thresholds; providing suggestions from across the enterprise networks for company and other possible press visits.

  <p>The new General Medical Services (GMS) contract came into effect on 1 April 2004. It requires GPs to provide medical services for their patients and specifies the on-going treatment and management of chronic illnesses. Chronic pain management forms an important part of this service. Additionally, the Quality and Outcomes Framework recognises and rewards GPs for good chronic disease management which includes those with chronic pain.</p>

  <p>Training in the management of chronic pain is part of the training received by every general practitioner. All doctors working in primary care are required, as part of their annual appraisal, to have a personal learning plan, based on their own needs: GPs might include the updating of knowledge and skills in chronic pain management in such a plan. Guidance and assistance on training for general practitioners is available to GPs from NHS Education for Scotland via the Postgraduate Directors of General Practice Education.</p>

  <p>Public concern around proposed changes to their local NHS services is understandable. The NHS must develop ways of engaging the local population in dialogue about how future NHS reforms will take shape and how they will affect the quality of care and delivery of services. Draft interim guidance was issued to the NHS in May 2002 on &quot;Consultation and public involvement in major service change&quot; and this is being revised to reflect comments received from a number of stakeholders and the experiences of consultation across Scotland. The new guidance &quot;Informing, Engaging and Consulting the Public in Developing Health and Community Care Policies&quot; will issue shortly and places a new focus upon informing and engaging with the public as soon as considerations of service change begin.</p>

  <p>The NHS Reform (Scotland) 2004 places a new duty upon the NHS to involve the public and boards must be able to demonstrate that they have taken genuine steps to inform, engage and consult the public over changes to services. This will be assessed by the Scottish Health Council which is being established as a body which will provide independent reports to the NHS, the Health Department and Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>To acknowledge the changes that are taking place in the way health services are delivered, a National Framework for Service Change in NHSScotland is being developed to support the change process ahead. A National Framework Advisory Group has been established to drive forward the review and is being led by Professor David Kerr and is due to report in March 2005. Comments from the public have been welcomed as a key part of the review. A newsletter describing the work of the group was distributed to NHS staff and to the public which poses a number of questions on the future and seeks views on them. The advisory group has begun holding regional meetings for the public across Scotland.</p>

  <p>A number of organisations, including private sector banks and Registers of Scotland regularly publish house price data at both a national and sub-national level. Many also disaggregate the national data by house type. As a result the Scottish Executive has no plans to publish additional house price information.</p>

  <p>In respect of housing land supply, the relevant information is collected and held by planning authorities, and is not held centrally. <em>Scottish Planning Policy 3: Planning for Housing </em>(SPP3) says that planning authorities should carry out regular monitoring of housing completions and availability of effective land by preparing a housing land audit. In most urban authorities, these audits are carried out annually. SPP3 also requires planning authorities to ensure that their development plans identify the housing land requirement for at least 12 years from the plan&rsquo;s expected date of approval, and to ensure that a five-year effective supply of land is maintained at all times.</p>

  <p>The findings and recommendations of the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD), <em>Why Mothers Die 2000-2002</em> , are relevant to all health care professionals responsible for the planning and provision of care to pregnant and recently delivered women. All NHS organisations and individual staff are advised to consider the recommendations within the CEMD Report and to develop action plans for change where needed in their local services or individual practice.</p>

  <p><em>The Framework for Maternity Services (2001)</em> and the report of the Expert Group on <em>Acute Maternity Services (2002)</em> addresses many of the recommendations that the CEMD has made.

  <p>The planning system is based on a plan-led system by which planning authorities are required to make their decisions in accordance with the development plan for the area in question. Through the <em>Making Development Plans Deliver</em> consultation, we are working towards ensuring that development plans are up to date so that decisions can be made quickly and consistently.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has proposed a number of specific measures to help speed up the determination of planning applications.

  <p>Planning authorities are subject to a number of targets for the processing of planning applications. These are:</p>

  <p>(1) 80% of all applications for planning permission (aggregating householder, major and other applications) must be determined within two months.</p>

  <p>(2) 85% of all applications for planning permission (aggregating householder, major and other applications) must be determined within three months.</p>

  <p>(3) Taking the subset of householder applications as a separate category, 90% of these applications must be determined within two months.</p>

  <p>(4) Taking the subset of householder applications as a separate category, 95% of these applications must be determined within three months.</p>

  <p>(5) Taking the subset of major applications as a separate category, 80% of these applications must be determined within four months.</p>

  <p>The reason that additional targets are applied to the separate category of householder applications is that they are for the most part straightforward and are expected to be processed more quickly. An additional target for major applications is set because they tend to be more complex and may raise controversial or sensitive issues which in turn take longer to determine.</p>

  <p>The general targets which apply to all applications therefore take into account the fact that speedier determination of householder applications (which are also more numerous) should balance out slower progress on the major development applications.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive invited views on its proposals for reform of the development planning system in its consultation paper <em>Making Development Plans Deliver</em> which was published in April 2004. The proposals in the consultation paper were grouped under four key themes, that is more efficient management of the development planning process; more effective consultation and engagement in the preparation of plans; making plans shorter and targeted on key spatial issues; ensuring that plans are aimed at delivering desirable outcomes in terms of improving the environment; protecting what we value and promoting high-quality development. These proposals will all contribute towards securing more efficient operation of the development planning system and the achievement of more satisfactory planning outcomes.</p>

  <p>In relation to development control the determination of planning applications takes place within a &quot;plan led&quot; system. That means that development plans (structure and local plans) form the basis of the planning system through setting the framework for land use and development in their areas. In determining planning applications local authorities are required to have regard to whether proposals are consistent with the development plan for the area. The Executive&rsquo;s proposals to ensure coverage across Scotland of relevant and up-to-date development plans should therefore help to ensure that decisions on planning applications can be taken more quickly and consistently.</p>

  <p>A white paper outlining the Executive&rsquo;s proposals for modernising planning is expected to be published in spring 2005.</p>
