<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-06-05.S3W-13421.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0605.htm#2">

  <p>Operations Rooms or Emergency Medical Dispatch Centres (EMDCs) control the deployment of staff and vehicle resources to meet demand.</p>

  <p>In 2002, under the previous administration, the Scottish Ambulance Service approved the move from eight operations rooms covering accident and emergency and the Patient Transport Service to three EMDCs (Edinburgh, Inverness and Paisley) and a &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model for Patient Transport Service dispatching based in hospitals.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing confirmed in her statement to Parliament on 4 June that she has asked the Chief Medical Officer to commission an independent evaluation of the front loaded model. The terms of reference will be agreed in partnership.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service had noted that resources are deployed more efficiently and effectively than before. Moving the patient transport dispatching to sit within hospitals has supported better punctuality and reliability of service. There is also more local decision making, involving partners in the planning and operation of the Patient Transport Service now they are based in hospitals.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ambulance Service resilience and business recovery arrangements are also strengthened. The move provided an essential platform for the introduction of priority-based dispatch and was also cost effective and good value for the public purse. With three centres there is a consistency of approach and the recent appointment of a general manager for EMDCs is further improving the quality and effectiveness of the EMDCs in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and the Scottish Ambulance Service will continue to drive for improvement and the most recent review of the EMDCs has resulted in a decision to co-locate the three EMDCs with NHS 24 in a bid to further improve the service delivered to patients.</p>

  <p><strong>na Robison: </strong>While this is an operational matter for the Scottish Ambulance Service, they have assured me that the current rates, last reviewed in May, cover the costs. The Scottish Ambulance Service will now be reviewing the rates on a monthly basis to ensure this continues to be the case.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for NHS boards. It is understood, however, that taxis may be used under specific circumstances. For instance some areas co-ordinate the use of local taxis under contract arrangements to bring people in to the out-of-hours service if they are unable to travel by their own means and do not require ambulance transport. This ensures that patients can get to a treatment outwith the times covered by community or voluntary car schemes and avoids inappropriate use for emergency ambulances.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not provide direct support to local community based projects. However, local voluntary organisations can apply to the NHS board in their area for grant funding under section 16b of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978.

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to promoting and supporting children&rsquo;s rights through the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The Scottish Government is looking to better implement the UNCRC in a collaborative way with local authorities, COSLA and the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner. We have no plans to act independently of that collaborative approach.</p>

  <p>It would be competent to draw up subordinate legislation to give local authorities the power to reduce council tax for holders of bonds issued by that local authority. The authority for this is drawn from section 80 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, rather than from the Scotland Act 1998. As independent bodies, it would ultimately be for individual local authorities to offer such a facility, if enacted.</p>

  <p>I have already announced over &pound;7 million of investment in the young people of Scotland using the ill-gotten gains of organised crime. This significant programme of activity in sports, the arts and youthwork will be used to benefit young people of all ages throughout Scotland including those in Mid Scotland and Fife.</p>

  <p>Our young people need to be given the opportunity to reach their potential and to have real hope for their future. This government recognises that the vast majority of them are not offenders. But we want to do more to prevent them getting involved in crime or antisocial behaviour in the first place.</p>

  <p>The devil makes work for idle hands so if we are asking our young people to be responsible members of society, we must provide them with the opportunities to do so.</p>

  <p>The National Theatre of Scotland currently occupies office and rehearsal space at The Bridge in Easterhouse, offices in Hope Street, and storage space at Glasgow North Trading Estate, and makes use of other rehearsal, workshop and meeting spaces on a regular basis.</p>

  <p>The National Theatre of Scotland remains committed to its permanent home base at The Bridge in Easterhouse and to maintaining and enhancing its relationship with the community there. The lease of the Company&rsquo;s Hope Street offices is, however, due to expire in October 2008. The National Theatre of Scotland is therefore exploring options for alternative short-term office accommodation to supplement its permanent home base at The Bridge from October 2008 when the lease on its temporary premises in Hope Street expires.</p>

  <p>BT chose which exchanges they would enable for broadband on the Western Isles. Their decision was a purely commercial one in which the government had no role. It essentially left the smallest exchanges in the Western Isles with no commercial provision and so broadband access for communities in those exchange areas was addressed by Connected Communities. Connected Communities is led by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) and it is HIE who deal with all operational matters around its design and delivery.</p>

  <p>The Scottish science baccalaureate and Scottish language baccalaureate will be important elements within the wider <em>Curriculum for Excellence </em> programme. They will also contribute to the government&rsquo;s principal purpose and strategic objectives. The awards aim to encourage more of our young people to study science and language courses in the later stages of secondary school. They will raise the status of S6 and assist our young people in making the transition from school to higher and further education and employment. As the baccalaureates will not constitute an exclusive programme of study, young people will also be able to study additional subjects and take part in other activities.</p>

  <p>The baccalaureates will include existing qualifications in science and languages at Higher and Advanced Higher level. The new element of the awards will be an interdisciplinary project to be taken in S6. This is intended to give young people the chance to work across subject boundaries, study a topic in greater depth and link their learning to areas of future interest in higher education, further education and employment. It will be important to give young people good opportunities for choice in the projects that they undertake. However, examples of the topics that could be studied within the science baccalaureate are exploring the engineering industry, investigating how the life sciences are used in industry and ethical issues in science. Examples of topics in the languages baccalaureate are how Scotland&rsquo;s tourism and cultural provision is perceived by speakers of other languages and Scotland and global citizenship issues.</p>

  <p>A summary of the structure of the awards and courses that will be included in the Baccalaureates is attached.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and the Scottish Qualifications Authority will be taking forward work on the Baccalaureates with stakeholders in schools, colleges, higher education and representatives from business and industry. We expect the first baccalaureates to be awarded in August 2010.</p>

  <p>This is an exciting development which offers our young people new opportunities to develop their skills in science and languages and better prepare them for higher and further education courses and employment.</p>

  <p>Over the last three years 42 Scottish teachers have been selected by Link Community Development to take part in their Global Teachers Programme in Malawi (11 in 2005-06; 17 in 2006-07 and 14 in 2007-08). These placements benefitted 55 schools in 2005-06 and 85 in 2006-07. Figures for 2007-08 will not be available until after August 2008.</p>

  <p>Link Community Development were awarded &pound;100,000 in 2005-06, &pound;150,000 in 2006-07 and &pound;150,000 2007-08 for the Scotland Malawi School Improvement Project., which supported a number of elements, one of which was the Global Teacher Programme. Link Community Development receives funding from a number of organisations and it is, therefore not possible to provide information on the percentage of funding spent in Malawi specifically from the Scottish Government grant for this programme.</p>

  <p>We have reviewed the funding given to Link Community Development to simplify the landscape for teachers. This means that from April this year most Scottish Government funded International CPD opportunities for teachers are being considered as part of the Scottish Continuing International Professional Development (SCIPD) programme for teachers administered by Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS). The SCIPD scheme includes opportunities for teachers to apply for continuous professional development opportunities in Malawi. This part of the programme is managed by the League of Exchange of Commonwealth Teachers.</p>

  <p>Other opportunities for teachers to participate in Malawi programmes include the Department for International Development Global Schools Partnerships programme which provides advice and guidance, grants and professional development opportunities for schools wishing to develop partnerships between the UK and Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. This programme is managed by the British Council.</p>

  <p>Link Community Development currently receives funding from the International Development Fund which relates specifically to the Scotland Malawi School Improvement Programme in the Dedza District Assembly area of Malawi, which supports the development work that they are doing in Malawi. Any future funding for Link Community Development from the International Development Fund will be based on a satisfactory review of existing grant programmes and on whether future bids meet the relevant funding criteria.</p>

  <p>The work that Link Community Development does in the Dedza District of Malawi is supported by the government of Malawi, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. The work which teachers are involved in is very highly regarded in Malawi, contributing to raising teaching and learning quality.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to publish a register of school links with Africa. As part of their role in promoting International Education in the curriculum, LTS collect data on schools which link with other countries throughout the world including schools linked with Malawi. There are a number of opportunities which currently exist to enable the sharing of good practice between practitioners and this includes the LTS website <a href="http://www.ltscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.ltscotland.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>School partnership links with Malawi have opened up a number of wonderful learning opportunities for teachers and young people in both countries. I would expect that the links established by schools should continue to ensure that schools benefit from and build on this established knowledge and learning.</p>

  <p>I am clear that while we need to be able to safeguard Scotland&rsquo;s traditional fishing rights for the future, we also wish to maintain procedures which interface with other administrations in the UK. This is made clear in the consultation paper.</p>

  <p>We would be happy to discuss the terms of a reconciliation exercise with other administrations in the UK if, following consultation, this is deemed necessary. In such an event, I believe that it would be sensible for it to be conducted on a UK-wide basis to take account of any cross-border transactions.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-06-05.S3W-13857.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0605.htm#23">

  <p>In the answer to question S3W-11870 on 24 April 2008, I confirmed that the Scottish Government would take all reasonable steps to control the costs of the inquiry. Having particular regard to the terms of the Inquiries Act 2005, measures will be adopted to ensure that this inquiry will be able to operate in a cost-effective manner, while having the resources to fulfil its remit.</p>

  <p>Section 40(4) of the Inquiries Act contains a power for ministers to place conditions or qualifications on any awards that the chairman of the inquiry may make under section 40(1) and 40(2) in respect of compensation, expenses or legal representation. After discussions with the Inquiry, I have decided to issue a notice of determination under section 40(4) in respect of awards for legal representation. The terms of that notice are as follows:</p>

  <p>&quot;The Scottish Ministers have determined, under section 40(4) of the Inquiries Act 2005 (&quot;the 2005 Act&quot;), that as regards the inquiry set up on 14 March 2008 and concerning the fingerprints associated with HMA -v- McKie in 1999, the power of the chairman of the inquiry to award amounts in respect of legal representation under section 40(1) and (2) of that Act shall be subject to the qualifications and conditions set out below.</p>

  <p>The qualifications and conditions are:</p>

  <p>1. Awards in respect of legal representation may be made only in circumstances in which the chairman considers it is necessary, fair, reasonable and proportionate for such an award to be made.</p>

  <p>2. Any award must be subject to the condition that payment will be made only for work that is evidenced and can be identified as having been done in an effective and efficient manner, avoiding unnecessary duplication and making best use of public funds.</p>

  <p>3. Awards may be made only in respect of legal representation provided by one or more named legal representatives whose involvement has been approved in advance by the chairman. The chairman must approve the size and composition of any legal team to be engaged, including the seniority and number of any counsel. Costs associated with work carried out by legal representatives who are not approved in advance of the work being carried out shall not be met from public funds.</p>

  <p>4. Any award must specify the nature and scope of the work that is to be publicly funded. Legal representatives must not be publicly funded for work that does not fall within the agreed scope. An inquiry under the 2005 Act is inquisitorial in nature and legal representatives will not be paid for investigative work or for work in relation to obtaining expert reports, unless the chairman gives express permission in advance for this work to be carried out.</p>

  <p>5. The legal representatives will agree in advance, with the solicitor to the inquiry, hourly rates for counsel and solicitors, subject to the following maximum hourly rates:</p>

  <p>Senior Counsel &pound;200</p>

  <p>Junior Counsel &pound;100</p>

  <p>Solicitors &pound;150.</p>

  <p>6. The maximum number of hours that can be charged by a legal representative in receipt of an award made by the chairman shall be 40 hours per week, save that exceptionally the solicitor to the inquiry may authorise an increase in the weekly cap up to 60 hours for counsel or a solicitor during the oral hearings and for a two month period before they commence where the solicitor to the inquiry is satisfied that such action is justified in all the circumstances (e.g. when the work involved in any week clearly needs to exceed 40 hours).</p>

  <p>7. In respect of paragraph 6 of this notice:</p>

  <p>(a) no unused hours in any week may be set off against any other week;</p>

  <p>(b) a week shall be taken as commencing on Sunday and ending on Saturday;</p>

  <p>8. Expenditure incurred before notification of the chairman&rsquo;s award, or expenditure in excess of the terms upon which approval is granted, will not be recoverable.&quot;</p>

  <p>This determination has been made on a preparatory basis. As indicated on 14 March in my answer to question S3W-10920, the chairman of the inquiry will remain focused on his existing judicial duties until the end of August.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of falls and recording of such falls within hospitals is not held centrally. Recording and investigating the circumstances of falls and subsequent action is the responsibility of NHS boards.</p>

  <p>Following the work of the Falls Prevention Group, the Scottish Government issued guidance last year which included advice for NHS boards, Community Health Partnerships and others on actions to prevent falls by older people and improve bone health. The guidance is available on the Scottish Government website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/OlderPeopleCare/fallsgroup" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/OlderPeopleCare/fallsgroup</a>. The guidance set out a number of recommendations for NHS boards to do locally, including the need for accurate recording and reporting of incidents, including falls.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that the up-rating of mileage allowances payable to staff who have to use their car for work purposes was discussed at a meeting of the Scottish Terms and Conditions Committee (STAC) on 29 May. STAC is a partnership organisation which exists to collectively negotiate terms and conditions issues for NHSScotland staff and is made up of representatives of trades unions and professional representative organisations and NHS employers. Meetings are facilitated by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>It was agreed at STAC to await the outcome of the UK Staff Council mileage allowances sub-group tasked with taking forward a review of mileage allowances. The sub-group is scheduled to meet on the 9 and 17 of June where it is hoped that agreement can be reached over any new arrangements.</p>

  <p>Railway safety is a matter which is reserved to Westminster.</p>

  <p>Rail travel is one of the safest forms of transport and the passenger accident rate remains at an all time low level with only one passenger fatality in the past three years.</p>

  <p>Whilst level crossing collisions remain at a historically low level, level crossing safety remains a top priority for the rail industry and significant amounts of work continue to be undertaken to mitigate the level crossing risk. About 96% of the risk arises from accidental or deliberate misuse of level crossings by members of the public.</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) has been monitoring the implementation of the recommendations of <em>Hungry for Success</em> through its programme of school inspections. Inspection activities include checks to ensure that school meals meet the Scottish nutrient standards for school lunches. Feedback on inspection findings, including recommended points for action where necessary, are given to the head teacher and senior member of catering staff in the school and also to nominated staff within the local authority. Where appropriate, follow-through inspections include evaluation of progress made in addressing any main points for action related to school meals.</p>

  <p>HMIE will also be involved in monitoring implementation of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 (the Act) through their programme of inspections. Inspections will build on the activities that inspection teams undertook to evaluate aspects of health promotion and the implementation of <em>Hungry for Success</em>. They will focus particularly on the impact of actions taken by schools and local authorities to improve food provision in schools and the uptake of food provided.</p>

  <p>We are currently discussing with HMIE the main features of inspection activities. Where an inspection finds that a council or school is not complying with the requirements of the act, recommendations for action will be discussed with the council or school, and will be followed through to check progress as necessary. Where councils are found to take insufficient action to secure improvement, HMIE will refer them to Scottish ministers who will consider what action to take. Self-evaluation by schools and local authorities will continue to be important in measuring impact, identifying effective practice and securing continuous improvement.</p>

  <p>The act will place duties on local authorities and managers of grant aided schools to ensure that all food and drink provided in schools complies with nutritional requirements, specified by Scottish ministers by regulations. Draft regulations, The Nutritional Requirements for Food and Drink in Schools (Scotland) Regulations 2008, are currently with the Parliament for approval. If approved by the Parliament, we will be publishing guidance to local authorities to assist them in implementing the regulations. Local authorities will also be advised on approaches to menu analysis to ensure that the data will be accurate and reliable for use in self-evaluation.</p>

  <p>A progress report on the implementation of <em>Hungry for Success</em> was published by HMIE in January 2008. It included evidence from inspections of primary, special and secondary schools. It found that <em>Hungry for Success </em>has been successful in meeting many of its aims and that there have been notable improvements in the quality of school meals in Scotland. It also identified areas for further action and improvement, by schools and local authorities.</p>

  <p>HMIE will also be involved in monitoring implementation of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 through their programme of inspections.

  <p>No. The relevant legislation makes it clear that local authorities may make arrangements as they consider necessary for the provision of travel to school. However, one factor the local authorities must take into consideration when making such considerations, is the safety of the pupils and in doing so may consider that in certain specific circumstances, they will provide transport for children living less than two miles from their designated school.</p>

  <p>There is no such definition in legislation. However, in a Scottish Executive Education Department Circular (No.7 of 2003), a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 29135), it was made clear that ministers expect authorities to keep under review their criteria for providing school transport in light of a range of safety considerations, for instance including volume and speed of traffic, availability of safe crossings, sufficiency of pavements, footpaths and subways, built-up and wooded areas and adequacy of street lighting. This remains the position.</p>

  <p>Under the new Concordat with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the local government finance settlement for 2008-11 set out in Finance Circular No.1 2008, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45732), the government has issued local authorities with increased levels of funding which are not earmarked or hypothecated to individual services.</p>

  <p>Alongside that increase in funding, the government has also devolved significant controls and flexibilities to local government in how councils deploy those resources. It is the responsibility of each council to allocate the total financial resources available to them on the basis of their local needs and priorities such as for the provision of school transport.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and I last met Councillor Marilyne MacLaren, the Convener of Education, Children and Families, on 27 September 2007, accompanied by other elected members and appropriate officials. Discussion covered a range of educational issues, including the Council&rsquo;s aspirations for future school building under what they term their &quot;Wave 3&quot; schools programme. In response to a subsequent request from Councillor MacLaren, the Cabinet Secretary has already indicated that she would welcome a further such meeting to discuss the council&rsquo;s strategy and plans for schools.</p>

  <p>Our policy is that the financial resources available to the Scottish Government should be applied fully, efficiently and effectively to supporting excellent public services. Consequently we expect unspent balances at the end of each financial year to be very low. We successfully reached agreement with HM Treasury to release large unspent balances accumulated by the previous administration. This money is supporting public service delivery over the period covered by the 2007 Spending Review.</p>

  <p>As part of the negotiations with the Treasury any unspent resources from the Scottish Government will be retained by the Treasury and cannot be accessed until after the conclusion of this spending review period.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are subject to a financial framework which differs in detail from that applying to the Scottish Government. In particular, local authorities are required by statute to have a general fund. With some exceptions, again defined by statute, all income received by the authority is paid into this fund and all expenditure paid out of this fund. At the end of each financial year any balance on the general fund is held as a general reserve by the local authority and is available for use in future financial years. Local authorities therefore control the use to which any unspent funds at the end of a financial year are put</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy is to provide NHS boards with appropriate financial flexibility, for example in relation to the timing of capital expenditure. An administrative arrangement operates whereby a board can carry forward unspent balances of up to 1% of its total financial allocation for use in the following year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to marking St Andrew&rsquo;s Day as a National Day and as a holiday. With effect from this year, staff in its core Directorates, including senior civil servants, and those agencies which make up the Scottish Government main bargaining unit have therefore been given an extra day&rsquo;s holiday to celebrate St Andrew&rsquo;s Day. In 2007 staff were given the option of exchanging an existing half day holiday for a half day on St Andrew&rsquo;s Day.</p>

  <p>St Andrew&rsquo;s Day is a Scottish bank holiday and therefore it does not affect other parts of the UK.</p>

  <p>Individual employers are free to decide whether to take St Andrew&rsquo;s Day as a holiday.</p>

  <p>The numbers of students graduating from teacher training in 2006 and 2007 are available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/03/18093809/110" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/03/18093809/110</a> .</p>

  <p>Comparable figures are not yet available for 2008 but 2,054 primary sector students and 1505 secondary sector students have been allocated to local authorities for the 2008-09 teacher induction scheme. However, not all of these students will graduate and the numbers eligible to take up their allocations will be smaller.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise. That exercise estimates the number of teachers leaving each year but does not differentiate between retirals and other reasons for leaving. The estimated number leaving in the years requested is set out in the following table:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is satisfied that where snaring is carried out according to best practice, it is lawful. Intentional or reckless snaring of European protected species is a criminal offence.</p>

  <p>Following an extensive period of consultation the Scottish Government decided that the balance of argument was in favour of allowing snaring to continue, subject to further regulation to improve animal welfare. This was set out in the statement of 20 February 2008. There are no plans for a further review of snaring.</p>
