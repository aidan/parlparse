  <p>The information requested is not available on a consistent basis. We are taking a range of initiatives which should reduce waiting times. Central to these is the drive for local agencies to work together to improve services as envisaged in <i>Modernising Community Care: an Action Plan</i> . Incentive funding to encourage implementation will increase from &pound;5 million this year to &pound;7.5 million in 2000-2001.

  <p>Health boards may, if they think fit, make payments to local authorities and housing associations for, among other matters, the provision of housing.</p>

  <p>Latest figures show that local authority social work departments spent &pound;15 million on aids and adaptations in 1997-98.</p>

  <p>Scottish Homes issued good practice guidance last year on the provision of adaptations. The guidance is aimed at housing associations, local authorities, private landlords and others and sets a list of bodies responsible for the provision of aids or equipment for all housing sectors.</p>

  <p>The details of such contracts are between the authorities and the contractors concerned.

  <p>It is for the statutory authorities, in liaison with local Drug Action Teams, to ensure that there is an appropriate range of treatment services for drug misusers in line with the national objectives set out in Scotland&#8217;s drugs strategy. The success of methadone treatment in reducing crime, deaths, disease and drug use is well documented. In light, however, of the tragic death of Kerry-Ann Kirk, the Executive is asking all health boards to report on the steps that they have taken to ensure that, wherever practicable, methadone is taken under supervision. That includes addressing problems that may arise over weekend and holiday periods. The balance of benefit is hugely in favour of prescribing methadone, but we must ensure that its use is safe and watertight.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign to enable it to develop road safety education and publicity initiatives. Following the Comprehensive Spending Review, the resources allocated for this work were increased by &pound;1 million over the three years beginning 1999-2000. Following a review of the Scottish Cycle Training Scheme by the Scottish Road Safety Campaign, the written training materials have been revised and a new training video made. The new training pack will be issued shortly to all Road Safety Units in Scotland and its use promoted in schools throughout Scotland. The pack will assist in the delivery of high quality cycle training.</p>

  <p>Local authorities receive a block allocation for expenditure on a number of services. It is for each local authority to determine its expenditure programme, including provision for cycle training and Safer Routes to School schemes, in the light of its various priorities.</p>

  <p>The level of new business start-ups in Scotland is determined by a range of factors, including the overall state of the Scottish and UK economies. The quarterly GDP statistics indicate that the Scottish economy experienced a modest slowdown in the rates of GDP growth over the first half of 1999, along with UK and other European economies. However, the most recent economic indicators are favourable and the latest forecasts suggest that growth in Scotland will accelerate from 2000 in line with the UK.</p>

  <p>We also have a number of specific initiatives in hand to increase the number of start-up businesses assisted by the enterprise network, and to improve the quality and consistency of advice and support for small businesses across Scotland. We will announce details of these improvements shortly.</p>

  <p>The distribution of grant-aided expenditure, which feeds into the distribution of aggregate external finance, is based on a formula assessment of councils&#8217; relative expenditure needs agreed with CoSLA. Glasgow City Council&#8217;s below average increase in GAE this year was largely due to the continuing phasing in of revised social work GAE indicators and the normal redistributive effects on a number of other service assessments within the agreed formula approach.</p>

  <p>Detailed breakdowns of revenue budgets for 1999-2000 are not held centrally. Further details of the revenue spending in 1998-99 by those Social Inclusion Partnerships converted from former Priority Partnership Areas and Regeneration Programmes are set out in their annual reports. Copies of the annual reports for 1998-99 have been placed in the Information Centre.</p>

  <p>We will shortly be issuing a new monitoring framework for Social Inclusion Partnerships. The new framework will require each Social Inclusion Partnership to submit a detailed breakdown of its revenue budget for the year ahead. This information will be available when annual reports for 1999-2000 are submitted in the summer of 2000.</p>

  <p>I understand that the statement by the Secretary of State for the Environment Transport and the Regions related to how he intended to use existing budgets. Future levels of expenditure in England will be determined in the forthcoming Spending Review now underway and any change for Scotland will be reflected in the Assigned Budget through the operation of the Barnett formula. We will decide at the appropriate time the allocation of that budget reflecting Scotland&#8217;s priorities. As to hypothecation of any future real terms increases in fuel duty to transport in Scotland, I refer Mr Tosh to the Finance Minister&lsquo;s answer to question S1W-3868.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to make specific statutory provision for the Strategic Rail Authority to be consulted in such circumstances.</p>

  <p>There are no specified statutory consultees in the development planning process. However, existing requirements on planning authorities to publicise their development planning activity and to consult appropriate authorities and bodies afford the Strategic Rail Authority adequate opportunity to make representations at the appropriate stages.</p>

  <p>The Franchising Director, part of the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority, operates a GB-wide Incentive Payment regime which rewards good performance by train operating companies and penalises poor performance. All penalty payments received by the Franchising Director are held by him to support his GB-wide expenditure. To date ScotRail is the single largest beneficiary of incentive payments. Last year alone the company&#8217;s good performance earned it over &pound;6 million in incentive payments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is progressing the Trunk Roads Cycling Initiative in a number of areas. It is continuing to promote the portfolio of schemes listed in my answer of 22 November 1999 (S1W-2268) including major sections of the Sustrans National Cycle Network in the A9 corridor. The dedicated cycle route running parallel to the M74/A74(M) motorway is almost complete. The remaining section to which we have contributed is to be provided on local roads south of Kirkpatrick Fleming. Some work has been completed redetermining suitable sections of trunk road footway to permit use by cyclists and our interest in this area continues. Advice on the provision for cyclists within new trunk road schemes has been included in the technical consultation document, <i>Cycling by Design</i> which I published in December 1999.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the devolution settlement for railways announced on 31 March 1998, the Scottish Ministers will be able to issue guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority for daytime cross-border passenger rail services. This may cover matters such as frequency and journey times but not infrastructure as such. It is then for the train operating company and Railtrack to ensure the availability of the necessary infrastructure to meet the terms of the franchise.</p>

  <p>Under section 17 of the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Act 1991, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency may issue licences for the abstraction of water for irrigation from inland or ground waters in an area to which a control order applies under section 15 of that Act. We expect to develop future abstraction control policy in the light of the proposed EC Water Framework Directive which is presently before the European Parliament. <br /></p>
