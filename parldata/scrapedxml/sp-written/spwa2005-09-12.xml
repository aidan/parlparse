  <p>Since June 2004 correspondence has been received from 15 MSPs and two members of the public about lymphoedema services.</p>

  <p>In April 2005, &pound;6 billion was allocated to NHS boards for 2005-06. It is a matter for NHS boards to decide where this money is directed to meet the healthcare needs of their local populations. Each NHS board publishes a Local Health Plan annually that sets out the broad strategic direction for public health and health care services in their area.</p>

  <p>People suffering from lymphoedema also stand to benefit from the new, more systematic approach to the management of all long-term conditions that Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) will be encouraged to pursue. In particular, CHPs will be able to undertake an assessment of the needs of those with lymphoedema as well as developing care pathways for them.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the nurses who staff NHS 24 have access to details of the services available at each hospital in order that patients can be directed, not to their nearest hospital, but to the nearest hospital that has services to treat the condition which the nurse suspects the patient to be suffering from.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 offers a triage and consultation service to patients. Nurse advisers come to NHS 24 with a wide range of nursing experience, gained over a substantial period of time. The nurse adviser asks a series of questions with the support of a clinical evidence based support tool. This structured approach allows the nurse adviser to gain relevant information so that they can ascertain the urgency of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms and determine the most appropriate level of care.</p>

  <p>The nurse advisers have access to information about hospital services that helps them decide which location is the most appropriate for the patient. For example, for accident and emergency departments, minor injury units and maternity units, this information includes whether the hospital provides treatment for eye injuries, fracture management, medical emergencies, paediatrics, stabilisation of serious conditions, trauma emergencies and x-ray facilities, early pregnancy or high risk pregnancy.</p>
