  <p>Officials have recently discussed the terminal capacity issues at Inverness Airport with Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL). We recognise the drivers for the expansion project, such as capacity constraints at peak periods and security provision. HIAL is now carrying out further work on design, cost and phasing aspects of the project which will form the basis for further discussions, with the aim of delivering a terminal that meets the short and medium-term needs of a growing airport.</p>

  <p>The curriculum for Latin is part of the on-going review of the curriculum, <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em> . The draft outcomes and experiences for classical languages were released for engagement on 10 December on the Curriculum for Excellence website: <a href="htt://www.curriculumforexcellencescotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.curriculumforexcellencescotland.gov.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>The introduction to the draft outcomes makes clear the very positive contribution that study of classical languages can make to learning of other languages, especially Romance languages.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary has asked officials to examine whether the publication of the draft outcomes and experiences for classical languages provides future opportunities for the teaching of Latin.</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education regularly inspect schools, including, where appropriate, inspection on the teaching of Latin.</p>

  <p><em>Better Together</em> , the new programme for improving health care experience, which was announced in March 2007, will provide the information needed to monitor this target.</p>

  <p>The first part of this programme of work, which is currently underway, is to determine what aspects of healthcare are most important to patients and carers in Scotland. The results of this work will inform the next stage of the programme, which will collect information on patients&rsquo; and carers&rsquo; experiences.</p>

  <p>Information from the in-patient experience survey, which will be carried out from 2008-09, will feed into the new measure. The indicator will be developed in collaboration with NHS boards and the programme co-ordinators, and will represent experience relating to the areas that are of most concern to patients and carers.</p>

  <p>The purpose of <em>Better Together</em> is to enable patients, carers and health care staff to work together in partnership to initiate service improvements and redesign, based on enhanced use of information and feedback.</p>

  <p>NHS Tayside and the health care professionals providing services at the centre are responsible for determining and arranging any follow-up action required on the basis of an assessment of individual patients&rsquo; specific needs for care and treatment. Action will depend on the outcome of each assessment &ndash; psychological therapies, drug treatment and discharge are among the options. Follow-up to resolve individual episodes of care can range from several sessions to regular input over a number of years, depending on clinical need.</p>

  <p>Within the framework of national guidance, NHS Tayside is responsible for assessing local service needs and for providing services to meet these needs. I understand that children who have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and are on medication are followed up routinely by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service within the Centre for Child Health. Medication is monitored in collaboration with the patient&rsquo;s GP through a shared care protocol.</p>

Table 1 shows the estimated percentage of Scottish households living in dwellings below the bedroom standard in each local authority area in 2005-06, and table 2 shows the estimated percentage of children who live in such households. Estimates for earlier periods were provided in the answer to question S2W-32511 on 26 March 2007.

  <p>Source: Scottish Household Survey, 2005-06.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Base numbers show the sample sizes of the population participating in the survey but cannot be used to calculate how many respondents gave a certain answer. The base in table 1 refers to the number of households in the sample and in table 2 to the number of children in households in the sample.</p>

  <p>2. Year-on-year changes should be interpreted with caution as estimates can fluctuate from year to year due to sampling variability and small sample sizes. This is a particular issue for table 2 where the sampling unit is the household but the unit of analysis is the number of children in the household.</p>

  <p>3. The estimates are provided for a two-year sweep as the survey is not designed to be representative at local authority level for a single year.</p>

  <p>4. The bedroom standard represents the minimum number of bedrooms required for a household.</p>

  <p>The standard requires that a separate bedroom is available for:</p>

  <p>each cohabiting couple;</p>

  <p>any other person aged 21 years or over;</p>

  <p>each pair of young persons of the same sex aged 10 to 20 years, and</p>

  <p>each pair of children under 10 years (regardless of sex).</p>

  <p>Unpaired young persons aged 10 to 20 are paired with a child under 10 of the same sex if possible or allocated a separate bedroom. Any unpaired children under 10 are also allocated a separate bedroom.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, under the terms of its concordat with COSLA, how funding costed in the SNP manifesto for free school meals compares with the amount allocated in <em>Scottish Budget: Spending Review 2007</em> and what the reasons are for any differences in the two figures.</p>

  <p>The concordat makes clear that the vast majority of the funding allocated through the Scottish Budget, including the funding for free school meals <em>,</em> will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and the full terms of the concordat.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards receive an annual allocation of funds. Each board&rsquo;s allocation will be increased in each year of the spending review period. It is for each NHS board to decide how best to utilise these funds to meet the health care needs of its resident population taking account of national and local priorities, including occupational therapy services. No specific additional funding is being provided for occupational therapy services. It will be for boards to decide whether any of the additional funding being made available to them is used for this purpose.</p>

  <p>Board workforce plans published in April 2007 have predicted that the overall number of qualified occupational therapists is projected to increase by almost 3.6% over the next three years from 1,536.3 in 2006 to 1,592.3 in 2009.</p>

  <p>There are no recommended design maxima for traffic flows for any category of road in either daily or hourly terms. The Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) Volume 5, Advice Note TA 46/97 &quot;Traffic Flow Ranges for Use in the Assessment of New Rural Roads&quot;, sets out opening year flow ranges for use only as starting points in the design and economic assessment of new rural road links. These are as follows:</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="50%">
<tr>
<td width="50%" height="5" rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top"> Carriageway Standard</td>
<td width="50%" height="5" colspan="2" align="center" valign="top"> Opening Year AADT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="24%" align="center" valign="top"> Minimum</td>
<td width="26%" align="center" valign="top"> Maximum</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="left" valign="top"> Dual 2 Lane Motorway</td>
<td width="50%" colspan="2" align="center" valign="top"> Up to 41,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="left" valign="top"> Dual 3 Lane Motorway</td>
<td width="24%" align="right" valign="top"> 25,000</td>
<td width="26%" align="right" valign="top"> 67,000</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>Note: AADT is Annual Average Daily Traffic in vehicles per day.</p>

  <p>These flows do not represent maximum throughputs which depend on vehicle type mix, driver behaviour, junction spacing, maintenance considerations, etc.</p>

  <p>No hourly peak traffic flow ranges are given in the DMRB.</p>
