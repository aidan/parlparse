  <p>NHS costs are available at speciality level only. It is therefore not possible to provide costs for individual alcohol related conditions and/or by ICD-10 codes.The costs quoted in <em>Cost to Society of Alcohol Misuse in Scotland: An Update to Alcohol Misuse in Scotland Trends and Costs</em> are an approximation based on all alcohol related hospitalisations (which include a wide range of diagnostic conditions). It is not possible to use this figure to provide information on the cost of hospitalisation days against individual ICD-10 codes.</p>

  <p>The quality of climate and relationships in schools is regarded by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education as one crucial aspect of school discipline. &quot;Climate and Relationships&quot; are evaluated in every primary and secondary school inspection using the four point scale of &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;satisfactory&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;very good&quot;. This scale is used along with others to describe the effectiveness of the whole school. This approach allows for the wide range of factors which contribute to school discipline, in addition to the recommendations of Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning, to be assessed and understood, including effective teaching and learning and strong leadership.</p>

  <p>The findings of school inspection reports are collated to inform thematic reports such as <em>A Climate for Learning (2005)</em>, which reported on progress of implementation of Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning (BB-BL). Through thematic inspections and in all school and education authority inspections Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education will continue to monitor progress with implementation of the recommendations in the BB-BL report.</p>

  <p>: The Executive commissions regular independent evaluations of the Do a Little Change a Lot Campaign. The third such evaluation was published in June 2004 and is available on the Executive&rsquo;s website. I am also arranging that a copy of the report is placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre. The campaign has been effective in both in raising public awareness of environmental and sustainable development issues and also in changing behaviour. We have noted that the most recent research showed that there was more that we could achieve in changing behaviour and we have taken appropriate action in our most recent campaign which has concentrated on energy efficiency issues.</p>

  <p>The First Minister launched the International Development policy on 15 March 2005. Copies of the International Development policy have been placed with the Parliament Referencing Centre (Bib. number 35726). The policy sets out the role that Scotland can play within the international community, and in particular the contribution that it can make to developing countries.</p>

  <p>The powers of devolution mean there are specific ways in which we can contribute to the international development agenda. How we operate our devolved policies, such as development of global citizenship education and procurement, can impact on the developing world. Scottish organisations and individuals can respond to humanitarian issues and help in aid situations. We can also support effective, targeted Scottish effort in helping others to reach the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

  <p>I am delighted that this year&rsquo;s G8 summit will be held in Scotland. We want to take the opportunity to ensure that the people of Scotland are aware of the G8 and its agenda and have a chance to debate the issues and make their voices heard. In particular the issue of addressing poverty in Africa can have a strong resonance for people in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Where the issues raised are reserved matters, ministers and officials will continue to reflect Scottish views to UK colleagues. We welcome the UK government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling global poverty, and support their position that trade in goods and services should be free and that international trading rules should be made to work to the benefit of developing countries.</p>

  <p>We also welcome the Commission for Africa, in particular their support for partnership working, their proposal that wealthy nations should double their aid to Africa, raising it by &pound;30 billion a year over 10 years, and their proposals to cancel debt for the poorest sub-Saharan countries.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to contributing to the Commission for Africa&rsquo;s agenda by encouraging public discussion of the report and its issues, and by ensuring that the international development policy takes account of its findings. In particular, Scotland has much to offer in terms of skills and expertise in tackling HIV/AIDS, in boosting health and education capacity in Africa, and in the development of civil society and good governance. We will focus on Scotland&rsquo;s key strengths and values, and we will aim to transfer Scottish knowledge, skills and expertise to where they are most needed in the world.</p>

  <p>We have recently announced the Scottish Schools Africa Challenge to give schools the opportunity as part of their international education to combine learning with real support for development in Africa. The next few weeks and months will afford a number of occasions to see in more detail what Scotland is contributing.</p>

The pilots are being independently evaluated and will contribute to our understanding of how to improve health and reduce health inequalities.</p>

  <p>In addition other initiatives aimed at reducing health inequalities will also impact on the health and well being of men across three levels, life circumstances, lifestyles and specific health issues including action on: smoking, alcohol, physical activity, diet and mental health and well being, while also targeting action towards coronary heart disease, cancer, sexual health and oral health.</p>

  <p>: The study in question compared the rate of chromosome abnormalities in 60 newborn children in New York and found higher rates for those children whose mothers were exposed to higher levels of airborne pollution. While the authors do comment on the wider applicability of the these findings, they make no direct reference to Glasgow or Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Advice from the UK Committee for Medical Effects of Air pollution indicates that the risks associated with the levels of carcinogenic substances found in the air in the UK are exceedingly small.

  <p>We are not taking forward proposals that will lead to there only being Sheriffs on the bench. On 22 March we published <em>Smarter Justice, Safer Communities: Summary Justice Reform &ndash; Next Steps</em> .

  <p>: We are making excellent progress. Our Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative has allocated grant funding to over 600 small-scale renewable energy projects since 2002, and applications to the scheme continue to increase.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has completed its assessment of the proposed development including a new junction to the M8 motorway. The outcome of these considerations is that the Executive is content that the developer proceeds to the next stage of the appraisal process for the two identified motorway junction options. This means that, in principle, the Executive will support a new motorway access in order to facilitate the redevelopment of the Bishopton site. My officials will, today, write to inform the developer of this decision.</p>

  <p>A Letter of Decision to all relevant parties has issued and a copy of that decision (and the Public Local Inquiry Report) has now been lodged in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre, (Bib. number 35854). After full consideration, I have decided to confirm the Orders, and authorise that the scheme should now go ahead.</p>
