  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to implement the Declaration of the European Parliament on the Charter of Rights for People with Autism, as adopted by the European Parliament on 9 May 1996, and what the reasons are for its position on the matter.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-03-24.S2W-24179.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0324.htm#3">

  <p>The European Charter for people with autism is based on the principle that people with autism spectrum disorders should share the same rights and privileges enjoyed by all of the European population where such are appropriate and in the best interests of the person with autism. This principle underpins the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s work to implement the recommendations from the Public Health Institute of Scotland&rsquo;s Needs Assessment Report for people with autism spectrum disorders.</p>

  <p>A number of rights outlined in the European Charter relate to freedom from abuse, neglect, exploitation or coercion. The proposals in the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Bill aim to safeguard these rights.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for the FETA Board to consider how it will take forward its local transport strategy.</p>

  <p>As I said in my statement to Parliament on 1 March 2006, the Scottish Executive wants to concentrate on taking a strategic approach to improving all public transport in the region. That work will involve the Scottish Executive and Transport Scotland, working alongside FETA, local authorities and regional transport partnerships.</p>

  <p>Keith Lodge is an independent care facility and the proposed closure is for commercial reasons. It would therefore not be appropriate for the Scottish Executive to meet staff and patients. It is for the local commissioners of care to decide on the level of provision required to meet local needs. Should Keith Lodge close, it will be for the local authority to work with users and families to ensure they are provided with suitable alternative services.</p>

  <p>The Cities Growth Fund is supporting a wide range of projects to provide or improve facilities and infrastructure in and around Scotland&rsquo;s six cities. These include, for example, the Hermiston park and ride facility on the outskirts of Edinburgh, the refurbishment of a number of parks and gardens in Aberdeen, and the Clyde Gateway project in Glasgow. Annual reports prepared by each city council describing the various outcomes achieved to date are published on the Building Better Cities section of the Executive&rsquo;s website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Cities/Cities" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Cities/Cities</a> .</p>

  <p>The Cities Growth Fund has also brought other sorts of improvements. For example, it has acted as a catalyst for both City-Region and regional partnership working; it has supported the development of strategic capacity at the City-Region level (such as in the Clyde Valley Community Planning Partnership which covers Scotland&rsquo;s largest City-Region), and it has led to greater inter-city collaboration (such as between Edinburgh and Glasgow which will help both cities to compete successfully in global markets).</p>

  <p>Many of the improvements resulting from the funding provided are long term in nature and an independent assessment of the impact of the fund will take place during the second half of 2006-07.</p>

  <p>We have made it clear throughout that the best way to ensure that individuals have the National Entitlement Card which they will need to access the Scotland-wide Free Bus Scheme was to submit their applications early. We will make every effort to ensure that everyone who submitted a valid application before 20 March 2006 will receive their entitlement card by 1 April 2006. Those who for whatever reason do not have a new Entitlement Card by 1 April will be able to use their old travel card for local travel for a limited period of time thereafter.</p>

  <p>However, the EOC did launch a general formal investigation into the role and status of classroom assistants in Scottish primary schools on 23 January 2006. The investigation will run for 12 months and is based on recent EOC pilot research indicating that classroom assistants are an example of jobs that are undervalued because they involve skills linked with domestic and caring roles, historically associated with women.</p>

  <p>To inform and complement the work of the investigation, the EOC has established an advisory board. Key stakeholders will participate in the advisory board, including representatives of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Education Department.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for the courts in each jurisdiction to reach a view on the appropriate level of payment in individual cases. There are differences between the law of damages in Scotland and that in England and Wales. In Scotland, the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976 provides that where a person dies as a result of personal injury the deceased&rsquo;s family may be entitled to claim damages for patrimonial loss and/or non-patrimonial loss. Patrimonial damages are awarded for loss of financial support, while non-patrimonial damages are awarded as compensation for distress and grief or for the loss of the deceased&rsquo;s society. Only the &quot;immediate family&quot; is entitled to sue for non-patrimonial loss. We have recently legislated to update the list of persons who make up the deceased&rsquo;s immediate family, for example to include same-sex partners, grandparents and siblings.</p>

  <p>There is no claim for non-patrimonial loss in England and Wales. Instead, the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 provides for an entitlement to a bereavement claim, of fixed amounts, for a more limited range of relatives.</p>

  <p>If the member has any concerns on specific aspects of damages law in Scotland I will be glad to hear more about them. In the meantime, the Scottish Executive has no plans to introduce legislation covering this area of the law.</p>

  <p>The Executive is investing record levels in social care, including the accessibility of respite provision. In particular, local authorities receive &pound;16 million per annum from the Change Fund to help implement the recommendations in <em>The same as you?</em> review of services for people with learning disabilities. One of the recommendations is for further development of short breaks for people with learning disabilities.</p>

  <p>The Executive also supports parents in accessing respite care for their children through the promotion of direct payments. A working group drawing on the expertise of multiple sectors will be convened later in the year to examine barriers to the greater provision of direct payments, as well as means of empowering parents through this mechanism.</p>

  <p>The criteria for exemption from NHS prescription charges fall into three main categories. The list of chronic medical conditions that confer exemption from prescription charges was agreed with the medical profession in 1968. In the intervening period there has been no consensus for change. For exemption on financial grounds the schemes that either enable or passport exemption status are subject to annual review, as are the thresholds or monetary amounts at which exemption is triggered. The only amendment to exemption on age grounds was in October 1995 when the age exemption for men was reduced from 65 to 60.</p>

  <p>The distinction between a failure to meet particular contractual commitments and breaches of contract generally is one that relates to the remedies that may be available against a contractor, and is determined by the terms of individual contracts. For example, the imposition of costs or actions on contractors for failure to meet specific commitments (e.g. required service levels) is a common feature of many contracts. This approach can ensure that there are direct and effective consequences against a contractor which fails to meet the commitments agreed in the contract. In other words, failure to meet specific contractual commitments can have consequences that are not treated as a breach of contract. Failure to comply with terms of the contract where no specific consequences are provided for, where penalties exceed specified levels or the appropriate remedial action has not been taken within a specified time, would be treated as being a breach of contract in relation to which the remedies normally available at law may be pursued.</p>

It suggests that local authorities may wish to consider, when negotiating contracts for school transport, whether to require that vehicles are fitted with three point seat belts rather than the minimum statutory requirement of lap belts.

  <p>The Changing Children&rsquo;s Services Fund was established to help local authorities and their partners, including NHS boards and the voluntary sector, deliver better outcomes for children and young people through improving the integration and effectiveness of local services.</p>

  <p>Guidance sets out broad objectives and criteria for the Fund but local agencies have considerable discretion and flexibility to decide which services should be supported to meet local requirements.

  <p>The Executive is investing record levels in social care, including respite provision. In particular, local authorities receive &pound;16 million per annum from the Change Fund to help implement the recommendations in <em>The same as you?</em> review of services for people with learning disabilities. One of the recommendations is for further development of short breaks for people with learning disabilities.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also examining ways of promoting financial control mechanisms for parents of younger people with learning difficulties such as direct payments. A working group drawing on the expertise of multiple sectors will be convened later in the year to examine barriers to the greater provision of direct payments.</p>

  <p>Sportscotland is subject to the same environmental duties and responsibilities which apply to the public sector in Scotland in general. In addition, the Minister for Environment and Rural Affairs wrote to all non departmental public bodies in August 2004 requesting that each body audit its current environmental impact and develop an environmental management policy to seek to improve environmental performance on an on-going basis.</p>

  <p><strong></strong>Sportscotland has commissioned Natural Capital Ltd to advise on the development of its environmental management system. <strong></strong>Sportscotland officials have also made use of the information and advice available to them through seminars and information sessions organised by the Executive as well as the web-based guidance to public sector bodies on delivering the biodiversity duty imposed by the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004.</p>

  <p>The need for training of its staff and board members is one key issue being considered by <strong></strong>sportscotland as it develops its environmental management system. Staff have been made aware of the on-going policy development and have attended briefing sessions. The board has also reviewed and adopted an Environmental Policy Statement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides development funding to Forward Scotland to further a range of sustainable development activities. The allocation for 2005-06 is &pound;381,389, reducing to &pound;333,338 in 2006-07. This funding is subject to Executive conditions of grant, including discussion and agreement on the outcomes to be achieved.</p>

  <p>This grant funding is made through the Sustainable Action Fund. The fund supports sustainable development in Scotland in partnership with a wide range of public and private sector bodies. Forward Scotland is one of those partners but not to the exclusion of others.</p>

  <p>Payments are made under Section 153 (1) of the <em>Environmental Protection Act 1990</em>. Ministers are accountable to the Scottish Parliament for this expenditure.</p>

  <p>Forward Scotland manages the Community Environmental Renewal Grant Scheme (CERS) on behalf of the Scottish Executive. The Company was awarded this contract following an open tender exercise. The total allocation for CERS is &pound;4,500,000 spread over 2004-07.</p>

  <p>Forward Scotland is an independent company with charitable status limited by guarantee. It was established in 1996 with the overall aim of promoting sustainable development in Scotland through innovative practical projects and influencing policy. Between 1996 and 2004 ministers had a number of powers in relation to the company, including appointment of the chairperson, control over the memorandum and articles, ministerial approval of the corporate plan and determination of the level of grant-in-aid. The relationship was changed in 2004, limiting ministerial involvement to the offer of any grant-in-aid, as set out above.</p>

  <p>The company receives funding from a number of organisations, including grant funding that it disburses on behalf of others. Full details of the income received, the amounts spent on administration and the company&rsquo;s programme of work are all detailed in the company&rsquo;s published corporate accounts.</p>
