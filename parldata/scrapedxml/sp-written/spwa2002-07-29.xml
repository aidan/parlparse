  <p>Recommendation 16 of the <i> Macpherson Report into the Murder of Stephen Lawrence</i> stated: &quot;That all possible steps should be taken by police services at local level in consultation with local government and other agencies and local communities to encourage the reporting of racist incidents and crimes. This should include: the ability to report at locations other than police stations&quot;. This recommendation has been accepted by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and local arrangements are now being developed. These or other facilities could in principle be extended to include other types of crime but that would be a matter for the police, in consultation with the relevant agencies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made on the consultation paper Managing Radioactive Waste Safely published jointly in September 2001 by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government and the devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-07-29.S1W-27786.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80258" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0729.htm#6">

  <p>The consultation ended on 12 March and today we are publishing a summary of the 330 responses received by the UK Government and the devolved administrations. We have considered the many comments made on the specific issues on which Managing Radioactive Waste Safely sought views, and the other comments which some recipients offered, and are now outlining the next steps which the UK Government and devolved administrations have agreed will be taken in the policy process.</p>

  <p>We now propose to press ahead with a review of waste management options. The review will seek the views of interested stakeholders, the public and government departments. We will appoint an independent body to oversee the review process which will make recommendations on the option, or combination of options, for managing radioactive waste which achieves long-term protection for people and the environment. We will review all options and revise the timetable to a four rather than five stage process. We, the UK Government and the devolved administrations, will continue to be responsible for taking the ultimate decision on the management option.</p>

  <p>We propose that the new body will be in place by the end of the year. We will advertise widely for the members of this new body and they will be appointed jointly by ministers from the UK Government and the devolved administrations. We will be seeking people who will bring technical expertise and people who will bring a wider perspective of environmental, health, social or ethical issues. We will also want to ensure that its membership is drawn from across the UK. Further details will be announced later. This new body must win public confidence and operate in an open, transparent and inclusive manner. The review process must engage with stakeholders and the public.</p>

  <p>The first step of the review will be to set the framework for debate by establishing broad agreement on the wastes to be considered, the range of management options for each of them, and the criteria against which these options should be assessed. The second step will be to assess each option including commissioning any new research required. The final step will draw up recommendations for ministers to consider.</p>

  <p>The Managing Radioactive Waste Safely consultation was the first stage in our programme. The appointment of the new body will signal the beginning of Stage 2, and the process of assessing options, and it will end when we publish and explain our decision. Stage 3, around 2006, will be a public debate on how the decision should be implemented, including any site selection criteria. Stage 4, around 2007, will be the start of the implementation process including any necessary legislation. In making these changes we have taken account of views received and research undertaken. We believe that this approach will result in a more dynamic and extensive process of public engagement as the review progresses, rather than the series of public consultation exercises originally envisaged. We shall not set rigid timetables and deadlines. But we shall go faster if we can.</p>

  <p>Our priority is to reach the decision which achieves long-term protection of people and the environment, which inspires public confidence, and which is practicable. This approach, coupled with regular reports to the Scottish and UK Parliaments and the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, will reach far more people and encourage active involvement in decision making, rather than occasional opportunities to react to consultation papers.</p>

  <p>The waste from our existing nuclear facilities will arise over the next century or so. So we intend, in our assessment of waste management options, to include not only materials currently classified as waste but also to consider the consequences of providing for other materials which may be have to be managed as waste during that period, such as some separated plutonium, and uranium, as well as certain quantities of spent nuclear fuel. The future management options for the UK&#8217;s civil plutonium include its possible use as a fuel. However, up to 5% of this stock may be so contaminated that, even though it may also be technically possible to treat and use this amount for fuel, it might prove uneconomic to do so. The Government is currently undertaking a study of the possible options for the future management of UK owned civil stock and will want to consider the results of that exercise before reaching its own conclusions on this issue. More generally, the Government urges the other owners of these materials, on a voluntary basis, to put in hand procedures now which would allow them to identify those materials which may become not economically reusable.</p>

  <p>The review of options will not consider potential radioactive waste sites. Our priority is to assess the management options and decide how to manage the waste. But we need to recognise that the assessment of some options will raise siting issues &#8211; including, as some consultees have suggested, whether local communities should have a veto or be encouraged to volunteer, and whether they should be offered incentives. It is important to ensure that we are clear and open when drawing up any criteria which might eventually be needed to identify sites in the option assessment process, and the issues which they raise.</p>

  <p>Over the summer and autumn, we shall publish more detailed proposals. These will include details of the new body and its terms of reference, and more detailed proposals for Stage 2. They will also address pressing issues such as arrangements for managing waste safely in the short term and an announcement on waste substitution. We shall report progress on the other issues covered in the consultation, including decommissioning nuclear sites, the powers of the environment agencies, managing spent sealed sources of radioactivity, and waste classification. We will also set out how the policy process relates to other programmes, particularly the UK Government's proposals for<i> Managing the Nuclear Legacy &#8211; a Strategy for Action</i> published on 4 July 2002. A summary of the consultation responses has today been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 22822) and in the libraries of Westminster and the other devolved administrations. Copies of individual responses are available in the Scottish Executive Library and in those of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the relevant departments in the devolved administrations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s policy on equal pay is currently covered by its general policy on equal opportunities which provides that staff should be treated equally in respect of all matters. This policy is set out in the Staff Handbook which is available to staff and recognised Trade Unions. In addition, a review of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s pay system will be undertaken in the autumn with a view to identifying whether there are any gender pay gaps or other inequalities. Following the review, which is expected to be completed by April 2003, the Scottish Executive will publish a specific policy on equal pay.</p>

  <p>Many of the materials will be produced as part of on-going initiatives and some have been produced already, for instance:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has produced a leaflet that provides parents with information on which to base decisions about child safety in groups. It will be widely circulated to parents and carers in the school year 02-03 (recommendation 8).</p>

  <p>Disclosure Scotland has produced detailed guidance and advice in the form of a Guide to the Code of Practice, and in the Disclosure Scotland Website. Information will be issued in due course on the links between the Index of adults unsuitable to work with children and the Scottish Criminal Records Office (recommendation 11).</p>

  <p>Other materials are still being developed:</p>

  <p>A review of guidance issued to local authorities regarding child protection in schools is about to commence and will result in updated guidance being produced during 2003. Resources currently exist in schools regarding child protection and personal safety, however, following the updated guidance, the Scottish Executive will consider whether there are any significant gaps in provision which need to be addressed (recommendation 2).</p>

  <p>The Association of Directors of Social Work and the Scottish Institute for Residential Childcare will jointly develop supporting materials on safe and healthy relationships and assertiveness skills for children and young people looked after by local authorities, those with special educational needs or in special schools, and those identified as living with or affected by domestic violence. They will also provide information and about sexual health for vulnerable young people in care. This will be done by autumn 2003 (recommendations 4-6).</p>

  <p>The Risk Management Authority, which will be established by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, will be responsible for issuing guidance about assessing and minimising risk (recommendation 19).</p>

  <p>&quot;Information for Sentencers&quot; will be developed to provide information on the available provision of community based programmes, including those for sex offenders. It will be piloted in Edinburgh and the Lothians in autumn 2002. This could also be made available to the Parole Board (recommendation 25).</p>

  <p>The Justice Department steering group, announced along with the response to the expert panel, will produce protocols to provide a framework for information sharing and joint working (recommendation 64).</p>

  <p>The Judicial Studies Committee will decide on the timing and content of advice to the Judiciary to increase understanding of the nature and special features of sex offending and its prosecution. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service will develop their training to include this information (recommendation 71). The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service already provide good practice guidance to prosecutors, as this is the responsibility of the Lord Advocate (recommendation 73).</p>

  <p>The main thrust of the recommendations is to build on existing best practice. Many of them can be taken forward as part of the existing or planned initiatives of the key agencies which are involved. There are no major changes envisaged, rather a series of smaller changes which together can have a significant impact on practice.</p>

  <p>The following costs have been identified for taking forward the recommendations that are included in the Criminal Justice Bill:</p>

  <p>There will be minor annual costs from additional requirements for social enquiry reports and psychological assessments of &#163;50,000. The Scottish Executive will meet these costs. There will also be an annual cost of &#163;270,000 for transcribing the Crown&#8217;s narrative of the facts following a guilty plea, and an additional one off cost of &#163;50,000 for the installation of recording equipment. These costs will be met from the Scottish Court Service budget. There will also be additional costs in judicial time for the preparation of notes by trial judges, which can be met from planned resources.</p>
