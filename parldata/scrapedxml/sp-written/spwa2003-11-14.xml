  <p>Our National Health (December 2000, Bib. number 10298) and Partnership for Care (February 2003, Bib. number 26689) are explicit about the need for the NHS to work with patients and their carers to ensure that they have the information and support they need to be involved in decisions that affect them. This applies equally to people with conditions such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease where there is a key role for carers and relatives.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, as part of the implementation of the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002, NHS boards will be required to draw up carer information strategies. Guidance on the format and content of these strategies will be discussed in consultation with carer&#8217;s organisations and issued in 2004.</p>

  <p>Priority-based dispatch is one element of the Scottish Ambulance Service&#8217;s modernisation programme and will be introduced into Argyll and Clyde with effect from 31 December 2003, and into Dumfries and Galloway and Ayrshire and Arran with effect from 1 April 2004. The priority-based dispatch system is currently operational in all other areas of mainland Scotland.</p>

  <p>Supporting priority-based dispatch and another element of the service&#8217;s modernisation programme is the satellite tracking system, which is now in operation in all the emergency control rooms. This enables control room staff to track the movements of accident and emergency vehicles and to deploy the vehicle which is closest to an incident. The satellite navigation system - which allows the crew to identify the location of an incident via an electronic map - has been installed in the service&#8217;s rapid response units. The service plans to install this system in all accident and emergency vehicles over the next two years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service is currently halfway through a five-year programme to have a paramedic in every frontline ambulance by 2005-06. This involves the training of over 600 additional paramedics. The training programme is widely advertised and ambulance technicians are encouraged to apply. Direct recruitment is also used to increase the number of paramedics in the service, subject of course to checking of qualifications.</p>

  <p>The ambulance service&#8217;s South West Division has an action plan to increase the number of paramedics across the division, including at the Vale of Leven Ambulance Station. Paramedic cover in Vale of Leven is supplemented by the use of overtime and the service plans to post suitable direct recruitment personnel into the area. I know that the ambulance service has been in discussion with NHS Argyll and Clyde about the implications of the changes to clinical services at the Vale of Leven Hospital and I understand that funding has been secured for extra ambulance resources.</p>

  <p>To become a paramedic, ambulance technicians must have at least 18 months operational experience. They also have to sit a pre-entry examination. Training takes six weeks at the Scottish Ambulance College with four weeks clinical training in hospital. The costs of training a paramedic are between &#163;8,000 and &#163;10,000 depending on what operational cover is required to support their absence from their home base.</p>

  <p>As outlined in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> , the Executive is committed to extending concessionary fares schemes on public transport, including a national free off-peak bus scheme for older people and people with disabilities; and progressively introducing a scheme of national bus, rail and ferry concessionary travel for young people, initially for all in full-time education or training.</p>

  <p>Work is taking place to progress these commitments, including discussions with key stakeholders. This will be followed by a formal consultation process and substantial research and implementation work. We will be in a position to make a decision on the precise timing of the introduction of the schemes once the formal consultation process has been completed.</p>

  <p>Companies House does not keep information on the number of public limited companies (PLCs) with headquarters in Scotland. However the number of PLCs having their registered offices in Scotland as a result of commencing trading in each year since 1997 is as follows:</p>

  <p>I have asked Claire Clancy, the Chief Executive of Companies House, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Companies House does not record which public limited companies (PLCs) are included in the FTSE 500. Companies can be removed from the register for a variety of reasons and cessation of business is not a category that Companies House can provide figures for.</p>

  <p>Companies House does not keep records of PLCs relocating headquarters as it is not a requirement of the Companies Act. However, PLCs cannot relocate their registered offices from Scotland to England/Wales or vice versa as there is no provision within the Companies Act which allows this to be done.</p>

  <p>I am committed to the maintenance of affordable air and sea links to Scotland&#8217;s island and remote communities. Tendering protects the lifeline ferry services to the Northern Isles and in the Clyde and Hebrides by ensuring that they are in line with EC rules and thereby allowing subsidy to continue.

  <p>It is important to build on good practice and the Dundee pilot project suggests that it is possible to reduce waiting times for physiotherapy, which is good for patients. As part of its national programme, the Centre for Change and Innovation is undertaking a modernisation of out-patient services which will certainly build on the kind of work demonstrated by physiotherapists in Dundee.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Dundee pilot, a further study involving all health board areas in Scotland and GP practices in a wide range of locations, is currently under way to consider further the scope for the provision of direct access. This national multi-centred study will show whether provision of direct access is appropriate in all locations irrespective of deprivation and setting.</p>

  <p>Each local authority requires to assess housing needs across all tenures within its area in terms of its local housing strategy, which should complement the local authority's homelessness strategy and other strategic plans. In making this assessment it will need to take into account its duties under the 2003 act and any effect it considers those duties will have on the level of need for affordable housing in its area.</p>

  <p>The 2003 act sets the framework for the expansion, and ultimate abolition, of the &quot;priority need&quot; definition within homelessness legislation, with the end target that all &quot;unintentionally homeless&quot; households will be entitled to permanent accommodation by 2012. Research is being commissioned which will identify a methodology for assessing the capacity of local authorities to respond to this change. The 2003 act requires ministers to publish, by 31 December 2005, a statement on the abolition of the priority need test. This ministerial statement will be informed by the outcomes of the research.</p>

  <p>The partnership agreement includes a commitment to the provision of an additional 18,000 new and improved homes for social rent and low-cost home ownership by 2006.

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Local authorities have responsibility to assess housing provision and the provision of related services in their area, and in particular the provision of housing and related needs of persons with special needs. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, section 89 requires local authorities to undertake an assessment of housing needs and conditions, including the housing needs of people with disabilities in their area and to produce a local housing strategy. Local housing strategies must complement community care plans. Communities Scotland will be assessing the local housing strategies on behalf of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>In 2003-04, Communities Scotland will provide, in rural areas, &#163;18.5 million of funding to enable the provision of over 350 new and improved homes for older people, vulnerable single people, physically disabled individuals, people with learning difficulties and other groups, consistent with community care plans. Funding for the physical adaptation of existing properties is also available from the relevant housing budgets (e.g. the local authority for any of its tenants; Communities Scotland for tenants of a registered social landlord and local authorities for owner occupiers and private renters where applicable). In addition, in 2002-03, 96.2% of all Communities Scotland&#8217;s general needs new build housing funded by housing association grant was built to a barrier free standard.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive today issued its response to the consultation by the Department for Constitutional Affairs on constitutional reforms, including the setting up of a UK Supreme Court to replace the House of Lords sitting as an appeal court.</p>

  <p>The Executive welcomes the proposal for the setting up of a UK Supreme Court as a means of ensuring that Scotland&#8217;s constitutional position is maintained. The Executive believe that the creation of the UK Supreme Court would respect the unique nature of the Scottish justice system.</p>

  <p>The Executive indicated its view in July that it saw no case for departing from the long tradition of Scottish civil appeal cases going from the Court of Session to the House of Lords nor of supplementing the criminal appeal system by a further route to the new UK Supreme Court.</p>

  <p>In its response, the Executive agree that the right of appeal to the House of Lords on civil matters has served the Scottish justice system well. A tradition of high quality and durable decisions has built up in a way which has ensured valued and valuable consistency throughout the UK. The Executive see no reason to upset the current balance.</p>

  <p>Equally, the Executive do not believe that there is any need to modify current rights of appeal in relation to criminal matters to give the new UK Supreme Court jurisdiction in those respects simply for the sake of consistency. There are considerable differences between the systems of criminal law in Scotland and England and the current system has served the Scottish justice system well.</p>

  <p>The view of the Executive is that in relation to devolution issues under the Scotland Act, the UK Supreme Court is the appropriate forum for final determination of all such matters. The full text of the response is at www.scotland.gov.uk/00018515.</p>

  <p>Our National Health (December 2000, Bib. number 10298) and Partnership for Care (February 2003, Bib. number 26689) are explicit about the need for the NHS to work with patients and their carers to ensure that they have the support and information they need to be involved in decisions that affect them.</p>

  <p>The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002, requires NHS boards to draw up Carer Information Strategies, including advice on all available assistance. Guidance to health and social care professionals on implementing measures contained in the act states that the views of a child or young person with support needs, as well as the views of their parent or guardian, should be taken into account, as far as this is reasonable and practicable.</p>

  <p>Measures are already in place. Probationer teachers must achieve the Standard for Full Registration (SFR) before being fully registered by the General Teaching Council for Scotland and thus becoming eligible to apply for permanent teaching posts. The SFR sets out clearly what is expected of new teachers during their induction period and provides a professional standard against which decisions are taken on full registration. Among the professional skills and abilities listed in the SFR that registered teachers are expected to demonstrate is the ability to &quot;identify and respond appropriately to pupils with difficulties in, or barriers to, learning and seek advice in relation to their special educational needs&quot;.</p>

  <p>In 2001-02 the Scottish Executive allocated an additional &#163;90 million to NHS boards to accelerate the implementation of <em>Our National Plan: A Plan for Action, A Plan for Change</em> . The &#163;90 million formed part of the Finance Minister&#8217;s end year flexibility settlement and was distributed across all NHS boards. First call on this funding was, as a priority, the clearing of all cumulative deficits which had arisen since April 2001. Hence using these resources, seven NHS trusts had their cumulative financial deficits of &#163;41 million written off as shown in Table 1.</p>

  <p>When the funds were distributed, Susan Deacon stressed that this was a one off exercise which would not be repeated. The funds were provided to give a clean slate to the new unified NHS boards and to provide a real opportunity to develop initiatives flowing from Our National Plan. It was stressed that NHS systems and in particular accountable officers must ensure that future deficits were not accumulated.</p>

  <p>Since 2001-02, 3 NHS board areas have incurred revenue deficits at trust level; Argyll and Clyde, Grampian and Lanarkshire. As at 31 March 2003, the accumulated financial deficits are as outlined in Table 2.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have any plans to write off the above balances. The Health Department is working closely with boards in the development of their financial recovery plans, which demonstrate how the board areas will return to recurring financial balance and repay any accumulated financial deficits.</p>

  <p>Local authorities commission services from the independent sector to meet the needs of people with learning disabilities. These services are monitored and evaluated by local authorities. Monitoring and evaluation should take account of the views of the people with learning disabilities and their families that use the services.</p>

  <p>Local authorities also monitor and evaluate the services that they provide in-house. For example, local authorities conduct Best Value reviews of various services for people with learning disabilities. One of the aims of such reviews is to ensure that people with learning disabilities get services that maximise their quality of life.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has a number of policies that tackle aspects of poverty. Efforts are made in all of these to meet the particular needs and circumstances of vulnerable groups.</p>

  <p>For example, lone parents, who are predominantly women, are now able to access a &#163;1,000 child care grant to allow them to attend higher education courses, thereby increasing not just their own, but also their children&#8217;s life chances. The Sure Start Scotland programme targets support at families with very young children, ensuring that every child has the best possible start in life. Race equality legislation, along with our &quot;One Scotland, Many Cultures&quot; campaign, are helping to alleviate poverty by breaking down barriers faced by ethnic minority people to entering the labour market. More than 10,000 older people are now benefiting from warmer and more efficient homes through free central heating installed under our Warm Deal scheme. Older people and disabled people are benefiting from our policy to provide free bus travel within their local areas.</p>

  <p>Although the questioner refers to section 19(2)(b) of the Race Relations Act 1976, the relevant Scottish provision was section 19(3). The whole of section 19 of the 1976 act was repealed by Schedule 3 of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 with effect from 2 April 2001 by virtue of Statutory Instrument 2001/566. In any event, the general duty under section 19(1) only applied to educational authorities in Scotland by virtue of section 19(6) and companies operating public private partnerships were never subject to this duty.</p>

  <p>Access to Edinburgh airport and the west of Edinburgh will be improved through provision of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link, and the west Edinburgh tram. We have committed funds to both in order that the necessary Parliamentary powers to construct may be secured.</p>

  <p>The Executive currently has no plans regarding an access route from the M8 east of the M9 exit. Our policy, as set out in the West Edinburgh Planning Framework published in March this year, is that public transport improvements will be considered ahead of any road enhancement in the area.</p>

  <p>The A8 is a local road and as such the responsibility of City of Edinburgh Council. Access to the Royal Bank of Scotland site would therefore be a matter for the council.</p>

  <p>The decision on whether or not to proceed with a prosecution against an operator in relation to offensive odour is a matter for the Procurators Fiscal Service. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has, in addition to its ability to recommend cases for prosecution, a range of statutory powers to take enforcement action against operators who breach conditions in its licences. This includes requiring an operator to take remedial action to address a problem and revoking a licence.</p>

  <p>Depending on circumstances, landfill sites fall within the scope of Waste Management Licensing (WML) under Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 or the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (PPC). Some sewage treatment works fall under WML. Others will transfer to PPC by 2007. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency enforces both regimes and is able to include conditions in licences or permits to prevent offensive odour from a site. For those sewage treatment works that do not come within the scope of either regime, local authorities have powers under Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to statutory nuisance, which includes offensive odour.</p>

  <p>Action to improve the average waiting time for court decisions on young people has been taken on a number of fronts. The Youth Court pilot is operating a fast-track process where young offenders appear in court no more than 14 days from the point of charge. For this category of offender the process reduces to 75 days the period from charge to sentence identified in the Audit Scotland report as lasting between 167 and 190 days.</p>

  <p>The Audit Scotland report also recommended the implementation of a series of comprehensive multi-agency time standards for young offenders in the criminal justice system. Proposals on how to implement such time standards which will be considered by the new national Criminal Justice Board which holds its inaugural meeting in December.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has introduced National Standards for Scotland&#8217;s Youth Justice <em> </em> Services. These <em> </em> set out standards, to be achieved by 2006, that every young person referred to a hearing on offence grounds will have a comprehensive assessment delivered on time to a hearing, with the young person&#8217;s case worker in attendance at the hearing and that every comprehensive assessment must be completed using ASSET/YLS-CMI assessment tools. The Executive allocated an additional &#163;3 million in 2002-03 to assist with the dissemination and effective use of these tools. In addition, most social workers working with young people subject to court orders are trained in the use both of the LSI-R assessment tool, which is an adult version of YLS-CMI, and in the use of the Scottish Executive's Risk Assessment and Guidance Framework. The new social work degree which will be in place from 2004 will also require social workers in training to demonstrate competence in the assessment and management of risk.</p>
