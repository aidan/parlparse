  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to grant the application by the Federation of Small Businesses for the setting up of an inquiry under Section 211 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1973 into the manner and consequences of the divestment or &quot;externalisation&quot; of 11 residential homes formerly run by Dumfries and Galloway Council.</p>

  <p>We have written to the Federation indicating appropriate approaches. In relation to claims that individuals are being denied their right of choice of home it is open to the individuals or their representatives to raise the issue through the Social Service Department&#8217;s complaints procedure. General complaints against councils&#8217; decisions may be taken up with each council&#8217;s Chief Executive. Breaches of statute or codes of practice may be taken up with the council&#8217;s monitoring officer. Claims of injustice as a result of maladministration may be referred to the Local Government Ombudsman. In relation to the financial and tendering concerns raised by the Federation I understand the Controller of Audit has already initiated an audit. In these circumstances I do not consider an inquiry under section 211 would be appropriate at this time.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its view is on the extent to which the increase in violent crime of 17.5% in attempted murders, 9.25% in serious assaults, and 12.7% in robberies across Strathclyde last year can be attributed to cuts in funding which leave Strathclyde Police 350 officers below the establishment deemed appropriate to provide adequate policing.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-10-11.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa1011.htm#806">

  <p>Grant aided expenditure to forces last year was increased by 2.4%. Most forces reported an increase in recorded crime but some did not. There was therefore no question of funding being cut nor any apparent relationship between trends in funding and trends in recorded crime. In the case of Strathclyde the Chief Constable&#8217;s Annual Report for 1998-99 records the positive measures taken to deal with increased recorded crime, with encouraging results, which are a testimony to the success of the Chief Constable and his force in tackling crime in Strathclyde. These included a new force corporate strategy and planning framework and the launch of a major initiative in October 1998 targeted on housebreaking and drugs related crime. The force achieved an increase in detection rates, to 43.2%, for the year which was the highest in the history of the force and there was also a significant slow down in the increase in crime. Information recently released by the force shows a further increase in detection rates during the period April to June 1999, with a 44.4% detection rate and a reduction in recorded crime of 6% on the equivalent period last year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive to specify the capital and revenue costs which will fall on water authorities, health boards and other public agencies in Scotland as a result of fluoridation and whether additional resources will be made available to each of the foregoing to offset these costs.</p>

  <p>Health boards would be responsible for the capital costs incurred by water authorities in providing the treatment technology necessary to ensure that fluorides are added to water supplies accurately and safely and for revenue costs. Health boards promoting applications to fluoridate would also face the costs of consulting the public and any other administrative costs. Standing guidance indicates that central government will consider providing assistance to health boards of up to 60 per cent of the capital costs incurred in a fluoridation scheme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will amend the law relating to the expiry of commercial leases to give tenants the opportunity to continue trading from premises on a new lease after expiry and, if it has no immediate plans to do so, whether it will consult regarding the factors involved in providing more opportunity for tenants of commercial premises to have continuity of trading from the premises they rent.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to amend the law relating to security of tenure on the expiry of commercial leases in Scotland, nor do we intend to consult on such matters as these are primarily for individual tenants and their landlords to negotiate when drawing up leasehold contracts.</p>
