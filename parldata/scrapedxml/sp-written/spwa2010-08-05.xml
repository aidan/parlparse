  <p>While the Scottish Ambulance Service is structured into operating divisions for management purposes it is a national Special Health Board that serves all of Scotland. Where a patient requires transport to return from hospital it can be in a vehicle usually based in the patient&rsquo;s own locality or a vehicle from elsewhere. This depends on the scheduling and availability of the required, and most appropriate, resource.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach to delivery of phase two of the Home Insulation Scheme (HIS) in 2010-11 was agreed with COSLA. We are working to agree the detail of final schemes for those local authorities which bid unsuccessfully in 2009-10, and have also given those authorities which chose not to bid in 2009-10 a further opportunity to do so.

  <p>In preparing the Scottish child poverty strategy, Scottish Government intend to consult with a wide range of stakeholders, these include, but are not limited to: local authorities and associations of local authorities, children and organisations working with or representing children; parents and organisations working with or representing parents. Early development of the strategy has already been informed by regular contact with stakeholders, in particular with COSLA and the End Child Poverty coalition in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government will be consulting more widely from autumn 2010. A consultation event to feed into the formation of the strategy will take place on 29 September, as part of the Holyrood Tackling Poverty in Scotland conference. A formal public consultation will be launched later in the autumn, and will be accompanied with further consultation activities which are still in the process of being developed.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402)</p>

  <p>It is for local partners in community planning partnerships (CPPs) to develop models tailored to meet local needs and the Scottish Government is not prescribing local action. We are however providing support to the national third sector parenting organisations and others to develop parenting capacity and support carers to improve outcomes for children. Many of the locally organised informal support networks such as baby and toddler groups will also be available to grandparents and others.</p>

  <p>Those providing care to children with disabilities will benefit from the implementation of many of the action points contained in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s new carers and young carers strategy. Again, CPPs have an important contribution to make.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402)</p>

  <p>The early years framework is one of the three key social policy frameworks alongside Equally Well, the health inequalities framework and Achieving our Potential, the antipoverty framework, created jointly by the Scottish Government and COSLA, supported by the NHS, other public sector organisations and the third and private sectors. Taken together, the three frameworks form a coherent and long term approach to addressing disadvantage in Scotland and breaking the intergenerational cycle of inequalities. The child centred and multi agency approach in Getting it right for every child is the mechanism by which support for children is to be delivered.</p>

  <p>Single outcome agreements (SOAs) are the mechanism in the relationship between national and local partners through which shared priorities are progressed. The three social policy frameworks are agreed priorities for all community planning partnerships (CPPs) and as such will be reflected within their SOA. It is for local partners in CPPs to develop models tailored to meet local needs, but Scottish Ministers and officials are closely engaged with CPPs to provide support.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402)</p>

  <p>Effective local implementation of the Early Years Framework is the key to achieving the changes we want to see and the Scottish Government is ensuring that community planning partnerships (CPPs) are aware of the wide range of evidence that highlights the importance of the very early years of life.</p>

  <p>The Maternity Services Action Group&rsquo;s working group on ante-natal inequalities is developing evidence into action guidance for NHS boards in response to recommendation 4 of <em>Equally Well</em>.</p>

  <p>In addition, the refreshed framework for maternity services, which we expect to issue in spring 2011, is focussing on strengthening the contribution of maternity services both in the quality of the care and support provided by maternity services &ndash; ensuring it is person centred, safe and effective and the contribution of maternity services as partners with other public services, including the third sector.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and NHS Education for Scotland are developing a national syllabus for ante-natal education, which will allow for a consistent approach to antenatal parenting support across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government launched the family nurse partnership programme, in January 2010. There is one site, consisting of six nurses and one supervisor in Edinburgh City, which is aiming to support 150 first-time teenage mothers. We are testing this model in Scotland, and the outcomes will be evaluated across the three years the programme is in place. The three key aims are &quot;to improve maternal health&quot;, &quot;to improve child health and wellbeing&quot;, and &quot;to improve economic self-sufficiency of the family.&quot;</p>

  <p>We have undertaken a refresh of <em>Health for All Children</em> (Hall 4) which sets out the programme for screening, surveillance and health promotion contacts which every child can expect to receive. We have consulted on proposals to make the guidance more robust, particularly concerning the allocation of the health plan indicator (which determines the programme of contacts the child and family receive, depending on their assessed need), the use of the Getting it right for every child practice model for use as a tool for assessing the needs of children and families, re-emphasising health promotion as part of universal services and the re-introduction of a universal 24 to 30 month review. The consultation process is still ongoing and further guidance on Hall 4 will be issued in autumn 2010.</p>

  <p>Through the community planning partnerships and children&rsquo;s services planning processes, local partnerships are able to take a co-ordinated and integrated approach to meeting the needs in local communities, including the needs of children.</p>

  <p>Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) provides the methodology which should underpin delivery of all services for children and young people. Under the GIRFEC approach, children with additional support needs will be identified in universal services and assessed using the national practice model.</p>

  <p>The use of the GIRFEC approach will provide a comprehensive needs assessment and planning process to which all agencies will adhere, bringing in specialist assessment and help where necessary. Our delivery framework for substance misuse services includes specific action to support children affected by parental substance misuse.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402).</p>

  <p>It is for local partners to plan, design and deliver services to meet the needs of families. Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) provides the methodology which should underpin the delivery of all services for children and young people. Experience has shown that taking a GIRFEC approach can strengthen the collective voice of the team around the child, and places the views, wishes and opinions of the child and family firmly at the centre of planning and decision making.</p>

  <p>GIRFEC delivers a stronger and co-ordinated teamwork approach for children, especially for those with complex needs, and identifies and involves all agencies who can meet the assessed need. It not only considers immediate needs, but also takes a long term view of how children and their families can be supported through any difficulties, including life threatening and enduring conditions.</p>

  <p>We are providing support to a number of specific initiatives including the family nurse partnership, the development of care pathways for vulnerable families being developed by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. The Scottish Government has also supported child protection research that considered types of parenting interventions and the effects on children, where substance misuse is a factor. The Scottish Child Care and Protection Network published a report earlier this year which helps to establish an overview of effective parental interventions for local practitioners&rsquo; use.</p>

  <p>We also continue to work with initiatives such as the Lloyds TSB partnership drugs initiative, and the projects that it supports, which are critically important in improving the day to day lives of many of the children and families within our communities specifically affected by adult substance misuse issues.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402)</p>

  <p>In line with Scotland&rsquo;s sexual health strategy <em>Respect and Responsibility </em>and <em>National Outcomes 2008-11,</em> NHS boards and local authorities are required to work together to improve the sexual health of young people and to reduce teenage pregnancy. This includes the provision of accessible drop-in services offering general health advice, chlamydia testing, pregnancy testing and condoms, in or within walking distance from every secondary school in Scotland. We are working with NHS boards and local authorities to achieve that.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are working with local authorities and the Scottish Prison Service who are required to prioritise the provision of sex and relationships education and one to one support for vulnerable young people, included looked-after or accommodated children.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Standards (QIS) for sexual health have been developed and Standard 3 is that NHS boards should ensure the development and delivery of integrated approaches to sexual health improvement, particularly in relation to young people. Criteria include the demonstration of delivery of targeted interventions for young people at greatest risk of teenage pregnancy and poor sexual health, including looked after children. NHS boards will be subject to QIS assessment shortly.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission agreed with the Scottish Government that during 2009-10, they would look at how regulated services support children&rsquo;s development and learning by involving parents and carers. To that end, Care Commission officers advised all early years day care providers of this and sampled these services to gauge the extent to which parents and carers were being involved. This was also explained to providers at a seminar &quot;Implementing the Early Years Framework: Delivering a Strategy for Effective Intervention&quot; which was held in Edinburgh in May 2009 and chaired by the Care Commission&rsquo;s chief executive.</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) undertook in 2008-09 to gather information on the implementation of the Early Years Framework from their inspections. In October 2009, the report <em>Positive Start, Positive Outcomes </em>was published on the HMIE website. It outlined the importance of partnership working and gave details of key issues facing those involved in implementing the framework. It also included a range of case studies exemplifying how the framework was being delivered across services and communities in Scotland. HMIE continue to monitor the Early Years Framework through their inspection programme, and to share good practice.</p>

  <p>Raising literacy and numeracy standards is central to Curriculum for Excellence, the curriculum framework for learners three to 18. It will drive forward improvements in teaching and learning to ensure our young people have the literacy and numeracy skills they need for learning, life and work. All practitioners have a responsibility to promote the development of these skills, including in the early years. HM Inspectorate of Education evaluate and report on early language and mathematics in every inspection in pre-school centres.</p>

  <p>We will publish a literacy action plan in the autumn, bringing together work to improve literacy standards from across government, and also work being taken forward by our partners. It will address the continuum of learning, from the early years through to adult learning.</p>

  <p><em>Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC)</em> is the national approach to helping children and young people in Scotland. The approach helps families and professionals to work better together with children and young people, and gives children and families more say in the help that they get.</p>

  <p>The GIRFEC approach delivers a stronger and co-ordinated teamwork approach for children, especially for those with complex needs, and identifies and involves all agencies who can meet the assessed need. It not only considers immediate needs, but also takes a long term view of how children and their families can be supported through any difficulties, including life threatening and enduring conditions.</p>

  <p>Where the plan is multi-agency a lead professional will be agreed to be the first point of contact with the child and family and to co-ordinate the actions set out in the plan. They will also liaise regularly with all the partners to the plan.</p>

  <p>We have undertaken a refresh of <em>Health for All Children</em> (Hall 4) which sets out the programme for screening, surveillance and health promotion contacts which every child can expect to receive. We have consulted on proposals to make the guidance more robust, particularly concerning the allocation of the health plan indicator, which determines the programme of contacts the child and family receive, depending on their assessed need; the use of the GIRFEC practice model for use as a tool for assessing the needs of children and families; re-emphasising health promotion as part of universal services; and the re-introduction of a universal 24 to 30 month review. The consultation process is still ongoing and further guidance on Hall 4 will be issued in autumn 2010.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402).</p>

  <p>Education has a key role to play in ensuring that young people make informed choices about sexual relationships and reducing unintended pregnancies. With the full introduction of Curriculum for Excellence from August 2010, children and young people will learn, as part of a broad health and wellbeing curriculum strand, about relationships, sexual health and parenthood.</p>

  <p>Reducing unintended teenage pregnancies in girls under 16 is a key aim of <em>Respect and Responsibility</em>, Scotland&rsquo;s sexual health strategy, which promotes the values of mature loving relationships, founded on self respect and respect for others. A total of &pound;15 million over three years until March 2011 has been provided to NHS boards to support the implementation of the strategy.</p>

  <p>With the publication of the <em>Sexual Health Outcomes</em> in 2008, NHS boards and their partners have been working closely together in order to address the wider cultural factors that affect sexual health and wellbeing.</p>

  <p>In addition, guidance was issued by Learning Teaching Scotland in March 2010 which seeks to support local authorities, NHS boards and other agencies to reduce teenage pregnancies. Annual statistics, published in June, saw a reduction in the teenage pregnancy rate. That, combined with the recent decrease in the abortion rate, is encouraging.</p>

  <p>There is now growing evidence to support intervention in early years to improve sexual health outcomes, and we will taking this into account as we update our sexual health strategy and national outcomes, which come to an end in March 2011. We will also be looking at other opportunities to include sexual health advice and interventions in acute and other healthcare settings.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402).</p>

  <p>The Early Years Framework committed the Scottish Government to promoting childcare vouchers among employers in Scotland. From January to June 2009, the Scottish Government ran a project to promote greater use of childcare vouchers among Scottish employers in the public, private and voluntary sectors with the report now available on the Scottish Government website. This has successfully raised the profile of childcare vouchers through individual contacts and working with the Scottish Trades Union Congress.</p>

  <p>More recently, the Scottish Government pressed the former UK administration to drop plans to make potentially damaging changes to the tax incentives for childcare vouchers. We will continue efforts with the UK Government to create a single, progressive and more accessible means of supporting childcare costs through tax credits and childcare vouchers. Responsibility for these are reserved to the UK Government.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402).</p>

  <p>Through the community planning partnerships and children&rsquo;s services planning processes, local partnerships are able to take a co-ordinated and integrated approach to meeting the needs in local communities, including the needs of children.</p>

  <p>Getting it Right for Every Child provides the approach which should underpin the delivery of all services for children and young people.</p>

  <p>Scottish planning policy encourages the provision of play space and other opportunities for children and young people to play freely, explore, discover and initiate their own activities to support their development. Local authorities are encouraged to carry out audits and prepare strategies about the open space in their area and to consider the creation of green networks which can help encourage more active travel and healthier lifestyles. The &quot;Designing Streets&quot; planning policy encourages the creation of environments which, through an emphasis on safe, walkable neighbourhoods, public green and hard spaces, the control of traffic and the consideration of pedestrians before cars, offers increased opportunity for children to engage in healthy exercise and play.</p>

  <p>Our joint statement with COSLA &quot;Equal Communities in a Fairer Scotland&quot; in October 2009, signals the need for local authorities and their community planning partners to use the combined power of mainstream resources to tackle poverty in our most deprived communities. In doing so community planning partnerships are also expected to complement the key aims of the three linked social frameworks, including the Early Years Framework.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government investment in active travel for schools has resulted in over 80% of schools working on or developing a travel plan for pupils and staff. Funding through Sustrans has provided safe routes to schools for those who wish to walk and cycle and for secure cycle parking.</p>

  <p>In addition, the cycling action plan for Scotland was published in June 2010 and will promote cycle training for school children, starting in Primary 3.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is keen to see all our children and young people having positive learning experiences in a variety of settings and has invested in the production and promotion of guidance to support opportunities presented by the new school curriculum for learning in the outdoors. The guidance makes clear that the outdoor environment offers motivating, exciting, different, relevant and easily accessible activities from pre-school years through to college. A series of six regional events were held throughout Scotland in May and June 2010 to raise awareness of the new guidance <em>Curriculum for Excellence through Outdoor Learning</em> and the supporting online resource to re-emphasise the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment for all children and young people to participate in a range of creative, sustainable and progressive outdoor learning experiences.</p>

  <p>We have invested in the production and promotion of guidance and an online resource to support everyone in the learning community to pursue the opportunities presented by Curriculum for Excellence to provide creative, sustainable and progressive outdoor learning experiences for all children and young people. HM Inspectorate of Education pay particular attention on every inspection of pre-school centres to the quality of outdoor learning through play.</p>

  <p>We also provided over &pound;400,000 in 2009-10 through various Government initiatives to promote outdoor learning. These include the Forestry Commission&rsquo;s education programme including forest schools; the National Trust for Scotland for visits to Bannockburn, Culloden and Robert Burns&rsquo; Birthplace; visits to Historic Scotland properties and through Scottish Natural Heritage support for grounds for learning. Funding will continue in 2010-11, when there will be additional visits to New Lanark, to the National Trust and Historic Scotland properties and funding to the Royal Highland Education Trust to encourage school trips to farms.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402).</p>

  <p>Single outcome agreements (SOAs) are the mechanism in the relationship between national and local partners through which shared priorities are agreed and progressed. Each community planning partnership (CPP) is expected to reflect high level, strategic progress on the early years framework within their SOA. Each local authority has a statutory obligation to produce an integrated children&rsquo;s services plan and this is to be seen as an integral part of the wider community plan.</p>

  <p>It is for local partners in CPPs to develop models tailored to meet local needs, but Scottish Ministers and officials are closely engaged with CPPs to provide support. The Getting it Right for Every Child methodology facilitates an integrated and co-ordinated approach to the delivery of children&rsquo;s services.</p>

Each hub will produce an action plan which will consider the key actions required to develop and refocus services around the Housing Options model to the prevention of homelessness. This process will be assisted by the use of peer review/support models, a Housing Options Toolkit and an awareness of local circumstances. It is for local authority partners to agree priorities, however it is envisaged that funding will be used for training and service development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government remains committed to the target of ensuring that all unintentionally homeless households have the right to access settled accommodation by the end of 2012. At the last statistical count published in March 2010, it is evident that Scottish Borders Council still have some way to go to meet the national 2012 target on the abolition of the priority need test. However, the Scottish Government regularly meets with our partners in COSLA via the 2012 Joint Steering Group to discuss progress in this area, and to assist local authorities in achieving this target</p>

  <p>One of the key aims of the 2012 Joint Steering Group is to facilitate greater access to existing housing stock. In this context, a Scottish Government official met with officials of Scottish Borders Council in March 2010 to discuss how recently introduced legislation pertaining to greater access to the private rented sector could assist the council&rsquo;s progress towards the target. Scottish Borders Council has also indicated that it intends to participate in our forthcoming regional seminars on the Housing Options approach to homeless prevention, another key aim of the steering group.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government anticipates significant public and private co-investment as part of the JESSICA regeneration programme.</p>

  <p>The European Investment Bank will look to make significant co-financing available, subject to their normal lending criteria. Big Lottery Fund are also looking at ways in which they can co-invest alongside the JESSICA Holding Fund, to help secure maximum benefit for local communities. We also expect Urban Development Funds to lever in private co-investment finance from banks or other institutional investors.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to determine interest rates relating to the JESSICA programme at this stage. Interest rates will be determined by Urban Development Fund managers, and these have not yet been procured. Specifying a target rate of return from the outset is not seen as appropriate, as it could constrain the discretion of the European Investment Bank or Urban Development Funds.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to specify repayment timescales until Urban Development Funds are established, and a pipeline of projects has been identified. Decisions on these issues will be taken by the European Investment Bank, in conjunction with the JESSICA Investment Board and Urban Development Fund managers.</p>

  <p>The JESSICA (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas) programme is part-funded through Priority 3 (Urban Regeneration) of the Lowlands and Uplands Scotland ERDF Programme and will operate in the 13 local authority areas targeted in that Priority.</p>

  <p>Eligibility is limited to the 10 local authority areas with the highest share of population in the 15% most deprived data-zones, as measured by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, and the seven areas with the highest concentration of individuals in the NEET (not in education, employment and training) category. There is some overlap, resulting in 13 targeted areas. These areas account for approximately 60% of the region&rsquo;s population.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government facilitated an event in June for stakeholders to discuss how translation and interpretation services might be improved across the public sector. Partners are now working collectively to look at the suggestions and how we may work together to improve the quality and standards of interpretation services.</p>
