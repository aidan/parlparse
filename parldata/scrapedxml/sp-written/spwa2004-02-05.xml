  <p>No central record is kept of children placed outwith Scotland in order to fulfil supervision requirements. The principal services accessed in England and Wales are likely to be secure accommodation and mental health places. Some children from England also use places in Scotland. In respect of the secure estate, in particular data collection, service provision and management issues are regularly discussed with secure providers, registration and inspection bodies at the Secure Accommodation Forum.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working with those at the front line of delivering homelessness services to ensure the prevention of homelessness as well as effective responses where it does occur. The recommendations of the Homelessness Task Force are being taken forward and progress has been set out in the first report of the Homelessness Monitoring Group which was published on 28 January 2004. Progress is expected through the development and implementation of homelessness and housing strategies.</p>

  <p>Particular emphasis is given by the Executive to vulnerable groups, including young people and those with addictions. For example, guidance to senior managers of children&#8217; services was published in July 2003 following extensive work by the Working Group on Young Runaways and Children Abused through Prostitution to encourage more effective joint working across all agencies to tackle the underlying issues which can cause vulnerable children to run away.</p>

  <p>Another priority is to address the health and health care needs of homeless people, including of drug users. NHS boards are required to implement health and homelessness action plans which outline all planned activity in each board area to address the health needs of homeless people. These are integrated with homelessness strategies, which were submitted to the Executive in 2003 and have been assessed for the overall standard and for the quality of health links. Action plans are also integrated into local health plans. Progress is being overseen by the health and homelessness steering group.</p>

  <p>Under our broadband strategy, we are currently considering which interventions would be most appropriate in 2004-05 including a possible successor to the Business Broadband Incentive scheme. The scheme has been very successful this year, with around 5,000 applications received to date. To put this figure in context, the total number of businesses with a broadband connection in May 2003 was 10,000.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that mediation can contribute to the effective and efficient administration of justice in the civil courts. That is why we strongly support its use and are keen to encourage it where feasible and appropriate. The Executive already provides support and funding for a range of mediation and advice services. We are actively considering what further action might be taken to encourage greater use.</p>

  <p>It is a fundamental principle of commercial contracts that parties are free to choose the applicable law. This principle forms part of the Rome Convention, to which the UK is a signatory, as translated into domestic UK law. The Convention determines the law that applies to a contract where more than one legal system is involved. It supports consumers by ensuring they retain the benefit of certain types of rule designed to protect them under the law of their habitual residence, even where the contract designates another law as the applicable law.</p>

  <p>Scottish interests were taken into account in the formulation of the Convention rules, which bind all of our current EU partners. Consumer protection is a reserved issue.</p>

  <p>Details on the whole time equivalent and headcount of paediatric consultants and paediatric nurses, as well as the population by NHS board area, are available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, (Bib. number 30418).</p>

  <p>Rates per 100,000 population are also given. These rates should be treated with caution. The variability in rates between health boards can be partly explained by the number of consultants each rate is based on.

  <p>The Executive is committed to the dispersal of public sector jobs and to improving the social and economic conditions of all areas across Scotland, including areas of most need. The Executive recognises that particularly in remote areas, even a small number of additional jobs can make a significant difference to social and economic conditions. Under this small units initiative, Tiree will be considered as a potential location for the relocation of public sectors jobs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working closely with the Secretary of State for Scotland&#8217;s office to ensure that Scotland is well positioned to benefit from the outcome of the UK public sector relocation review which is due to report in 2004. Scottish Development International is in regular contact with the review team and is meeting all relevant Whitehall departments and public bodies to understand, inform and support their relocation requirements. As specific reviews come up, it will be possible to assess on a case by case basis what locations within Scotland may be suitable as relocation options.</p>

  <p>The Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route is being designed as a dual 2 lane, all purpose carriageway. In normal circumstances, this type of road does not have a hard shoulder. However, unlike significant stretches of the A90 dual carriageway south of Aberdeen, the new by-pass road, it will have a 1m wide marginal strip adjacent to the nearside running lanes.

  <p>Recent tidying up of the data has identified that we held a number of records showing apparently outstanding cases who would have received zero payments. As a result, 45 of the 723 cases included in the &quot;not yet claimed&quot; category in the answer given to question S2W-1237 on 24 July 2003 have been left out of the equivalent figures above.

  <p>An <em>ad hoc</em> group of ministers on tourism has been examining the state of Scottish tourism, and the public expenditure devoted to it. We are considering the outcome of the area tourist board review in the context of these wider issues. We need a support structure for the sector that is not only right for today&#8217;s market but will stand us in good stead for the future, because this is an industry with a long term future. We hope to announce the group&#8217;s conclusions in due course.</p>

  <p>We are actively developing an integrated transport system in Scotland. We are investing in public transport projects that improve integration and interchange between different services and modes of transport. We are improving travel information through Traveline Scotland, providing high quality travel information by phone and internet. We are supporting the development of the UK service Transport Direct, which will allow people to plan and book their journey, and check journey information in real time, all in the same place. We are also committed to the development of more integrated ticketing schemes, making public transport simpler to use.</p>

  <p>Jean Dunlop and Roy Hayter attend the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) meetings. They were nominated by the Scottish Executive for membership. The Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland (MACS) has a complementary work programme to DPTAC who are the UK Government statutory advisers on transport issues for disabled people relating to devolved transport issues. The Taxi Working Group is a sub-committee of DPTAC and DPTAC members are assigned to its membership. The Scottish Executive remains committed to improving transport for disabled people in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am aware of the concerns of the Scottish haulage industry regarding the recruitment and retention of HGV drivers. Communication with Westminster is maintained on this issue through Scottish Executive attendance at the UK road haulage forum.</p>

  <p>My officials have also been working closely with Scottish representatives from the Road Haulage Association, the Freight Transport Association and Skills for Logistics in seeking ways to address these concerns. As a result, in the past year we have launched two training initiatives funded through the Scottish Road Haulage Modernisation Fund. These are: The Young Driver Training Scheme and The Scottish Driver Training Scheme (aimed at over 21s).</p>

  <p>My officials continue to meet industry representatives on a regular basis and are currently considering further initiatives to address recruitment and retention of staff within the industry in Scotland.</p>
