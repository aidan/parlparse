This commitment builds on an undertaking by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland in March 2003 to make it a priority to return a further 250 police officers to operational policing roles by 2006. The conclusion of the contract for the prisoner escort and court custody tasks which was signed on 3 November 2003 will also release up to 300 officers to be re-deployed to other front line duties.

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) has one member of staff based in Brussels on a fixed term basis for one year from April 2003. This was agreed by the SPCB at its meeting of 7 January 2003.</p>

  <p>The staff member is line managed by the Head of the External Liaison Unit and by the Clerk/Chief Executive. Reports on his work are submitted every month to the Corporate Body.</p>

  <p>The remit of the member of staff, agreed by the SPCB, is, in accord with the recommendations contained in the European Committee&#8217;s 5th Report of 2002 on Scotland&#8217;s Representation in the European Union:</p>

  <p>to research and produce a report to the SPCB on the options for and the practical aspects of establishing a more permanent Scottish Parliament presence in Brussels,</p>

  <p>to provide support for MSPs who serve as delegates to the Committee of the Regions and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities in Europe, and</p>

  <p>to support visiting MSPs on parliamentary business.</p>

  <p>The member of staff works in office space leased to Scotland Europa in Scotland House. The SPCB is paying 15,429.48 euros to Scotland Europa for the use of this office space from April 2003 until April 2004. MSPs and parliamentary staff can also use hot-desk facilities in the office space as a part of the agreement with Scotland Europa.</p>

  <p>Overall, the anticipated maximum annual running costs for the one year posting are &#163;70,000, which includes the office costs, and the member of staff&#8217;s salary, allowances and travel expenses etc.</p>

  <p>The SPCB will consider future arrangements on the options for, and the practical aspects of, establishing a more permanent Scottish Parliament presence in Brussels upon receipt of a report by the member of staff in Brussels in early 2004.</p>
