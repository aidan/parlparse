  <p>The Scottish Government understands that Aberdeen City Council pays an allowance to kinship carers and has plans to deliver in full on the concordat commitment by paying an allowance at a rate equivalent to that paid to foster carers by 2011.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much funding it has made available for research into skin cancer in each of the last five years.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Government has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and healthcare needs in Scotland. CSO does not ring fence funds for specific areas of research but supports projects of a sufficiently high standard initiated by the research community in Scotland. This role is well known and advertised throughout the healthcare and academic community.</p>

  <p>CSO expenditure on skin cancer research in each of the last five years was as follows:</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">

</table></p>

  <p>In addition, during the last five years, &pound;1 million per annum has been spent on the Scottish Cancer Trials Network and approximately &pound;10 million per annum supporting the cost of cancer research carried out in the NHS. A further &pound;485,000 per annum for three years was spent on the National Translational Cancer Research Network and subsequently &pound;324,000 per annum on the experimental cancer medicine centres where funding has been matched by Cancer Research UK. Some of this expenditure will have benefited skin cancer research.</p>

  <p>CSO would welcome further research proposals in this area which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>Scottish police forces take their responsibilities under equality regulations extremely seriously, and since the 1999 MacPherson report have sought to ensure they are exemplars in their approach to racial equality. Progress has been made and will continue to be made.</p>

  <p>Our police reflect and represent all of Scotland. Victimisation or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated; the law will be enforced by the police and within the police, and, while we always remain alert to these issues, ministers do not believe that the police service in Scotland is institutionally racist.</p>

  <p>Data on the number of VAT registrations are released annually by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (DBIS). These figures are used to monitor the number of business start-ups. The latest available data refers to all VAT registrations taking place in Scotland in 2007. Please note that these figures do not account for all business activity as only companies with a turnover above the VAT threshold are required to register.</p>

  <p>The VAT registration rate in Scotland has remained relatively stable over the last 10 years. However, the registration figures for 2007 have increased substantially since 2006 and are the highest since the series began in 1994. It is likely that these figures partly reflect the impact of changes in tax rules in April 2007 surrounding managed service companies (MSC). We would not anticipate that the higher level of registrations seen in 2007 will be sustained once the business behaviour in response to the tax rule change diminishes.</p>

  <p>Data and further information on VAT registrations can be found on the DBIS website at:</p>

  <p>http://stats.berr.gov.uk/ed/vat/.</p>
