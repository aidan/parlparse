  <p>There are no plans to change the existing testing regime for amnesic shellfish poisoning in scallops.</p>

  <p>EU legislation requires that the whole body or any part edible separately is tested. The testing regime in Scotland is directed to the gonad since research has shown that, of the most commonly eaten parts of the scallop, this tends to have the highest concentrations of toxins.</p>

  <p>This information is not available. The requirement to test for amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) is relatively recent, commencing in 1998. The Fisheries Research Services Marine Laboratory in Aberdeen have been asked to examine the comparative distribution of ASP in the various parts of scallops as part of their current research programme.</p>

  <p>I launched the Improving Regulation in Scotland Unit (IRIS) on 24 November 1999. The IRIS unit will pursue business concerns about the burden of regulation and will work closely with small business representative groups to ensure that the particular needs of small businesses are kept to the forefront of policy making throughout the Executive. My officials in the IRIS Unit will soon be arranging the first of a series of meetings I plan to have with businesses across the country to hear at first hand about the regulatory problems they are encountering.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce today that I am inviting Caledonian MacBrayne to review the company&#8217;s ferry fares structure. This will include a review of CFARES policy objectives and an evaluation of the success or otherwise of the fares structure in delivering these. As well as consideration of the fares structure as a whole, there are particular areas of concern which I have invited the company to consider including route specific increases; the five-metre cut-off; the balance between commercial and passenger fares and peak and off-peak fares; and discounts to island residents and other concessionary schemes.</p>

  <p>The company&#8217;s present fares policy was introduced in 1992 and while much progress has been made the time is now right to review the success of the current policy and how this might be improved upon to produce a more efficient and effective outcome.</p>

  <p>In carrying out the review, the company will wish to seek the views of ferry users and I hope all those with an interest will contribute.</p>

  <p>The detailed decisions on levels of school funding are matters for individual education authorities and depend on a range of factors and local circumstances which they will take into account. Accordingly, we do not investigate authorities&#8217; school expenditure decisions. No guidelines about levels of spending per pupil exist, and we have no plans to issue such guidelines.</p>

  <p>We are co-operating fully with HM Treasury who are the lead UK government department on matters relating to the euro. In common with Whitehall departments, and other devolved administrations, we have prepared preliminary estimates of the time and direct costs that might be incurred in any transition to the euro. In particular, we sought to identify (a) any business areas where work on euro-compliance might have to begin in advance of any decision to join the single currency; and (b) any computer systems where the euro compliance could be incorporated in upgrades that were already planned.</p>

  <p>Had Glasgow received the average increase in Aggregate External Finance in the provisional allocations announced on 15 December its allocation would have increased by &pound;21.0 million over the current year. The final AEF figures for 2000-01, including the allocation of &pound;15 million additional for policy priorities, will be announced in the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2000 next month.</p>

  <p>Had Glasgow&#8217;s expenditure guideline for 2000-01 increased compared with its current guideline in line with the Scottish average, it would have increased by &pound;34.5 million. The City Council&#8217;s actual guideline allows for it to increase spending over its budgeted expenditure for the current year by &pound;41.4 million. Allocations from the Special Deprivation Payment (from which Glasgow will receive &pound;3 million) and the &pound;15 million still to be allocated have been disregarded for the purposes of calculating councils&#8217; spending guidelines.</p>

  <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his pre-budget statement that in England, any increases to fuel duty and tobacco duty above the Retail Price Index would be hypothecated respectively to transport and health programmes. The Scottish Executive will receive a share of those hypothecated resources, calculated in accordance with the Barnett formula, but there is no requirement for the Scottish Executive to hypothecate any sums which become available under this arrangement. Nevertheless, we have decided that any such sums should be allocated to the Scottish transport and health programmes respectively. Decisions on the levels of fuel duty and tobacco duty will be announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in due course in budget speeches.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence or scientific basis to suggest that there is a correct rate of caesarean section. A decision on the way a baby is to be delivered will be taken by the doctors and midwives involved on the basis of a number of factors. These will include what has happened in any previous pregnancy and delivery the mother may have had, the management of the labour at the time and the choice of the mother herself.</p>

  <p>The audit of, and research into, caesarean section in Scotland is ongoing. Professional advice, as appropriate, will be disseminated following consideration of any findings of this work.</p>

  <p>In the year ending 31 March 1999, the provisional figure for the number of people who died while on a waiting list for cardiac surgery is 67. Because the data do not include cause of death, it cannot be assumed that death was due in every case to coronary heart disease. The Coronary Heart Disease Task Force is satisfied that arrangements are in place for the active management of patients on cardiac surgery waiting lists.</p>

  <p>The issue of deaths on the waiting list for cardiac surgery was highlighted in the report of the Acute Services Review, which took it as an indication that the aim should be to treat disease at a less advanced stage and minimise delays that were leading to avoidable illness and death. That is why the Scottish Executive considers it important to establish national waiting times for this clinical priority.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service is not aware of the study. A significant proportion of prisoners have learning difficulties of various sorts and therefore, prisoner education gives priority to basic literacy and numeracy skills. SPS also works closely with the Scottish Dyslexia Association and where dyslexia is identified, opportunities to address this are offered.</p>

  <p>The development of railways is primarily a matter for the rail industry. I understand that South Lanarkshire Council has requested that Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive undertake a feasibility study into the viability of opening a station at Law.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive maintains trunk roads and motorways to allow safe movement of traffic and to minimise delays caused by adverse weather conditions. The winter period starts on 1 October and finishes on 15 May and during this time a dedicated 24 hour winter service operates on all trunk roads.</p>

  <p>Under proposals in the UK Transport bill those who issue directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority will be required to publish them. The Scottish Ministers will therefore publish their directions and guidance for the passenger rail services that begin and end in Scotland and sleeper services that begin or end in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, further to the answer to question S1W-3268 by Sir David Steel on 27 December 1999, to specify the amount of power expected to be generated by solar panels in the Holyrood building and the approximate percentage of the domestic water supply to be provided by this method.</p>

  <p>The solar panels to be installed in the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood are expected to generate 24,000 kw per annum of primary energy. This will heat an estimated 400,000 litres per annum of domestic hot water which will be equivalent to 16% of the total hot water consumption for the complex.</p>
