  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-28676 by Malcolm Chisholm on 24 September 2002, whether it would fund the testing of every autistic child for the presence of the measles virus if a validated test became available that would detect the virus other than in its acute viraemic stage.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to give a definitive answer to such a question, about the availability and desirability of funding blood tests on children with autistic spectrum disorders, in the absence of a validated procedure, and subsequent detailed expert consideration of expected outcomes, whether in the context of medical research or the clinical requirements of an individual.</p>

  <p>I have been considering how best to provide information on progress under the central heating programme. Eaga have set up a website on that programme and the Warm Deal. The address is www.eaga.co.uk. The website gives detail of surveys and installations of central heating by main postcode area. Information is not collected on any other geographical basis. Information not shown is not collected regularly. This information will be updated monthly. Please consult the website for information on progress.</p>

  <p>A copy of each month&#146;s report will be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. We will also provide details of progress under the central heating programme by those local authorities and housing associations which are taking part. This information will be made available as they claim grant. No claims have yet been made in 2002-03. A detailed report on the outcomes of the two programmes in 2001-02 will be presented to Parliament shortly.</p>

  <p>Drugs courts are currently being piloted in Glasgow and Fife and are the subject of an independent evaluation. The findings of the evaluation will be available early in 2004 and will inform our consideration of the future of the drugs court. There are therefore no immediate plans to extend the number of drugs courts.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of any impact of increased costs of public, environmental and employers&#146; liability insurance premiums on small- and medium-sized enterprises; what information it holds on the incidence of such enterprises being unable to secure such insurance cover at an affordable level, and what discussions it is undertaking, or considering undertaking, with Her Majesty&#146;s Government and, in particular, the Secretary of State for Scotland about any (a) market failure and (b) predatory pricing in respect of the availability of such insurance to such enterprises.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has received a number of case studies, illustrating the possible impact of increased business insurance premiums, particularly Employers Liability Compulsory Insurance, and, in some instances, difficulty in securing cover has been identified. It is important to clarify that this type of information is not routinely collected. Not withstanding that fact, the Scottish Executive will continue to encourage individual companies, business organisations and trade associations to share their evidence and concerns on this important matter, to help to build up an accurate representation of the position developing across the UK.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the statutory requirements affecting Employers Liability Compulsory Insurance rests with the Department of Work and Pensions and I have written to the Minister of State for Work, who is taking the lead on this matter, to express my concerns. The Executive is already directly involved in discussions about options for change and inter-departmental consultation is now well under way. The Scottish Executive will continue to work with the Scotland Office to represent Scottish business interests.</p>

  <p>Accordingly the total amount spent on schemes funded through modulation during the period is &#163;3,653,000.</p>

  <p>The balance of the receipts still available from 2001-02 will be spent over the coming years and already the value of modulation supported agri-environment agreements that have been committed over the next three years of their duration amounts to nearly &#163;18 million. In addition new commitments will be entered into in forthcoming application rounds. I have already announced changes to the agri-environment schemes that, subject to agreement by the European Commission, will enable the Executive to use these modulated funds to support a higher number of entrants to such schemes in the future.</p>

  <p>In the farm scale evaluations, the same ecological research is conducted on the non-GM crops grown as a control crop as is conducted on the adjacent GM crop. Those tests involve the collection of information on the following indicators:</p>

  <p>No. Such tests do not form part of the protocols applicable to the farm-scale evaluations and would only serve to confirm what is already known about the behaviour of pollen from these crops. The possibility of tiny quantities of pollen from the GM crop travelling outwith the trial crop is recognised and the potential consequences are addressed as part of the risk assessment process which is undertaken prior to the granting of approval. Our expert advisers are clear that pollen from the GM crops that have approval for release poses no greater safety threat than pollen from the equivalent conventional crop. Experience of the operation of separation distances suggests that any GM presence beyond this distance will be extremely small.</p>

  <p>Crops grown outwith the separation distance around a GM crop do not come within the scope of the legislation regulating GM releases. Growers, whether they are the farmer involved in the trial or neighbouring landowners, are at liberty to do what they wish with these crops. Before a GM crop is approved for release, the possible consequences of pollen flow from the crop is assessed carefully. Approval would not be granted if there was considered to be a safety threat to neighbouring crops or to human health.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that complementary or alternative therapies may offer relief to some people suffering from a wide variety of conditions. There is no legislative bar to prevent practitioners of such therapies from offering their services, subject only to some general restrictions such as those on prescribing and supplying medicines and giving injections. A GP or hospital clinician may refer a patient for alternative treatment, but would require to be satisfied of the value of the treatment and the competence of the practitioner and would remain responsible for the patient&#146;s medical care. It is also open to NHS boards or trusts to provide complementary or alternative therapies from the funding made available to them by the Executive, based on their assessments of local needs.</p>

  <p>The reasons given in answer to question S1W-28916 relate to an absolute right to buy and because of that are not relevant to the crofting community right to buy salmon fishings. The crofting community right to buy is not an absolute right to buy. It is conditional on a range of criteria being met and can be exercised by a crofting community body only when ministers consider that the acquisition of the property would be in the public interest. There are also very tight constraints on when the right to buy salmon fishings can be exercised. So the existence of the right should have no impact on the value of salmon fishings.

  <p>The traditional PPP/PFI structure results in the linking of finance, construction and maintenance with the result that the private sector is incentivised to perform, driving efficiency and results. That element is removed under the trust proposal.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s views on the trust proposal are already in the public domain, having been the subject of parliamentary questions and debates. Such a trust would need to take advantage of the Executive&#146;s ability to enter into contingent liabilities and to act as guarantor to these liabilities. Key questions relating to the governance and accountability of the trust, with a potential budget of billions of pounds, remain unanswered. We could end up with key decisions being taken not by elected ministers, but by trustees.</p>

  <p>The Executive is always willing to consider innovative ways of funding investment in public services, as demonstrated by our involvement in the development of a Non-Profit Distributing Organisation in Argyll and Bute.</p>
