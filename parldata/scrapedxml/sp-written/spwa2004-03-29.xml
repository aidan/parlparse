  <p>On its establishment in April 2002, Careers Scotland brought together some 80 guidance-related organisations. Its original budget was based on the total of the support provided by the Executive to these conjoining organisations, supplemented by specific funding for all-age guidance, inclusiveness and enterprise in education-related activity.</p>

  <p>Careers Scotland is now an integral part of the enterprise networks. Its costs therefore form part of the network's overall operating costs. The Executive's grant funding of the networks includes the original budget allocated up to April 2002. Allocation of the level of resources necessary for Careers Scotland is therefore an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</p>

  <p>As part of the Department's ongoing modernisation programme, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has recently begun the implementation phase of its Future Office System (FOS).</p>

  <p>FOS is an electronic workflow and document management system which will streamline much of the administrative and clerical work undertaken, including that arising from initial decision making.</p>

  <p>It was envisaged that staff savings would be realised following implementation and that these savings would occur primarily at the basic administrative grade.</p>

  <p>In order to minimise any possible redundancy situation, it was agreed, with trade union support, to fill vacancies at that level which occurred in the last 9 months on a temporary fixed term basis in the expectation that a significant number of these posts would no longer be needed in 2004-05 and in order to avoid the need for redundancies of permanent staff. The use of temporary or casual staff has indeed allowed the department to avoid making staff redundant.</p>

  <p>The Executive made a commitment in the partnership agreement to improving energy efficiency in the public sector. The Executive has just announced &pound;20 million in new funding to set up energy efficiency funds on a sustainable basis across all local authorities, health boards, and Scottish Water. Under this initiative savings achieved from energy efficiency will be reinvested to deliver further energy efficiency measures. Over five years we estimate these funds could deliver a reduction in energy consumption of up to 20% across these bodies &#8211; equating to a &pound;70 million saving in public sector energy bills and a reduction in carbon emissions of 500,000 tonnes over five years.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. NHS boards were informed of their 2004-05 capital allocations on 11 March with Highland, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles NHS boards receiving increases of 11.4%, 6.1%, 4.4% and 4.5% over their 2003-04 allocations respectively. Capital funds are now allocated to NHS boards using the Arbuthnott formula adjusted for cross boundary flows and weighted for the provision of regional specialities. This means that NHS boards can determine, based on their knowledge of the needs of the local area how this money should be spent.</p>

  <p>The calculation of the cost of a modern hospital whether a teaching hospital, a general hospital or a community hospital is a complex matter critically dependent upon the range and configuration of services to be offered, and hence the area to be occupied. It is not possible therefore to give even an estimated cost on the basis of the information provided in the question that could be applied or relied upon for comparative or planning purposes.</p>

  <p>Supporting People grants of &pound;421 million for 2003-04 have been allocated to local authorities. A further &pound;408 million has been announced for 2004-05. This includes part year allocations to West Dunbartonshire and Argyll and Bute councils. The allocation is also subject to adjustment to provide full year funding to projects which came into operation between 1 April 2003 and 31 March 2004 and were only funded for part of the year. Further decisions on 2004-05 funding will be subject to review. The purpose of this review is to ensure that the services being funded properly meet the objectives of Supporting People and are being delivered in an effective and value for money way and that Supporting People is placed on a secure footing going forward with a clear purpose and remit and the funds to deliver.</p>

  <p>Commodity prices are determined by supply and demand in global markets and, as such, affect all economies. As Royal Bank of Scotland's purchasing managers' indexes reveal, manufacturers throughout the UK have been affected by price inflation in raw materials, particularly metals. The Executive recognises the increasingly global and competitive nature of the markets that Scottish manufacturing companies compete in. The Executive pursues, through the Framework for Economic Development in Scotland, the provision of a supportive microeconomic environment to ensure that Scotland's manufacturers can capitalise on broader UK macroeconomic stability, grow and remain competitive.</p>

  <p>In addition to contacts with the Nordic Council of Ministers, the Scottish Executive enjoys bilateral links with Nordic countries in a number of fields, including health, fisheries and the environment. The Health agreement between Scotland and Finland for the exchange of information, visits and co-operation on common health issues reached its 25th anniversary in 2003.

  <p>During the period 27 June 2003 (when Section 74 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 came into force to permit an offence to be proved to have been aggravated by religious prejudice) until 29 February 2004, the police reported 262 cases including an allegation of religious aggravation. At this stage it is not possible to provide a definitive account of the number of prosecutions or their results and many remain active cases, but a report on the first six months of operation of this legislation will be available by the end of April 2004.</p>

  <p>Since the Disability Discrimination Act was introduced in 1996, NHS boards have been actively involved in ensuring that they develop and deliver services in ways which best meet the needs of all disabled people, including people who are deaf. As the final requirements of the act come in to force in October 2004, further development work is currently in progress. The current development work, which is being carried out in partnership with the Disability Rights Commission, will consider the needs of all disabled people and aims to ensure that it deals with these issues in an integrated way. We are committed to ensuring that responding to the needs of disabled people becomes part of mainstream activity within NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>The Review of the West Edinburgh Planning Framework arises from the UK Government White Paper <em>The Future of Air Transport</em> , and is necessary to accommodate the land use and transport planning issues consequent on the policy for the growth of Edinburgh Airport. It will safeguard land for the development of the airport; help facilitate the relocation of the Royal Highland Centre; and incorporate new rail, tram and road links to improve access and thereby assist development. It will also identify the opportunities once the crosswind runway is no longer operational for development in that area and intensification of development in Edinburgh Park.</p>
