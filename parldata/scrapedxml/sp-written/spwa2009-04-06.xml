  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to ensure that all devolved public authorities settle invoices within 10 days of receipt and whether it will publish performance figures for local authorities, individual departments and agencies.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-04-06.S3W-22008.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80397" speakername="John Swinney" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0406.htm#2">

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to supporting business in the current economic situation by paying bills more quickly. The intention is to achieve payment of all undisputed invoices within 10 working days, across all public bodies.</p>

  <p>The target, and the expectation that they will work towards achieving it in as short a timescale as possible, has been communicated to all bodies. Within the Scottish Government work was quickly put in place, and is continuing, to sustain improved payment performance. Public bodies who do not use the Scottish Government&rsquo;s financial systems are responsible for their own systems and processes and, therefore, for making the necessary changes to ensure that they work towards this target.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Finance Manual has also been updated to reflect the introduction of the target and can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Finance/spfm/payments/paymentsannex1" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Finance/spfm/payments/paymentsannex1</a>.</p>

  <p>As noted in the response to S3W-19759, answered on 29 January 2009, the Scottish Government monitors payment performance on a monthly basis and information is collated by calendar month. The payment performance of the bodies who use the Scottish Government&rsquo;s systems and processes has doubled since the launch of the initiative; for the month of March 2009 payments for 91.6% of transactions were made within 10 working days.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has reported payment performance in response to parliamentary questions and will also report on payment performance in its annual accounts (to be published in September 2009). The Scottish Government does not hold centrally performance information on the bodies who do not use Scottish Government systems and processes. The expectation, however, is that individual bodies can report on their own performance and will do so in their annual accounts.</p>

  <p>All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>Part 8 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 covers the mandatory registration of private landlords. This includes short-term accommodation but not houses for holiday use.</p>

  <p>In addition, Part 7 of the Act provides that a local authority can issue an Antisocial Behaviour Notice on the landlord of a relevant house where the tenant or occupant is engaging in antisocial behaviour.</p>
