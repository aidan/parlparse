  <p>Information on how much is spent by local authorities and NHS boards specifically on rehabilitation for drug problems is not held centrally; it is for local authorities and NHS boards to commission services to meet the needs of the local population.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government allocates funding to NHS boards for drug treatment services, including rehabilitation. Table 1 provides the funding allocations from the Scottish Government to NHS boards for each of the last 10 years. It should be noted, however, that this table does not provide the complete picture of NHS spend on drug treatment and rehabilitation; NHS boards and other local partners are able to supplement these funds to tackle problem drug use, in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p>

  <p>In addition to this investment in frontline NHS drug treatment services, the Scottish Government also provides funding to a number of national organisations with a focus on driving forward the principles of Road to Recovery.</p>

  <p>Local authorities hold data on the amount that they spend on treating adults with addictions and substance misuse problems, this includes (but is not specific to) drug rehabilitation services. Table 2 provides the local authority net revenue expenditure on adults with addictions and substance misuse problems for each of the last 10 years. Care should be taken when comparing some of these totals, as explained in the notes in the following table.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Figures from 1999-2000 to 2001-02 exclude expenditure on addictions and management and support costs and are not comparable with 2002-03 onwards.</p>

  <p>2. When comparing revenue expenditure levels in 2008-09 to previous years, it is important to note that there was a change to the local government funding structure in 2008-09, with the former ring-fenced revenue grants rolled up into General Revenue Funding. As a result of this change, the figures are not wholly comparable.</p>

  <p>3. 2009-10 figures are provisional.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that, in addition to the above, resources for tackling drug misuse are provided through a number of other budgets. In particular, many NHS boards use resources from their unified budget to supplement funds provided through the drug misuse budget; the police use some of their resources towards tackling drug misuse; and further resources, such as those from the budget allocated to dealing with blood borne viruses, are used to deal with the types of problems associated with drug misuse.</p>

  <p>In September this year, with the support of the Scottish Fisheries Council, I published the Four Pillar Plan which provides a strategic framework under which the initiatives we support can be brigaded. The intention of the plan is to provide the means and opportunities to the fishing industry to weather current challenges and also to ensure its resilience in the future.</p>

  <p>The plan aims to:</p>

  <p>Improve the wider framework for European Fisheries Management;</p>

  <p>Manage quota and effort in order to promote sustainability and profitability;</p>

  <p>Maximise the value of the catch; and</p>

  <p>Ensure that we have a resilient fleet crewed by a skilled workforce.</p>

  <p>More than &pound;12 million is now in place to support the new plan, which includes funding for a licence parking scheme, fleet modernisation and work to maximise the value of the catch. Licence parking, for example, provides opportunities for businesses to reduce their operating costs and improve their profitability. A more profitable industry will deliver more confidence in its future, which will encourage new entrants into the industry.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 2009, I announced the formation of the joint industry/government New Entrants Working Group, with a remit to deliver proposals which would enhance and sustain new entrants into the fishing industry. A key recommendation from the working group was that a coherent single career pathway for all new entrants to the catching sector be developed, with appropriate exit and re-entry points depending on an individual&rsquo;s career aspirations.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland officials are providing support to industry training experts and the Maritime Skills Alliance (MSA) sector skills body (which includes Seafish) as they progress work to establish new Modern Apprenticeship (MA) Frameworks for the sea fishing industry in Scotland. The MA framework was last reviewed in 2001 and the qualification no longer has industry recognition as a fit-for-purpose career progression route.</p>

  <p>The first outcome to be achieved has been establishing a Level 2 MA Framework in Sea Fishing in Scotland for the first time. This was approved by the Modern Apprenticeship Group (MAG) in July. This MA framework is, however, an interim solution available only until summer 2011, when the full consultative review of new qualifications for the sector is expected to conclude. This Level 2 MA Framework extends the accreditation of the existing Marine Vessel Support Level 2 SVQ qualification, previously funded through the skillseekers national training programme.</p>

  <p>The review being led by the MSA will see proposals for the development of new generic maritime industry MAs at levels 2 and 3 issued to the Scottish fishing industry stakeholders in November. While the MA frameworks will offer specific pathways for learners to qualify as a fishing deck hands and allow further progression to mate on a fishing vessel, the new qualifications&rsquo; core content structure will have transferability and recognition across all maritime sectors, such as merchant navy, offshore industry support or passenger transport. The timetable for this review in Scotland has a scheduled completion date of spring 2011 for the Level 2 Maritime MA, with the aim that the new qualification will be available to learners from summer 2011. The review into a new Level 3 Maritime MA will conclude later in 2011.</p>

  <p>A three week duration &quot;Introduction to Commercial Fishing Course&quot; (which includes all of the Maritime Coastguard Agency&rsquo;s mandatory safety training) has been developed by the Fish Industry Training Association (FITA) in collaboration with Seafish, as the initial training intervention on a career pathway for new entrants. The Scottish Government supported plans by Seafish to fund a national roll-out of this course in 2010-11, to be delivered via the network of industry-led group training associations (GTAs) which cover the whole of mainland Scotland and the Highlands and Islands. However, the ongoing court action challenging Seafish&rsquo;s right to impose a levy on fish imports has imposed severe financial constraints on the organisation and no funding has been available to support the planned roll-out. The Scottish Government is working with the industry on options to ensure that these courses for new entrants are still available during this period. An exceptional European Fisheries Fund (EFF) bid was made in October 2010 by the GTAs for support which would deliver the running of three courses (in Oban and Eyemouth) before the end of the current financial year.</p>

  <p>Grant aid for capital investment in the fisheries sector is also available under the EFF programme for 2007-13. EFF provides for capital grants to assist across a range of measures including assistance to young fishers (up to 40 years of age), who have worked at least five years as a fisher or have equivalent professional training, to purchase their first full, or part, ownership of an active fishing vessel (subject to eligibility criteria). To date, there have been eight awards made through this initiative.</p>

  <p>Funding for flood risk management is no longer ring-fenced but is included within the overall level of capital support provided to local government. This provides local authorities with the flexibility to allocate the financial resources available to them on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives. In 2010-11 the total capital support from the Scottish Government to Perth and Kinross Council amounted to &pound;17.890 million. The settlement took account of the level of flood risk in the council&rsquo;s area.</p>

  <p>Allocation of capital funding for flood prevention schemes within the overall resources provided to them is therefore rightly a decision for Perth and Kinross Council.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Joint Improvement Team is supporting the development of Telecare services across all 32 health and social care partnerships in Scotland to enhance the delivery of care services to people in their own homes and community settings. It has invested a total of &pound;20 million in the Telecare Development Programme since its launch in August 2006.</p>

  <p>The 2010-11 Telecare allocation of &pound;4 million through the Scottish Government&rsquo;s eHealth programme is helping local care partnerships, including the Scottish Borders partnership, to make further progress in supporting people effectively at home as an alternative to hospital or care home admission.</p>

  <p>Though converging partly with Telecare, Telehealth services focus on addressing clinical remotely using digital technologies and their development is being led by the Scottish Centre for Telehealth, part of NHS24.</p>

  <p>Following the announcement of the UK Government&rsquo;s Spending Review, the Scottish Government is now finalising its own plans. Decisions on funding for Telecare services will be taken in the light of the outcome to be announced to the Parliament later in November 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no functions in relation to the regulation of chiropractors, who are regulated as health professionals by the General Chiropractic Council (GCC), an independent regulatory body. Degree qualification and continuing professional development are both linked with statutory regulation by the GCC. The prime purpose of all such statutory regulation is to protect the public, not to gather an evidence base.</p>

  <p>The GCC sets standards of chiropractic education, conduct and practice, and recognises degree programmes that achieve those standards. It ensures that those who have registered continue to meet the requirements, including those for continuing professional development. It requires chiropractors to practise evidence-based care, which is defined as having three components: best available evidence; the preferences of the patient and the expertise of practitioners. This is reflected in the GCC&rsquo;s Code of Practice and Standard of Proficiency, which can be accessed at:<br /> <a href="http://www.gcc-uk.org/page.cfm?page_id=1550" target="_blank">http://www.gcc-uk.org/page.cfm?page_id=1550</a>.</p>

  <p>Since May 2007, there has been regular discussion and communication between the Scottish Government, the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service on the provision of information to communities to keep children safe from individuals who have convictions for child sex offences.</p>

  <p>Specifically, the Scottish Government has announced the roll out of the Community Disclosure Scheme across Scotland following a successful pilot in Tayside. A multi-agency Project Board chaired by the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland, will oversee the roll-out of the scheme, which will enable parents, carers and guardians to formally register their concerns about a named individual who has contact with their children, and be informed whether that individual has a conviction for sex offences against children.</p>

The discussions have been very productive, and already significant progress has been made on the technical and logistical proposals for the transport of the vessel. There are also exciting possibilities emerging around the cultural links between Scotland and Australia, and those of the Scottish diaspora, directly linked with emigration to South Australia on the vessel.

  <p>The Staff Governance Standard commits NHSScotland employers to ensuring that all staff are treated fairly and consistently and that the minimum standards as described in the relevant Partnership Information Network (PIN) policy are met or exceeded. The PIN policy on tackling bullying and harassment stipulates that NHS boards must have mechanisms of support available to employees who feel they have been the victims of bullying and harassment. Those support mechanisms can include access to confidential contacts and professional counselling. The dignity at work project was also launched early this year to promote a positive working culture and behaviours across NHSScotland and to develop tools and behaviours that will reduce the perceived or actual levels of bullying and harassment felt across the organisation.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-11-04.S3W-36946.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1104.htm#20">

  <p>As of 2 September 2010, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has received a total of 75 reports of suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of HPV vaccine (including Cervarix and brand unspecified reports) from Scotland, covering 106 adverse reactions, which were considered serious by the reporter. These events are listed in the following table below as provided by MHRA. The total number of cases considered serious has decreased from 77 to 75, since two cases were identified as duplicate reports; these have therefore been discounted from the data.</p>

  <p>The number and nature of suspected ADRs received so far is very much in line with what the MHRA expected to receive at this time and no serious new risks have been identified. Following administration of at least 4 million doses across the UK since September 2008, the balance of risks and benefits of Cervarix remains positive.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that such reports do not necessarily mean that the events described were caused by the vaccine. Reporters are encouraged to report suspected ADRs i.e. the reporter does not have to be sure that the vaccine caused the reaction &ndash; a mere suspicion will suffice. Therefore, reports submitted to MHRA may be adverse reactions to the vaccine, they may be related to the process of vaccination rather than to the vaccine itself (e.g. nervousness or anxiety about needles or vaccination); or they may be purely coincidental events that would have occurred anyway in the absence of vaccination (e.g. events due to underlying medical conditions). These events are therefore not a summary of known or proven adverse reactions to the vaccines and must not be interpreted and used as such.</p>

  <p>A list of the recognised side effects is provided in the product information for healthcare professionals (Summary of Product Characteristics) and patients (Patient Information Leaflet) which is available to view at <a href="http://www.medicines.org.uk" target="_blank">www.medicines.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>We recognise the fundamental role that the third sector has in creating a more successful Scotland. We are considering the UK Government&rsquo;s Comprehensive Spending Review and its implications for the draft Scottish budget. We recognise that the current economic conditions place pressures on the third sector but make the third sector all the more important to our communities.</p>

  <p>I had direct discussions with senior representatives of the third sector to inform our plans for the next spending period which will be announced shortly.</p>
