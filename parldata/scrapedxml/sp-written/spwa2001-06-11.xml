  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking forward a broad SEN Programme of Action to support education authorities meet their statutory duty to secure adequate and efficient educational provision throughout Scotland. This includes the provision of Grant Aided Expenditure for Special Educational Needs totalling &#163;178 million in 2000-01 and &#163;192 million for 2001-02, of which Highland Council&#8217;s pro-rata share is &#163;7.4 million and &#163;7.9 million respectively. From April 2000, the Scottish Executive Inclusion Programme is providing &#163;19 million over two years to assist local authorities to include children with SEN, including autism, in mainstream provision. Highland Council will receive a total of &#163;793,112 based on the numbers of pupils aged 2 to 19. In addition, the Executive is providing &#163;5 million per year to local authorities for the development and training of classroom-based staff and trainee educational psychologists working with children with special educational needs.</p>

  <p>New enforcement obligations were introduced for EU Member States last year when the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) scheme of control and enforcement was implemented. The Scottish Executive gained new powers to appoint NEAFC inspectors to enforce regulations in the NEAFC zone. Last year the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency took part in patrols and inspections of vessels involved in the international Atlanto-Scandinavian herring fishery.</p>

  <p>Following the agreement achieved at a NEAFC meeting earlier this year, an area of the NEAFC zone around Rockall was closed to protect haddock. Haddock has thus become a regulated NEAFC resource. SFPA vessels have been carrying out patrols and inspections around Rockall this spring. This represents the Scottish contribution to meeting member states&#8217; enforcement obligations on the high seas. Other member states are enforcing regulations in the Atlanto-Scandinavian herring fishery</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether Grampian Health Board has the lowest level of cancelled operations of all health boards and, if so, why, and whether it will identify any best practice procedures the board employs which other health boards could adopt.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of operations cancelled by NHSScotland is not collected centrally. Data are collected on the number of planned admissions to hospital which are cancelled. Data for the year ending 31 March 2000, the latest period for which data are available can be found on the SHOW website at</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/isd/Scottish_Health_Statistics/SHS2000/M1.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/isd/Scottish_Health_Statistics/SHS2000/M1.pdf</a></p>

  <p>I strongly support the efforts of the NHS to reduce the number of cancelled admissions to hospital and to spread good operational practice. The development of new performance assessment and accountability arrangements for NHSScotland, as described in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> will help encourage continuous improvement in NHS performance through benchmarking, sharing of good practice and publication of performance information.</p>

  <p>The Executive published its consultation paper on 15 December 2000, inviting views on whether, in principle, the Executive should seek to promote legislation to give greater protection to hutters and the detailed provisions required if legislation were to be introduced.</p>

  <p>The consultation closed on 9 March and we received a total of 326 responses, some of which after the closing date. Officials are currently analysing the responses to the consultation and once we have considered all the views of interested parties, we will announce our decision on whether to proceed with legislation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-14328 by Malcolm Chisholm on 4 April 2001, what criteria it used to determine the amount of change funding that would be made available to local authorities to help them implement the recommendations of <i>The Same As You? a review of services for people with learning disabilities</i> and how many transfers of people with learning disabilities from long-stay hospitals to the community this funding will cover in each of the next three years.</p>

  <p>Change funds were set at a level which would make a significant impact over the first three years of a 10-year implementation programme. These funds are only one of the resources available to local authorities to implement the recommendations of the Learning Disability Review.</p>

  <p>The additional funds are intended to enable better use of existing resources and are not specifically intended as a resource for people coming out of long-stay hospitals, although they may contribute. Authorities were provided with a significant uplift in the Grant Aided Expenditure settlement, amounting to &#163;30 million in each year from 2001-02 to 2003-04 to cover, amongst other things, that element.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has already made considerable progress in providing extra resources to Greater Glasgow Health Board in line with the recommendations in the Final Report of the Arbuthnott Committee. In 2000-01 every health board in Scotland has received a substantial increase in its funding of at least 5.5%. Health boards whose share of resources should increase under the Arbuthnott formula have received larger increases in funding. Greater Glasgow Health Board&#8217;s resources have increased by 7.7%, and this means that in the current financial year this board has received an additional &#163;17.45 million as a result of Arbuthnott.</p>

  <p>The indicative allocations which have been issued for 2002-03 and 2003-04 will also provide Greater Glasgow Health Board with additional resources over and above the general increase in funding. In 2002-03, all health boards will receive an increase of at least 6.5%, while Greater Glasgow Health Board will receive an increase of 7.3%. In 2003-04 every board will receive an increase of at least 7.4% while Greater Glasgow Health Board will receive 8.2%. This means that in 2002-03 and 2003-04 Greater Glasgow Health Board will receive an extra &#163;6.769 million and &#163;7.263 million respectively as a result of Arbuthnott.</p>

  <p>By the end of this three-year period, therefore, the total annual increase in healthcare resources for Greater Glasgow Health Board as a result of Arbuthnott will be over &#163;30 million. This is a very substantial additional sum and it reflects our commitment to target resources on areas of need, to improve health and to tackle inequalities in health.</p>

  <p>The information provided in the answer to question S1W-13949 was based on information available as at 31 December 2000.</p>

  <p>Provisional end-year figures indicate that the net overspend of all the NHS Trusts in Scotland taken together as at 31 March 2001 was &#163;400,000. The estimated overspend represents less than 0.01% of estimated income for the year.</p>

  <p>A number of factors, including the additional investment in NHSScotland of over &#163;480 million in 2000-01 and the implementation of financial recovery plans by a number of Trusts, have resulted in this much improved year-end financial position.</p>

  <p>The report by SNH, as reporting body under section 3 of the National Parks (Scotland) Act, was submitted to Scottish Ministers on 19 March. We have considered the report carefully. It has been a very thorough piece of work, involving extensive efforts to ensure a high level of participation. We are satisfied that the reporter&#8217;s conclusions reflect a balanced assessment of the views of consultees and the statutory criteria for designation of a National Park. We are therefore broadly accepting the reporter&#8217;s conclusions, subject to one or two adjustments. On boundaries the most important of these is that we see the inclusion of the area of west Glen Dochart, including Tyndrum and Crianlarich, as providing an important gateway to the northern end of the park.</p>

  <p>We are therefore publishing today a draft designation order for consultation, as required under section 6 of the National Parks (Scotland) Act. This is being made available widely, and copies have been available to the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre. The consultation closes on 21 September, after which the draft order will be amended as required in the light of comments, before the draft order is submitted for approval of the Scottish Parliament in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Under section 5 of the Scotland Act 1998, the provision and regulation of railway services, which includes railway safety, are reserved matters and as such are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. ScotRail is required to meet all relevant GB safety standards, which are monitored by the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive of course recognises that customers have increasing expectations about the quality and comfort of their rail journey. Our consultation paper, <i>Strategic Priorities for Scotland&#8217;s Passenger Railway</i>, emphasised that we will look to train operators to consider a range of service quality improvements as an integral part of any new franchise.</p>

  <p>A planning application for a depot at Lochaber was lodged by BEAR Scotland Ltd on 10 January 2001 and negotiations are continuing with the planning authority. If the planning authority refuses permission, or fails to determine the application within two months, BEAR Scotland Ltd has the option of appealing to the Scottish Ministers. The new operating company has contractual obligations to carry out maintenance on trunk roads from 1 April 2001. Any additional interim arrangements to address this situation are the new operating company&#8217;s responsibility.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the removal of litter from special roads and motorways lies with the Scottish Executive as the roads authority. For all other trunk roads the responsibility rests with the local councils through which area the trunk road passes. These are statutory obligations and there has been no alteration to these requirements as a result of the recent award of the management and maintenance contracts for the Scottish trunk road network.</p>

  <p>The recently awarded management and maintenance contracts contain a provision to require the new operating company to liaise with local councils and to ensure that their policies meet with the requirements of the relevant sections of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 with respect to the trunk roads within the Unit.</p>

  <p>With effect from Monday 11 June, the Finance Group and the Executive Secretariat will be brought together to form a new Department to be known as the Scottish Executive Finance and Central Services Department (SEFCSD).

  <p>From the same date, the Rural Affairs Department will become the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD). No changes in departmental responsibilities or structure are involved, but the new name will reflect ministerial portfolios.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to give details of projected spend for campaigns over the next 12 months as budgets are not held centrally. Throughout any year campaigns can also arise unexpectedly in response to issues (such as the recent foot-and-mouth disease outbreak). It is difficult to gauge levels of spend before detailed discussion takes place on the targets and goals of any campaign as these can dictate the scale of activity and spend. Similar discussions take place in relation to the timing of campaigns.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive measures the success of its advertising campaigns in a number of ways. This can involve baseline research where items such as levels of awareness or behaviour can be measured. When a campaign is completed or throughout longer campaigns the research can be repeated and any shift noted.</p>

  <p>Some campaigns are set specific targets such as the recent flu immunisation campaign where the target percentage of uptake in the over 65 age group was exceeded. Campaigns that have a response mechanism such as a telephone help line are measured by the number of calls.</p>

  <p>At the end of each campaign and during the longer running campaigns, departments monitor systematically the evidence of research and other measurement methods to assess their effectiveness and to alter them as necessary, often setting new goals and targets for the advertising agencies involved.</p>

  <p>Local authorities should collect this information which is not held centrally. In his recently published annual report, based on a round of visits to each local authority, the Chief Inspector of Social Work Services made reference to the fact that social work and social care can be very stressful occupations and that the levels of sickness amongst staff are frequently the highest in the local authority. The Association of Directors of Social Work has produced a management resource pack designed to support frontline staff which, amongst other things, tackles the issue of absences. As a consequence of monitoring and following up, absences have been reduced in some authorities (for example, East Renfrewshire reported reduced levels from 14% to 6%). The Chief Inspector&#8217;s annual report underlines the importance for local authorities of good employment practices as a means of improving attendance levels.</p>

  <p>Information on the related issue of recruitment and retention of staff will be collected centrally for the first time this year by the SEHD Social Work Statistics Division. This will be published towards the end of 2001. The next Chief Inspector&#8217;s annual report also intends to return to the issue.</p>
