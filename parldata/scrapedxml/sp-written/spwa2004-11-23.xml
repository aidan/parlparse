  <p>Of the &pound;60 million made available in 2004-05 and 2005-06, &pound;50 million has been allocated to local authorities to fund community warden schemes, fill gaps in services for victims and witnesses of antisocial behaviour and other practical initiatives at local level, support the creation of proactive antisocial behaviour teams in local authorities, and to help them and their Community Planning Partner prepare local antisocial behaviour strategies. The balance has been earmarked for other purposes that will support the overall delivery of the antisocial behaviour strategy, including training, dissemination of good practice, piloting of new approaches and monitoring and evaluation.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the precise allocation of the &pound;67.5 million available in 2006-07 and 2007-08 will be made shortly but, broadly speaking, this will be used to support the delivery of local antisocial behaviour strategies.</p>

  <p>Since the programme began in September 2001, seven applications for central heating have been unable to proceed due to the refusal of consent from landlords. In order to override their objection to tenants receiving the central heating programme, primary legislation would have to be created to alter landlords' property rights and currently there are no plans to do so.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-11-23.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa1123.htm#4">

  <p>The Lewis Peatlands Special Protection Area (SPA) was classified under the European Council Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409/EEC) on December 7 2000; the site encompasses an area of 58,984.23 hectares.</p>

  <p>The relevant international population by which the importance of any bird species on an SPA can be assessed is expressed in terms of the biogeographic population from which it is drawn or is a part of. A biogeographic population is a group of birds which breed in a particular location (or group of locations), breed freely within the group, and rarely breed or exchange individuals with other groups.</p>

  <p>The qualifying species are &ndash; black throated diver (11 pairs representing at least 6.9% of the GB breeding population and &lt;0.1% of the biogeographical population), dunlin schinzii sub-species (3,650 pairs representing at least 33.2% of the breeding Baltic/GB/Ireland population), golden eagle (six pairs representing at least 1.5% of the GB breeding population and 0.1% of the biogeographical population), golden plover (1,978 pairs representing at least 8.8% of the GB breeding population and 0.4% of the biogeographical population), greenshank (152 pairs representing at least 0.3% of the breeding Europe/Western Africa population and 0.3% of the biogeographical population), merlin (20 pairs representing at least 1.5% of the GB breeding population and 0.2% of the biogeographical population) and red throated diver (60 pairs representing at least 6.4% of the GB breeding population and 0.8% of the biogeographical population).</p>

  <p>The whole of the Lewis Peatlands SPA is not underpinned by Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) notification. However, four SSSIs are contained within the SPA boundary. These are mainly notified for reasons other than the SPA interest and are:</p>

  <p>1. Achmore Bog SSSI (296.73ha. Notified for blanket bog).</p>

  <p>2. Loch Laxavat Ard &amp; Loch Laxavat Iorach SSSI (267ha. Notified for woodland, open waters and breeding bird assemblage).</p>

  <p>3. Loch Nan Eilean Valley Bog SSSI (33.26ha. Notified for blanket bog and valley mire).</p>

  <p>4. Loch Scarrasdale Valley Bog SSSI (218.26ha. Notified for blanket bog and valley mire).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its role is in respect of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme; what costs it has incurred in respect of the scheme; what payments have been made to it in respect of the scheme, and what its powers are with regard to the nomination of members to the scheme and direction in respect of payments.</p>

  <p>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS) is a GB-wide scheme which is administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel (CICAP). Scottish ministers and the Home Secretary have joint responsibility for the scheme but decisions on individual applications rest exclusively with the CICA and ministers cannot intervene in such decisions. Scottish adjudicators are appointed to the appeals panel by the Scottish ministers after consultation with the Home Secretary. The power to amend the scheme rests with the Home Secretary, who is obliged to consult the Scottish ministers before he exercises that function. By way of a service level agreement in place with the Home Office, the Scottish Executive bears a proportion of the costs in respect of Scottish cases, based on the total expenditure on Scottish cases over the previous three years expressed as a percentage of the total GB expenditure for the same period. Over the past few years this has fluctuated between 11-13%. In 2003-04 the Executive&rsquo;s contribution was &pound;25.8 million, consisting of &pound;22.8 million compensation and &pound;3 million administration.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provide drugs specific resources to NHS boards and local authorities for the provision of drug treatment and care services. In Fife for 2004-05 the NHS board received &pound;829,244 for drug treatment services and the local authority &pound;464,000 for drug rehabilitation services per annum. On 27 October 2004, the Minister for Justice announced that an additional &pound;6 million per annum will be available across Scotland to support drug treatment and rehabilitation services from 2005-06.</p>

  <p>Local drug action teams are responsible for the planning and delivery of drug treatment and care services in line with identified local need and in full collaboration with all partner agencies.</p>

  <p>Schemes administered by the Department for Transport and relating to seafarer employment and training opportunities include the Support for Maritime Training Scheme (SMarT) which provides support for the training of officers and ratings. SMarT provided funding for 621 new officer cadets in 2003-04, an increase from 557 in the previous year. 45% of cadets receiving SMarT funding are from Scotland. The tonnage tax features a minimum training obligation which requires each shipping company entering the scheme to recruit and train one officer trainee each year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet, and to give consideration to employment and training opportunities for ratings.</p>

  <p>Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd, which is wholly owned by Scottish ministers, is committed to employee training and development to enable staff to contribute fully to the business and progress as far as possible within the organisation. The company also encourages employees to continue personal and professional training, for which financial assistance may be available. Caledonian MacBrayne has a core base of about 1,200 employees and recruits temporary workers as required on a seasonal basis.</p>

  <p>The <em>Review of Funding of Learners</em> was published on the 22 September 2004. Copies of the Report are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre and it is also available on the Funding of Learners Review website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/ELLD/FoL/00017431/page677853067.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/ELLD/FoL/00017431/page677853067.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>The report presents the findings of the Review <em>of Funding of Learners</em>, the commitment to which was made in the <em>Lifelong Learning Strategy for Scotland</em> published by the Scottish Executive in February 2003. The review&rsquo;s terms of reference focused on identifying gaps and anomalies in the provision of funding to post-16 individual learners and recommending changes that will improve the coherence, equity and effectiveness of overall provision. The review has covered further education student support, higher education student support, education maintenance allowances and individual learning accounts.</p>

  <p>The outputs of the review take the form of a series of action points, the timetables for which are phased from immediate (already undertaken in advance of academic year 2004-05) actions to those to be undertaken in the period through to 2006.</p>

  <p>Further to the answer given to question S2W-1390, Scottish ministers announced in May 2004 that the income threshold for the repayment of student loans would increase to &pound;15,000 (from &pound;10,000) from April 2005.</p>

  <p>No study in these specific terms is currently being undertaken. However, the Executive has commissioned a number of research projects to monitor and evaluate the central heating programme, including its impact on health.</p>

  <p>In the UK mortality increases in winter. International comparisons have shown that Scotland, like the rest of the United Kingdom, has relatively high levels of &quot;excess winter mortality&quot;, even when compared with countries with more extreme winters. Excess Winter Mortality Index (EWMI) figures given by Curwen (1997) showed that &quot;excess winter mortality&quot; in the United Kingdom was approximately double that of Scandinavian and other Northern European countries. However, the EWMIs for the Irish Republic, Spain, Portugal, and Italy were comparable to, or higher than those for the countries of the UK.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no formal role or powers in respect of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The Health and Safety Commission(HSC) and Executive are non-departmental public bodies. The HSC is sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions and is ultimately accountable to the Minister of State for Work, the Rt Hon Jane Kennedy MP. There is a concordat between the Health and Safety Executive and the Scottish Executive which is intended to provide the framework to guide the working relationship between them. A copy can be obtained from the HSE.</p>

  <p>The Home Office have continued to keep the Scottish Executive fully informed about proposals for the introduction of identity cards. During the development of the policy and the drafting of the legislation, Executive officials have had a number of discussions with the Home Office to ensure that the proposed legislation could not, without the express approval of the Scottish Parliament, make it a requirement to use an ID card in order to access devolved services.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers&rsquo; position remains that the ID card will not be required to allow access to devolved public services and the draft bill reflects that position.</p>

  <p>The details are shown in the following table. Many of these hospitals were long-stay mental health and learning disability institutions, which closed because of the emphasis on provision of care in the community. Others were old buildings which were no longer fit for modern health care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided support to the production of biodiesel in Scotland by awarding a Regional Selective Assistance grant of &pound;1.2 million to Argent Energy, which is building the nation&rsquo;s first large scale biodiesel plant at its Scottish base near Newarthill, Motherwell. The grant will be payable in three instalments.</p>

  <p>The plant, which is expected to be functional early in the new year, will produce around 50,000 litres of biodiesel per annum when operating at full productivity levels. The site will also be equipped with an electrical generator fuelled by waste product which is expected to generate between 2.75 and 3 megawatt of electricity per year. The electricity produced will be sold to the National Grid.</p>

  <p>The local government grant distribution methodology has been agreed following extensive and collective consultation over a number of years with local authorities, through COSLA and takes account of a wide range of complex factors influencing local authority spend to ensure a fair distribution of grant. These factors include population, pupil numbers, road lane lengths and indicators of rurality and deprivation. COSLA has not requested any re-examination of the GAE calculation for local roads and in these circumstances the Executive has no current plans to review the funding formula.</p>

<ques id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-11-23.35.q0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80009" speakername="Scott Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab)" spid="S2W-12513" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa1123.htm#23">

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what Sewel motions it will lodge in the Parliament in connection with the legislative programme of the UK Government that is announced today in the Queen&rsquo;s Speech.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-11-23.35.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80022" speakername="Ms Margaret Curran" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa1123.htm#23">

  <p>Under the Sewel Convention, the UK Government does not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. This is an important part of the devolution settlement, signifying respect for the role of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>Within the context of this Convention, the Executive recommends that the Scottish Parliament should consent to legislation at Westminster only when this would deliver clear benefits for Scotland. I am pleased that we have been able to identify and agree specific opportunities for several of the bills within the UK Government&rsquo;s new legislative programme to make beneficial provision for Scotland, on matters that are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament and on matters which relate to the executive competence of the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the Sewel Convention and the procedural undertakings that have been given, we will present the Parliament with a motion and detailed explanatory memorandum in relation to each of those Bills as soon as possible after they are introduced at Westminster, in order to maximise the scope for scrutiny and debate. The bills are:</p>

  <p>the Animal Welfare Bill &ndash; to ensure that people who are banned from keeping animals in England and Wales, following conviction for cruelty to animals there, continue also to be banned from keeping animals in Scotland.</p>

  <p>the Constitutional Reform Bill &ndash; to create a UK-wide Supreme Court, establishing a clear and transparent separation between the judiciary and the legislature.</p>

  <p>the Disability Discrimination Bill &ndash; to put Scotland on the same footing as the rest of the UK on new public sector duty to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people.</p>

  <p>the European Union Bill &ndash; to ensure that the devolution settlement is taken into account in legislation to enable the ratification and implementation in UK law of the EU Constitutional Treaty and to allow a referendum on the Treaty to take place.</p>

  <p>the Gambling Bill &ndash; to modernise powers for Scottish ministers to regulate gambling in Scotland.</p>

  <p>the Inquiries Bill &ndash; to modernise the law for the conduct of inquiries into matters of public concern.</p>

  <p>the International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Bill &ndash; to ensure that the devolution settlement is taken into account in legislation that secures the position of specified international organisations.</p>

  <p>the National Lottery Bill &ndash; to provide power for Scottish ministers to issue directions to the Big Lottery Fund and allow a Scottish Committee to exercise all the functions of the Fund in relation to devolved expenditure.</p>

  <p>the Railways Bill &ndash; to provide greater responsibility for rail within Scotland to the Scottish ministers, including an extended role with regard to infrastructure.</p>

  <p>the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill &ndash; to strengthen the fight against serious organised crime with the creation of a new UK-wide agency and other measures.</p>

  <p>Legislating in this way has a number of benefits for Scotland. For bills (like the Inquiries Bill and the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill) that include provisions on matters that are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, it enables useful provision to be made in areas of mutual interest without delay or disruption to our own legislative programme. For Bills (like the Gambling Bill and Railways Bill) that include provisions that relate to the executive competence of the Scottish ministers, it enables powers and functions to be exercised by the Scottish ministers rather than UK Ministers.</p>

  <p>In order to maximise this potential, we will maintain our dialogue with the UK Government over the coming weeks and months to see whether further opportunities can be identified. If that proves to be the case, we will bring them to the attention of the Parliament as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what representations have been received from the City of Edinburgh Council regarding its allocation of funding under the Supporting People initiative and the impact that the allocation will have on its ability to deliver core support services to vulnerable members of its community.</p>

  <p>We have received representations from COSLA, local authorities including Edinburgh, providers, stakeholders and a range of other organisations and individuals.</p>

  <p>I have met with COSLA on several occasions and listened to their concerns about the allocations announced on 1 October. I have offered to slow down the rate of redistribution to provide greater protection for those councils most affected. I hope to make a new announcement shortly.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware that the proposed reduction in Supporting People funding for the City of Edinburgh Council may jeopardise the council&rsquo;s ability to maintain its rough sleeper initiative and therefore the Executive&rsquo;s commitment that no one should need to sleep rough.</p>

  <p>We are very conscious that the City of Edinburgh Council and providers have concerns about the allocations announced. I have met with COSLA on several occasions to discuss their concerns and have offered to slow down the rate of redistribution with the aim of ensuring that the pace of change and redistribution is manageable locally.</p>

  <p>A new announcement on Supporting People allocations is expected shortly.</p>

  <p>The updated Preliminary Financial Case and the ArupScotland review for both Bills are available on the respective committees&rsquo; webpages and Parliament partner libraries.</p>

  <p>It is understood that the financial models developed by Grant Thornton will be available on the Transport Initiatives Edinburgh website in the course of the week commencing 22 November 2004.</p>
