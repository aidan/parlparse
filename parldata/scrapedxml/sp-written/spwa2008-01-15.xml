  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3O-1612 by John Swinney on 13 December 2007, what section of the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005 provides it with the discretion to apply the judgment on strategic environmental assessments.</p>

  <p>In line with the provisions of the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act (2005), consideration was given to whether the Government Economic Strategy would be the most effective point to conduct a Strategic Environmental Assessment. While there are no discretionary powers for Scottish ministers, the act indicates that, in order to avoid duplication, consideration must be given to whether such assessments should be more appropriately deployed at different levels.</p>

  <p>Duplication would inevitably occur if the Government Economic Strategy &ndash; as a high-level framework - was subjected to a Strategic Environmental Assessment. We have a robust process in place for conducting Strategic Environmental Assessments and this will ensure that assessments are conducted, where required, on the successive sub-strategies and policies which support the Government Economic Strategy&rsquo;s delivery. Ultimately, this will lead to a more meaningful assessment of the individual environmental impacts, rather than the more generic potential impact, of the Government Economic Strategy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is fully committed to ensuring that access to higher education is available to all on the basis of ability to learn rather than ability to pay. There are already a number of access initiatives in place both by individual institutions and collaboratively through the regional widening access forums and other programmes.</p>

  <p>Progress on widening access is measured over time through the Higher Education Statistics Agency&rsquo;s annual performance indicators showing the proportion of students from low participation groups in each higher education institution. Additionally, for the first time this year, the Scottish Government published data on entrants to higher education by areas of deprivation which, over time, will allow us to measure whether there has been any improvement in the figures.</p>

  <p>Development of widening access policy is being driven by the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council following the publication of its <em>Learning for All</em> report in 2005. The council developed an action plan which is reviewed regularly by a National Action Group. The council also holds an annual conference of key stakeholders at which progress is reported and actions for the future are identified. This provides an opportunity to influence the development of widening access policies and priorities.</p>

  <p>All higher education institutions are already involved in work to widen access. The government both supports and expects this. Each institution is active in promoting access initiatives in accordance with its own priorities. Additionally, each institution is represented on its local Widening Access Forum which determines local priorities for collaborative projects to widen participation by under-represented groups of the population.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is fully committed to widening access to all of our higher education institutions for everyone who has the ability to benefit. This is a commitment that is shared by all our higher education institutions and each has programmes and activities to encourage participation by under-represented groups.</p>

  <p>Greater access can be achieved in a variety of ways, through raising aspiration, by outreach to under-represented groups in the population and by creating opportunities for articulation from one level of study to another. There are many examples of widening access activity by individual institutions and by institutions working collaboratively through the Widening Access Forums and other programmes.</p>

  <p>The Homelessness etc (Scotland) Act 2003 incorporates a target that the distinction between homeless households assessed as having a priority need for accommodation and those who are assessed as &quot;non-priority&quot; will be removed by 2012. The Scottish Government is committed to achieving this target.</p>

  <p>If the target is achieved, unintentionally homeless households will generally be entitled to permanent accommodation as defined by the homelessness legislation. Section 32A of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 allows for Scottish ministers to prescribe circumstances in which permanent accommodation need not be provided. These circumstances are currently set out in the Homeless Person Interim Accommodation (Scotland) Regulations 2002. A consultation on amendments to these Regulations will take place later this year.</p>

  <p>The Homelessness Monitoring Group will publish a report on the situation as regards the 2012 target and future capacity for progress later this year.</p>

  <p>The government&rsquo;s legislative programme for future years will be announced in due course. As set out in my answer to question S3O-1344 on 22 November 2008, we have no plans to change the common law on culpable homicide. We consider that the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 address the problem identified by the Transco case. The act sends a robust message to organisations that failures to meet their duty of care to employees and the public will not be tolerated. The act comes into force in April, and our priority is to ensure its successful implementation.</p>

  <p>Living in safe and strong communities is an essential part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s positive vision for Scotland. For too many people that vision is blurred by the fear of crime and intolerance.</p>

  <p>While good government needs a clear vision it must also deal decisively with immediate problems. To do otherwise would compromise public safety. I can therefore confirm the Scottish Government&rsquo;s support for the proposed Sentencing of Offences Aggravated by Prejudice (Scotland) Bill. This will extend statutory aggravations to cover crimes motivated by malice or ill will towards victims based on their sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.</p>

  <p>No one in Scotland should be targeted or victimised because of their sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability. Our clear aim is to prevent and deter crime but where crime does happen we must send a clear signal that it will not be tolerated.</p>
