  <p>The incidence of oesophageal cancer in males in Scotland has risen over the last 10 years, from 13.0 per 100,000 in 1988 to 16.8 per 100,000 in 1997.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health</i> reaffirmed cancer as one of the top priorities for the NHSScotland. The Cancer Strategy for Scotland will set out a comprehensive range of measures designed to provide swifter, better diagnosis, treatment and care together with measures to help prevent cancer from occurring. The results from a CRAG-funded Scottish Audit of Gastric and Oesophageal Cancer will be available by the autumn and will inform further consideration of how best to organise services to improve outcomes for patients.</p>

  <p>We have not conducted a specific audit of respite facilities. However, our policies on a number of fronts emphasise the importance of improving the quality and availability of respite care (or short break services), including our Carers Strategy for Scotland, the Learning Disability Review, the work of the Joint Futures Unit and the package of measures to improve support to people at home announced in Susan Deacon&#8217;s statement of 5 October 2000. We have developed these policies in consultation with users of services and their carers, and their views and experiences of existing services have had a major influence on the directions we are taking. We will be monitoring closely the impact of these policies on short break services in Scotland.</p>

Scottish Borders Council is considering measures to address the deficit it has identified in its education budget.

  <p>I understand that Scottish Borders Council is considering a range of measures to deal with the deficit identified in its education budget. Until this process is complete it will not be possible for the council to state for certain what the impact will be on any specific part of the education programme.

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s support to local authorities for the development of the National Grid for Learning (NGfL) comes through the Excellence Fund. Local authorities are all committing considerable amounts from their own resources to support NGfL developments. The extent of that contribution is a matter for local decision.</p>

  <p>Each authority is entitled to draw its share of the NGfL Excellence Fund programme provided that it has agreed with the Scottish Executive an Improvement Plan setting out how it will work towards the various objectives of the programme, including the target pupil:computer ratios. Money may be vired between Excellence Fund programmes subject to approval by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Money is drawn down twice a year, on certification by council officials that valid expenditure has taken place. Authorities are required to report annually on progress and to notify any significant change from their original Improvement Plans. The Scottish Executive also monitors progress on certain of the NGfL targets though the annual School Census.</p>

The support centres were staffed by officers from the Programme Management Executives and the Scottish Executive and equipped with hardware and software for use by those applicants experiencing system difficulties.

  <p>155 responses were received on the consultation in Scotland. The vast majority of these - over 95% - were critical, or rejected the proposals altogether. There was, however, widespread recognition in the responses that the status quo was not tenable and that action was required both to improve disease control and animal traceability. A number of variants on the proposals and alternatives to them were suggested.</p>

  <p>We have decided that measures in this area will need to be set in the context of a total approach to disease control. Further work is being carried out on the proposals and on the variants and alternatives. The aim is to introduce new arrangements to take over as existing controls are lifted.</p>

  <p>Our policy is to ensure that <u>all</u> staff have the opportunity to contribute appropriately to decision making in NHS Scotland, without favouring one profession over another. That is why we are giving a stronger voice to local staff partnership forums and why we are asking NHS boards to carry out a major overhaul of their area professional advisory committees.</p>

  <p>As part of the new accountability review process, NHS boards will be required to demonstrate that they have involved the relevant professional committees appropriately in strategic and service development issues.</p>

  <p>In addition, we intend to strengthen the role of nurses and midwives in policy development by establishing a new national Nursing and Midwifery Forum, details of which will be discussed with the main professional, academic and staff representative bodies.</p>

  <p>I have today published and laid before the Parliament a further consultation paper, <i>A Modern Complaints System</i> , which sets out detailed proposals for public sector Ombudsman arrangements in Scotland.</p>

  <p><i>Modernising the Complaints System</i> sought views on a wide range of issues which needed to be addressed in framing the Act of the Scottish Parliament which will put in place modern public sector Ombudsman arrangements for Scotland. The ideas discussed in that paper received a very positive response from consultees. The detailed proposals set out in<i> A Modern Complaints System</i> are based on those responses. The responses to this second consultation paper will help to shape the Bill, which I will in due course introduce in this Parliament.</p>

  <p>Ministers remain committed to the promotion of modern government and high quality public services which are open, efficient, accountable and responsive to public need. To achieve this, it is essential that as broad a range of interests as possible is given the opportunity to respond to the consultation. Accordingly, this consultation paper, like the previous one, will be given a very wide distribution. It is also available on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s website.</p>

  <p>I will be writing to each MSP individually, enclosing a copy of the paper and encouraging them to let me have their views on this important subject. Copies of the paper are available from today in the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s reference centre.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what response it has given to the views of the Royal College of Nursing regarding recruitment drives targeted at countries with shortages of nurses and what action it plans to take to encourage NHS Trusts to reduce expenditure on overseas recruitment and increase it on the training of former nurses for re-entry into the profession.</p>

  <p>I have just announced my intention to bring together nursing leaders and education providers for a &quot;summit&quot; on recruitment and retention.</p>

  <p>Recruitment of nurses is a matter for individual NHS Trusts to determine in the light of local workforce planning needs within the overall context of agreed national policy. <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> states that over the next five years 10,000 nurses and midwives will qualify in Scotland - 1,500 more than previously planned.</p>

  <p>We have no evidence of widescale recruitment by NHS Trusts in Scotland of nurses from overseas.</p>

  <p>Vandalism and fires in schools both cause disruption and distress to the pupils and staff affected by them and are matters of serious concern for the education service.</p>

  <p>The recommendations in this report are directed at the local authorities, who are responsible for the management of school premises in their areas. The report quantifies the scale of property related crime problems facing Scotland&#8217;s schools, and it is encouraging that Audit Scotland have found a significant reduction in the cost of school vandalism and fires compared with figures in 1995.</p>

  <p>Local authorities should find the report useful in reviewing the scope for further improvement.</p>

  <p>School vandalism issues need to be considered on a local basis, and measures adopted which are appropriate to local circumstances. There is no single cause of school vandalism and, therefore, there can be no single solution. Education authorities will consider a range of measures appropriate to their assessment of the problem. The installation of closed circuit television is one of a number of such measures which education authorities and schools might consider appropriate in contributing to efforts to reduce the incidence of vandalism at particular schools.</p>

  <p>The experience of school staff and, in particular, the headteacher is valued by authorities. The improvement framework contained in the Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools etc (Scotland) Act 2000 offers an additional means through which the headteacher and school staff can take the lead in school improvement. School vandalism issues need to be considered on a local basis, and measures adopted which are appropriate to local circumstances. The principles of risk assessment and risk management are important factors in addressing them.</p>

  <p>Duties imposed on education authorities for the provision of mainstream education for children with disabilities stem from education legislation, in particular the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and the Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools Etc Act 2000. When commenced, the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2000 will place additional duties on local authorities with regard to equality of opportunity for disabled pupils. The duty to plan to increase access for disabled pupils does not apply to Scotland. Ministers are considering how best to apply a similar duty here.</p>
