  <p>The information is not held centrally. This is a matter for individual local authorities.</p>

  <p>However, the member may be interested to learn that Audit Scotland recently published details of possible fraud on the Blue Badge Scheme in their report on the National Fraud Initiative. As a result of a pilot scheme on data matching with some local authorities, 960 Blue Badges were cancelled, mainly where the holder had died and the badge had not been returned. Audit Scotland have decided to make this a mandatory part of the National Fraud Initiative in order that all local authorities will be involved in the next round.</p>

  <p>The report can be found at:</p>

  <p>One of the first actions outlined in the Refreshed Strategy for Volunteering issued recently to the NHS in Scotland was to review the payment of out of pocket expenses for volunteers. This review is currently in hand and further guidance will be issued on this in due course to ensure a consistent approach across the NHS in Scotland. We are concerned about the impact of rising fuel costs on volunteer drivers, and plan to hold discussions with HM Revenue and Customs on the current tax-free rate, which is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for the overall provision of NHS dental services in the area rests with the NHS board, NHS Lothian. Where a NHS board considers that the existing general dental service is insufficient, the NHS boards can appoint salaried dentists. NHS Lothian already employs a number of salaried dentists and are looking to approve further such posts.</p>

  <p>NHS Lothian received &pound;2.48 million from the 2006-07 and 2007-08 Primary and Community Care Premises Modernisation Programme to develop six dental surgeries in Bonnyrigg which will improve access in Midlothian and new clinical facilities within the Edinburgh Dental Institute will increase service provision and give improved access to patients. The addition of 20 dental chairs represents a 30% increase in capacity. It will assist with management of waiting times particularly in restorative and paediatric dentistry. The projects are due to open in the autumn of this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government have introduced a number of financial measures to improve access to NHS dental services and we are also working to continue to increase the dental workforce in Scotland, including Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made clear our view that the current system of processing grid connection offers needs to change. While responsibility for connections to the transmission network is a matter primarily for the UK government, we are in continuous discussions with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, National Grid and others to ensure that the connection system does not involve unnecessary delays for viable projects. This includes participation in the current review of grid access arrangements.</p>

  <p>Local load and efficiency will be important factors for the grid owners and operators to consider when considering and making connection offers. However, our view is that the connection process needs to give greater weight than at present to factors such as the relevant planning consents being in place and the financial viability of the applicant and their project.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government position remains that it is for NHS boards to determine how occupational health services are provided. Any transition to a shared services model is a journey that needs careful planning and execution, and requires comprehensive understanding of the delivery process including customer requirements and delivery objectives. We understand that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde are continuing with their consideration of these issues, and as no decisions have been taken, it is not possible to offer a view on what the outcome of their deliberations may be.</p>

  <p>Interim guidance on the new definitions and main principles of &quot;New Ways&quot; was issued in March 2005. This guidance was produced by a multi-disciplinary group of the health service - including a GP - and the Scottish Executive Health Department. The main principles of this guidance remain in place today. The guidance stressed the need for NHS boards to ensure that all relevant staff, including hospital clinicians and GPs, were fully informed of the guidance and involved in the issues covered</p>

  <p>I wrote to all GP practices in Scotland in September 2007, to seek general practitioners&rsquo; help in ensuring that patients understood how the new system of defining and measuring waiting times across Scotland would operate. I also indicated that a leaflet had already been issued to general practices to familiarise practice staff with the new approach and to assist them in implementing it, and that NHS boards would be offering training or awareness events.</p>

  <p>I have personally received no complaints from patients or from their representatives about the operation of the New Ways system.</p>

  <p>The number of complaints about waiting times made to NHS boards during the year ending 31 March 2008 will be published by ISD Scotland later this year. This period includes nine months prior to the introduction of New Ways. The first publication of complaints data covering the whole full year will be during 2009. It will not be possible to separate complaints relating to the operation of New Ways from complaints about other aspects of waiting times.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many patients were not added to waiting lists by virtue of being deemed medically unfit and having no clear end date to the condition which would have allowed the referral to proceed; who is responsible for reaching such a conclusion, and whether the patient, appropriate care giver or GP is contacted before removal from waiting lists.</p>

  <p>Information on numbers of patients not added to waiting lists is not available centrally. Published national guidance makes it clear that medically unfit patients should not be added to a waiting list if there is no estimated end date to their unavailability.</p>

  <p>The decision to add a patient to a waiting list or to remove a patient from a waiting list can only be made by the healthcare professional responsible for that patient&rsquo;s treatment. A patient will not be removed from a waiting list if it is clinically inappropriate to do so. The national guidance makes it clear that the patient and the patient&rsquo;s GP should be informed if a decision is made to return a patient to the care of their GP. The GP can of course re-refer the patient.</p>

  <p>The overall aim of the &quot;Better Together&quot; programme is to gather information on the patient experience, which will be used to drive forward service improvements. In the first few years the programme will focus on In-patients, commencing in autumn 2008. This may include general information on patient experience of waiting times. Details are still being developed and have yet to be finalised.</p>

  <p>I have already asked ISD Scotland for a New Ways data quality assurance project to be undertaken. I understand this may include an evaluation of the patient experience based on a random sample of patients from each NHS board. The project is currently being designed and is due to report by October 2008.</p>

  <p>As you will also be aware, the Auditor General for Scotland will also be undertaking a review of how the NHS applies the new system of defining and measuring waiting times.</p>

  <p>As part of its &quot;Leading by Example&quot; programme the Scottish Government is looking to all parts of the public sector to play an exemplary role in pioneering new greener behaviour, including the generation of renewable energy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Futures Trust will introduce innovative and more efficient ways of delivering and funding public infrastructure, and will encourage specifications which ensure that new public buildings are also green public buildings.</p>

  <p>Changes to the Energy Standards of Scottish Building Regulations and SPP6: Planning Guidance encourage the use of renewable energy technologies in new public buildings to meet improved carbon emissions levels.</p>

  <p>We are also promoting uptake by the public sector under the UK Government&rsquo;s Low Carbon Buildings Programme which complements the increased funding under our own renewables grants programme for community projects.</p>

  <p>We are introducing dedicated schools development officers to support the deployment of renewable technologies in Scotland&rsquo;s schools.</p>

  <p>We have also recently widened the Central Energy Efficiency Fund to allow public bodies to invest in renewables as well as energy efficiency.</p>

  <p>Accident statistics are reviewed annually across the entire trunk road network and this forms the basis for the identification of the annual programme of accident investigation and prevention (AIP) works that Transport Scotland carry out to reduce casualty numbers on the trunk road network. To complement this reactive approach, new strategies are being taken forward to remove risk and prioritise initiatives aimed at preventing accidents and mitigating the effects when accidents do occur.</p>

  <p>Work is currently underway on the road improvement scheme at Glenairlie and AIP works are planned to improve safety on the A76 trunk road as follows:</p>

  <p>Mauchline passively safe island trial</p>

  <p>Auldgirth to Skerrington route review - signs, high friction surfacing and lining</p>

  <p>Vehicle activated sign installation - signs at Courthill, Auldgirth, Barburgh Mill and Enterkinfoot</p>

  <p>Skerrington to Dettington roundabout</p>

  <p>Safety fence review.</p>

  <p>AIP works completed in the last year to improve safety on the A76 trunk road are as follows:</p>

  <p>Sanquhar to New Cumnock - signs, high friction surfacing, lining</p>

  <p>Passively safe signposts</p>

  <p>Lincluden Roundabout - signs, high friction surfacing, lining and landscaping.</p>

  <p>The potential to introduce more average speed cameras, and at what trunk road locations, will be informed by an assessment of the A77 average speed camera system.</p>

  <p>The effectiveness of the A77 average speed camera system, installed in July 2005, will be fully assessed once three full years of data is available. A three year period is the norm when considering road safety interventions as it allows a greater degree of statistical confidence in the results.</p>

  <p>Accident statistics for the three year period from July 2005 to July 2008 are expected to be published in October 2008. Full assessment of the A77 average speed camera system will commence after these statistics are published.</p>

  <p>The policy memorandum for the Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill notes that &quot;young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are often deterred from entering full-time education and from continuing in it long enough to reach their full academic potential because of economic hardships they suffer, particularly as a result of the accumulation of debt. The abolition of the GE should therefore be a contributing factor in opening up access to higher education on a more equitable basis.&quot;</p>

  <p>Of those eligible to pay the fee, two-thirds have added it to their student loan, which is part of the accumulation of debt - extrapolating from this we can therefore assume that the abolition will benefit those on low incomes.</p>

  <p>The importance of the whisky/spirits industry to the Scottish and UK economies should not be underestimated. Scottish Government ministers share the concerns of the spirits industry and have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer condemning the recent changes in alcohol duty as not only damaging to Scotland and the UK economy but also a potential blow to international competitiveness of the industry at a time when it has been investing significantly to meet global demand. This is particularly the case with the Scotch whisky industry and the premium products it makes.</p>
