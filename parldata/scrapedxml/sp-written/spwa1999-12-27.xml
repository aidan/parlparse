  <p>I have on-going discussions with the UK Government on the difficulties facing Scottish farmers, as a result of which a number of substantial aid packages have been made available in recent months. I announced on 16 November that a further &pound;1 million would be available for ABIS, over and above existing expenditure of &pound;14.7 million. More generally, and given the severe problems currently faced by farmers in Scotland, I have had no option in drawing up assistance packages but to give priority to those farmers whose income levels are falling, rather than those who would like to invest in new capital projects.</p>

  <p>I am aware of the work of the Ayrshire and Arran Rapid Response Team, which is an excellent example of partnership working between Health Service providers, Local Authorities and other agencies. I stressed the need for effective joint working of this kind at a conference for Local Authority and Health Service leaders last month.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on the current practice of making appointments to the Shrieval bench, whether it will give an assurance that no conversations or discussions with or advice given by Special Advisers to the Scottish Executive have influenced the process of such appointments and what its policy is towards replacing the current appointments system with an open and transparent judicial appointments board.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-12-27.S1W-3254.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa1227.htm#3254">

  <p>All vacancies for Shrieval posts are advertised and applications are submitted to the Justice Department. There are invariably consultations with the Sheriffs Principal and the Lord President of the Court of Session before the First Minister makes recommendations to The Queen. Special Advisers are not involved in the appointment process. Ministers remain committed to a public consultation exercise on the system of recommending the appointment of Judges and Sheriffs. The full implications for judicial appointments more generally, of recent judgements in the High Court dealing with temporary Sheriffs are still being considered and the consultation paper will now be issued in the spring.</p>
