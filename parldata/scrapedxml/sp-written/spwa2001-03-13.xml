  <p>Research commissioned for the joint Scottish Executive and COSLA <i>It Pays to Pay</i> report on council tax collection identified a range of factors which influence the collection rates in Scotland compared with England, including legislative differences. For 2001-02 we have introduced legislative changes to give councils in Scotland the same powers as those available to councils in England to bill earlier and to issue joint reminder and final notices. We are working with local government and other relevant organisations, through the <i>It</i> <i>Pays to Pay</i> Implementation Group, to assist and encourage councils to improve their council tax collection levels and efficiency.</p>

  <p>A draft definition of &quot;vulnerable adult&quot; will shortly be the subject of consultation with relevant organisations in the statutory, voluntary and private sectors. In the meantime, we have decided that Part V criminal record checks on volunteers working with vulnerable adults in the voluntary sector may be carried out without cost to the volunteer or to the voluntary organisation concerned. This will put volunteers working with vulnerable adults on a par with those working with children.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise Glasgow co-funded Social Firms UK&#8217;s annual conference in Glasgow in November 2000.</p>

  <p>It also co-ordinated meetings on behalf of Social Firms Scotland with the Joint Employment Unit/Greater Glasgow Health Board and voluntary sector representatives to develop a proposal to support social firms&#8217; work of job creation. This proposal was approved under the new European Community Initiative, EQUAL, and funding is being provided by Scottish Enterprise.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is dedicated to improving the health of all Scots and, in particular, to tackling health inequalities. <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> , published on 14 December 2000, sets out fully the policy framework which provides the focus for our work to tackle the root causes of ill health. Implementation of these policies at local level will lead to improvements in health with consequent improvements in life expectancy rates for both men and women.</p>

  <p>Greater Glasgow Health Board (GGHB) is involved with partner organisations in a wide variety of initiatives aimed at improving the health of all of its population. Information about the specific actions being taken by the board can be obtained from their Health Promotion Department.</p>

  <p>The Executive has recognised the high levels of morbidity and deprivation in the Greater Glasgow Health Board area in implementing the recommendation of <i>Fair Shares for All</i>. This means that GGHB will receive in 2001-02 an increase of 7.7% in its allocation for hospital and community health services, compared with an average increase of 6.5%.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Director and Chief Executive of Historic Scotland, to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland, an agency within the Scottish Executive, is supporting a number of projects which conserve the built heritage in Kilmarnock and Loudoun. It is providing repair grants for work being undertaken as part of a Townscape Heritage Initiative in Newmilns partly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, as well as providing substantial grants towards the repair of Riccarton Parish Church in Kilmarnock and St Sophia&#8217;s Parish Church in Galston. The agency is also responsible for looking after Rowallan Old Castle which is in the Guardianship of Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>No. Existing criminal law is sufficiently robust and flexible to respond to crimes of violence and incitement to violence. In addition, guidance has been issued that any evidence of religious motivation or hostility should be brought to the attention of the Procurator Fiscal and the court. The court can consider this as an aggravating factor in sentencing.</p>

  <p>The annual allocation to local authorities of consent to incur capital expenditure is a general consent for expenditure on their non-housing capital programmes, including education. The consent is distributed amongst authorities on the basis of a formula agreed with COSLA, and is neither programme nor project specific. Within that framework, it is for East Dunbartonshire to decide on the level of capital expenditure on facilities for the provision of school meals.</p>

  <p>The pensions of retired teachers and their dependants are increased under the powers in the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 and the Social Security Act 1975. Pensions in payment for a year or more will increase by 3.3% from 9 April 2001. Any pension in payment for less than a year will increase by a proportionate amount, depending on the number of months it has been in payment.</p>
