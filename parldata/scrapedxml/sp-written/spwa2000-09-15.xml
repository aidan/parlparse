  <p>We attach importance to the provision and availability of targeted access to capital as part of our enterprise review and our social inclusion strategies. A number of schemes of support are available from the Scottish Executive and through the Enterprise Network. These include, for example, the &pound;12 million Business Growth Fund launched last year to provide loan finance to companies unable to access sufficient support from established sources, and the new Invest for Growth scheme replacing Regional Selective Assistance grant for grants below &pound;100,000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, in partnership with other organisations, also wishes to encourage the provision of and access to finance to enable social economy organisations in Scotland to develop, thereby stimulating enterprise and wealth creation in disadvantaged communities. The model to meet this aim is the Social Investment Scotland Fund.</p>

  <p>Davis, Langdon and Everest, the cost consultants for the Parliament Building project were asked to provide cost estimates for ancillary works. The works covered are: the roadworks within Holyrood Park, the landscaping of the Royal High Playing Fields (including possible acquisition of a small section of the Dynamic Earth site), and the demolition and replacement of the Royal Park Constables Muster room, which are the responsibility of Historic Scotland; and the road and environment improvement works affecting Horse Wynd and Reid&#8217;s Close, which are the responsibility of City of Edinburgh Council.

  <p>Differences in the number of NHS staffed beds per 1,000 population between health boards reflect a number of factors including the healthcare needs of different populations and the fact that some hospitals provide treatment to patients from other health board areas.</p>

  <p>The statutory time limit for commencement of the trial in such cases will be that applying in all other bail cases, namely 12 months from the date of the accused&#8217;s first appearance at court. It is intended that greater priority will be given to such cases, than to other bail cases, in both their investigation by precognition and their allocation to High Court sittings. The date on which the trial proceeds will require to take several factors into account, particularly the state of preparedness of the defence and whether the High Court sitting features other cases with more pressing time-bars.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are required to meet 30% of Mental Illness Specific Grant (MISG) and provision for this is made in the GAE provision for each authority.

  <p>Voluntary organisations make applications to local authorities for MISG for individual projects. Figures about projects whose applications have been unsuccessful due to financial constraints are not available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides 70% of Mental Illness Specific Grant (MISG) grant with the remainder being met by local authorities from their GAE provision.</p>

  <p>MISG was introduced for 1991-92 at &pound;3 million (&pound;0.9 million provided by local authorities). This was increased to &pound;6 million (&pound;1.8 million) in 1992-93 and then to &pound;10 million (&pound;3 million) the following year. Total grant was increased again to &pound;14 million (&pound;4.2 million) in 1994-95 and finally to its current level of &pound;18 million (&pound;5.4 million) in 1995-96.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to increase the level of Mental Illness Specific Grant in the current year. The level of funding available for 2001-02 onwards will be determined in light of the outcome of the Spending Review.</p>

  <p>The allocation to local authorities for social work increased from &pound;1,010 million in 1997-98 to &pound;1,050 million in 1998-99 and to &pound;1,101 million in 1999-2000. It is for authorities to determine what should be allocated to services for people with mental health problems.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Short-break services (respite care) are usually provided to the cared-for person rather than their carer, although carers undoubtedly benefit from such services. Under the Strategy for Carers in Scotland, however, &pound;10 million has been earmarked this year for local authorities to provide services to support carers, including short-break services. This should lead to a real increase in support for carers, including those caring for relatives or friends with mental health problems.</p>

  <p>I have also made &pound;200,000 available this year to the voluntary sector to help implement the strategy. This will help carers&#8217; groups across Scotland to access and share information on services. It will also help empower carers in consultations with health and social services on the planning and development of local services to meet their needs.</p>

  <p>I refer to my answer to question S1W-8805 on 21 August 2000. A single Public/Private Partnership contract for the M77 and the Glasgow Southern Orbital could only proceed if East Renfrewshire Council and South Lanarkshire Council are able to complete the statutory procedures for the Glasgow Southern Orbital. The current programmes for the Glasgow Southern Orbital and the M77 extension between Fenwick and Malletsheugh will permit construction of a combined scheme in line with the timetable for the M77 which I published last November in <i>Travel Choices for Scotland: Strategic Roads Review</i> .</p>
