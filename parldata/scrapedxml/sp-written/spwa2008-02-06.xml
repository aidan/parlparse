  <p>Funding allocations were not calculated with specific reference to adoption services within grant aided expenditure for these years. Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources to this area, the specific amounts allocated to local government under the more general heading of Casework and Related Administration &ndash; Children, which would include adoption services, were as follows:</p>

  <p>2005-06: &pound;71.5 million</p>

  <p>The Curriculum for Excellence comprises a series of learning outcomes and experiences; many of which support financial capability. It is for local authorities to determine how to deliver Curriculum for Excellence and to seek contributions to that from local organisations including credit unions. Although the credit union movement has not been consulted directly about the Curriculum for Excellence, a number of credit unions successfully run a junior savers programme aimed at not only providing a saving function for children but also to provide a level of financial education to both the children and their parents both within and outwith a school setting.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers, subject to the approval of the Scottish Parliament, are free to allocate the available budget in whatever way they see fit. Ministers, from the present and previous administrations, have therefore made their decisions on the basis of what is best for Scotland, irrespective of the way in which budgets have been allocated in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>If the Department for Transport were to make changes (increases or decreases) in the level of fuel duty support, that would affect the budget available to Scotland, as calculated through the Barnett formula. It would be for ministers, taking account of the net change in the total Scottish budget, to decide which Scottish budget lines should be amended, and to ask Parliament to approve the relevant budget amendments.</p>

  <p>There are no local targets for onshore wind farm developments. Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 6, Renewable Energy confirms that the target for the percentage of Scotland&rsquo;s electricity to be generated from renewable sources should not be regarded as a cap.</p>

  <p>Development plan policies for wind farms should be based on the principle that wind farms should be accommodated where the technology can operate efficiently and environmental and cumulative impacts can be addressed satisfactorily.</p>

  <p>Each application for a wind farm is determined on its own merits. Scottish Planning Policy 6 Renewable Energy provides that consideration should include a wide range of factors including impacts on landscape, communities and tourism, and cumulative impacts of other proposals which have been built, given permission or are the subject of a valid application.</p>

  <p>Under planning legislation there are no powers to prevent planning applications being made. However, the preparation of up-to-date policies by planning authorities which reflect Scottish Planning Policy 6 Renewable Energy should provide greater certainty for developers and local communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that Scottish Planning Policy (SPP6) Renewable Energy provides a sound national policy context for addressing onshore wind development. We want to see the SPP&rsquo;s provisions taken forward urgently, with local authorities engaging with communities and other parties in the preparation of locational strategies in the form of supplementary planning guidance. These local frameworks should provide greater certainty for developers and local communities and speed up the decision process. We see this approach as striking the right balance between national and local responsibilities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides funding to Road Safety Scotland for the development of key road safety education initiatives and publicity messages. Road Safety Scotland&rsquo;s business plan for 2007-08 does not include plans for a campaign on the dangers caused by diesel and oil spills.</p>

  <p>In deciding its priorities for publicity campaigns, Road Safety Scotland concentrates on known major causes of road deaths and serious injuries, such as speeding, drink driving and seat belt use.</p>

  <p>Out of a total of 13,109 injury accidents in Scotland in 2006, there were 81 accidents, including one fatal, in which the presence of oil or diesel on the road was recorded. This represents 0.6% of injury accidents.</p>
