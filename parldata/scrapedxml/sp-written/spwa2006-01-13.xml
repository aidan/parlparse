  <p>Representatives from Western Ferries discussed their proposals for a Users Charter for the Gourock to Dunoon route with Scottish Executive officials at meetings in June, July, November and December 2004. Representatives from Argyll and Bute Council attended the meeting in November 2004. The issue was also discussed at a meeting between the then Minister for Transport and Western Ferries in August 2004 and I was briefed on the background when I met the company in September 2005. All of these meetings took place in Edinburgh. Discussions on this issue at these meetings were brief and were overtaken by the Executive&rsquo;s proposals to seek an operator willing to provide a service between Gourock Pier and Dunoon Pier on a commercial basis. The Users Charter proposals were not therefore developed to a stage where any decisions, actions or conclusions on this issue were relevant in moving matters forward.</p>

  <p>Such a procedure would constitute an assault under the common law of Scotland. Whether this procedure would constitute the crime of torture would depend upon the status of the person committing the offence. Torture is a criminal offence in Scotland in terms of section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Under this section, the offence of torture occurs where the offence is committed by a public official or a person acting in an official capacity.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any views on the advice given to the All-Party Group on Extraordinary Rendition at Westminster by the Centre for Human Rights and Global Justice of New York University School of Law that &quot;seemingly innocuous acts (e.g. allowing refuelling at airports of aircraft of another state) can become wrongful under international law if those acts facilitate Extraordinary Rendition&quot; in respect of the allegations that US agencies have been using Scottish airports for these purposes.</p>

  <p>The control of flights in and out of Scotland is a reserved matter. Under international law the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation entitles foreign civil aircraft to make technical stops, for example for refuelling, without requiring the permission of the state in which they stop.</p>

  <p>If the police receive specific information that crimes are being committed in Scotland they will be responsible for conducting an investigation into these offences. To date, no specific, credible allegation has been brought to the attention of the police that the &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; of any individual has been unlawfully facilitated through a Scottish airport.</p>

Latest Scottish Arts Council reports indicate that YMI opportunities are encompassing a variety of musical instruments, including the voice, and are taking place in one-to-one and group sessions. The Scottish Arts Council is shortly to commission independent research to evaluate the effectiveness of the Youth Music Initiative since its inception in 2003.

  <p>Additional specialist instrumental tuition is often available to school pupils. The application and level of charges are matters for individual education authorities. However, those councils operating a charging system normally offer concessions to pupils whose families are of limited means.</p>

  <p>The Executive has set up a &pound;5 million trust fund, known as the Dewar Arts Awards, to support exceptionally talented young people across the arts in Scotland who have limited financial resources. The awards, administered by the Scottish Arts Council, are designed to support talented young people who are hampered in making further progress due to lack of funds.

  <p>Data about personal injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. The following table gives the numbers of road accidents which were identified in these returns as occurring on the specified sections of the A811 from 1995 to 2004, and the associated numbers of fatalities.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given below are based upon the data which are held in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s road accident statistics database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authorities would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether local authorities will be penalised if they fail to achieve the target to recycle 25% of municipal waste by 2006.</p>

  <p>The 25% recycling and composting target by 2006 is a Scotland wide target, not an individual local authority target. As the latest figures from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency show, we are making good progress. The Landfill Allowance Scheme imposes limits for each authority on the amount of biodegradable municipal waste they can landfill and penalties can be imposed on authorities that breach these limits.</p>
