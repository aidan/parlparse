  <p>The review of the children's hearings system is being launched today with the publication of the review consultation pack, <em>Getting it right for every child</em> .</p>

  <p>This fulfils a commitment made in the Partnership Agreement to &quot;review the children's hearings system to develop and improve the current service.&quot;</p>

  <p>Ministers recognise the strengths of the current system, with its child-centred approach, its involvement of local people and its focus on the care and welfare of young people, and want to hold on to those fundamental principles. However, it is now time to look constructively and critically at how the system is operating to make sure that it is relevant and effective in the years ahead.</p>

  <p>The review will have two phases. Phase 1, which will run until 21 July, will consider the principles and objectives of the hearings system and what the hearings system should be achieving for vulnerable children. It will invite suggestions for changes and improvements.</p>

  <p>Phase 2, commencing autumn 2004, will be concerned with the more detailed measures needed to implement the changes identified and agreed from phase 1.</p>

  <p>Copies of the consultation pack have been placed in the Parliament's reference centre (Bib. number 32458).</p>

  <p>There is no definition of a rural school in education legislation.</p>

  <p>For various statistical purposes, the Scottish Executive classifies settlements of 3,000 or less people to be &quot;rural.&quot; That core definition is further refined by reference to settlements based on the 3,000 and 10,000 population thresholds. Settlements of less than 3,000 people and within 30 minutes drive of a settlement of 10,000 or more are classified as &quot;accessible rural&quot;; settlements of less than 3,000 people and more than 30 minutes drive to a settlement of 10,000 or more are classified as &quot;remote rural.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is for education authorities to consider the pattern of school provision within their areas. The extent to which authorities may have decided either not to propose the closure of certain schools, or not to proceed with certain closure proposals which they may have made, and the reasons for such decisions, are matters for the authorities themselves.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to the provision of public services that are of the highest possible quality, for both urban and rural areas. The community planning process is ensuring that services are planned in partnership, through community engagement, which leads to improved provision. The Scottish Rural Partnership Fund provides financial assistance to rural communities to develop and improve local services. In rural areas, this is leading to joined up services which are more accessible and which better meet local needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to maintaining strong, prosperous and growing communities in rural Scotland. Whilst the Environment and Rural Affairs Department coordinates rural policy, the activity to deliver this commitment is undertaken by a wide range of departments and agencies. The <em>Rural Scotland: Taking Stock</em> report published in March 2003 outlined the many steps the Executive is taking to deliver benefits for rural communities. We shall be publishing later this year another report on progress towards delivery of the Executive's rural commitments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has committed significant resources to the implementation of the recommendations in the Expert Panel on School Meals' report, <em>Hungry for Success. </em> This includes encouraging the serving of larger portions of more nutritious food, such as fresh fruit and vegetables. The Executive has also committed additional funds of &pound;2 million over three years to provide all pupils in primaries 1 and 2 with one piece of fruit three times a week.</p>

  <p>Individual education authorities are responsible for implementation, and have been offered an additional &pound;57.5 million over three years to deliver initiatives under <em>Hungry for Success</em>. There are positive signs of progress by authorities.</p>

  <p>The school estate strategy, developed jointly by the Scottish Executive and COSLA in 2002, recognises that all schools make an important contribution to the wider community. They potentially provide a real or potential resource for the community, for example, offering opportunities for life long learning, culture, recreation and sport. Schools will serve a number of different communities &#8211; of place, of interest &#8211; each with differing needs. In developing local solutions to best meet local needs, authorities will have to balance competing needs and take account of the community plan.</p>

  <p>There have been a number of developments to support school leavers at risk of not entering education, employment or training, such as the delivery by Careers Scotland of new key worker services; investment in training and development and the new BRITE initiative at Stevenson College to build capacity across the further education sector, and the development of Get Ready for Work, the new national training model for 16- to17-year-olds who require additional support. In addition, 12 local authorities are acting as pathfinders in the delivery of post-school psychological services over the next two years.</p>
