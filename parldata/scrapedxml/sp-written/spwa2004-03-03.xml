  <p>The Scottish Executive issued guidance (CCD 2/2003) in March 2003 to local authorities, NHSScotland and the voluntary sector advising on new legislative measures to support unpaid carers contained in the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002. A fundamental principle underpinning the act and its associated guidance is that carers are key partners in the provision of care and as such need resources to help them in their caring role. Resources can include practical support or training. It is up to local authorities and health boards, working in partnership with local carers, to agree the provision of support services for carers. I understand that some Princess Royal Trust Carer Centres, which receive funding from local authorities and health boards, are already conducting local training of carers in moving and handling techniques.</p>

  <p>Outreach centres for dental student training should allow an alternative training experience. This would preferably be an experience which is different from the base dental hospital. Students using such centres could learn and develop in either a clinical or non-clinical environment.</p>

  <p>Our vision of the Aberdeen centre is in development with Grampian Health Board but should include significant clinical facilities where students could offer patients the full range of clinical treatment.</p>

  <p>We are encouraging Grampian to view this as primary care oriented outreach facilities to complement the skills developed in dental hospitals.</p>

  <p>The Irish Presidency presented its work programme for the first half of the year. Their general priorities were enlargement, simplification and enhancement of food safety.</p>

  <p><strong>On agriculture</strong>, the Council noted progress on technical level discussions preparatory to political discussion at the April Council on the proposals for a regulation on the protection of animals during transport. During discussion, the UK supported the need for an early agreement.</p>

  <p>The Council took note of a report from the Commission on its public hearing on 22 January 2004 on organic food and farming. This is preparatory to the tabling of an action plan by the Commission to the Council later in the Irish Presidency.</p>

  <p>The Council noted a report from the Greek Minister about severe weather conditions in Greece affecting agriculture, and the sympathetic response from the Commission. Greece and the Commission will pursue the assessment of this situation bilaterally.</p>

  <p>The Council also noted a presentation from the Commission on its proposals for the agriculture, rural development and fisheries elements of the financial perspective.</p>

  <p>Under any other business, the Council noted a written report on BSE and reports from Commissioner Byrne on the current situation in regard to Avian Influenza in Asia and a recent outbreak in the US. Commissioner Byrne notified the Council that acting under comitology procedures, the Commission was to introduce a ban on the importation of live poultry and certain products from the US. The Council also noted a report from Spain and Portugal about the high level of feed grain prices and indications from Finland and Sweden that there remained supplies of oats which could be used.</p>

  <p>The Council noted information from Italy and Portugal with support from other wine producing countries about recent changes made to the use of traditional terms for wine imported from third countries; and also that the Commission had explained these changes were necessary to take account of recent discussions at World Trade Organization level.</p>

  <p>Information from France about the low level of milk prices was noted. A wide range of views were expressed in subsequent discussion, the UK making the point that a fall in milk prices was to be expected as a result of the changes agreed last June. Farmers would, however, get compensation through direct payments which would be introduced shortly. The Commission undertook to produce an analysis of the situation with assistance from the member states.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Commission amplified the terms of a letter which it had recently sent to all member states about the single farm payment to explain that it was making the point that member states which chose to operate on regional or hybrid models would need to justify this decision to the Commission, as will be clarified in the Commission implementing regulations. This was noted by the Council.</p>

  <p><strong>On fisheries</strong>, the Council agreed by a qualified majority a regulation providing for tariff quotas for the importation of certain fishery products. The UK supported the proposal.</p>

  <p>The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) publish performance indicators for all UK higher education institutions (HEIs) annually. The latest figures show that 10% of full-time first degree entrants to Scottish HEIs in 2000-01 failed to continue after their year of entry.</p>

  <p>The mechanisms in place to support students to the successful completion of a higher education qualification are the responsibility of HEIs themselves; these are supported through Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) grants for teaching and learning. The nature of these support mechanisms is not determined by SHEFC, as they are based on the local circumstances and priorities of the institution in question. However, SHEFC introduced its Widening Access Premium in 2001-02 in order to support institutions in improving the retention and progression of students from under represented areas. The total allocated to the sector through this grant in 2003-04 is &#163;4,236,000.</p>

  <p>In August 2003, the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) published performance indicators charting the achievements of Scotland&#8217;s 46 further education colleges, in relation to the academic year 2001-02. The performance indicators show that 85% of students staying at college beyond the first quarter of their course completed their programmes.</p>

  <p>The performance indicators enable individual colleges to benchmark their own achievement against that of other colleges and thus lead to quality improvement. SFEFC recently consulted on proposals for its future approach to quality improvement and assurance. SFEFC has agreed to proceed with changes to achieve a differentiated review model, with greater emphasis on the effectiveness of student learning. A working group has been set up to manage the detailed development of the review methodology.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>As set out in section 7 of the Pathfinder Inspection Report, the Executive&#8217;s concern in relation to this issue is primarily about the weaknesses in management information available from the local authority. This meant that the local authority was not able to provide reliable information to Communities Scotland Inspectors showing what outcomes were being achieved for homeless people applying to the council for housing. These weaknesses also meant the local authority could not clearly demonstrate whether it was achieving its own quota for allocations to homeless people.</p>

  <p>In the answer given to question S1W-24583 on 28 March 2002, I undertook to continue to report quarterly on the numbers of letters received by ministers and our performance in answering them. This is the third quarter in which I am reporting performance on letters only and not invitations.</p>

  <p>In the quarter October to December 2003, 2,706 letters were received for ministerial reply of which 75% received a reply within 17 working days, and 89% received a reply within 25 working days. In the same period ministers received 589 invitations.</p>

  <p>All costs are excluding VAT. The January figure includes &#163;69,470 of transfer costs as the line was transferred from Essentia to NHS24 on 6 January 2004. We expect the costs to drop significantly now.</p>

  <p>We expected call traffic to fall off when the main advertising ceased in October. The TV adverts have hit home &#8211; recording 80% awareness levels in the general population at the start of the campaign and 76% before advertising ceased in October (NHS Health Scotland Communications Tracking Survey (BMRB International)).</p>

  <p>If we are to bring about cultural change in our diets we must empower the people of Scotland to make healthier choices. The healthyliving advice line and website are a way of sharing information and building skills and confidence.</p>

  <p>The success of the healthyliving initiative will not be measured simply by the number of calls to the line or hits on the web. Many people will have made changes to their diet and lifestyle without having used the helpline or web site.</p>

  <p>Success will be measured over time by whether we improve our health by eating the right foods and adopting a more active lifestyle. We implore all sections of Scottish society to take a broad view of the wide range of actions that are required to achieve success.</p>

  <p>Data is not available on the number of physiotherapy places offered.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council funds student places through 13 funding subject groups including the other health and welfare category, from which physiotherapy places are funded. The council does not allocate places or funding to specific courses within funding subject groups, which is at the discretion of higher education institutions (HEIs).</p>

  <p>Correspondingly, there is no fixed level of course places for physiotherapy, as HEIs have the flexibility within the broader subject group to increase the level of provision for specific courses, reflecting demand in any particular year.</p>

  <p>The amount of student loan that a graduate repays each month and the period of time over which repayments are made are linked to the level of the borrower&#8217;s income and the amount borrowed. Under the support arrangements introduced in 2001-02, many students who will be liable to pay the endowment when they graduate will have been eligible to receive the Young Students Bursary in place of part of their loan entitlement. Most liable graduates will have borrowed less under these arrangements than they would have had under the previous system. No student should have borrowed more.</p>

  <p>Any costs incurred by the Student Loans Company (SLC) are met on a proportional basis by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government and the devolved administrations, based on the numbers of borrowers who were domiciled in each country when they received their loan and value of those loans. Any additional development costs incurred by SLC as a result of policy changes by one administration are generally met by that administration.</p>

  <p>While costs incurred by SLC have financial implications for student support budgets they do not have any direct effect on students. Student loan borrowers only begin to repay their loans when they have left full-time education and earn more than the specified income threshold. The amount to be repaid is uprated by inflation to ensure that it is the same, in real terms, as the amount borrowed.</p>

  <p>In July, 1999, the Scottish Executive commissioned an independent committee of inquiry, headed by Mr Andrew Cubie, to conduct a comprehensive review of student finance, which in turn commissioned research to inform its report. Since then the Scottish Executive has not conducted research specifically on the effects of tuition fees and the graduate endowment scheme on attitudes towards study in further and higher education. However, the Executive continues to make use of work conducted by academics and other researchers in the field of further and higher education regarding student finance and possible barriers to participation. We also maintain close links with officials in DfES.</p>
