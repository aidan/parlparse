  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to the return of the former air route development fund in light of the decision by the Cyprus Tourism Organisation to introduce a European Commission-approved air route development scheme.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to resurrect the air route development fund in light of the approval of the Cypriot Tourism Organisation (CTO) scheme. The CTO scheme was approved under the framework of the EC guidelines on start-up aid to airlines. We do not believe that the guidelines would allow a level of support which would materially influence airlines&rsquo; decision-making processes. In addition, the Cypriot scheme is limited to the development of routes from only three EU member states. We will, however, monitor the outcome of the tendering process by which the CTO is awarding aid.</p>

  <p>Employment is an issue reserved to the UK Government who have introduced a range of new initiatives over the last 12 months.</p>

  <p>However, in addition to this, 13 Community Planning Partnerships in Scotland were awarded &pound;38.6 million in European Social Fund (ESF) and &pound;11.2 million in European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in 2008 grants to support more people in target areas to move towards, and into, sustained employment over the two years to 2010.</p>

  <p>In April this year, the eligibility rules for Training for Work (TfW), the Scottish Government&rsquo;s vocational skills programme for the unemployed, were changed to allow access to the programme when people reach the three month unemployed stage &ndash; previously they had to wait for six months. Lone parents, those with disabilities and those recently made redundant are among specific groups who already have immediate access to the programme.</p>

  <p>An additional 3,150 TfW training places will be available in the coming year following an award of almost &pound;3 million ESF money in June of this year.</p>

  <p>None. Whether or not to have an independent audit of its management system to confirm that it conforms, for example, to ISO 9001 or ISO 14001 is a decision to be taken by a business against a range of factors. These might include if implementation of ISO standards is a contractual, regulatory or market requirement, to meet customer preferences, or if the business thinks it will motivate staff by setting a clear goal for the development of its management system.</p>

  <p>The best reason for wanting to implement ISO standards is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of company operations. A business can implement ISO standards without seeking certification; such certification of a management system is not always an ISO requirement.</p>

  <p>This application was notified to Scottish ministers on 30 March 2009 and, after careful consideration, was cleared back to Glasgow City Council on 28 April.

  <p>Scottish ministers are unable to provide the requested information as outline planning permission was granted by Glasgow City Council. In reaching a decision, on 9 October 2008, to clear the application back to the city council to deal with, Scottish ministers did not specifically consider the advantages to bus users. Their focus was on the broader issue of whether there were matters of genuine national interest that would warrant their intervention. Scottish ministers are aware that there are conditions attached to the outline planning consent which require that the final design of the bus station is acceptable to Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT), as bus station operator, and meets current and future operator and passenger requirements.</p>

  <p>Aileen Campbell (South of Scotland) (SNP): To ask the Scottish Executive whether the development or protection of orchards is covered by planning guidance or legislation.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-08-13.S3W-26125.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0813.htm#7">

  <p>Although orchards are not specifically highlighted, National Planning Policy Guideline 14 states that planning authorities should seek to protect trees, groups of trees and areas of woodland where they have natural heritage value or contribute to the character or amenity of a particular area. Planning authorities may therefore identify orchards in their development plans as areas to be protected from development.</p>

  <p>Section 159 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 (as amended by the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006) requires both Scottish ministers and planning authorities to ensure that wherever possible provision is made for the preservation or planting of trees when granting planning permission. If the orchard is in a conservation area or protected by a Tree Preservation Order, then the 1997 Act provides further legal protection. A commercial orchard may be classed as an agricultural use and the establishment or alteration of such may not require planning permission, under the terms of Section 26 of the Town and Country (Scotland) Act 1997. The decision on whether planning permission would be required rests with the relevant planning authority.</p>

  <p>An energy infrastructure requirement assessment is currently being undertaken by Scottish Enterprise, working closely with Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) and Scottish Development International. This will go a significant way to identifying the current availability of infrastructure for renewable energy projects in the Pentland Firth and beyond. HIE is working with many of the developers who are currently bidding for sea bed leases in the Pentland Firth.

  <p>To date, the Scottish ministers have complied with the provisions and requirements of the European Habitats Directive.</p>

  <p>The Habitats Directive was implemented in the UK by the Conservation (Natural Habitats etc) Regulations 1994 as amended. Regulation 48(1) and (2) make it clear that the point at which the competent authority requires to make an appropriate assessment, if necessary, is before deciding to undertake or give any consent, permission or other authorisation for a project. It is clear from Regulation 48(2) that it is as part of the statutory consent process that this procedure must be followed through.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers have not yet taken a decision to proceed with the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route. Such a decision will only be taken following consideration of the reporters&rsquo; report, based upon the evidence heard during the public local inquiry.</p>

  <p>As a decision has not yet been taken whether to proceed, the competent authority has not yet carried out the appropriate assessment in respect of the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route. However, the advice of Scottish Natural Heritage, who are the statutory nature conservation advisor to the Scottish Government, indicated that, on the basis of the information provided and appraisal carried out to date, that if the proposals are undertaken strictly in accordance with specified conditions, the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route will not adversely affect the integrity of the River Dee SAC (Special Area of Conservation). The advice provided by Scottish Natural Heritage was lodged as a document during the public local inquiry, a copy of which is available at:</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland&rsquo;s consultants have prepared a report to inform an appropriate assessment (RIAA) of the impacts of the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route on the River Dee SAC. The approach taken to completion of the RIAA was set out in consultation with Scottish Natural Heritage. A copy of the RIAA is available from the inquiry website at:</p>

It is clear from Regulation 48(2) that it is as part of the statutory consent process that this procedure must be followed through.</p>

  <p>In terms of Article (6)(3) of the Habitats Directive, the principal issue to be considered in the appropriate assessment is whether or not the project in question will adversely affect the integrity of the site. Only if a negative conclusion is reached in relation to that test, or there is uncertainty as to whether or not there would be an adverse effect on the integrity of the site, is it necessary to proceed to the considerations in Article 6(4). It is in that context that guidance from the European Commission suggests that it is necessary to consider whether the option put forward for approval is the least damaging for habitats, species and the integrity of the site and that no other feasible alternative exists that would not affect the integrity of the site.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland&rsquo;s consultants have prepared a report to inform an appropriate assessment (RIAA) of the impacts of the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route on the River Dee Special Area of Conservation (SAC).

  <p>Throughout the scheme development process consultation took place with a wide range of statutory and non-statutory bodies, seeking comment on various issues, including inter-alia, carbon impact and impact on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

  <p>During the public consultation held in spring 2005 the public were invited to make comment on any issues, including inter-alia, carbon impact and impact on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

  <p>The publication of draft orders in December 2006 and September 2007 marked the start of formal statutory consultation periods in respect of the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Trunk road and motorway schemes currently under construction have not been included as final outturn construction costs are not known until scheme completion.</p>

  <p>2. Total scheme cost includes all preparation costs, land costs, construction costs and VAT where applicable. It should be noted that land costs are still subject to negotiation following construction of a scheme. Where final outturn land costs have not been established for the schemes listed, estimated outturn land costs have been used.</p>

  <p>3. Privately financed projects and junction improvements constructed over the past 10 years have not been included.</p>
