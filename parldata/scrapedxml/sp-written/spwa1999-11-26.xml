  <p>Information concerning the number of foster carers who have ceased fostering over the last three years and the reasons for their decision is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, findings from a two-stage study on foster care in Scotland funded by Government over 1996 and 1997 noted that 155 carers (7% of all carers) ceased fostering in the period 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997. Almost 60% of those who left did so because of dissatisfaction with some aspect of the fostering services. For those who were dissatisfied, the decision was a combination of four main interacting factors: past history of unresponsiveness and unavailability of social work support; the child being more difficult than expected; unresponsiveness of social workers to requests for help and support during a recent crisis; and impact of fostering on own family. The rest left for other reasons including retirement, illness or moving house.</p>

  <p>New carers recruited during the same period exceeded losses by 6%.</p>

  <p>Sexual health, including the reduction of teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, is a priority for the Scottish Executive. The White Paper <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> emphasised the need for a comprehensive approach, which placed sexual values and relationships within a legal and ethical framework. The demonstration project &quot;Healthy Respect&quot;, being funded by the Executive, will therefore develop best practice in the promotion of sexual health and the prevention of unwanted teenage pregnancies.</p>

  <p>An expert working group is reviewing the current HIV prevention strategy in the light of epidemiological trends. The Health Education Board for Scotland, too, has sexual health as a prominent aspect of its work.</p>

  <p>Schools have a crucial role to play, and tackle sex education within a comprehensive programme of health and social education. Funding is being provided by the Executive to enable the voluntary sector&#8217;s expertise to be made available to many more schools in Scotland and so promote a more informed and responsible approach to sexual matters on the part of young people.</p>

              will lead to some double, or multiple, counting. For example, where

              It is believed that for the overwhelming majority of cases where

  <p>Under the Scotland Act 1998, national security, interception of communications and the functions of the security and intelligence agencies are reserved matters. In recent years, the Secretary of State for Scotland has issued national security warrants for interception against targets in Scotland. However continuing this practice after devolution would have raised policy, legal and practical problems. It was therefore agreed that the Home Secretary should take on responsibility for issuing national security warrants against targets in Scotland. This is consistent with his overall responsibility for national security.</p>

  <p>These arrangements for issuing national security warrants will have no significant operational implications for the Scottish police or criminal justice system. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and all relevant agencies and Government Departments were fully consulted on these arrangements.</p>

  <p>Orders in Council made under the Scotland Act empower Scottish Ministers to continue to issue interception or property warrants in relation to serious crime when the target is located in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There are no national targets for the amount of land to be reclaimed for development in areas of high unemployment and deprivation. Relevant targets are instead set in terms of job creation outcomes. However Scottish Enterprise is currently developing a regeneration strategy which will ensure better linkages between land development and community regeneration.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise is also targeting specific infrastructure development work in Social Inclusion Partnership areas (SIPs) and other disadvantaged areas to create jobs and community regeneration. Some of the key targets proposed for 2000-01 are:</p>

  <p>-an acceleration of the recycling of brownfield land by 150% of the 1999-2000 level;</p>

  <p>-an increase in the take-up of brownfield land by 25% of the 1999-2000 level;</p>

  <p>-infrastructure development in SIPs leading to 450 jobs, of which 225 will be for local people; and</p>

  <p>-infrastructure development in other areas leading to 50 jobs, of which 25 will be for local people.</p>

  <p>Following a public local inquiry, the Scottish Ministers accepted the Reporter&#8217;s recommendation that a planning application for wheelchair access at the west door of St Giles Cathedral be refused. This decision was intimated in the Scottish Executive Development Department&#8217;s letter of 10 September 1999. It is for the applicants to come forward with acceptable alternative proposals for wheelchair access.</p>

  <p>Significantly, Disability Scotland, which aims to be the national voice of the disabled movement in Scotland, are also in favour of an alternative point of access. In their view, alternative means of providing access for disabled people, most notably at the north door, would be reasonable access and would also provide a sociably acceptable, independent point of access into the cathedral, as well as being more acceptable in planning terms.</p>

  <p>As is described in detail in the Technical Document which accompanied <i>Social Justice: a Scotland Where Everyone Matters</i> , published on 22 November, we recognise a number of definitions of income poverty, covering relative, absolute and persistent low income.</p>

  <p>In future annual Social Justice reports we intend to use indicators that show the proportions of children, working age people and older people living in households with less than 50, 60 and 70% of median GB income and less than 50 and 60% of mean GB income, both before (BHC) and after (AHC) deduction of housing costs. We also intend to track the proportions of children, working age people and older people which fall below these levels of income each year with the levels fixed at their 1997-98 values in real terms; and to develop similar indicators to track persistent low income, based on the recently boosted Scottish sample in the British Household Panel Survey.</p>

  <p>The table below gives figures for these indicators of relative poverty, drawn from the 1997-98 Households Below Average Income dataset using the Family Resources Survey. Because these figures are taken from a sample survey they are subject to sampling error; the figures in brackets may be less reliable than the others because of technical factors.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to collect estimates of the total time lost because of congestion. The Executive believes policy and investment decisions should be informed by well-established techniques for predicting the amount of time that would be saved as a result of specific proposals, rather than using estimates of total time lost which rely on a comparison between actual traffic conditions and a hypothetical free flowing scenario.</p>

  <p>Under the Standing Orders, it is for the Parliamentary Bureau, rather than the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, to propose to the Parliament that a meeting of the Parliament shall be held in a place in Scotland other than in the Church of Scotland Assembly Hall, The Mound, Edinburgh. The Bureau, in making its recommendations to the Parliament, will take into account budgetary and other considerations. If the Parliament decides on a motion of the Parliamentary Bureau that a meeting of the Parliament should be held in another place in Scotland, including Dundee, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body will be responsible for providing the necessary staff and services and will do so with an eye to maximising efficiency.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer how many staff the Parliament&#8217;s full complement of security staff comprises; how many security staff have left since May 1999; what the reasons for security staff leaving were and, in particular, whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body considers that low wage levels, in comparison with security jobs in the private sector, are causing security staff to leave.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-11-26.S1W-2600.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80277" speakername="Sir David Steel" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa1126.htm#2600">

  <p>The full complement comprises 87 full time operational staff, 60 of whom are employed on a shift-rota system with the remainder on permanent day shift. All shifts are of eight hours duration. In addition, the Parliament Security Office employs six administrative staff.</p>

  <p>Since 1 May 1999, 18 operational staff have resigned for a variety of reasons: these include taking up full time study, relocation, securing employment matching qualifications, domestic circumstances and finding employment with higher remuneration.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to compare directly the salary levels of Parliament Security staff with security positions in the private sector because of the wide range and disparate nature of duties undertaken as well as the different terms and conditions of service which exist in the security industry. On a simple comparison of hourly rates of pay, the Scottish Parliament Corporate Body is aware that some sectors of the private security industry do have higher rates of remuneration. While the Scottish Parliament Corporate Body acknowledges that remuneration levels have been a factor in causing some staff to leave it also recognises that there have been other reasons.</p>

  <p>I take this opportunity to record the many grateful observations from members of the public about the helpfulness and courtesy of our security staff on duty.<br /></p>
