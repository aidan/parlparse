  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-2585 by Lord Hardie on 26 November 1999, whether it will give details of what enquiries or representations it has made or proposes to make and what has prompted it to make such enquires or representations, as to why the information relating to the litigation in the United States by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) against the manufacturers of the Chinook FADEC system, which was concluded in or about November 1995, was not made available to the Crown Office until December 1997 and why it was not produced by the MoD at the time of the Fatal Accident Inquiry held in 1996, and to detail any response from the MoD.</p>

  <p>When allegations about the FADEC system were first made the Crown Office immediately sought and thereafter obtained a very full account of the issue from the Ministry of Defence. The litigation, which was settled out of court, related to the test of a pre-production version of the software in conditions of simulated battle damage. There is no evidence to suggest that information about that matter would have made a difference to the outcome of the Fatal Accident Inquiry and, accordingly, no further documentation is required.</p>

  <p>All information known to the Lord Advocate and Crown Office was made available to those representing the families of the deceased, the Ministry of Defence and the aircraft manufacturers. All evidence known to the Lord Advocate and Crown Office which was considered to be in any way relevant to the Fatal Accident Inquiry was led at that Inquiry.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many new jobs forecast by projects supported by Locate in Scotland between April 1998 and April 1999 have so far been created.</p>

  <p>In the year to 31 March 1999, Locate in Scotland and its partners helped to attract to Scotland a total of 78 projects involving planned investment of &pound;760 million and the anticipated creation or safeguarding of nearly 11,000 jobs.</p>

  <p>Inward investment projects are recorded in the year in which the investing company announces the decision to implement the project in Scotland, and using the data in the company&#8217;s announcement. Such projects typically build up over several years. Where financial assistance is offered, this is drawn down in line with the actual creation of jobs and actual incurring of capital expenditure.</p>

  <p>While many of the projects announced by investors in the year ending March 1999 will still be at an early stage of development, analysis of inward investment projects during the 1990&#8217;s suggests that over 70% of announced jobs actually come to fruition. This figure does not include cases where projects have, in fact, created more jobs than originally planned, or the large number of expansion projects which are secured on the positive experience of an investor&#8217;s initial project in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The very positive experience of inward investors in Scotland is underlined by the fact that as many as 50% of inward investment decisions in a typical year represent expansions or new projects by existing foreign investors.</p>

  <p>Social Phobia is included in the main psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV).

  <p>Health Boards and NHS Trusts are expected to develop services for the treatment of psychological disorders based on the assessment of needs.

  <p>No. Registered housing associations are subject to monitoring and regulation by Scottish Homes.

  <p>The total cost would depend on the number of grants paid and the amount of grant in each case. I have announced that the budget for the Warm Deal for 2000-01 will be &pound;13 million which would yield 26,000 grants of &pound;500. The cost of 26,000 grants at &pound;700 would be &pound;18.2 million. These figures assume that all grants would be at the maximum level, but in practice the average level of grant will be lower than the maximum.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the total cost would be of making available grants of up to &pound;1,800 per household for installing central heating under the Warm Deal programme, similar to the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme which operates in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>I understand that under the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme in England it is proposed to introduce new arrangements from June 2000 under which, in certain restricted circumstances, the maximum grant will be &pound;2,000. It is not possible to estimate the cost of introducing similar arrangements in Scotland but plainly the higher the maximum grant in individual cases the fewer the number of dwellings which can be improved for a given budget.</p>

  <p>The budget for improving home energy efficiency for low-income households in Scotland is &pound;12 million for 1999-2000. &pound;1.475 million of the total came from the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) to meet the cost of the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) in Scotland between 1 April and 30 June. The rest is for the Warm Deal which was introduced on 1 July. It includes &pound;4.525 million received from DETR as Scotland&#8217;s share of the HEES budget for GB for the period from 1 July to 31 March 2000. None of the resources for the Warm Deal come from the budget for the New Deal or from capital receipts by local authorities.</p>

  <p>One of the environmental aims of the new parliament building will be to reduce the amount of waste disposed at landfill. As a result, recycling will be an integral part of the facilities available. This will include the recycling of waste paper, aluminium cans, vending cups, cardboard, and any other materials should a suitable outlet for them exist. <br /></p>
