  <p>The Board of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) is responsible to Scottish ministers for ensuring efficient and effective use of resources throughout that organisation. A management statement for which the Scottish Executive is responsible sets out, among other matters, requirements in respect of procurement. As the previous answers stated, it is then for HIE to meet these requirements in its day to day operations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to write to the board of HIE in relation to supply partners. The Chief Executive of HIE recently wrote to all MSPs within the HIE area fully explaining the reasons behind this business delivery initiative.</p>

  <p>It is too early to predict the outcome of the debate on the future of the European Structural Funds for the Highlands and Islands or anywhere else when the current programmes cease in December 2006. The European Commission&#8217;s third cohesion report due to be published early next year will give an indication of the Commission&#8217;s thinking ahead of their draft regulations expected next May. Negotiations between member states will take place thereafter and are likely to last at least a year.</p>

  <p>Public sector match funding for structural fund projects comes from the relevant domestic spending programme within the assigned budget. Whatever the future of the funds, public bodies will continue to be able to set their own priorities including allocating money either to match fund projects they sponsor or to fund them outright.</p>

  <p>The pay and modernisation agreement signed on 13 June 2003 states that the pay increases payable from 7 November 2003 and 1 July 2004 are subject to:</p>

  <p>&quot;verification by the Audit Commission (England and Wales), the Accounts Commission (Scotland) and Government (Northern Ireland) that the intended benefits (including savings) of the various national changes are being delivered locally.&quot;</p>

  <p>The arrangements for the verification process are a matter for the parties to the agreement. However, the Executive has an interest in the outcome because the release of transitional funding by the Executive in support of the implementation of the agreement is conditional on satisfactory verification. The detailed arrangements for the verification process will have to be agreed between Audit Scotland and COSLA and the Executive will assist as necessary. Those discussions are taking full account of arrangements for verification of the agreement elsewhere in the UK.</p>

  <p>To date <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em> has been found in the south of England in four species of tree; Southern red oak, Holm oak, beech and Horse chestnut. Research on which species of tree found in the UK were susceptible to the disease was started in August 2001. Results from laboratory tests indicate that red oaks, beech, Sweet chestnut, Sitka spruce and Douglas fir are at greatest risk whilst other species such as our native white oaks are not so susceptible. Other research is also being undertaken on how the disease is spread.</p>

  <p>We have taken precautionary measures with emergency legislation designed to control the disease put in place in May 2002 and these were followed by emergency measures throughout the EU in November 2002.</p>

  <p>In line with EU measures, an intensive survey programme of retail outlets, nurseries, gardens and other established planting areas has been under way since the first UK case in February 2002. There have now been over 300 findings of the disease in the UK, including 24 in Scotland. In Scotland all of the outbreaks have been on horticultural establishments. All four of the cases where infection has been discovered in trees have been at well known historical gardens in the south of England where infection had already been found in ornamental shrubs of the rhododendron family.</p>

  <p>Following the discovery of the disease in trees we are stepping up eradication and containment action. In Scotland staff from the Forestry Commission will shortly begin surveying in woodlands in areas identified as being of high risk from the disease. This will complement the surveys being performed in England and Wales. This survey will be completed by the end of the April 2004 and further action will depend on the findings.</p>

  <p>SEERAD are currently considering what further action it should take with regard to horticultural plants in the light of the findings in trees in the south of England.</p>

  <p>The strategic waste fund was established in January 2001. Twenty one local authorities have received major awards totalling &#163;99,950,000 to 2005-06 to assist the implementation of their area waste plans.</p>

  <p>In addition, in 2000-01, &#163;3 million was distributed between all authorities for recycling and composting schemes. A further &#163;6 million was distributed in 2002-03 for this purpose.</p>

  <p>&#163;1.69 million and &#163;3.3 million were distributed between all local authorities in 2001-02 and 2002-03 respectively to assist local authorities to comply with the Control of Ozone-Depleted Substance Regulations 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also funds waste awareness, market development, community recycling and other schemes directly from the strategic waste fund.</p>
