  <p>We propose to make available to CalMac in 2001-02 revenue deficit grant of &#163;21.4 million and capital grant of &#163;0.4 million. The proposed level of capital grant makes no provision for the purchase of new vessels, since European regulations no longer permit the payment of grant for this purpose. The proposals for tendering CalMac&#8217;s services, which I announced on 23 January, reflect these rules. They would also allow services and fares to be protected and provide mechanisms to secure investment in new vessels. The budget figures will be kept under review as the tendering process develops.</p>

  <p>A statutory instrument, The Foot and Mouth Declaratory (Controlled Area) (Scotland) (No 2) Order 2001, was introduced on Friday 2 March 2001. This provides the legislative framework for a licensing scheme for movement of livestock from farm direct to slaughterhouse.</p>

  <p>The only restriction on the location of the slaughterhouse is that it should not be within 3 km of an infected premise.</p>

  <p>Movement is strictly controlled under these arrangements and poses minimal disease risk with vehicles which deliver the animals being thoroughly cleansed and disinfected before they leave the abattoir. Furthermore, the animals slaughtered will be subjected to the routine ante-mortem inspection before meat is passed fit for human consumption.</p>

  <p>It would be for any individual community body to consider the viability of any land purchase. Community bodies applying for community right to buy under the draft Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will be required to present to ministers, at the right to buy stage, detailed plans for the land which they wish to purchase under this legislation.</p>

  <p>The proposed legislation provides for ministers to decide whether an application to exercise a right to buy can proceed. In making their decision, ministers must consider whether the right to buy would be in the public interest and compatible with sustainable development. A community body seeking to exercise a right to buy must therefore address these issues in its plans.</p>

  <p>This meeting was almost exclusively about English issues not related to the effect on tourism of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. I took the view that it would be more useful to speak separately to Janet Anderson, the minister responsible for tourism at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I have done so and we have agreed to keep in touch on a regular basis.</p>
