  <p>Under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, as amended, local authorities must provide free school milk, meals or other refreshments to all school children whose parents receive income support or the income based job seekers allowance.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are not obliged to provide free school milk etc to pupils whose parents receive financial assistance under the new Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled Persons Tax Credit schemes as both schemes already contain an element to cover the cost of school milk and meals.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to considering the sustainable development implications of all new pieces of legislation. The Improvement in Scottish Education Bill is intended to create a transparent framework for improvement in schools. Within that framework Ministers will gain powers to set national priorities for schools education while giving authorities flexibility to respond to local needs.</p>

I am delighted to announce that Deirdre Hutton has agreed to serve as Deputy Chairman and that Professor Brian Clark, Councillor Susan Clark, Professor Stanley Dagg, Fred Edwards, Bill Furness and Councillor Bill Howatson have accepted my invitation to serve on the Board of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Two current Board members, whose appointments expire on 11 October 1999, David Hughes Hallett and Councillor Cormick McChord, have agreed to serve for a further term. I look forward to working in partnership with all the Board members.</p>

  <p>I am grateful to Alexander Buchan, Graeme Gordon, Councillor Alastair Hewat, Professor Cliff Johnston, Councillor Alison Magee and Councillor Jennifer Shaw whose terms of appointment end on 11 October 1999 for their contribution to the work of the Board over the past four years.</p>

  <p>In <i>Making it Work Together &#8211; Our Programme of Government</i> we have said that we will publish by the end of 1999 our strategy for modernising government in Scotland. Work on developing the strategy is in hand and I hope to be in a position to announce details in the autumn, including any plans for consultation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to inform the Parliament&#8217;s Committees about Executive announcements.</p>

  <p>Committee members may be informed of forthcoming announcements, such as news events or consultation documents, at briefings to Committees by Ministers or Scottish Executive Officials. Committee Clerks may also be informed of announcements through their Committee Liaison contacts in the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Executive announcements in the form of consultation documents are made available to the Parliament&#8217;s Document Supply Centre. All papers laid before Parliament, whether or not they will be subject to any Parliamentary proceedings, are listed in the Business Bulletin under Section H, and are also available through Document Supply.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive announcements in the form of press releases are available on the Scottish Executive web-site. The Parliamentary Information Centre (SPICe) currently takes press releases off the web-site and these are available from the reference centre in Parliamentary Headquarters.</p>

  <p>It has recently been agreed that SPICe will be included on the electronic press mailing list thereby speeding the transmission of announcements between the Scottish Executive, Parliament and Committees. It is our intention to continue to make improvements in informing Members as systems develop and in light of experience.</p>

  <p>I am aware that viewers in some parts of Scotland are unable to receive certain programmes on BBC2 Scotland. While this is not a matter which the Corporate Body can rectify, I shall raise the matter with the BBC. <br /></p>
