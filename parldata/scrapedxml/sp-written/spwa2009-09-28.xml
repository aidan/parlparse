  <p>Marketing of the Home Insulation Scheme (HIS) is expected to begin in late September, with doorstep assessment visits starting in early November and the first measures being installed in early December. It is not possible at this stage to accurately estimate the number of households which will sign up to receive insulation measures by the end of 2009. Our planning and funding framework is based on financial years, i.e. 2009-10 for the first phase. When HIS is underway and data is collected for monitoring and evaluation purposes it will be possible to provide more informed estimates.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that Scotland&rsquo;s cities, including Edinburgh, will benefit from having a thriving live music scene. However, defining these benefits in precise economic terms is difficult.</p>

  <p>The City of Edinburgh Council, the Scottish Arts Council, other relevant bodies and local authorities confirm that this information is not collected or held centrally. The reason relates to the difficulty of defining a &quot;live music scene&quot; and what it can mean in practice.</p>

  <p>We will be considering, in partnership with the medical profession in Scotland, how best to prevent any new arrangements of this nature being entered into by GP practices. In addition, we will issue guidance to NHS boards which will require them to press practices currently using premium rate numbers to reopen negotiations with service providers in a bid to drive down the costs to callers.</p>

  <p>There is no specific timescale for ending the use of premium rate telephone numbers used by GP practices. However, as detailed in the answer to question S3W-27498 on 28 September 2009, we will be working closely with the medical profession to ensure that patients do not incur additional costs when contacting a practice by telephone.</p>

  <p>Healthcare associated infection (HAI) is not unique to Scotland and is a major challenge for all the UK countries. It is also a global problem. Both the Scottish Government and members of our HAI Task Force have robust networks of contacts in place around the UK, and across the European Community, so we can learn from each other and share best practice on the most effective approaches towards tackling HAI. In addition, both the Chief Scientist&rsquo;s Office and the Scottish Infection Research Network (SIRN) encourage and support innovative research and projects into HAI to ensure that our approach continues to evolve and keeps pace with other countries.</p>

  <p>As well as on-going dialogue with UK colleagues, regular meetings take place across the UK including meetings of the Pan Celtic Group, which is attended by all UK countries; meetings of the Antimicrobial Resistant Healthcare Associated Infection Committee, which is led by the Department of Health, and meetings at the European Centre for Disease Control.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers, through Historic Scotland, maintain four Roman sites in Perthshire, including three of the Gask Ridge watchtowers. These sites are featured in our members handbook, which has a distribution of 70,000 and in our <em>Sites Guide</em> , 4,000 of which are sent to media and stakeholders. Their on-site interpretation has been recently replaced incorporating up-to-date research and of course it is recognised that they are only a part of the picture for Roman Perthshire; the broader interpretation of their role within Roman Scotland is covered in publications such as <em>Roman Scotland</em> , by David Breeze and published by Historic Scotland and Batsford Books, reprinted in 2000.</p>

  <p>In addition, Historic Scotland has recently provided grant support for an important conference held in Perth (and proceedings recently published as &quot;First Contacts&quot;), organised by Tayside and Fife Archaeological Committee into the earliest Roman presence in Scotland, looking at archaeological evidence which may show contacts a decade or more before the normally accepted date of the first Roman presence in the north.</p>

Historic Scotland also raises the profile of our Roman heritage through active marketing of sites such as the Antonine Wall.</p>

  <p>Punishment parts are set by the High Court in accordance with the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, as amended by the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001. There is no statutory limitation on the maximum punishment part that may be set. The punishment part set is subject to appeal by the prisoner or the Lord Advocate.</p>

  <p>Section 118(7) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 provides that in disposing of an appeal against sentence the High Court may issue a guideline judgement on the sentence which is appropriate in any similar case.</p>

  <p>NHS boards response to pandemic influenza surge planning reflects a staged and incremental re-prioritisation of existing services as demand increases or diminishes. A key action for boards has been planning for the re-alignment of workforce resources including staff numbers, skills and competence, physical capacity (bed spaces and equipment) in order to support anticipated critical care demand.</p>

  <p>The required increase in staffing capacity and capability is principally achieved through the re-allocation and up-skilling of the existing workforce rather than through the engagement of additional staff. This process is appropriate to managing activity peaks and is reflected in both Scottish and UK-wide surge guidance.</p>

  <p>Alongside this planned re-allocation of resources, NHS Board Nurse Directors have been reviewing the existing critical care skills and competencies and establishing the educational and training needs for staff to enhance such skills in order to support greater flexibility. An expert group has also led on developing and making available supporting materials for both Critical Care and the pandemic immunisation programme.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have all been asked to look at capacity within their nurse bank complement and, if necessary to consider whether there may be additional potential capacity amongst those who have recently left their service.</p>

  <p>Whilst the NHS in Scotland undoubtedly faces challenges in the months ahead, we have been proactive in our planning, in scoping staff requirements and in rolling out appropriate development initiatives.</p>

  <p>The increase in the number of recalls is partly a reflection of the continued rise in the number of prisoners: 6,620 in 2004, rising to more than 8,000 in 2009. It also reflects the fact that those released on licence must abide by their licence conditions or expect to be dealt with seriously.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS delivers a range of offending behaviour programme that address the issue of violence.</p>

  <p>The Violence Prevention Programme is an intense, 94 session programme designed to address the offending behaviour of those offenders who have the most violent offence histories. Access to all programmes is currently determined on an individual prisoner&rsquo;s suitability for the programme and risk assessments.</p>

  <p>Other programmes are available that address offending behaviour in the context of substance misuse, anger and emotional management and problem solving. These programmes may be offered to some prisoners as a more appropriate measure for addressing offending behaviour.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that the Scottish Government and COSLA are launching a new School Estate Strategy <em>Building Better Schools: Investing in Scotland&rsquo;s Future </em> today. Copies have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 49305) and the document is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Schools/Buildings/commitments" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Schools/Buildings/commitments</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Building Better Schools: Investing in Scotland&rsquo;s Future </em>represents the Scottish Government and COSLA&rsquo;s agreed destination and route map to get the School Estate up to the standard which Audit Scotland set out in <em>Improving the School Estate. </em>It has been developed as a partnership between national and local government and we are jointly committed to continuing this partnership as we proceed with implementation. The strategy has pupils at its centre and sets out the joint government-COSLA target of achieving 90% of children being educated in good condition schools (conditions A &amp; B) with firm plans to lift the rest of pupils out of being educated in schools in conditions C &amp; D.</p>

  <p>I am also pleased to announce the 14 secondary schools will benefit from the new &pound;1.25 billion school building programme that will follow on from the current &pound;2 billion of school investment that is being supported by the government which are:</p>

  <p><strong>As I have previously set out to Parliament (</strong>Col. 19247) we have engaged with COSLA, councils and the Scottish Futures Trust to identify the 14 schools and have taken into account the distribution of needs throughout Scotland; the best available information about schools&rsquo; condition and unsuitability to deliver the curriculum for excellence; additionality, and authorities&rsquo; plans and priorities and readiness to proceed.</p>

  <p><strong>We have also agreed with COSLA that we would accelerate the primary school announcement and that the same criteria will be used to identify these schools. We </strong>anticipate that all councils will benefit from the first tranches of the school building programme.</p>
