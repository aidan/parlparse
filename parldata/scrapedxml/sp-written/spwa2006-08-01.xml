  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it intends to ensure that the advantage which Scottish universities perceived that they have gained through the Fresh Talent visa scheme, when recruiting foreign students, is maintained in light of the proposed introduction by the Home Office of a similar scheme across the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the new United Kingdom-wide scheme allows postgraduate students, and some first degree students within very specific disciplines, to remain and work in the UK for a maximum of one year. However, the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme is different and stronger in that it offers the opportunity to work for two years, and includes all Master&rsquo;s, first degree, PhD and Higher National Diploma graduates who successfully complete their studies. This is a significant advantage, and we will continue to work with Scottish higher and further education institutions to promote the scheme to international students.</p>

  <p>The Executive acknowledges the importance of ensuring that guidance is readily available to all health care professionals and patients on the management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has produced a range of guidelines which relate to this issue.</p>

  <p>We have agreed with NHS Quality Improvement Scotland that it will carry out a stock-take of all the initiatives in place in NHSScotland aimed at preventing venous thromboembolism, which includes DVT. The results of that survey will enable the Chief Medical Officer to consider what further guidance to health care professionals might be needed.</p>

  <p>The only personal information held on the National Entitlement Card are those details that are necessary to print or re-print a card for the cardholder. The details are a picture of the cardholder, forename, surname, date of birth, gender, house number, postcode and the card number.

  <p>No it is not compulsory for elderly and disabled people to carry their National Entitlement Card at all times. However, if they wish to travel by bus free of charge, they will need to present their card to the driver at the start of their journey.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive currently has two central contracts for the provision of agency staff. Administrative and clerical staff are supplied through a contract placed with Pertemps. A contract is also in place for the provision of interim managers with Hays.</p>

  <p>Rates for staff supplied by Pertemps are the same for all Scottish Executive Departments, and depend on the grade of the post being covered. Table 1 shows the mean average rate paid to Pertemps for staff at administrative and clerical grades for each year since 1999.</p>

  <p>Table 1: Pertemps &ndash; Average (Mean) Hourly Rate Paid to Pertemps for Agency Workers Covering A1 to A4 Posts</p>

</table></p>

  <p>Note: Calculated for each year by summing the agreed hourly rates for each of the administrative and clerical grades, including typists and personal secretaries and security staff, covered by the contract and dividing by the number of grades to give an average rate. Where a rate or rates has/have changed during the year, an average of the two rates has been used.</p>

  <p>Rates for staff supplied by Hays will vary depending on the skills and specialist expertise required for the particular role. A mean average hourly rate paid to Hays for staff is shown by department in Table 2. The average rate will depend on the usage of the contract by the department and the types of roles being covered. Because some candidates are highly specialised they may command a very high rate, although usually only for a relatively short period of time. This will have distorted the rates for some departments.</p>
