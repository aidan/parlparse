  <p>The Scottish Government has no formal role in overseeing the introduction of such schemes under the 2009 act but we have been working with COSLA, local authorities, the energy companies and some other interested parties to support implementation. As a result, we understand that 15 local authorities currently have a scheme in place, 11 have plans which are at an advanced stage and the six remaining authorities are planning to introduce schemes for the start of the 2011-12 financial year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also provided a small amount of funding to allow COSLA and the Improvement Service to commission a review of energy efficient council tax rebate schemes in Scotland. The review has been completed and a copy of the review report, which is currently being finalised, will be placed in SPICe (Bib. number 51226) when it is published.</p>

  <p>MRC are unable to provide separate figures for their spend in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Within the Scottish Government the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and healthcare needs in Scotland. CSO supports projects of a sufficiently high standard initiated by the research community in Scotland. CSO has not funded nor received any research applications on motor neurone disease (MND) since 2000.</p>

  <p>Expenditure made by research charities in Scotland on MND is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not consider that there would be any negative impact upon stoma product availability or innovation arising from the proposals in <em>Consultation on the terms of the tenders to be issued for the provision of stoma appliances to NHS Scotland for the period 2010-12</em> . Stoma appliance manufacturers would remain able to respond to the forthcoming tender by pricing their products as they see fit but within a more transparent framework intended to help NHS boards deliver optimal value for money in the provision of this service.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland had expected to use the new UK-wide NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) framework on the expiry of the 2009 Scottish agreement. Following a rise in NHS PASA&rsquo;s framework charge rates the cost impact in Scotland would have been higher than elsewhere in the UK. Accordingly, following consultation with NHS boards in 2008, NHS National Services Scotland&rsquo;s National Procurement division were tasked with putting in place a more affordable agreement for NHSScotland. This was a complex process, involving extensive consultation with stakeholders and negotiations with suppliers. The new agreement came into operation on 1 June 2010, and is the most competitively priced contract of its kind in the UK.</p>

  <p>(a) There are delays in processing 613 annual recurrent claims, and 209 capital claims under Rural Priorities.</p>

  <p>(b) On the annual recurrent side, the delay is due to officials continuing to clear computer generated errors, which emerged during the processing of these claims. These include cases where claimants have changed their approved schedule of work, or have amended their original contract, and/or have differences between the areas claimed and those found at inspection. On the capital side, the main reason for the delay is that a number of claims lack all of the required supporting documentation. Such claims are not valid to be paid and officials have to contact claimants to obtain the missing data. This can cause delays if claimants do not respond quickly, or do not have the required information to hand.</p>

  <p>(c) There is some &pound;4.6 million of outstanding annual recurrent claims, and some <br /> &pound;4.5 million of capital claims.</p>

  <p>(d) New systems are being introduced to speed up the processing of annual recurrent payments. There are no current delays with processing valid 2010 RP capital claims.</p>

  <p>(e) We aim to pay all annual recurrent claims by 31 August 2010 and earlier where possible, within the strict confines of EU legislation. Payment of the outstanding capital claims is entirely dependent upon receipt of the required information.</p>

  <p>The current position on Rural Priorities payments is set out in the following table.</p>
