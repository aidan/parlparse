<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-09-27.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80030" speakername="Patricia Ferguson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0927.htm#2">

  <p>Since 1999-2000 the Scottish Executive has provided purchase grants totalling over &pound;3 million annually to the three National Institutions: Of this total, &pound;1.26 million per annum has been provided to the National Galleries of Scotland for the purchase of art. In addition, the National Galleries have had access to one-off funding from the Executive for major additions to their collections: &pound;0.5 million in 1999-2000 towards the purchase of Botticelli&rsquo;s &quot;The Virgin adoring the sleeping Christ Child&quot; and &pound;2.5 million in 2002-03 for the purchase of Titian &quot;Venus Rising from the Sea&quot;.</p>

  <p>No funds have been set aside by the Executive for future acquisitions beyond the normal NGS purchase grant of &pound;1.26 million per annum. Neither are any proposals for the purchase of art collections under consideration for additional one-off funding at the present time.</p>

  <p>Purchase grants are only one means by which the National Institutions acquire items for their collections. The UK Government operates a scheme under which works of art can be accepted by the state in lieu of Inheritance Tax. The Heritage Lottery Fund also funds acquisitions and gave &pound;7.6 million each for the purchase of the Botticelli and the Titian by the National Galleries of Scotland. The National Heritage Memorial Fund acts as funder of last resort to save works of art for the nation and gave &pound;3 million towards the joint purchase of &quot;The Three Graces&quot; by the National Galleries of Scotland and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The National Art Collections Fund has also funded acquisitions in Scotland, giving &pound;0.5 million towards the purchase of the Titian by the National Galleries of Scotland. The National Institutions receive a significant number of bequests of items for their collections from private individuals and as well as financial donations which can be applied towards the purchase of works of art.</p>

  <p>The level of annual purchase grant provided to the National Galleries of Scotland by the Scottish Executive is set out in the answer to question S2W-19126 on 27 September 2005. The actual level of expenditure by NGS may be supplemented by additional income or financial donations and is set out in their annual accounts which are laid before the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>Broadcasting is a reserved matter. On 15 September 2005, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Rt Hon Tessa Jowell MP, confirmed the timetable for digital switchover and announced details of a support scheme to make sure that no one is left behind in the switch. Questions about digital switchover are a matter for UK Ministers at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.</p>

  <p>Broadcasting is a reserved matter. However, Scottish ministers have made clear to the UK Government the importance the Scottish Executive attaches to social inclusion. Scottish ministers&rsquo; position is that, when digital switchover is complete, television services should be available to as great a number of people as possible without any unnecessary financial burden.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. Average waiting times are not regarded as a particularly effective measure of the availability and efficiency of drugs services.</p>

  <p>A national waiting times information framework was implemented in April 2004. It collects data on the number of people who wait for less than one week, less than two weeks, and so on, for up to four different treatment and support interventions. Information is collected at the Alcohol and Drug Action Team (ADAT) level.</p>

  <p>Reports are submitted to the Scottish Executive each quarter, and can be viewed on: <a href="http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/wtpilot/reports.htm" target="_blank">http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/wtpilot/reports.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>Methadone will not suit every patient. In any case, decisions on treatments, or combinations of treatments, are for individual patients and their medical professionals.

  <p>Methadone is used as a treatment in many countries, and its benefits are supported by a substantial body of national and international research. Both the National Treatment Outcome Research Study and the early results from the Drug Outcome Research In Scotland study confirm the benefits from drug treatment, including methadone, in terms of reduced use of illegal drugs, reduced levels of injecting, reduced criminal activity and significant health gains for individuals.</p>

  <p>The new guidelines established in the revised Lisbon Strategy, which focus greater attention on productivity and employment, align the Lisbon policy priorities closely with those that currently exist in Scotland and the United Kingdom. The economic development priorities of the Executive are set out in the long-term economic strategy <em>The Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</em> and the Executive&rsquo;s Enterprise strategy <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland (SSS)</em> .</p>

  <p>The three key Lisbon objectives for growth and jobs (making Europe a more attractive place to invest and work; knowledge and innovation for growth, and creating more and better jobs) fit well with the three main policy objectives of SSS (global connections; skills and learning, and growing business).</p>

  <p>Global connections has a range of policies aimed at encouraging Scottish companies to increase their involvement in global markets and international collaborations. These policies also promote Scotland as a world class location to live, study, work and invest. The policies relating to the skills and learning objective aim to exploit high-skill levels, support lifelong learning, continuing workforce development and increasing economic activity. Finally, the growing business theme promotes innovation and entrepreneurship, supporting new companies and growing business of scale.</p>

  <p>The economic challenges facing Scotland with respect to the Lisbon agenda of growth and employment are similar to those identified and discussed in <em>The Framework for Economic Development in Scotland (FEDS)</em> . These relate primarily to the productivity challenge facing the Scottish economy and, in particular, closing the productivity gap between Scotland and the world&rsquo;s leading advanced economies. FEDS also highlights the importance of research and development and innovation as a key driver of productivity and economic development, which is also a Lisbon objective.</p>

  <p>In terms of employment, Scotland is performing very well by European standards. Over 150,000 people have entered employment since the creation of the Scottish Parliament and our employment rate is in excess of the current 2010 Lisbon target and among the highest in the European Union.</p>

The Lisbon Strategy and the renewed EU focus on growth and jobs fits well with existing Executive policy, as set out in <em>The Framework for Economic Development in Scotland (FEDS) </em> and the Executive&rsquo;s Enterprise strategy <em>A Smart Successful Scotland</em> (SSS).

The Executive also consults regularly with key stakeholders through various forums, ensuring that all views are represented.</p>

  <p>The UK Government consults widely with national, regional, local and sectoral stakeholders in developing proposals for structural economic reform. In preparation of its national reform programme, the UK government has held an open stakeholder dialogue from 8 July to the 12 August 2005, inviting comments and input from all stakeholders across the United Kingdom on the proposals for structural economic reform. Responses were received from the private, public and voluntary sectors. The Executive inputted to this process and has on-going consultation with the UK government on the national reform programme. Many of the reforms necessary to meet the Lisbon objectives have already been implemented in the UK and in Scotland and were consulted on prior to implementation.</p>

  <p>Out-of-hours services will continue to be provided at the new Stobhill and Victoria Hospitals. Around &pound;190 million is being invested in these new builds. The new Hospitals will provide Minor Injury Units which are well placed to deal quickly and effectively with the problems out-of-hours patients present.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-17976 by Mr Andy Kerr on 16 August 2005, how many operations were cancelled on (a) the day of and (b) the day after admission and how many of the patients involved were not readmitted within a month in each quarter of the last five years for which figures are available in each NHS (i) board and (ii) hospital.</p>

  <p>The specific information requested is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>Limited information is available on the number of in-patient/day case episodes where operations/procedures were not carried out <u>following admission</u>. Information on the number of in-patient and day case episodes where operations/procedures were cancelled following admission by NHS board of treatment and hospital, for calendar years 2000 to 2004, and the number of patients who were not subsequently admitted to hospital for an operation within 30 days of discharge has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37492). It is not possible to identify on what day the operation was cancelled.</p>

  <p>For the calendar years 2000 to 2004 the percentage of operations which were cancelled has decreased from 2.0% to 1.8%.</p>

  <p>Operations can be cancelled due to various unforeseen pressures. Some examples of these are; an influx of emergency admissions, widespread staff sickness, theatre equipment failure or infection in wards.</p>

  <p>On occasions, some patients may be sent home, following admission, when a planned procedure/operation has not been carried out. Some reasons for this include; patient being unfit for treatment due to illness (e.g. chest infection), having omitted to fast before admission, failing to follow pre-admission advice on medication, or where theatre time is unavailable due to unexpected complications arising in earlier theatre cases.</p>

  <p>In setting out an initial response to Professor David Kerr&rsquo;s report <em>Building A Health Service Fit For The Future</em>, I made it clear that I supported his proposals that we should stream planned care, separating it, where possible, from emergency care. I have asked the Regional Planning Groups to develop arrangements for streaming planned care that will reduce cancellations, increase predictability and workflow and reduce waiting times.</p>

  <p>Information is not held centrally on the total number of temporary accommodation places available, neither in properties owned by registered social landlords, nor in properties in other tenures.</p>

  <p>Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, as amended, local authorities have a duty to ensure that temporary accommodation is made available for homeless people in a number of different circumstances. The accommodation can be provided across a range of tenures including private rented accommodation and temporary accommodation in the council&rsquo;s own property. The latest available information on numbers of homeless households in temporary accommodation in each local authority area at 30 September 2005 was published in February 2005 and is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00399-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00399-00.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>The table shows for each local authority for each of the last three years the total number of houses owned by the council which the council has designated as temporary accommodation for homeless applicants.</p>

  <p>The issue of access to NHS podiatry services is a matter for clinical decision in the light of the health needs of individual patients. The planning and provision of services is a matter for NHS boards.</p>

  <p>At national level, the Scottish Executive is committed to increasing the number of Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) including podiatrists by 1,500 by 2007, as set out in the Partnership Agreement commitment. This is being backed up with action and investment. The Allied Health Professions Officer for Scotland and the Centre for Change and Innovation are working with podiatrists and other AHPs to support service redesign where this would enhance access for patients. The AHP Strategy Future Directions for the Allied Health Professions in Scotland also provides an action plan to aid recruitment and retention. Already, &pound;400,000 has been provided for an AHP return to practice initiative, the development of alternative routes to state registration and the development of AHP specialist practitioner posts.</p>

  <p>I do not intend to set targets for palliative care provision since circumstances will vary locally. However, since 2001, every NHS board has completed a palliative care needs assessment, developed a palliative care strategy, or established a palliative care managed clinical network.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS boards must now take account of a number of specialist palliative care standards that were published by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland in January 2004. One of these standards is that patients who need access to specialist palliative care services should be able to access them 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I now expect all boards to work towards implementing these standards fully, in particular by broadening access to palliative care for patients who do not have cancer. But I am also convinced that we have seen real and significant improvements in palliative care provision in every NHS board area since 2001.</p>

  <p>The provisions covering publicity (neighbour notification and advertising) and consultation apply to planning applications generally.

  <p>It is open to anyone to comment on a planning application and it is for the planning authority, in the first instance, to weigh up any competing considerations and reach a decision on the application.</p>

  <p>There are no plans at present to reform the publicity and consultation procedures specifically in relation to planning applications for agricultural buildings.</p>

  <p>However, our White Paper - <em>Modernising the Planning System</em>, published in June 2005, contains a package of reforms that will offer greater opportunity for local people to have stronger participation in the planning process at earlier stages.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not set specific targets for growth in R&amp;D expenditure relative to GDP, but is committed to improving Scotland&rsquo;s position relative to our main competitors. The Executive and its agencies have a range of policies to encourage R&amp;D and commercialisation activity in Scotland and address this priority. These include:</p>

  <p>The SCoRe and SEEKIT initiatives which support collaborative, pre-competitive R&amp;D, jointly undertaken between SMEs and public sector science base as well as enhancing public sector research organisations&rsquo; ability to work with business;</p>

  <p>The highly successful R&amp;D grants under SMART/SPUR/SPUR plus aimed at small and medium sized enterprises, researchers and prospective entrepreneurs, which are now at record levels;</p>

  <p>The Proof of Concept fund of &pound;40 million fills a funding gap aimed at a pre-development conceptual phase of high risk projects;</p>

  <p>The Scottish Co-investment Fund (&pound;45 million) and Scottish Proposal Assistance Fund (SPAF) provide additional sources of assistance;</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council has established a Knowledge Transfer Grant which will total at least &pound;12 million in 2005-06, double the level in 2002-03, and</p>

  <p>R&amp;D plus designed to actively support large companies engaged in new and innovative research aimed at developing products with potential for global commercial success.</p>

  <p>Complementary to these programmes is the establishment by Scottish Enterprise of three Intermediary Technology Institutes (ITIs). The three ITIs focused on the three industry sectors: energy, life sciences and communication technology and digital media will receive funding of &pound;450 million over 10 years. They will assist the commercial exploitation of knowledge and the creation of more knowledge based companies in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, annual UK surveys continue to show that Scotland performs well in UK terms on a range of measures of commercialisation. The Executive is consulting with business about a further scheme linking business rates relief with research and development expenditure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament intends to register a number of appropriate .eu domain names. The registration of .eu domains will be undertaken to protect the Parliament&rsquo;s interests from activities such as cybersquatting and to provide a redirection service to the Parliament&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk">www.scottish.parliament.uk</a> .</p>
