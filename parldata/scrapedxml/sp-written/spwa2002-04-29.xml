  <p>The member is probably aware that the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) has agreed to conduct a review of its future functions and objectives, in consultation with its key stakeholders. I would expect representatives of the groups to which the member refers to be invited to participate in the consultation process.</p>

  <p>Following this piece of work, the SAC will examine options - for all of its three campuses - about how it might restructure itself to be able to meet these objectives, prior to putting their conclusions to ministers for consideration. In advance of this work being taken forward, it is not possible to say at this stage what options will emerge for consideration or to comment on any individual one.</p>

  <p>The SAC will be using external consultants to help it with these major initiatives. The consultants will bring an independent line of thought to bear.</p>

  <p>The purpose of a needs assessment is to determine the requirement for social care for an individual. This is linked to the provision of services by, or for, local authorities under social work legislation, not to services provided by the NHS. The extension of free personal and nursing care only applies to those who currently pay for, or towards, such care in community settings (e.g. in a care home or in their own home). All NHS care is provided free at the point of delivery already and is not affected by the introduction of free personal and nursing care which only applies outside an NHS setting. There is therefore no requirement for additional funding for the NHS as a consequence of the introduction of this policy.</p>

  <p>One thousand, three hundred and fifty-two <strong></strong> central heating systems have been installed in houses owned by Glasgow Council, whose tenants have now voted in favour of stock transfer. 28 systems have been installed in stock owned by Argyll and Bute Council and 28 in Shetland. Both of these councils are actively considering whole housing stock transfer. The other three councils considering stock transfer, Dumfries and Galloway, Scottish Borders and Western Isles, have central heating in all their houses and so are not taking part in the central heating programme.</p>

  <p>There is a lack of good evidence to support substitute prescribing for cocaine, amphetamine and cannabis misuse. Prescription of tranquillisers, such as diazepam, can ease the symptoms of withdrawal from psychostimulants, including sleep disturbance and anxiety. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, and psychosocial interventions, such as relapse prevention, can also play an important role, either in conjunction with symptomatic relief, or as stand alone treatments. Psychosocial interventions and counselling are also used to help treat cannabis dependence.</p>

  <p>Drop-in facilities, peer support, family support and complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, can also be useful in helping psychostimulant misusers.</p>

  <p>A working group of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse is reviewing the available evidence on best practice in prevention of psychostimulant misuse, and service provision for misusers. Evidence based on the findings of the working group will be issued later this year to those who plan and deliver drugs services.</p>

  <p>A marked register is used to show that ballot papers have been issued to a voter in person at the polling station. The by-election in the Teith ward was conducted as an election pilot under section 5 of the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Act 2002, and was conducted by an all-postal ballot. All registered voters were issued with a ballot paper by post and therefore a marked register was not used. The pilot resulted in a 63.2% turnout, an increase of 20% over the previous by-election.

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has been developing proposals for a trial re-introduction of the European beaver to Scotland for seven years. In January 2002 an application was submitted to the Executive for a licence to release, following importation and quarantine, a number of beavers in Forest Enterprise land at Knapdale, Argyll.</p>

  <p>The SNH proposal raises many questions and it is premature to speculate on when a final decision on SNH's application might be taken. In giving careful consideration to the application, my ministerial colleagues and I will have regard to all relevant factors before any decisions are made. These include the guidelines on re-introductions produced by the IUCN (the World Conservation Union) and the views of ACRE (Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment). The possibility of the Executive conducting a further external consultation cannot be ruled out.</p>

  <p>Where parents are separated their respective rights to information about their child's health or treatment depends on whether they have parental rights and responsibilities under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.

In deciding whether or not to share information with a parent, the child's welfare should be the paramount consideration for NHS boards and trusts.</p>

  <p>Guidelines for health professionals on children's capacity to consent and confidentiality are included in <em>Protecting Children - A Shared Responsibility: guidance for health professionals</em>, issued by the Health Department in 2000.

  <p>I can today announce the publication of the second public consultation paper on the <em>Review of Higher Education in Scotland</em> . The first consultation paper was launched in October 2001 and focused mainly on the performance of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. We plan to publish a short report on the responses to that paper in June. The second consultation paper invites comment on the wider higher education context and proposes a set of underlying principles on which higher education should be developed over the next decade. Responses are requested by the end of July. I am placing copies of the consultation paper in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 20840).</p>

  <p>This information requested is not held centrally.

  <p><em>Issues in Improving Quality in Private Houses: The first report of the Housing Improvement Task Force</em> makes no specific recommendations for action by the Executive and is intended to inform the second stage of the work of the Housing Improvement Task Force.

  <p>In launching the first stage report and in anticipation of the need to resource new policy initiatives in this area, I announced that &#163;10 million in 2003-04 would be available for the implementation of the task force's recommendations. The Executive will consider the need for further resource allocations in this area in the light of priorities identified in the expenditure review and the eventual recommendations of the task force itself.</p>

  <p>The Executive has already commissioned the Public Health Institute for Scotland to conduct a national review of child and adolescent mental health services. Their report is due later this year. In addition separate studies of adolescent psychiatry out-patient services, depression among adolescents and adolescent psychosis have been funded. Together, the findings will inform future decisions on the best organisation of services for this important care group.</p>

  <p>A national programme is also being developed to promote mental health and well-being and prevent mental health problems and illnesses, for both children and adults.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) is largely a response mode funder of research and this role is well known and advertised throughout the healthcare and academic community. Research proposals on ME or on any other health care issue are assessed on the basis of their scientific quality and potential relevance to the health of the Scottish people. Projects must be able to demonstrate "health gain" and potential to improve health care. Such assessments are made by expert peer group and committee review. Potential applicants are encouraged to discuss their research idea with CSO at an early stage, so that they can develop their proposals in a way that most directly addresses Scotland's public health and health services research needs. Comprehensive information and guidance on how to apply for a CSO research grant is available on the CSO website at:</p>

  <p>Following the English Chief Medical Officer's working group's report on CFS/ME, published on 11 January this year, the Department of Health in England asked the Medical Research Council (MRC) to draw up a research strategy, taking account of the working group's findings, other recent expert reviews and the views of patients and carers. Once the MRC's work is complete and the future strategic direction of research is clear, the Executive will seek to play a full part in the implementation of that strategy.</p>

  <p>Until that strategy is available, it would not be a sensible use of limited research funds for the Executive to commission large-scale epidemiological studies. Good quality research proposals into other aspects of CFS/ME will, however, be considered by the Chief Scientist Office by the usual peer review process.</p>

  <p>Since May 1999, the Executive has not contracted out any functions following a formal market testing process. However, the Executive routinely purchases a wide range of services under contract, some of which are to supplement in-house resources.</p>

  <p>The question S1W-23159 concerned allocation issues which are the responsibility of individual landlords. Whilst the Scottish Executive may issue general guidance on allocations, allocation policies and processes are monitored by Communities Scotland as part of their regulation of social landlords.

  <p>In order to inform its consideration of the fridges issue, on 6 December 2001 the Executive advised local authorities of the volumes of discarded fridges and freezers expected to arise in their area and asked whether their plans for dealing with such waste could cope with those volumes. The response provided the basis for the local authority grant announced in the answer given to question S1W-23475 on 7 March 2002.</p>

  <p>In other respects, each local authority is responsible for ensuring the safe disposal of the wastes it collects and the Executive does not collate information on how authorities have been dealing with discarded fridges and freezers.</p>
