  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the introduction of the aggregates tax in April 2002, whether the cost of any new computer software development to administer the tax correctly will be defrayed by the Executive or Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise and what consultation it has undertaken with quarry operators in order to arrive at a position on this matter as regards (a) any costs of such software and (b) whether there is sufficient time prior to its introduction for quarriers to develop any software required.</p>

  <p>The aggregates tax is a reserved matter. There are no plans to defray the cost of changes to computer software in Scotland. HM Treasury and Customs and Excise have included the quarrying industry in their consultations on the tax.</p>

  <p>The resources allocated in the Scottish Ambulance Service increased by &#163;5.3 million in 2001-02 and a further &#163;6.6 million in 2002-03 and &#163;3.6 million in 2003-04. The Scottish Ambulance Service is reassessing the impact of the European Working Time Directive on its operations to ensure that consistent, sustainable and high quality ambulance services are provided across Scotland, in a way which puts patients first and ensures that staff are able to give of their best.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>Modern apprentices start at different times throughout the year and there is no common set point for individuals to complete their apprenticeships, so the information above shows the proportion of young people who started MAs in the last two years and have completed their training or are still in training.</p>

  <p>Those who leave the modern apprenticeship programme before final completion often go on to positive outcomes, e.g. FE, other training or employment.</p>

  <p>All birds are legally protected in the UK. The Scottish Executive and Scottish Natural Heritage work with a variety of governmental and non-governmental organisations to maintain and enhance the status of various species of birds which have shown sustained periods of decline in recent years.</p>

  <p>Action includes protection and management of migratory and vulnerable/endangered species under the EU Birds Directive, including the classification of Special Protection Areas, together with projects involving re-introduction and species recovery programmes. Biodiversity action plans for those species most at risk throughout the UK are also in place.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is seeking to develop the way in which information is collected and collated for the school census, by maximising the potential for electronic data interchange with schools, in line with National Grid for Learning objectives. We are working with schools, local authorities and other interested players in the education field to develop a common set of detailed categories and standards for this data interchange.</p>

  <p>The content of the school census is kept under regular review in conjunction with education partners. An important consideration in this process is minimising the completion burden on schools. A copy of the survey forms used in the September 2000 school census, which show a detailed breakdown of all categories covered, has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The review is being led by officials within my Fisheries Group, but it is necessarily a cross-cutting exercise involving a number of other interests both within and outwith the Executive. As the first stage in this process, my officials wrote to those with an interest, inviting views by the end of April on how the existing arrangements might be improved. Formal consultation on a range of proposals will be undertaken over the summer. I expect to receive a final report towards the end of the year.</p>

  <p>As part of the wider range of checks on meat entering the UK announced on 3 May 2001, the agency is undertaking a programme of audits of ports and seaports to examine the effectiveness of UK border inspection arrangements operating there. This will cover commercial as well as personal imports. In Scotland the agency has provided additional guidance and asked local authorities to check for illegal imports as part of their routine inspection of food premises. To assist this process, an amendment to the Products of Animal Origin Regulations 1996 will strengthen the local authorities&#8217; powers to seize suspected illegal imports.</p>

  <p>Pieces of meat may carry a range of different diseases affecting both human health and animal health. The agency&#8217;s over-riding concern is the protection of public health. It is therefore very important to the agency that the legal requirements for imports of meat are observed, so that the measures designed to protect the public are effective.</p>

  <p>It was decided that the support would be most effective if targeted at rural local authority areas where the viability of businesses was threatened as a direct result of the outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease, and population density per hectare was the measure used to define rural areas for this purpose. These local authorities include all infected areas. 95% of the cost of the relief to small businesses in these areas is funded by the Scottish Executive, with local authorities making up the remaining 5% of the cost. Large businesses and those in all other areas are still eligible to apply for relief, 75% of which will be funded by the Scottish Executive and 25% by local authorities.</p>

  <p>The special circumstances which apply to hefted flock have been and will continue to be recognised when applying SERAD culling policy. The priority, however, has been to avoid any risk of the disease being spread through our hill areas and beyond, with possibly dire consequences for the whole of Scotland&#8217;s livestock industry. Now that the disease is under control the position of hefted flocks outwith infected premises will be assessed carefully before any cull goes ahead.</p>

  <p>For primary Gaelic-medium the Executive estimates that around 110 newly trained teachers will be required over the next seven years. There are 12 students undertaking a primary teaching qualification who may qualify as Gaelic-medium teachers this year. The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) are continuing to look to all institutions to respond positively to the need for teachers able to teach in the Gaelic medium through normal intakes to the BEd, Primary PGCE and Secondary PGCE courses. The provision of an extra 10 places is a step along the right route to fill any gap in teacher requirements in this area.</p>

  <p>The largest Gaelic-medium teacher requirements are specified by the Highlands and Islands and within the Glasgow area. The additional 10 funded places awarded by SHEFC to Strathclyde University in session 2001-02 specifically to support primary Gaelic-medium provision will have a significant impact in the geographic areas with the greatest need.</p>

  <p>SHEFC are continuing to monitor the situation and are seeking to improve information gathered from teacher education institutions which will inform the council&#8217;s future funding allocations specifically for Gaelic-medium teacher education.</p>

  <p>An onshore generating station of 50 megawatts or less will require the consent of the planning authority within whose boundaries the proposed development falls under section 28 of the 1997 Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act. The fee depends on the site area of the development, but the maximum would be &#163;10,500. Planning legislation requires applications to be determined within two months (four where an environmental impact assessment is required), unless the developer agrees in writing to an extension of this period. The time taken can vary considerably, however, depending on the issues involved in a particular case.</p>

  <p>If the proposed station exceeds 50 megawatts in size, consent must be obtained from Scottish Ministers under section 36 of the 1989 Electricity Act. This consent can also include deemed planning permission under section 57 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. An application for consent under the 1989 Act can attract a fee of between &#163;5,000 and &#163;20,000, depending on the output of the proposed scheme. There is no maximum time taken to issue such consents, although, as a guide, the relevant planning authority is allowed four months in which to submit its views as part of the consultation process.</p>

  <p>I attended a meeting on 26 April arranged by local MSPs with representatives of Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeen &amp; Grampian Tourist Board to discuss the issue. I hope that this meeting will lead to a resolution of the existing problems. However, decisions about funding and about the provision of TICs is a matter for local decision, not for the Executive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what financial assistance has been received by the National Trust for Scotland in respect of the proposed Glencoe visitor centre from (a) the European Rural Development Fund, (b) the Enterprise Network, (c) Scottish Natural Heritage and (d) any other public funding source and whether any such financial assistance places local restaurant and retail premises that have not yet received such funding at a competitive disadvantage.</a></p>

  <p>The National Trust for Scotland has received no financial assistance from the Enterprise Network in respect of the proposed Glencoe visitor centre. The Trust received &#163;178,750 from Scottish Natural Heritage in 1995 toward the purchase of the land for the development of the project.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to a letter he received in December 1999 from the National Trust for Scotland detailing a total of &#163;26,434 committed ERDF funding for the project. A copy of this letter will be placed for reference in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. This figure remains unaltered and no additional public sector funding has been provided to the National Trust for Scotland in respect of this project.</p>
