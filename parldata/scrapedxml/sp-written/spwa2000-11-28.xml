  <p>The Executive&#8217;s Action Plan for Dental Services in Scotland outlines a series of measures to improve oral health and access to NHS dental services throughout Scotland. An implementation support group has been set up to support and prioritise the proposals in the plan. The group had its first meeting on 27 November.</p>

  <p>Currently, it is open to Primary Care NHS Trusts to apply to Scottish Ministers for approval to appoint salaried dentists in areas where there are gaps in provision of NHS dental services. In addition, dentists wishing to set up or expand NHS practices in areas of unmet patient demand, including Banff and Buchan, or high oral health need may apply for grants under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive range of policy measures is in place to reduce unemployment in Scotland, including the establishing of Local Economic Forums, the New Futures Fund and a Review of the Training for Work Programme all of which aim to ensure that unemployed people can play an effective part in Scotland&#8217;s economic future.</p>

  <p>To directly encourage the creation of new employment opportunities and safeguard existing jobs in areas of relatively weaker economic performance, the Regional Selective Assistance and Invest for Growth grant schemes offer financial support to businesses located in the Assisted Areas. The Scottish Executive is also contributing &pound;454 million in supporting the Enterprise Network.</p>

  <p>Figures to the end-August show that 33,000 young people and long-term unemployed have gained employment through the New Deal in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Youth unemployment (18-24s unemployment for six months or more) in Scotland was around 3,000 in October 2000. This was 67% lower than in 1998. Long-term unemployment (over 25s who have been unemployment for two years or more) in Scotland was 11,000 in October 2000. This was 21% lower than October 1998, but has almost halved since 1997.</p>

  <p>I attended the Fisheries Council in Brussels on 17 November as part of the UK delegation.</p>

  <p>The council discussed the future policy for management of fleet capacity, building on the Commission&#8217;s mid-term review of the operation of the current Multi-Annual Guidance Programme (MAGP IV). The UK argued the need for maintaining and strengthening a range of controls in order to bring fishing effort into better balance with fish stocks. We also argued that, given the current over-capacity in the fleet, grants for constructing vessels are inappropriate. The Commission will include fleet management among the issues in its Green Paper next spring on the revision of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>

  <p>The Commission reported recent scientific advice that key cod, whiting and hake stocks were close to collapse. The UK delegation agreed that the situation was serious and supported the Commission&#8217;s approach that urgent action was needed to ensure effective recovery plans were introduced for 2001. We welcomed the Commission&#8217;s intention of looking at a mix of measures to aid recovery and the fact that the fishing industry was already being involved in developing these measures.</p>

  <p>The council discussed the impact of fuel price rises on the fishing sector. We strongly supported the Commission in opposing national operating subsidies and welcomed the Commission&#8217;s statement that measures taken by member states had to comply with state aid rules, and that they were taking action as appropriate to this end.</p>

  <p>The council also discussed a Commission proposal for a three-year continuation of Community financial support for fisheries enforcement. Final decisions on the proposal will be made in December. The council agreed to a two-year rollover of existing arrangements for control and enforcement action under NEAFC in the North East Atlantic. I argued that, while we could accept these proposals, the Community should take a larger role in carrying out control in international waters under the responsibility of regional fisheries organisations. I pushed for decisions to be taken on this and other control measures by June 2001. I also pressed the Commission to seek effective controls on over-fishing of Rockall haddock at the NEAFC annual meeting.</p>

  <p>The trial of David Montgomery and Andrew Coulter for the murder of Surjit Singh Chhokar concluded today at the High Court in Glasgow. Neither was convicted of the murder. Andrew Coulter was convicted of assaulting Surjit Singh Chhokar, while acting along with Ronnie Coulter, by repeatedly striking him on the body with a piece of wood and metal. He was also convicted of a charge of housebreaking at Mr Chhokar&#8217;s house and theft of a cooker and giro cheque and of a charge of uttering in connection with the giro cheque. He received a total sentence of 15 months detention, consecutive to the sentence that he is currently serving.</p>

  <p>David Montgomery was acquitted. I acknowledge that mistakes were made in this case, particularly in relation to the level of support and information given to the late Mr Chhokar&#8217;s family. I am determined that all possible lessons will be learnt and I am today setting up independent inquiries to look into two separate aspects of the case.</p>

  <p>Sir Anthony Campbell, of the Northern Ireland Judiciary, will carry out an independent examination of the Crown&#8217;s decision making following the death of Surjit Singh Chhokar, including the decision to indict Ronald Coulter separately from Andrew Coulter and David Montgomery. He will have the opportunity to interview all staff in the PF office at Hamilton and Crown Office as well as Advocate Deputes and Law Officers who dealt with the case. Sir Anthony will make such findings and recommendations for changes in practice and procedure as he sees fit. Sir Anthony&#8217;s findings will be published.</p>

  <p>Raj Jandoo, Advocate and Deputy Chair of the Scottish Executive Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Steering Group, will review and report on the liaison arrangements between the police, the Procurator Fiscal Service, and the Crown Office and the family of Surjit Singh Chhokar. As part of his remit, Dr Jandoo will consider and complete an internal report prepared by the Crown Office. He will take evidence from the family of Surjit Singh Chhokar, their representatives and from the police. He will also consult the Commission for Racial Equality and Victim Support Scotland. While most of the inquiry will be conducted in private, there will also be a public dimension to consider draft recommendations. Dr Jandoo&#8217;s findings and recommendations for action will also be published.</p>

  <p>The Deputy First Minister will be inviting the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Steering Group, which comprises representatives of the police, Crown Office, Commission for Racial Equality and independent members, to oversee the implementation of Dr Jandoo&#8217;s recommendations.</p>

  <p>A number of measures have already taken place to implement the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry in Scotland, including the production of a Racial Diversity Strategy and Guidance Manual by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, Crown Office guidance prosecution of racist crimes and a programme of anti-racist training for Crown Office staff. Her Majesty&#8217;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary has carried out a thematic inspection on the police and race issues in Scotland which will be published in the New Year. The steering group has reviewed the Executive&#8217;s action plan and their report will also be published shortly. We intend to build on this progress that has already been made in taking forward the lessons to be learnt from the Chhokar case.</p>

  <p>Assistance is available from the Executive for certain fishery-related harbour development, for pier and harbour improvements in the Highlands and Islands and from the EC through European Funds (ERDF) in eligible areas. Freight Facility Grants (FFG) can also be available for inland waterway projects and such projects can include expenditure on ports and harbours. Ports and harbours infrastructure are likely to be eligible for grants under the proposed extension of the FFG scheme to short sea and coastal shipping. Otherwise, port and harbour authorities are responsible for making their own investment decisions and raising finance.</p>

  <p>Estimated expenditure for the Executive&#8217;s schemes in the current financial year (2000-01) is set out below. ERDF estimated expenditure figures for ports and harbours for the current financial year are not available.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why the target set in Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s Business Birth Rate Strategy in 1993 for Scotland to at least equal the UK average in the number of new businesses created each year per head of population by the end of the 1990s has not been achieved and what steps it will take to address this situation.</p>

  <p>The objective set by Scottish Enterprise for the Business Birth Rate Strategy was very ambitious. In early 2000 Scottish Enterprise conducted a review to consider why the target had not been achieved. This is available on their website. Their review concluded that, although the number of new businesses created per head of population remained below the UK average, there had been some improvements in the infrastructure to support new businesses and an increase in the number of people enthusiastic about starting a business, and that these changes would have effect in the longer term.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise are about to commission an independent review of the strategy to help focus on ways to improve the strategy in the 21st century. We are also working closely with Scottish Enterprise to improve our support for the small business sector, for example through the recent introduction of the Small Business Gateway.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will examine the findings of the recent survey, commissioned by HEBS and ASH (Scotland) on public perceptions of passive smoking, when they become available.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises the importance for public awareness and understanding of issues surrounding passive smoking. Everyone should be able to be free from smoke and the effects of smoke wherever possible. It is important for employers, owners and managers of premises to understand these issues and to share the responsibility for creating smoke-free environments</p>

  <p>The Executive will consider the need for a public awareness campaign on the effects of passive smoking in the light of the results of this latest survey when known, together with the impact of the Scottish Voluntary Charter on Smoking in Public Places and the HSE&#8217;s proposed Approved Code of Practice on Passive Smoking in the Workplace.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer how much the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body has spent to date on producing core Parliamentary publications and publishing them on the internet.</p>

  <p>The SPCB has a contract with TSO for the provision of print and electronic information publishing services. We currently operate on a management fee basis, which includes the page layout, construction and HTML mark-up of all core parliamentary publications. There is a common production process for much of the preparation for both print and electronic publication. It is therefore not possible to identify separately the cost of publishing them on the internet.</p>

  <p>The only staff employed solely to produce core parliamentary publications are those in the Official Report. No staff work solely on either the internet or the paper publication of core parliamentary publications.</p>
