  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to making asthma a national priority in health care in light of new research from Asthma UK stating that for 20% of people with asthma in Scotland, there are still no medicines that adequately control their condition.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-05-20.S2O-2391.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0520.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>The importance we attach to tackling asthma is reflected in the range of measures currently underway in Scotland, including:</p>

  <p>The new GP contract includes asthma as a condition, which will attract extra remuneration for doctors, if they meet standards of care. All practices are required to provide essential services, including management of chronic disease in a manner determined by the practice in discussion with the patient.</p>

  <p>The new contracts for other health professionals enable the use of their expertise to address the review and management of people with asthma in the wider primary care teams. For example, the pharmacy strategy, The Right Medicine, is developing the role of community pharmacists through model schemes. This includes pharmacists taking part in the chronic disease management of asthma.</p>

  <p>Some personal medical pilots, which are another form of GP contract, have also been funded to develop improved chronic disease management in asthma.</p>

  <p>Practice accreditation procedures look into the management of chronic diseases including asthma. This involves following protocols and guidelines and the intention is that all practices should be accredited by the end of 2004.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, which is funded by the Executive through NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, published good practice guidelines on asthma management jointly with the British Thoracic Society in February last year.</p>

  <p>Other initiatives by the Executive which will benefit people with asthma include our efforts to reduce smoking in public places and the yearly influenza vaccination for high-risk groups including asthma.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Chief Scientist Office is currently committed to funding nine research projects on asthma at a cost of &#163;783,439.</p>

  <p>Community Health Partnerships (which were signalled in the White Paper, <em>Partnership for Care) </em>will have a particular focus on delivering improvements in the management of chronic conditions. They will have a critical role as the main focus for service integration for local communities with a particular emphasis on closing the health gap and delivering improvements particularly in relation to the management of chronic diseases for adults and children. One of their strengths will be their ability to provide a holistic approach to care.</p>

  <p>Five councils, Western Isles, Argyll and Bute, Stirling, Inverclyde and Renfrewshire have declared their intention to transfer their housing stock, subject of course to the wishes of tenants. If these transfers proceed, around 40,000 more houses will move into community ownership. Stirling Council has already been formally accepted on to the Community Ownership Programme. We expect the other four councils to join the programme shortly.</p>

  <p>I firmly believe that transfer remains the best means for a number of councils to achieve the Scottish Housing Quality Standard and a number of other councils are currently considering their position in relation to transfer.</p>

  <p>Patients on incapacity benefit who realise they have mistakenly claimed exemption from NHS prescription charges and who pay back the prescription charge to NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services (CFS) are not required to pay any penalty charges.</p>

  <p>Where a patient on incapacity benefit does not reply to the letter of enquiry from the CFS, a penalty charge may be imposed. If, however, the patient then contacts the CFS and explains that he or she is on incapacity benefit, the penalty charge will be waived. The CFS will also offer information on how to apply for help with NHS charges under the NHS Low Income Scheme.</p>

  <p>Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 the trunk road operating companies are required to clear litter from motorways and special roads. For the south east, south west and north east units 33,472 man hours were spent in 2003-04 collecting 32,998 refuse bags of litter. There are no motorways or special roads in the north west unit. It would not be appropriate to provide details of costs paid to the operating companies for this work because of commercial and contractual considerations.</p>

  <p>The collection of litter on all other trunk roads is a matter for local councils. The information requested is not held centrally for these routes.</p>

  <p>Much of the litter that requires to be removed from the trunk road network, particularly in the urban environment, is wind borne from surrounding areas and does not necessarily originate from road vehicles. Local authorities have the power under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to issue Fixed Penalty Notices of &#163;50 for littering. This power is to be extended to the police through the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>The shortage of social care staff is being addressed on a national basis. We have taken a number of initiatives including a national recruitment campaign, unprecedented investment in social work education, a fast-track scheme for graduates and an incentive scheme to attract qualified staff to hard to fill posts.</p>

  <p>There are more qualified social workers in Scotland now than at any time in the past and this year we have seen an increase in applications for undergraduate programmes of 26%. However, demand for social workers remains high, especially in the cities. We are committed to providing sustained help and recently, for example, I confirmed that the fast track recruitment of social workers will be sustained for five years.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Education and Young People has announced a fundamental review of social work across Scotland and he will provide more detail about that before the summer recess. The key aim of the review is to enhance the contribution of social work services.</p>
