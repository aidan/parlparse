  <p>The Executive&#8217;s targets in relation to enterprise are set out in <em>Building a Better Scotland</em> (BABS) which was published in September 2002. As is noted in BABS, several of these targets are derived from the progress measures set out in <em>Measuring Scotland&#8217;s Progress Towards a Smart, Successful Scotland</em> . The latest report on progress against these measures was published on the Executive&#8217;s website in March 2003.</p>

  <p>Additionally, we shall further promote an enterprise culture in our <u>schools</u>, through Determined to Succeed (DtS) our strategy for Enterprise in Education (E in E). We are working with local authorities (LAs) to develop E in E plans detailing how DtS will be delivered locally. We will agree targets with LAs based on local needs and against the background of our wish to make sure every pupil has the opportunity to learn entrepreneurial skills at school.</p>

  <p>The Pollution, Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 introduced stringent controls specifically to regulate noise from relevant industrial installations.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is preparing to implement, by July 2004, Council Directive 2002/49/EC on the assessment and management of environmental noise. The directive requires several initiatives to be put in place relating to noise from roads, railways, airports and industry. These initiatives are to be taken forward progressively and include noise mapping, provision of information to the public on environmental noise and its effects and, where necessary, the adoption of action plans with a view to preventing and reducing excessive noise.</p>

  <p>The intention is that schemes will be established locally on a voluntary basis by local authorities and landlords working in partnership, and work is in progress to provide suitable advice and guidance. Communities Scotland has commissioned a project to be completed by the spring of next year, which will develop an appropriate set of core standards to which accreditation could refer, together with good practice for private landlords. The project will also produce a guide to good practice for the establishment and operation of local accreditation schemes. Where a local authority does not establish a scheme, Communities Scotland will provide the necessary support for landlords to do so themselves.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland&#8217;s promotion of Scotland in UK and overseas tourism markets uses the tremendous appeal of Scottish food and drink as a vitally important part of its marketing message. An excellent example of this was the recent and very successful Scotland with Catalonia event in Barcelona. Scottish food and drink companies were integral to this event, as they were last year during the similar Scotland in Sweden event in Stockholm.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland is committed to raising the quality of experience our visitors receive throughout their time in Scotland.

  <p>Support for local authority youth work provision is provided through community education Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE). In the current year, Glasgow&#8217;s allocation of GAE for community education amounts to &#163;13.103 million, approximately half of which is estimated to be for youth work. As announced in Finance Circular No. 10-2002 (Local Government Financial settlement: 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06) an extra allowance of &#163;5 million has been made available for youth work across Scotland from year 2004-05 until 2005-06. Glasgow&#8217;s share of this extra money amounts to &#163;1.04 million.</p>
