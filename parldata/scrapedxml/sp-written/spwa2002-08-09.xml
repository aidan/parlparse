  <p>The table shows, for each Ambulance Service Division, the number of emergency responses made and the percentage of those where a trained paramedic was on board. Across Scotland this represents a 54% paramedic response rate. The service aim to achieve a 100% paramedic response rate to emergency calls by 2005. The allocation which the service has received for 2002-03, along with the indicative uplifts for 2003-04 and 2004-05, have enabled it to plan to increase the overall complement of front-line emergency staff and to train 250 more technicians to become paramedics.</p>

  <p>The Safe from Harm initiative is part of a wider child safety awareness raising campaign being run by Fife Child Protection Committee. The Executive is part funding the campaign with Fife Council and the committee was awarded &#163;20,000 in February 2001 under the &quot;Make Our Communities Safer&quot; Challenge Competition. The competition requires applicants to conduct an evaluation of the project within 18 months of its completion. The campaign is still on-going and Safe from Harm was only launched in June so it is too early to gauge its impact. It would be for other councils to decide whether they wished to introduce the initiative within their own areas. Once the evaluation is available it may be possible to determine whether it would be suitable for wider application.</p>

  <p>There are a number of legislative provisions directly and indirectly related to the harvesting of cockles (including fishing, food and environmental legislation). In terms of fisheries legislation:</p>

  <p>In Scotland, orders may be made under the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984 to prohibit fishing for sea fish (including shellfish) in a particular area;</p>

  <p>In England, Sea Fisheries Committees are empowered to make byelaws for the management and conservation of their district&#146;s fisheries;</p>

  <p>In Scotland and in England, Regulating Orders may be granted under the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 to provide for the maintenance and regulation of a fishery for shellfish.</p>

  <p>The damaging exploitation of a cockle bed also falls within the scope of nature conservation legislation on both sides of the border, where the cockle bed is situated within the boundaries of a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest, Special Area of Conservation or Special Protection Area.</p>

  <p>A Clinical Resource and Audit Group funded report, on the care of the elderly in long-term care (published in August 2000) examined this issue. The NHS was asked to implement the recommendations flowing from this work in a joint letter from the Chief Nursing Officer and Deputy Chief Medical Officer (18 December 2000). The Scottish Health Plan reminded the service of the need to implement these recommendations. Audit Scotland has initiated a study of hospital catering which reviews the best value of catering services in the NHS in Scotland; this work will also monitor implementation of the CRAG audit and Scottish Diet Action Plan recommendations. The Information Statistics Division of NHS Scotland has developed a system for annual collection of data on nutritional status and longer term monitoring arrangements based on this are under consideration.</p>

  <p>A number of documents, including the <i>Scottish Diet Action Plan</i> and the CRAG-funded audit into the nutrition of elderly people in long-term care, make recommendations relating to the employment of suitably trained staff. Departmental guidance on nutritional care reflects these recommendations. But the main way in which nutritional care will be improved is through the Clinical Standards Board&#146;s development of a standard for food and nutritional care. The NHS in Scotland will be expected to meet this standard when published next year.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Data for 2001 on persons proceeded against in court will be published in autumn 2002.</p>

  <p>The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim, and a crime may be recorded in one year and proceedings taken in a subsequent year. Charges recorded by the police may also be altered as a result of the judicial process.</p>

<ques id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-08-09.19.q0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80176" speakername="Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab)" spid="S1W-27564" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0809.htm#10">

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to section 50, paragraphs 5 (a) and (b) of the Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill, what impact the threshold of ownership of at least three quarters of units in the development in respect of sections 27 and 32 of the bill will have on those resident in a shared equity complex.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-08-09.19.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0809.htm#10">

  <p>The effect of section 27 of the Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill will be that a simple majority will be able to appoint a manager for the complex if the title deeds do not provide for an alternative decision-making process. Section 32 will allow the owners of a simple majority of the units to vary or discharge burdens affecting a housing complex. Section 50 of the bill provides for a special majority in relation to &quot;core burdens&quot; in a sheltered or retirement housing scheme. These are burdens which regulate facilities or services that make a development particularly suitable for occupation by the elderly or infirm. Attempts to use section 32 to vary these core burdens will require the consent of the owners of 75% of the units. Discharge will not be possible. A simple majority will still be able to appoint a manager in a sheltered complex using section 27, but a 75% majority will be required to confer certain powers on the manager. These special majorities have been introduced as a result of the Executive&#146;s consultation exercise for the bill.</p>

  <p>The provisions of the bill allow the person(s) who hold the majority share in an individual unit to exercise the vote for that unit in respect of decisions under sections 27 and 32. As a result, if an occupier owned 80% of the property and the developer 20%, the occupier would control that property&#146;s vote in decisions made under sections 27 and 32.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to introduce a separate charge for the collection of domestic waste. To achieve the objectives of the National Waste Strategy for sustainable waste management there will be a need for significant changes in householders&#146; attitude to the waste that they produce. We need to encourage people to separate out waste that can be reused or recycled, and to try to reduce the amount of rubbish that they produce. We are considering how we can best encourage this change of behaviour.</p>
