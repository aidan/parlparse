  <p>Although no further discussions have been held specifically about deer farmers, we did make successful representations at the time of the June Agriculture Council that will allow us flexibility to operate the National Reserve within Scotland. This flexibility is reflected in our recent consultation paper: Reform of the EU Fruit and Vegetable Regime and Deer Farming: Proposed Changes to the Single Farm Payment Scheme <em>.</em></p>

  <p><em>Principles and Priorities &ndash; The Government&rsquo;s Programme for Scotland</em> , published in September 2007, highlighted a range of commitments which will produce positive outcomes for deprived individuals and communities across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Examples of specific commitments include: the establishment of a ministerial task force on health inequalities; &pound;9 million of funding for 300 additional teachers, primarily in pre-school and in primary 1-3 in deprived areas; &pound;5 million to pilot free school lunches for some of the country&rsquo;s most vulnerable children in primary 1-3; and &pound;19.5 million for the new Scottish enhanced services programme to provide accessible community based and integrated health services, and to reduce health inequalities.</p>

  <p>The Higher Education Statistics Agency produces annual performance indicators showing proportion of students from low participation groups in each higher education institution. These are used to monitor performance over time. Additionally, for the first time this year, the Scottish Government published data on entrants to higher education by areas of deprivation which, over time, will allow us to measure whether there has been any improvement in the figures.</p>

  <p>Ministers from the previous administration set out areas where it expected to see an increase in participation in higher education in a letter to the Scottish Further and Higher Education Council &ndash; progression from schools with a low participation rate, articulation from higher national courses to degree study and mature students from deprived areas. All of these were linked to improved retention. These measures were included in the proposals in the council&rsquo;s Learning for All report on widening access. The funding council has set up a national action group to advise on taking forward the action plan arising from Learning for All. This group monitors progress and advises the funding council on widening access</p>

  <p>The private rented sector plays a vital role in the provision of housing in rural areas, accounting for about 11% of all rural households.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides support for the private rented sector in rural areas through rural empty properties grants to help increase the supply of affordable housing by making grants to landlords for improvements to empty properties, which are then rented to local tenants at affordable rents. We have also provided funding to the Scottish Rural Property and Business Association (SRPBA) to help the SRPBA provide support to private landlords.More generally, the Housing Supply Task Force has been charged with tackling the obstacles, such as land supply and planning issues, which have been hampering the delivery of more housing of all types. One of its early priorities is to examine the barriers to adequate housing provision in rural areas.</p>

  <p>All NHS/local authority partnerships have submitted joint action plans detailing initiatives to eliminate delayed discharges over the agreed six week discharge planning period and all delays in short-stay specialties by April 2008. &pound;30 million is being allocated to partnerships this year to achieve this.</p>

  <p>Great progress has been made in reducing the number of people inappropriately delayed in hospital. The latest census, taken in July shows a reduction of 80% in the number of delays over six weeks, since these figures peaked in October 2001</p>

This will include patients who were not considered to have social work involvement in their discharge planning process or in their post-hospital care arrangements. A patient ready for discharge is not considered to have social work involvement in their discharge planning process if the principal reason for delay is in the Healthcare groups; or principal reason for delay is in the Patient/Carer/Family - related categories and a date of referral for social care assessment has not been recorded.2. Number of patients ready for discharge in all specialties.3.

  <p>I have established a Dementia Forum to provide input and advice on all aspects of the dementia agenda including approaches to further raising awareness of the benefits of healthy lifestyles for all aspects of physical and mental health.</p>

  <p>Funding support is also given to Dementia Services Development Centre and to Alzheimer Scotland for their general functions including the production of educational materials and planning of events for both healthcare workers and the wider public on lifestyle approaches that may help reduce the incidence of dementia. There are also common messages in other published health campaigns including smoking cessation, reduced alcohol consumption and the links between physical exercise and health</p>

  <p>Deprivation factors are among those contained within the local government finance distribution methodology which is kept under constant review jointly by the Scottish Government and COSLA. That review process will continue to take account of proposals to make the methodology fairer and more accurate.</p>

  <p>The NHS Scotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) was established in 2005 to improve the method currently used (the Arbuthnott Formula) to divide the NHS budget among the territorial NHS boards. The NRAC report was submitted to the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing on the 4 September 2007. The Cabinet Secretary is seeking the views of the Health and Sport Committee on the recommendations contained within the report. In both the Arbuthnott Formula and the proposed NRAC Formula, the aim is not to adjust for deprivation per se, but instead to take account of how the morbidity and life circumstances of the population affects their needs for healthcare</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to (a) alter the use of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation as a mechanism for resource allocation to areas of deprivation and (b) increase funding to these areas to tackle deprivation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will use the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation to inform the allocation of resources which aim to tackle or take account of area-based concentrations of multiple deprivation. All detailed decisions on funding will be made as part of the spending review process.</p>
