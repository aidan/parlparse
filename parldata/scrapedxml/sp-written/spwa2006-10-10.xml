  <p>When I meet the major retailers, I emphasise how seriously the Executive views the importance of maintaining a sustainable food chain with healthy trading relationships between suppliers and retailers. I also recommended that the Competition Commission&rsquo;s current inquiry should address the importance of encouraging collaborative trading relationships within the supply chain for groceries so that the commercial viability of primary producers and processors is not undermined by short-term price pressures brought to bear by retailers.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that debt is calculated at the point of entering repayment (i.e. 31 March 2006) rather than at the point of graduation. Therefore, the majority of customers who have ceased to be students in 2006 will not enter repayment until 2007 and we cannot provide figures for these students as yet.</p>
