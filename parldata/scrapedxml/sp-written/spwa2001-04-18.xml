  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-13805 by Ross Finnie on 14 March 2001, whether any information on the impact of farmers&#8217; markets is available as a result of any such markets receiving funding under the LEADER II programme.</p>

  <p>Only a small number of farmers&#8217; markets in Scotland have been assisted under the LEADER II Programme. In these cases, funding was directed towards initial costs such as assistance towards incorporation of Angus Farmers&#8217; Market as a friendly society and a study investigating the feasibility of running a market in the Borders. The only information available on the impact of farmers&#8217; markets as a result of funding was that the Inverness market did not have a negative impact on local businesses. Prior to all markets being suspended owing to foot-and-mouth disease, those markets which received funding were still operating.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many consultant clinical and medical oncologists were employed at each of the five Scottish specialist cancer centres in the year to September 2000 and how many patients were seen per consultant at each centre during this period.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-04-18.S1W-14854.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0418.htm#3">

  <p>The number of consultant clinical and medical oncologists employed at each of the Trusts that contain the five Scottish specialist centres, is shown in table 1. These figures do not include the impact of the additional posts I announced on 28 June 2000, which includes four new WTE consultants in the oncology specialties. Oncology services are delivered by teams and, in addition to this increase in the consultant workforce, the number of Specialist Registrars in oncology is increasing substantially.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify the number of patients seen per consultant from the data collected centrally. Information is collected on the number of patient episodes occurring at each centre, and figures for the year ending 30 September 2000 are shown in table 2. The number of patient episodes is not the same as the number of patients seen, as the number of visits by an individual patient varies according to the type and stage of the disease. These figures do not include outreach patients seen outwith the centre, nor do they indicate the contribution made by other members of the oncology team. For these reasons, and as consultant levels at 30 September may not represent staffing present throughout the year, this data cannot be used to provide a robust indicator of the total workload per consultant.</p>

  <p>2. Data at 30 September 2000 is provisional.</p>

  <p>3. It is assumed that the medical and clinical oncologists are working at the specialist centres within the Trust.</p>

  <p>4. The difference in the totals for Scotland and the totals for the five trusts is due to some consultants working part-time outside the main cancer centres.</p>

  <p>5. The two oncologists at Highland Acute Hospitals NHS Trust give both radiotherapy and chemotherapy.</p>

  <p>The Carbon Trust was launched on 20 March and only came into being at UK level on 1 April 2001. It has a Chairman, but has not yet appointed a Chief Executive and is currently operating with only a skeleton staff. All discussions to date have been about internal operational issues and there has been little substantive discussion about how the trust will operate in Scotland.

  <p>Where possible, businesses affected by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak will receive advice from the relevant Small Business Gateway and Local Enterprise Company advisers.

  <p>Research and development with respect to renewable energy technologies is a reserved matter, and is funded by the Department of Trade and Industry. A DTI White Paper published earlier this year included a major initiative aimed at expanding the use of solar photovoltaics across the UK, with &#163;10 million committed for the first three years of this programme. We will remain in close contact with DTI colleagues as the details are developed.</p>

  <p>In addition, since April 2000, a reduction of VAT from 17.5% to 5%, has been available for professionally installed solar panels.</p>

  <p>The EC Water Framework Directive requires member states to put in place a comprehensive system of controls on the abstraction of water from the environment. Member states can exempt from control abstractions that have no significant impact on the state of the water environment. We are currently developing our proposals for implementing the directive in Scotland, including on abstraction controls. It is too early to say what form those controls might take. However, there is no scope within the directive for exempting whole industries from the abstraction control regime.</p>

  <p>In its 1999 report on the state of Scotland&#8217;s water environment the Scottish Environment Protection Agency identified water abstraction by distilleries as one of the pressures affecting water quantity. We will undertake a thorough assessment of the environmental effects of this and other impacts on the water environment in the implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive.</p>
