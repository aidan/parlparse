  <p>The Scottish Government does not intend to introduce measures to combat the varroa mite in bee colonies. Varroa is now considered endemic in Scotland and is neither a notifiable nor reportable disease.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does have an interest in the mite and the impact it has on honey bees if not managed properly. To assist and educate beekeepers in the recognition of varroa and methods to manage the mite, the Scottish Government funds a full-time post of a specialist bee adviser at the Scottish Agricultural College to provide free advice and training for beekeepers.</p>

  <p>Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture, part of the Rural Payments and Inspectorate Directorate, also provides a free diagnostic service to beekeepers to confirm the presence of varroa in hive debris.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Table 1 of the <em>Scottish Government&rsquo;s Recorded Crime in Scotland 2007-08</em> publication shows the number of recorded instances of shoplifting per year from 1998-99 to 2007-08.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not produce estimates of the economic cost of shoplifting in Scotland. However, the Home Office has produced an estimate of the average economic and social costs associated with a theft from a shop. This is available in The Economic and Social Costs of Crime (Home Office Research Study 217) <em><a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/hors217.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/hors217.pdf</a></em>.</p>

  <p>2. Incorporates an approximate mapping of sheriff courts into local authority areas. Some sheriff courts will deal with cases from more than one local authority area. Four local authority areas, namely East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Midlothian and North Ayrshire, do not contain a sheriff court.</p>

  <p>1. Where main offence.</p>

  <p>2. Incorporates an approximate mapping of sheriff courts into local authority areas. Some sheriff courts will deal with cases from more than one local authority area. Four local authority areas, namely East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Midlothian and North Ayrshire, do not contain a sheriff court.</p>

  <p>3. Contains a small number of cases where local authority is unknown.</p>

  <p>Tackling domestic abuse and other forms of gender-based violence is a vital priority for this government which is why we have allocated &pound;44 million over the financial period 2008-11 to support the agenda.</p>

  <p>The Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) is one of our key partners in taking this work forward. Government officials meet regularly with the VRU to discuss progress addressing gender based violence, including the implementation of the National Domestic Abuse Delivery Plan for Children and Young People. Most recently, from December 2008 to January 2009, the VRU ran a campaign of co-ordinated police action aimed at reducing the levels of domestic abuse in Scotland. The campaign launch took place a few weeks before the launch of the government&rsquo;s Annual Domestic Abuse Campaign. Officials from the VRU worked closely with the government&rsquo;s Violence Against Women Team to ensure we maximised the impact of these initiatives.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA) recently ran a &quot;Shared Responsibility&quot; campaign aimed at changing social attitudes towards cocaine by highlighting the environmental impact that cocaine use in Scotland has on communities in Columbia. The campaign was targeted at the whole population, including families, workers and students.</p>

  <p>The government supports the SCDEA to run a series of concert style events, in May each year, which are targeted at P7 school children to promote positive life choices and give messages about the dangers of substance misuse and the consequences of their use.</p>

  <p>Reliable information about the drug using population is key in the development of policy and practice. The Information Services Division of NHS Scotland collates information about individuals entering drug treatment services. Of those, it identifies people in full-time education and training, although this is a broader category than students alone. Obtaining prevalence and consumption estimates for cocaine use is especially difficult, however, because users do not often come into contact with services. In the future, we will be exploring how to improve data collection in relation to psychostimulants.</p>

  <p>SCDEA activity under the Shared Responsibility campaign is a general awareness campaign which has been, and will continue to be, promoted to varied audiences via a range of media and initiatives. The engagement with students in Scotland, which was supported by the National Union of Students, was part of this wider exercise to seek to reduce future demand for cocaine based on a better understanding of the effect its consumption has on the environment and communities of Colombia.</p>

  <p>No such meetings have taken place as any cost to Scotland in implementing the cross-border health care directive is primarily a matter for the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The cost to treat patients abroad will ultimately fall on the home NHS board. The cross-border health care proposals, as they stand, state that the reimbursement to the patient cannot exceed the cost of the treatment had it been received in the home state health care system. Therefore, the cost should be limited to the expense that would have been incurred by the local NHS service provider.</p>

  <p>The draft Directive does not seek to confer additional rights to treatment to which the patient is not entitled to receive at home. The UK Government is aware of, and agrees with, our view that it is essential that the Directive includes provision for prior authorisation from the home health care provider before a patient can travel abroad for treatment, and is negotiating on our behalf on that basis.</p>

  <p>In addition to the benefits of more modern IT systems being provided to GP practices, the replacement of GPASS is intended to produce savings that will allow NHS boards to invest in other areas of IT to support shifting the balance of care. For patient care this will mean, for example, Community Nurses and Allied Health Professionals being equipped with modern IT to enable electronic communication.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland has in place the SCI Gateway IT system, specifically designed to enable exchange of patient information in electronic form between primary and secondary care. 75% of GP referrals to hospital already pass through this system, with benefits to patient care such as faster and more reliable sharing of the patient&rsquo;s health problems between clinicians. The new GP systems that are due to be procured will be compatible with SCI Gateway. NHS boards are working towards the target of 90% of GP to hospital referrals being managed electronically by December 2010.</p>

  <p>It is standard practice in most parts of Scotland for the police to notify local licensing boards of any reports that they make to the Procurator Fiscal about offences concerning the sale of alcohol to those under 18.</p>

  <p>This position will be strengthened when the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 comes into force on 1 September 2009 as it will require all convictions of premises licence holders and personal licence holders for sales to those under 18 to be notified to the relevant licensing board.</p>

  <p>Both the court and the licence holder will be required to notify the licensing board of a relevant conviction. The licensing board may then hold a hearing to decide whether further action should be taken.</p>

  <p>There is wide support for the establishment of such a body and for the improved marine management arrangements it will deliver. Awaiting the passage of the Marine Bill would have meant substantive delay in establishing new delivery arrangements. Establishing Marine Scotland now means it can begin to integrate existing functions and resources and prepare for new functions once the bill is enacted. It also has the benefit of ending uncertainty for the staff involved and others.</p>

  <p>Establishing Marine Scotland as a delivery-orientated directorate of Scottish Government means it can deliver better integrated policy, science and other marine management functions than would be possible through a non-departmental public body. Combining marine expertise and resources will mean Marine Scotland is well placed to champion Scotland&rsquo;s seas and play a key role in the UK, Europe and internationally. It is also more transparent through direct accountability to the Scottish Parliament and offers value for money.</p>

  <p>A non-departmental body would be more complex and costly to establish and operate and has the significant drawback of fragmentation of functions.</p>

  <p>While there were differences of view on the most appropriate status for Marine Scotland, this is also the approach favoured by the largest group of respondents on the Marine Bill consultation who expressed a view on this issue.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland will lead on measures to achieve good environmental status in Scottish waters and we believe there are benefits in integrating within the same organisation lead responsibility relating to policy, science and delivery arrangements for marine nature conservation across Scotland&rsquo;s seas. That will allow informed and, where appropriate, balanced decisions to be taken on marine nature conservation alongside other issues.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland will continue to consider advice from Scottish Natural Heritage and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee on marine nature conservation issues, as appropriate.</p>

  <p>Integrating responsibility for fisheries policy and management alongside other marine management responsibilities within a single organisation will mean that Marine Scotland can bring to bear the necessary range of experience, expertise and policy interests. Consequently, it will be better placed itself to make and to offer consolidated advice to ministers so that they can make, informed and, where appropriate, balanced judgements and decisions about how best to manage our marine assets and resources. Amongst other things, this should help reassure fishing and other interests that appropriate, sustainable decisions have been taken.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland will take an overarching responsibility for marine management, including through the development of a marine planning framework and national marine plan, and allowing the development of local/regional plans. These will reflect strategic priorities, including in relation to the development of marine renewable energy sources.</p>

  <p>Integrating the range of policy, planning, science and other functions within Marine Scotland means that it can bring to bear the necessary range of experience, expertise and policy interests and promote achievement of our key strategic aims in an informed and authoritative way. As part of Scottish Government, it will also be well placed to work with policy colleagues elsewhere in the Scottish Government, its agencies and local government. This sort of integrated approach would be more difficult under a non-departmental public body.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland will integrate the existing roles and responsibilities of the Scottish Government Marine Directorate, Fisheries Research Services and the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. That includes their current decision-making functions in relation to marine nature conservation. To the extent that these responsibilities already rest with the Scottish Government or its agencies, this effectively maintains the status quo. Marine Scotland will continue to seek advice from Scottish Natural Heritage and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee as appropriate. We plan further provisions and functions related to marine nature conservation under the Marine Bill.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for some decisions relating to marine nature conservation &ndash; for example, related to the question of any proceedings for alleged offences &ndash; currently rests elsewhere. We have no plans to change that approach.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland will develop and implement Scottish ministers&rsquo; policies on marine issues in Scottish seas. SNH is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s statutory nature conservation adviser and its functions include provision of advice to ministers on the development and implementation of policies for, or affecting, the natural heritage of Scotland, including Scottish territorial waters. The Scottish Government has a duty under the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 to have regard to any representations made by SNH on proposals for developments that are likely to have a significant effect on Natura 2000 sites in Scotland. We intend to retain SNH&rsquo;s role as statutory adviser on nature conservation issues in territorial waters.</p>

  <p>Yes, the Scottish Government is aware of a lack of available clinical placements for dietetics students. A range of actions are in hand to identify solutions to this issue.</p>

  <p>The Chief Health Professions Officer (CHPO) at the Scottish Government has discussed the issues with the NHS Chairs and Chief Executives who agreed to take action within their individual board areas. NHS Education for Scotland (NES) has also reinforced the scale of the current situation with NHS Chief Executives. NES and the higher education institutions (HEIs) that provide dietetic programmes are also working with NHS boards to increase the number of available placements. NES is also leading work to develop a Memorandum of Understanding between HEIs and NHS boards for the provision of clinical placements for health professions students, including dietetics.</p>

  <p>The Dietetic Alliance has recently written to each NHS board chief executive detailing the shortfall of placements in their NHS board area and asking them to take immediate action.</p>

  <p>I can reassure you that progress is being made and that additional clinical placements for dietetics students are being identified by NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The NHS is not responsible for setting quotas for the numbers of dietetics student placements. However, the NHS is working in partnership with higher education institutions to identify increased placement opportunities for dietetic students in training.</p>

  <p>Following the decision of the British Dietetic Association to withdraw from the allocation of clinical placements for dietetics students, a Scottish Stakeholder Partnership (SSP), including higher education, NHS placement providers, NHS dietetics managers, and NHS Education for Scotland was created to oversee practice placement and work towards self-sufficiency in Scotland. The SSP agreed to a level of placement that equated to approximately six weeks of placement provision per dietitian (whole-time equivalent).</p>

  <p>Although progress has been made and dietetics students have been able to take up increased numbers of placements made available in Scotland, NHS dietetic services continue to work towards self-sufficiency for placements in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government already funds the Scottish Agricultural College to provide veterinary services and public good advice &ndash; including advice on agri-environment, rural diversification and crofting issues - to the value of &pound;7 million per annum. Funding is also available to assist applicants to the SRDP to make proposals under Rural Priorities.</p>

  <p>Grant assistance from Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) to the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group (FWAG) Scotland was not linked to the provision of advice to land managers in relation to the preparation of SRDP applications but rather to the delivery of specific public environmental benefits. In providing advice to land managers on the preparation of applications for the SRDP, FWAG Scotland, like any other commercial organisation, had to provide services on a competitive basis. I believe there remains a significant choice of companies and independent advisors who are able to provide the advisory services required by land managers in Scotland for the preparation of applications for the SRDP. However, I remain open to receiving suggestions on how to maintain choice for those seeking advice on applications to the SRDP.</p>

In order to deal with the extremely high-level and quality of proposals in the February Rural Priorities assessment round for agri-environment funding, it has been necessary to consider how to maximise the number of proposals to be approved.

  <p>The declining rate of inflation will only affect the interest applied to the amount borrowed on a student loan. Over time, therefore, the debt owed to the Student Loans Company will, in real terms, remain the same.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in relation to the recommendations in <em>Hidden Harm - Next Steps: Supporting Children Working with Parents</em> , what plans it has to improve support for young people caring for parents with substance misuse problems.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-03-23.S3W-21974.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0323.htm#29">

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the adverse effect that young caring can have on the social, emotional and mental development of children and young people. That is why Scottish ministers have made support for <em>all </em> young carers a priority. This includes those children and young people caring for parents with substance misuse problems.</p>

  <p>We have already put measures in place to begin to improve support for young carers. This includes the publication of the young carers services self-evaluation guide last June. This guide will enable all services in contact with young carers to assess the provision they make for this group, ensuring the best possible support is available. It focuses on delivering positive outcomes for young carers, achieved through partnership working.</p>

  <p>In addition, Scottish ministers provided funding to support the development of Scotland&rsquo;s first national young carers festival. This event provided Scottish young carers with a voice and a national platform to have their views heard. It also raised the profile of this vulnerable group. Following the success of this first festival, I was delighted to announce funding to support two further festivals in 2009 and 2010.</p>

  <p>Looking ahead, we are revising the National Carers Strategy for Scotland, in partnership with COSLA. This Strategy will include a &quot;lift out&quot; young carers section, focusing on the specific needs of this group. This section will be informed by the comments raised by the young carers who attended the festival last September. It will focus on identifying and supporting the needs of all young carers, including those caring for a parent with substance misuse problems, to ensure positive outcomes for this group.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government guidance is clear that young people should continue to be looked after until 18, if that is in their best interest. We know that too many young people are leaving care before they have the necessary supports in place to make a successful and sustainable transition to adult living. This is highlighted by The Care Commission bulletin <em>Throughcare and aftercare provided for children and young people in residential care: Are services meeting the standards?,</em> published in January 2009, and by the report <em>Sweet 16? The Age of Leaving care in Scotland </em> published by Scotland&rsquo;s Commissioner for Children and Young People in March 2008.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government is working with local authorities and other agencies to improve the life opportunities for all looked after children and young people both within the care system and once they have left.</p>
