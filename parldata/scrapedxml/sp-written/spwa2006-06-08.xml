  <p>The information is not available in the format requested.</p>

  <p>There has been no increase in the actual number of accident and emergency ambulances since 1999. However, with the introduction of the priority based dispatch system in 2002, the Scottish Ambulance Service has become much more efficient at strategically deploying its vehicles to ensure that Category A (life-threatening) calls are responded to more quickly. In 2005-06, the ambulance service responded to all emergency incidents in Edinburgh in an average of 8.2 minutes. This is against the target the service is working to of responding to 75% of all Category A calls within eight minutes across mainland Scotland by the fourth quarter of 2007-08.</p>

  <p>The ambulance service constantly monitors its resources in order to meet demand. At peak times, which are mainly day shift hours, up to 15 accident and emergency double crewed ambulances are on duty in Edinburgh City. At lower demand times, which are mainly mid-week night shifts, there are five double crewed ambulances on duty. However, the ambulance service&rsquo;s satellite technology and IT systems enable it to identify and deploy any ambulance resource to a call if it is the most appropriate response and is the closest vehicle.</p>

  <p>The ambulance service also operates two Rapid Response Units, which are each crewed by one paramedic. These units, which were introduced in 2002-03, are on duty for a minimum of 16 hours each day, seven days a week. They respond to Category A calls and are backed up where necessary by an accident and emergency ambulance.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware of concerns expressed by senior members of the Scottish Ambulance Service in respect of the introduction of undisturbed meal breaks under Agenda for Change and, in particular, concerns that lives may be lost as a result.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-06-08.S2W-26455.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0608.htm#3">

  <p>I am aware of the concerns expressed. However, there is little difference to the procedures the Scottish Ambulance Service had in place prior to the introduction of Agenda for Change as the Working Time Regulations required staff to have a recognised break where their working day was more than six hours &ndash; albeit this break was paid as part of the working day.</p>

  <p>Operationally, the revised terms and conditions mean that a standard five day working week will be made up of five eight-hour shifts, each of which will consist of an unpaid break of 30 minutes &ndash; previously staff were employed on a 40-hour per week basis inclusive of meal breaks.</p>

  <p>Agreement was reached through partnership to offer frontline operational staff an annual payment of &pound;250 if they wished to make themselves available to work during their unpaid break and they would, in addition, receive a payment of &pound;5 if they were called upon.</p>

  <p>To maintain operational cover, the Emergency Medical Dispatch Centres monitor the situation to ensure that meal breaks are managed and cover is provided at all times. This is done through a variety of means including the use of tactical deployment to ensure that, where a crew is on a meal break, a crew from a neighbouring location is moved into the area to maintain cover; satellite tracking systems ensure the ambulance service does this accurately. Systems are also used to assist in ensuring that staff are afforded their breaks at appropriate times.</p>

  <p>We have no centrally-held reliable data on breach rate of Antisocial Behaviour Orders. Research on the Use of Antisocial Behaviour Orders in Scotland attempted to examine this but current data recording practices mean that the data is incomplete. A survey of local authorities undertaken in the research suggests that, nationally, 26% of orders are allegedly breached.</p>

  <p>For the first time, a version of the <em>Civil Service Code</em> has been prepared for civil servants working in the Scottish Executive and its Agencies. This version reflects their accountability to Scottish ministers, who in turn are accountable to the Scottish Parliament. This version is available on the Scottish Executive website <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>In total, 2,375 Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) have been imposed in Scotland and 829 of these orders have been successfully completed to end March 2006.</p>

  <p>The number of successful completions is set in the context that many of the DTTO schemes have been established within the past two years and that DTTOs are imposed for an average period of 18 months to two years. A significant proportion of all orders imposed have not therefore yet reached the stage where they could have been completed.</p>

  <p>Dumfries and Galloway have received a 289% increase in funding between 2000-01 and 2006-07.</p>

  <p>The aggregate effects of offshoring are very difficult to quantify. What is clear is that offshoring suits the needs of some companies, under certain circumstances and as a whole, Scotland benefits from operating in the global market. We currently have one of the highest employment rates in the European Union with unemployment at its lowest level since quarterly records began.</p>

  <p>If we look at the call and contact centre industry, it is clear that the impact of offshoring has been minimal in terms of overall employment. Employment in this industry stands at 44,000 - broadly the same level as it did in 2001-02. Furthermore, we are told by firms, that when jobs are offshored, this creates higher value roles in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The preferred source for earnings estimates is the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the percentage of the top 5% of earners within each local authority area that were women in each year since 2000. These estimates are taken from ASHE and are based on the area that employees work in.</p>

  <p>The estimates in the following table are based on a sample survey, and as such, are subject to sampling error. This error can be used to assess the reliability of an estimate. Only those estimates that are judged to be reliable are reported.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the number of employee jobs in the manufacturing industry for Scotland, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee, Glasgow and Stirling in each year since 2000. Table 2 shows manufacturing jobs as a proportion of all employee jobs in these areas since 2000. These data are sourced from the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI). Due to changes in the ABI between 2002 and 2003 there is a discontinuity with the data therefore figures from 2003 onwards are not directly comparable with data prior to 2003.</p>

  <p>There is no information held centrally on the number of jobs lost in industries. However it is possible to look at the net change in jobs over time. The following table shows the net change in the number of manufacturing employee jobs in Scotland, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee, Glasgow and Stirling since 2000. Due to changes in the data between 2002 and 2003 there is a discontinuity with the data therefore the changes between 2002 and 2003 are not included.</p>

  <p>The original allocation of funding to the Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative (SCHRI) for 2006-07 was &pound;2.2 million. On 16 May, I announced an additional &pound;3 million for SCHRI for years 2006-07 and 2007-08.

  <p>In making additional resources available to Scottish Enterprise, I have stressed that the revised budget should have regard to ministerial priorities and the continuing delivery of Partnership Agreement commitments. I have also made it clear that ministers strongly support the intermediate technology institutes and that they should have the opportunity to deliver. Detailed decisions on relevant budgets are a matter for Scottish Enterprise.</p>

  <p>Data on the number of VAT registrations and de-registrations are released annually by the Small Business Service, an agency of the Department for Trade and Industry. These figures are used to monitor the number of business start-ups and closures; they are not available by business size.</p>

  <p>The number of business de-registrations is not a direct measure for the number of business &quot;failures&quot;. Businesses can de-register for VAT for a number of reasons, for example de-registration could be associated with a merger with another firm to form a new business.</p>

  <p>These figures do not account for all UK business activity as only companies with a turnover above the VAT threshold are required to register.</p>

  <p>The table below shows the rate of VAT registrations and de-registrations per 10,000 resident adults in selected local authorities from 2000 to 2004:</p>

  <p>We wrote to all Scottish Stakeholders, the Chief Executives of the Sector Skills Councils and their Scottish Representatives in October 2005 to inform them of our intention to carry out an Evaluation of the Skills for Business Network jointly with the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA). In that letter we outlined the remit of the evaluation as being to identify:</p>

  <p>How we can ensure that the Skills for Business network reaches its full potential in Scotland? What obstacles, if any, currently prevent this from occurring? Could the different organisational structures and remits of Scottish partners and/or the way in which the network has been established and operates in Scotland hinder effective engagement? Is this having an effect on the ability of the network to achieve its key objectives?</p>

  <p>What should the SSDA in Scotland and the Scottish Executive do in practice to better support the network and ensure it contributes to ministers&rsquo; top priority of growing the Scottish economy.</p>

  <p>How different models of SSC structure work in Scotland and the pros and cons of these.</p>

  <p>Practice on the ground &ndash; what works well and what doesn&rsquo;t work well. More importantly, how can we disseminate and encourage good practice across the network, how do we build on early success and how do we ensure the network performs consistently well, across all SSCs.</p>

  <p>Marine mammals die every day from a wide range of causes, wash ashore and strand between high and low water. The carcases are dealt with on a case-by-case basis depending on individual circumstances.</p>

  <p>In many instances, it is considered unnecessary to remove a carcass in view of the combination of long isolated stretches of coastline and low population density in many remote areas of Scotland. Such carcasses will be subject to a natural process of decomposition, which enriches biodiversity by providing a source of food for many scavenger species.</p>

  <p>The exception will be where a particular carcass is considered to represent a potential nuisance or threat to public health or safety or amenity. In these circumstances, local authorities may consider removal under powers conferred by Section 122 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 or Section 25 of the Local Government Planning (Scotland) Act 1982.

  <p>I can confirm that it is still the intention of the Scottish Executive to extend the statutory nuisance provisions of the Environment Protection Act 1990 to include light in a similar way to what&rsquo;s recently been introduced by the UK Government in England. No suitable legislative opportunity to allow this to happen has been identified as yet but action will be taken when an appropriate legislative vehicle is identified.</p>

  <p>In <em>Choosing Our Future</em> , the Scottish Sustainable Development Strategy published in December 2005, the Executive noted that complex funding streams caused problems for those seeking to promote local environmental regeneration projects. The Executive is reviewing the range of funding available with a view to simplifying the range and scope as far as possible. The aim is to ensure that funding is directed at projects in a way that secures the most significant outcomes for Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived communities. The Environmental Justice Fund is one of those covered by this review.</p>

In line with centrally produced guidance some requests for information are notified to the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s FOI Unit and recorded centrally. The Scottish Executive have published a report on information requests handling in the Scottish Executive for requests received during 1 January to 31 December 2005; this is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39491) and on the Freedom of Information pages of the Scottish Executive Website.

  <p>We expect the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) to use its expertise and judgement in setting college budgets, free from ministerial interference. The SFC decided to support those with the least developed skills and qualifications and to focus on areas where the supply is relatively low when compared to the Scottish average. Participation at non-advanced level in the south of Scotland is close to the average, although the overall supply is relatively low.</p>

  <p>If an applicant considered that an application had not been properly considered then that applicant might challenge the grant made on the basis that it should have been made in terms of the regulations made under Part 13 of the <em>Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 </em> (as amended). A person who was not the applicant might challenge the award of higher grants than provided for in the regulations on the basis that it was an unfair or improper use of the council&rsquo;s resources. In either case, the person should in the first instance complain to the local authority in accordance with its formal complaints procedure and if that did not resolve the issue could, depending on the circumstances, make a complaint to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman. The person might choose to initiate a judicial review.</p>

  <p>The authority&rsquo;s auditors could also qualify the authority&rsquo;s accounts if they found that it had made payments that were not in accordance with the regulations.</p>

  <p>Most grants are funded by Private Sector Housing Grant given by the Scottish Executive to local authorities. If a local authority was not operating in accordance with the legislation, appropriate funding could be clawed back in terms of the conditions on which Private Sector Housing Grant had been made.</p>

SNH has also commented on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) produced on behalf of Melbourne Marine Services by Aquatera.</p>

  <p>SNH&rsquo;s comments on the EIA included the view that there was insufficient information to ascertain that the proposals would not adversely affect the integrity of the European sites. Since submitting their comments in December 2005, SNH has been in discussion with Forth Ports to help clarify the further information which they believe is required for the appropriate assessments of the implications for the three Natura sites, namely the Firth of Forth SPA, the Forth Islands SPA and the Isle of May SAC.</p>

  <p>The lecture on 10 May 2006 at the Thistle Hotel in Glasgow was attended by ministers, officials and MSPs of various political parties including the Convener of the European and External Relations Committee.</p>

  <p>&pound;20,000 sponsorship from the Scottish Executive</p>

  <p>&pound;12,318.80 for the audio visual equipment and technical operators at the event and production of high quality DVD for future use to promote Scotland.</p>

  <p>&pound;5,000 for a table of 10 which comprised two officials, two business partners, and the headteacher and five young people from Our Lady and St Patrick&rsquo;s High School in Dumbarton.</p>

  <p>The sponsorship secured clear identification, in all UK and international media, of Scotland as the location for this event, and promotion of the Scotland brand.</p>

  <p>The exact number of district nurse contacts in Scotland in each year since 1997, is not available centrally. However, national estimates of the number of district nurse contacts can be given based on data received from general practices participating in Practice Team Information (PTI).</p>

  <p>PTI gathers information about face-to-face consultations between patients and members of the general practice team (general medical practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, district nurses and health visitors) and has been collected since 1 April 2003. Prior to this date information was collected on GPs only; therefore district nurse contacts are not available before 1 April 2003 from this source.</p>

  <p>Information on the estimated number of district nurse contacts in Scotland for the years ending 31 March 2004 and 2005 is published on the Scottish Health Statistics website under General Practice statistics, at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/general_practice_info" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/general_practice_info</a> (click on &quot;Contacts by staff discipline&quot; under &quot;Summary statistics&quot;).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the average waiting time is for a hernia operation in each NHS board area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-06-08.S2W-26362.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0608.htm#27">

  <p>The majority of patients who require in-patient and day case treatment, including hernia operations, are treated quickly. Nearly 53% of the patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals receive immediate treatment and never join a waiting list. Of those who do wait almost 41% are admitted within one month and over 70% within three months.</p>

  <p>For those who wait longer, the current maximum waiting time is six months. This guarantee will be reduced to 18 weeks from the end of 2007. On 31 March 2006, no NHSScotland patient with a guarantee had waited more than six months for in-patient and day case treatment.</p>

  <p>Median waiting times are derived from information about individual patients who have been treated and discharged from hospital during each year. This data includes patients who have had an Availability Status Code (ASC) applied, for example because they were medically unfit or asked for their admission to be deferred for personal or social reasons, and to whom the Executive&rsquo;s waiting time guarantee did not apply. Periods of unavailability for treatment are therefore included in the calculation of median waiting times, which means that the median waits are overstated.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the median wait, by NHS board, for all patients who were discharged from hospital following a hernia operation in 2005.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Hernia operations are defined as all OPCS4 procedures &quot;T19&quot; to &quot;T27&quot; inclusive.</p>

  <p>* Figures should be treated with caution as they are derived from a possibly unrepresentative small number of discharges (more than 14 but less than 50).</p>

  <p><sup>+ </sup>Median waits includes patients with an Availability Status Code. Consequently, true waiting times are likely to be overstated because of periods of medical unavailability, etc.</p>

  <p>NHS Argyll and Clyde received a formula capital allocation of &pound;15.647m in 2005-06. Of the total capital resources available &pound;8.5 million was returned to the Health Department as a result of slippage on projects.</p>

  <p>Following the dissolution of NHS Argyll and Clyde the formula capital allocation for subsequent years has been split between NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde in accordance with the capital allocation formula. The split applied is 77.37% to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and 22.63% to NHS Highland.</p>

  <p>Capital planning is a strategic issue for NHS boards. The slippage of &pound;8.5 million from 2005-06 has been allocated to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Highland on the basis of the location of projects which had slipped from 2005-06.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department annually monitors property transaction reports prepared by each NHS board&rsquo;s internal auditor and in this transaction the report confirms that the correct procedures were followed by NHS Grampian.</p>

  <p>The property was not advertised for sale given the decision to sell for a health-related purpose. This is one of a number of instances where NHS bodies can sell off-market which are collectively referred to as priority interests.</p>

  <p>Where a transaction is deemed appropriate to proceed on an off-market basis for a health-related purpose to a non-NHSScotland body the sale price is determined by a professional valuer. In this instance the sale price was recommended by the District Valuer who took into account the health-related nature of the transaction, that the houses were in poor condition and required expenditure to upgrade before they were fit for occupation by people with learning disabilities and that no grant assistance was available.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s planning policy on town centres and retailing is contained in National Planning Policy Guidance (NPPG) 8: <em>Town Centres and Retailing</em> . The policy contains a clear commitment to the enhancement and protection of town centres by looking to improve their vitality and viability. We have recently consulted on an updated version of this guidance and hope to publish the final document shortly.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also introducing business improvement districts (BIDs) to Scotland from 1 April 2007. BIDs can be a powerful tool to regenerate our towns and cities by allowing businesses an equitable way to invest collectively in the type of improvements and initiatives that will grow or sustain their economic performance. The Executive has made &pound;500,000 available this year to take forward six BID pilots in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, the recently published regeneration policy statement commits the Executive to a range of specific actions that will benefit all of Scotland&rsquo;s towns and cities, including modernising the planning system, improving the alignment of key players in regeneration, removing the barriers that can inhibit regeneration led by others and realigning and consolidating funding streams that support regeneration.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will list all the sector skills councils operating in Scotland, also indicating those with headquarters in Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-06-08.S2W-26488.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0608.htm#37">

  <p>All Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) operate in Scotland as they have a UK wide remit to help reduce skills gaps and shortages, improve productivity and performance, increase opportunities in the workforce and improve learning supply. A full list of all 25 Sector Skills Councils complete with the addresses of their headquarters can be accessed through the following web link:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.ssda.org.uk/ssda/default.aspx?page=16" target="_blank">http://www.ssda.org.uk/ssda/default.aspx?page=16</a>.</p>

  <p>With one exception, no SSC is headquartered outside England. The exception is Skills for Care and Development which is organised differently. In Scotland, it operates as the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) which was established under the <em>Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001</em> and carries out a number of statutory functions as well as being the SSC for that sector. It is based in Dundee.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what advice it has given to competent authorities intending to carry out appropriate assessment of plans or projects likely to affect European wildlife sites with regard to consulting (a) statutory bodies, (b) other interested parties and (c) the general public and whether the advice differs according to whether the assessment is carried out under Regulation 3 or Regulation 48 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 (as amended).</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-06-08.S2W-26370.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80011" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0608.htm#38">

  <p>Guidance on implementation of the Birds and Habitats directives, including the carrying out of appropriate assessments and consultation with statutory bodies and the general public, is set out in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s June 2000 circular: <em>Nature Conservation: Implementation in Scotland of EC Directives on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Flora and Fauna and the Conservation of Wild Birds (&quot;The Habitats and Birds Directives&quot;).</em> Supplementary guidance, covering aspects of the planning system ( <em>Assessing Development Plans in Terms of the Need for Appropriate Assessment: Interim Guidance</em> ) was issued in May 2006.</p>

  <p>Both Regulation 3 and Regulation 48 provide for an appropriate assessment to be carried out and allow for the opinion of the general public to be obtained. Advice in relation to the carrying out of an appropriate assessment differs to the extent that Regulation 48 explicitly requires the competent authority to consult Scottish Natural Heritage and enables the opinion of the general public to be obtained, if appropriate, as part of the appropriate assessment process, whilst Regulation 3 invokes Article 6(3) directly, does not refer explicitly to Scottish Natural Heritage and allows, if appropriate, for the opinion of the public to be sought prior to any final decision.</p>

  <p>Neither Regulation 3 nor Regulation 48 require consultation with &quot;other interested parties&quot; in connection with the conduct of an appropriate assessment.</p>

  <p>Appropriate assessment is the responsibility of the relevant competent authority. There is no requirement, either in the <em>Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 </em> or in the <em>Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC)</em> , to report the results of individual assessments to the Executive, the UK Government or the European Commission.</p>

  <p>The publication of information contained in appropriate assessments is covered by the principles and obligations established by legislation on <em>Access to Environmental Information and Freedom of Information</em>. Regulation 4 of the <em>Environmental Information (Scotland) Regulations 2004 </em>requires Scottish public authorities to organise environmental information, such as environmental impact studies and assessments, with a view to making that information available to the public. A similar obligation is imposed on UK public authorities by regulation 4 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004.</p>
