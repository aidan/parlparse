  <p>North American Signal Crayfish have been confirmed in river locations in the Kirkcudbright Dee, the Skyre Burn (Fleet catchment), Daer Water (Clyde catchment), the River Earn (Tay catchment), two locations in Fife and in the River Nairn. Sightings have also been reported in ponds in the North Esk, Tay and River Tyne (East Lothian) catchments.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the Prohibition of Keeping or Release of Live Fish (Specified Species) (Scotland) Order 2003 it is an offence to both keep and release crayfish without a licence from Scottish ministers. The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 also makes it an offence to release this species into the wild.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has taken steps to deal with the signal crayfish issue in Scotland. As well as helping to fund eradication programmes, it has also commissioned a research report entitled, <em>Preparation and Implementation of a Strategy for the Containment of American Signal Crayfish in the River Dee Catchment, Kirkcudbrightshire. </em>SNH is also involved in the development of publicity materials for this species, which are designed to educate the public about the dangers of translocating signal crayfish to other waters.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 provides that material may be withheld from publication for a number of reasons. Most exemptions are subject to a public interest test. In deciding the extent of publication of any future contract for private prisons, the SPS will need to consider (at that time) whether the harm likely to arise from the publication of certain information outweighs the public interest in releasing the information. The code of practice provides best practice guidance to public authorities to help them comply with their full range of duties under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.</p>

  <p>Capital spending by the core administration will increase by &pound;1.6 million in 2006-07 and &pound;1.8 million in 2007-08. In addition, there are increases in funding for the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) and the National Archives of Scotland. The most significant of these increases is to allow GROS to conduct a census test in 2006-07. Taking these changes into account, the overall administration budget will increase from &pound;260.02 million in 2006-07 to &pound;264.40 million in 2007-08.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the statement in Sir Peter Gershon&rsquo;s report, <em>Releasing resources to the front line &ndash; Independent Review of Public Sector Efficiency</em> that &quot;to go further or faster than the savings set out in my review during the period 2005-06 to 2007-08 would put at risk the delivery of public services.&quot;</p>

  <p>The level of efficiencies set for UK Departments is a matter for the UK Government. The Scottish Executive will judge what is appropriate for public services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what it understands by the statement in Sir Peter Gershon&rsquo;s report, <em>Releasing resources to the front line &ndash; Independent Review of Public Sector Efficiency</em> that &quot;I note that the Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly Government have announced that they are engaged in making annual efficiency gains as ambitious as those in England.&quot;</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is undertaking an efficiency initiative that is as ambitious as the Gershon review in its scope and will seek to secure comparable or greater gains in efficiency. The Executive was engaged in securing efficiencies in the public sector before the Gershon review. Its Efficient Government initiative will go on until 2010 &ndash; longer than the activity outlined in the Gershon report.</p>

  <p>Increasing numbers of students are completing social work training.</p>

  <p>In 1999, 397 graduated as qualified social workers;</p>

  <p>in 2000, 351;</p>

  <p>in 2001, 340;</p>

  <p>in 2002, 373, and</p>

  <p>in 2003, 469.</p>

  <p>The Fast-Track Graduate Recruitment Scheme may add up to 150 further entrants per year to 2007 and on this basis, total numbers graduating as qualified social workers should rise to as many as nearly 700 per year over the next three-year period.</p>

  <p>Current vacancies are around 600. This fact, coupled with the significant growth of social worker posts in recent years, means that it is not possible to say for certain that the requirements of social work departments will all be fully met in the next three years. Resolving recruitment and retention issues has never been seen as short-term and ministers have stated on many occasions that only a sustained commitment will achieve the objective of a confident and competent workforce of sufficient numbers.</p>

  <p>In the past two financial years 2002-03 and 2003-04 we spent over &pound;86 million on the major transport infrastructure projects set out in the Transport White Paper <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Transport Future</em> .</p>

  <p>The final capital costs of these projects will depend on the prices achieved through tendering and these are affected by both the market at the time and the type of contract awarded.</p>
