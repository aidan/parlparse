  <p>The law relating to compensation and compulsory purchase is complex and the rules that will apply to the Forth Replacement Crossing will not be finally defined until the Act has been secured.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, affected householders have been advised at recent public exhibitions that the information contained within the <em>Guidance on the Compulsory Purchase Process and Compensation</em> booklet, published by Transport Scotland in 2007, provides a general overview as it relates to schemes promoted by means of Roads Orders. We intend to revise this general guidance in the context of the bill procedures in the spring.</p>

  <p>The timetable for constructing the Forth Replacement Crossing has not changed: the bridge is the critical construction activity and although the width of the bridge has been reduced, the design and construction operations have to be undertaken in a certain sequence, which do not result in a materially shorter duration for construction of a bridge of this scale.</p>

  <p>The forecast for assumed minimum bus numbers crossing the Forth Road Bridge is based on existing services which call at Ferrytoll park and ride and cross the Forth Road Bridge. The current bus service level to and from Ferrytoll and crossing the Forth are 537 buses per day. Frequencies modelled in the peak periods are: 26 per hour in the morning, and 25 per hour in the evening. The creation of a public transport only crossing is expected to increase bus numbers.</p>

  <p>Maintenance of the existing Forth Road Bridge will remain a matter for the Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA). The Scottish Government hold regular discussions with FETA regarding their capital programme and the costs associated with this.</p>

  <p>We anticipate that removing the weight of traffic loading from the existing bridge will obviate the need for much of the traffic related repair, maintenance work and refurbishment work required.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to extend average speed cameras on the A77. The potential to introduce more average speed cameras on the Scottish trunk road network to reduce casualties will be informed by an assessment of the accident data for the A77 average speed camera system.</p>

  <p>The three year after accident data was published on the A77 Safety Group website on 30 October 2008. These figures are now being fully assessed and are due to be reported on by 31 March 2009. The findings will be published on the website, <a href="http://www.a77safetygroup.com">www.a77safetygroup.com</a>, shortly thereafter.</p>

  <p>Traffic modelling has been undertaken using the Transport Model for Scotland. This supplies traffic forecasts which take into account travel demand associated with household and jobs growth and trip distribution and mode choice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s catering provision seeks to maximise the use of local, seasonable produce whenever possible. Depending on the season, around 75% of all perishable produce is sourced in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The SPCB is committed to increasing the amount of Scottish produce used within the Scottish Parliament and we are currently working with our catering partner to achieve this through the provision of fresh and seasonal food items.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to give an accurate total percentage figure of Scottish sourced food served in the Scottish Parliament, as figures will change for some food types due to availability dictated by seasons, stock levels and price. All chicken, pork, milk, cream and bread products used are sourced in Scotland. In addition, when in season, we use vegetables grown in Scotland and endeavour to source Scottish produced foods, such as beef, lamb, fish and fruit when stocks and prices allow.</p>
