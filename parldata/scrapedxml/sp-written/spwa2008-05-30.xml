  <p>The evidence in SIGN Guideline 93 on Acute Coronary Syndromes is that those with the most serious heart attacks should be taken directly to a specialist intervention centre where they can be given a primary percutaneous intervention (&quot;primary PCI&quot;). There are better clinical outcomes for patients if the procedure can be performed within 90 minutes of diagnosis of the heart attack.</p>

  <p>Architecture and Design Scotland has a national responsibility to carry out design review, generally on projects of strategic significance, and this is set out in <em>Scottish Planning Policy 20</em> .</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to determine the need for local design review panels and their scope and remit. The definition of what constitutes a local design review panel is thus open to interpretation. Currently, Glasgow City Council has a formal local design review panel which draws upon independent external expertise: City of Edinburgh Council has an internal design surgery, Scottish Borders Council has an internal peer review panel, and Dundee City Council has a design review panel for work specific to its waterfront regeneration project.</p>

  <p>There have been two separate programmes of central heating installation, one aimed at public sector housing and one at private sector housing. The public sector programme was completed by the end of 2004, with the exception of Glasgow Housing Association which, given the number of houses involved, was not completed until March 2007.</p>

  <p>The number of installations for each year in each programme is provided in the following tables.</p>

  <p>These show that the highest level of installations in the private sector was 2007-08. The highest levels of installations in the public sector programme was during 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Progress is being made on realising the renewable capability across the public sector in a number of ways:</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &quot;Leading By Example&quot; programme we are ensuring all parts of the public sector play an exemplary role in pioneering new greener behaviours. Generating more sustainable low carbon energy through renewables is an important element of the programme.</p>

  <p>We have recently widened the Central Energy Efficiency Fund to allow public bodies to invest in renewable technologies.</p>

  <p>To ensure the public sector has better access to grants for renewables we are more actively promoting the UK Government&rsquo;s Low Carbon Buildings Programme and we have increased funding under own renewables grants programme.</p>

  <p>We are introducing dedicated Schools Development Officers to support the deployment of renewable technologies in Scotland&rsquo;s schools.</p>

  <p>The National Contract for Electricity is seeking to establish a national &quot;feed in tariff&quot; for public sector bodies who generate electricity from onsite renewables.</p>

  <p>Changes to the Energy Standards of Scottish Building Regulations and SPP6: Planning Guidance also encourage the use of renewable technologies in new public buildings to meet improved carbon emissions levels.</p>

A key outcome was that those present were keen to use the money in more innovative ways than straightforward grants and that no specific purposes emerged with substantial initial support.</p>

  <p>No funds are available in this financial year as the UK legislation which establishes the ways in which the funds will be collected from dormant bank accounts has yet to complete its UK parliamentary passage.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what decision it has reached regarding allocation of the Affordable Housing Investment Programme and what changes it intends to implement to Housing Association Grant in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>The government expects to spend over &pound;1.5 billion on affordable housing over the next three years and to approve construction of at least 21,500 units (6,000 in 2008-09, 7,100 in 2009-10 and 8,400 in 2010-11). The number of units over 21, 500 this will secure will depend on how successfully housing associations work with the government to secure more value from its investment.</p>

  <p>The funding allocated for 2008-09 is &pound;493 million (including ring-fenced money allocated to Glasgow and Edinburgh Councils in the local government settlement). The provisional allocation by local authority area and other programmes is set out in the following table. This may change in the course of the year in line with normal programme management practice.</p>

  <p>Note:</p>

  <p>1. Deaths of Scottish residents are counted on the basis of the addresses of their usual residences (as recorded when their deaths were registered); deaths of non-residents are counted on the basis of where they died.</p>

  <p>2. The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is produced using a range of statistical information for each of the &quot;datazones&quot; in Scotland (which have 500-1,000 residents each). For Scotland as a whole, quintile 1 contains the most deprived 20% of datazones, and quintile 5 contains the least deprived 20% of datazones, when classified on the basis used for the SIMD. In the case of the other geographic areas, the figures for each quintile were produced from the data for the parts of those areas that are in each SIMD quintile - so the figures for (e.g.) quintile 1 of a particular area could have been produced from the data for considerably more (or less) than 20% of that area: it all depends upon what percentage of the area is in SIMD quintile 1.</p>

  <p>3. These figures were produced by using the distribution by age of the overall Scottish population for 2006. That is the same method as was used to produce the standardised death rates which appear in table 2 of <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Population 2006</em>.</p>

  <p>4. The total number of deaths from which the standardised death rate was calculated. This may be small because only a small proportion of an area was in a particular SIMD quintile: if so, the standardised death rate for a single year might not provide a reliable indication of the normal level of mortality because there could be large year-to-year percentage changes in the number of deaths. For example, if a particular quintile tended to have around 100 deaths per year, it would not be surprising if its figures fluctuated by 10-20% between one year and the next.</p>

  <p>5. The sum of the figures for all the quintiles may differ slightly from the published total number of deaths for an area. There may be a number of reasons for this: for example, some of the datazones used in the SIMD might not fit properly within the boundary of the area, or corrections may have been made to some of the underlying data after the published figures were produced.</p>

  <p>Patients self-presenting to Ayr Hospital suffering from non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or who are not appropriate for primary angioplasty, will be treated at Ayr. The most likely reasons for this will be a clinical decision based on co-morbidity and the patient&rsquo;s wishes. Patients who become unstable in transit from their home may be stabilised in Ayr A&amp;E before receiving further treatment.</p>

  <p>The development of a Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Centre at Hairmyres Hospital is an enhancement to the service currently provided in the West of Scotland. At present primary angioplasty treatment is only available for patients in the West of Scotland at the Golden Jubilee Hospital.</p>

  <p>It is also worth noting that had Ayr A&amp;E closed, then no heart attack patients would have been treated there.</p>

  <p>Patients with an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and a transit time of less that 40 minutes will be taken directly to the Heart Attack Centre for Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PPCI). This equates to all patients north of a line just south of Ayr, Coylton and Cumnock, or about 70% of the Ayrshire and Arran population. Patients beyond this boundary will receive thrombolytic therapy in the ambulance or at Ayr Hospital as appropriate and be transported to Hairmyres.</p>

  <p>In arriving at a forecast of anticipated capital receipts, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has reviewed the entire range of sites within its ownership and identified those which it believes have potential to generate a capital receipt on account of disposal within the eight year period to 2015-16. This includes land at the following sites: Cowglen, Dykebar, Gartnavel Royal, Johnstone, Lenzie, Mansionhouse, Merchiston, Ruchill, QMH/Yorkhill, Ravenscraig, Stoneyetts, Victoria, Blawarthill, Broomhill, Hawkhead, Stobhill and a number of smaller sites currently within its ownership.</p>

  <p>The exact timing and final value of individual capital receipts will be dependent upon detailed negotiations, prevailing property market conditions and factors such as planning consent(s). The forecast value of &pound;135 million contained within the Outline Business Case is considered prudent and achievable across the range of properties involved.</p>

  <p>Leapfrogging affects only a very small number of staff and can arise as part of the assimilation process. The current assimilation process in Scotland has been agreed in partnership following discussion between Scottish Government, staff representative groups and employers and there are no plans at present to amend the agreement reached.</p>

Suppliers to the Scottish public sector are expected to maintain high standards of business and professional conduct e.g. in relation to legislative requirements on the environment, equal opportunities, race relations, health and safety, employment and taxation. Where bidders fail to comply with relevant legal obligations they can be excluded from competition on grounds of their unsuitability.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Internal Audit Division works to Government Internal Audit Standards (GIAS) drawn up by HM Treasury in consultation with UK Departments, including the devolved administrations. That is set out in the Internal Audit section of the Scottish Public Finance Manual. The GIAS standards draw heavily on the standards set by the Institute of Internal Auditors &ndash; UK and Ireland, which forms part of the global Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) who set the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. Our internal auditors work closely with the IIA and the Treasury in the development, revision and application of the relevant standards, and as our primary training route is towards IIA qualifications, our audit staff are required to comply with the standards.</p>

  <p>With regard to the implementation of revisions to external audit standards, that is primarily a matter for the Auditor General for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The charging statement, which takes account of responses to the consultation, confirms the charging principles that the Water Industry Commission for Scotland will apply when determining water charge caps for 2010-14.</p>

  <p>The key features of the statement are:</p>

  <p>recognition of the importance customers attach to stability and certainty of charges;</p>

  <p>that the existing principles of charging: full cost-recovery, cost-reflectivity, geographical harmonisation of charges, phasing of increases and paying for increased local capacity are maintained until 2014;</p>

  <p>that the water services charges exemption scheme should be retained in its present form until 2014;</p>

  <p>that the commission will phase in any unwinding of cross-subsidies over the 2010-14 period, but may extend this over a further regulatory period, and</p>

  <p>that the maximum size of the capital programme should be around &pound;2 billion.</p>

  <p>These principles are essential to ensuring that Scottish Water can continue to be successful and maintain its significant contribution to the government&rsquo;s strategic objectives for Scotland. Ministers will finalise their principles in September 2009 following the publication of the commission&rsquo;s draft charges determination for the 2010-14 period.</p>
