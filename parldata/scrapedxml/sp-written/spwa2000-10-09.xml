  <p>There have been no recalls of scallops by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) due to samples failing end-product testing. In the event that a commercially processed product fails end-product testing, it is the responsibility of the producer to ensure that products which could pose a danger to public health are not placed on the market. The FSA are not informed of the results.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is determined to address the challenges presented by cancer in <u>all</u> forms. We have pledged to tackle the root causes of ill health and will work over the next 10 years to promote healthier living and reduce mortality from cancer by 20% in the under 75&#8217;s.</p>

  <p>Targeted health promotion programmes and a pilot colorectal cancer screening programme are already underway.</p>

  <p>The Health Education Board for Scotland &quot;Big 3&quot; campaign has been successful in raising adults&#8217; awareness of the small changes to lifestyle (including diet) that can be easily achieved to help prevent cancer occurring.</p>

  <p>The place of aspirin in prevention of bowel cancer is still being evaluated.</p>

  <p>The number of consultants in paediatric dentistry employed in the NHS in Scotland is shown in the following table. The information supplied is the latest available and should be read in conjunction with the notes below.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that these consultants treat between 5,000 to 7,000 patients annually, offering advanced dental treatment to patients with severe illnesses or associated difficulties. This service is supplied by the six consultants and their associated support staff.</p>

  <p>The majority of children are, however, treated by general dental practitioners or community dental officers. It is estimated that each year around 724,000 children receive their dental treatment from General Dental Practitioners and 120,000 are treated by community dental officers.</p>

  <p>Paediatric specialist practitioners also offer dental services to children with some minor medical, physical or other associated problems. This is a new, developing group situated within either general or community dental practices, and it is currently estimated that approximately 20,000 to 30,000 children receive treatment from paediatric specialist practitioners per annum.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the nuclear site licence issued by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) the licensee, British Nuclear Fuels plc, will be required to put in place a plan for decommissioning the Magnox nuclear power station at Hunterston. British Nuclear Fuels plc will also be required to make an assessment of the environmental effects of their proposed decommissioning plan, to consult the public, and to have consent from the HSE. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and local authorities will be consulted by the HSE in that process.</p>

  <p>I understand from the Department of Trade and Industry that there are no plans to undertake such a shipment from Dounreay to the United States.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the regulation of storage and handling of all nuclear fuel held at Dounreay rests with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). I understand that HSE&#8217;s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) is aware of plans to return the fuel in question to its owners in Germany. Safety documentation to allow the transfer of the fuel from a dedicated store into transport flasks is being prepared by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and will be submitted to NII in due course.</p>

  <p>The fuel transport flasks to be used for moving the fuel from Dounreay to Germany will require certification by the UK and German authorities. The Department of the Environment Transport and the Regions (DETR) is the authorising body in the UK for nuclear fuel transport.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the total cash allocation to Scotland was through the Barnett formula in each year since its inception, in cash and real terms, with the corresponding multiplier that was used in each year.</p>

  <p>Information is not held in a way which would allow Barnett changes to be disaggregated from other changes, such as transfers to and from Scotland&#8217;s Budget. The total net effect of these changes, however, can be tracked through comparisons of the revised plans figures published in the Executive&#8217;s Annual Expenditure Report <i>Investing in You</i> and its predecessor, the Departmental Report <i>Serving Scotland&#8217;s Needs</i> which was published annually over a number of years.</p>

  <p>Under the formula Scotland receives a population share of changes in comparable UK programmes. When the formula was first used for Scotland in the 1978 public expenditure survey the population share was fixed at 10/85ths, or 11.76%. It was revised to reflect changes in population to 10.66% in 1992, 10.45% in 1996, and currently stands at 10.34% for 1999. In addition there is a comparability factor for each programme. They are set out in Annex C of the Statement of Funding Policy which is available on HM Treasury&#8217;s website at www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/news.html.</p>

  <p>Copies of responses are not being made public by the Scottish Executive because our approach to these bodies was made on an informal basis and they were not advised that this would be done. It is, of course, open to you to approach the organisations concerned direct to seek their views on supporter involvement in football.</p>

  <p>Telemedicine remains a rapidly developing field with great potential to improve access to high quality care irrespective of distance. The Scottish Executive is investing &pound;5 million to promote telemedicine schemes across Scotland and has established a Scottish Telemedicine Action Forum to co-ordinate this work. Evaluation of these projects will provide evidence about which telemedicine applications are sufficiently effective, efficient and robust to deserve wider implementation.</p>

  <p>The principal data on secondary-sector healthcare in Scotland come from the Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR), individual patient-based episode records prepared in hospitals. Diagnostic information in these records is recorded using the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases. Treatment information is recorded using the 4th revision of the Office of Populations Censuses and Surveys&#8217; Classification of Surgical Operations &amp; Procedures. This information is validated and submitted to the Information and Statistics Division (ISD) of the Common Services Agency. Management Executive Letter (1995) 36 requires that SMR returns should also be submitted for NHS patients treated in the independent sector.</p>

  <p>Ministers have already acted to safeguard NHS services this winter. &pound;10 million has been made available to local authorities primarily to tackle problems arising from delays in discharging patients and a further &pound;60 million has gone to the NHS mainly to target waiting lists and times, winter peaks and discharging delays. The detailed measures taken in Grampian are a matter for the health board and Trusts but I expect NHS planning for this winter to take into account the sound, practical recommendations of the Winter Performance Group to improve services. To ensure effective implementation, this planning should be undertaken jointly with Social Work Departments, Local Health Care Co-operatives and relevant voluntary bodies.</p>

  <p>Information on all medical grades working in the specialties of geriatrics and old age psychiatry as at 30 September 1999, which is the latest available, are shown in Table 1 below.</p>

  <p>Details on projected requirements for staff other than at consultant grade is not held by the Executive and is a matter for individual boards and Trusts. The number of new consultants required to cover expected retirals and developments within the service for 1999-2000 and 2000-01 are shown in Table 2. This however should be taken as an indicator only, as the exact number of new consultants needed to deliver services cannot be predicted with accuracy because it is affected by individual decisions to retire.</p>

  <p>The number of trainees who will become fully trained and will be awarded a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) for the years in question is given in Table 2, Annex B of NHS MEL (2000) 24, published on 28 April 2000.

  <p>Reducing waiting is one of the Executive&#8217;s most important objectives for the health service in Scotland. Action to reduce hospital waiting lists is primarily for health boards and NHS Trusts, and health boards have agreed waiting list targets to be achieved by March 2002. The Executive has put substantial extra investment into the NHS in Scotland, including targeted investment to help reduce waiting, and this will be coupled with new ways of working and delivering services to achieve sustained improvements.</p>

  <p>The national audit of museum and gallery collections will enable us to develop criteria for a restructuring of the sector with the aim of establishing a sustainable funding framework for the future. The industrial museums will be given priority in this process. We have announced funding of &pound;250,000 this year and &pound;3 million over the next three years for these purposes.</p>

  <p>There is no such measure. Each individual case will vary and will depend on a number of factors such as date of application compared to the course dates at the chosen institution, the student&#8217;s choice of institution, the branch of nursing that is selected and, indeed, the individual&#8217;s personal circumstances and choices.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to the promotion of better health and to reducing the need for hospital admissions.

  <p>The regulation of track access charges is a reserved matter. In July, the Rail Regulator published the draft conclusions of his periodic review of Track Access Charges. Until he announces his final decisions, Railtrack cannot change its present track access charges to freight and passenger rail companies. Rail freight charges to customers are a commercial matter for the rail freight companies.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to transferring freight from roads to rail and inland waterways. We are on track to achieve our target of transferring 15 million lorry miles a year by March 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to integrating the principles of environmentally and socially sustainable development into all its policies. In pursuit of this commitment, we have let a consultancy to develop proposals for a set of sustainable development indicators covering waste, energy and travel, relevant to Scotland&#8217;s distinctive environment. The indicators will help focus on specific actions and on measuring their effectiveness. They may also be important in applying strategic environmental assessment, stemming from a proposed EC Directive, now in final form. The cost of the consultancy is about &pound;27,000. No further spend on consultancies on sustainable development indicators is planned. If the Executive decides to proceed with the development of indicators, there will be costs associated with data collection and dissemination. It is too early to say now what those costs would be.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also let this month a contract for about &pound;20,000 for a scoping study to review the experience of strategic environmental assessment in other countries and consider how to apply it to Executive programmes. A key objective is to increase public participation in the process. We will consider carefully how to inform the public about the issues surrounding the application of strategic environmental assessment.</p>
