  <p>The effectiveness of joint working arrangements will be measured in a number of ways. At a strategic level, local partners will report progress through their local Health Plans and Community Care Plans.</p>

  <p>In terms of the Joint Future agenda, whose initial focus is largely on older people, we will analyse Local Partnership Agreements on implementing joint resourcing and joint management, and Action Plans for implementing Single Shared Assessment. We will also monitor partners&#146; Local Outcome Agreements in relation to all the service developments required by the Joint Future agenda.</p>

  <p>We are introducing joint performance indicators for the first time under the Joint Performance Information and Assessment Framework to gauge the impact of jointly delivered services on the quality of people&#146;s lives.</p>

  <p>The anticipated positive outcomes for older people set out in Delayed Discharge Action Plans are also dependent on effective joint working, and the Executive monitors these plans closely.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and the Social Work Services Inspectorate operate programmes of monitoring and inspection that explore the effectiveness of partnership arrangements.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for licensing the keeping of signal crayfish rests with Scottish ministers.

  <p>Through our contacts with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) the Executive was kept informed of the development of the new principles and guidance relating to continuing flood risk cover for domestic properties and small businesses. These new principles were put in place by the ABI, on behalf of ABI members within the insurance industry, and are general industry guidance. These principles are not the subject of an agreement with Government.</p>

  <p>Guidance from the ABI states that it is the intention of ABI members that flood insurance for domestic properties and small businesses should continue to be available for as many customers as possible. The premiums charged and other terms and conditions - such as excesses - will reflect the actual risk of flooding, in the same way as for other insurable risks. However, changes to premiums and policy details are matters for policyholders and the insurance company concerned.</p>

  <p>We continue to have meetings with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) on general insurance issues concerning flooding and have taken the opportunity offered by these meetings to raise the matter of the damage to properties by the floods in Moray. However, claims for damage to domestic and business properties from flooding in Moray (or elsewhere) or any consequent changes to premiums are a matter for policy holders and the insurance company concerned. Guidance from the ABI states that it is the intention of ABI members that flood insurance for domestic properties and small businesses should continue to be available for as many customers as possible.

  <p>There is no requirement and no perceived benefit in allocating resources for collecting and holding this information centrally.</p>

  <p>The reporter appointed to conduct the inquiry is presently considering the evidence led at the inquiry and the written submissions of the parties. Thereafter, the reporter will submit a detailed report with recommendations to Scottish ministers for their consideration. It is expected that a decision will issue late May or early June 2003.</p>

  <p>It is for the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (the Care Commission) to determine which of the definitions in the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 apply to any particular service. The Care Commission will take into account the service's statement of function and purpose in making this decision. Maximum fees are set each year by Scottish ministers for each type of regulated service, for applications for initial registration or cancellation of registration; for the annual continuation of registration; for applications for variation or removal of a condition of registration, and for the issue of a new certificate of registration. Each year the Care Commission sets fees for each type of regulated service within these maxima. Not all of the services defined in the act are already regulated by the Care Commission - regulation is being phased in.</p>
