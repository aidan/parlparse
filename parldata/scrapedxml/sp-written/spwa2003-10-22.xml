  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland meet with Eaga on a regular basis to discuss progress being made on the central heating programme and consider contract compliance issues.</p>

  <p>Eaga are responsible for the work undertaken by their contractors and carry out 100% inspections of central heating installations to ensure quality standards are met. They have in place processes and procedures to deal with issues that may arise.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland is currently considering further measures for scrutinising the effectiveness of the delivery programme.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The central heating programme is a major programme of work impacting on the homes of individuals. The Executive expects that high standards of care are applied by those delivering the programme, and has contractual agreements in place governing these aspects.</p>

  <p>Concerns have been received about the specifics of eligibility for assistance and about detailed aspects of the implementation programme. Issues of eligibility are for Communities Scotland to deal with. The eligibility criteria are set out in Scottish Statutory Instrument 2001 No 267, and this is an issue for the Scottish Executive to deal with. The execution of the eligibility criteria is a matter for Eaga, and it is for them to determine whether individuals qualify for assistance under the programme.</p>

It is made up of two elements; a formulated award based on population share and crimes per head of population and a variable award based on progress and quality of partnerships&#8217; community safety strategies and action plans.

  <p>by the enterprise agencies on<strong> </strong>enhancing skills and training in the tourism workforce and investment in physical tourism infrastructure e.g. visitor attractions;</p>

  <p>by Scottish Natural Heritage<strong> </strong>on making it easier for visitors to appreciate Scotland&#8217;s natural environment, e.g. through better visitor facilities at nature sites, and</p>

  <p>by Historic Scotland<strong> </strong>on new and upgraded visitor facilities at historic sites.</p>

  <p>Local authorities<strong> </strong>also provide and maintain local visitor attractions, fund local tourism projects and part-fund area tourist boards.</p>

  <p>This considerable public sector investment in Scottish tourism has helped the industry to recover well from the blows of 2001. In 2002, tourist spending in Scotland as a whole recovered almost to the levels of 2000, and further strong growth is being experienced this year.</p>

  <p>The current Millennium Volunteers scheme is being reviewed by Volunteer Development Scotland. Volunteer Development Scotland is also preparing advice for the Scottish Executive on the strategic framework for promoting volunteering in Scotland and is contributing to the work of the Scotscorps working group established by the First Minister in May this year. A decision on future direction and funding will be taken in the new year once work on these three related strands is complete.</p>
