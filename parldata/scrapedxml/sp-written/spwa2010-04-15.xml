  <p>Information on funding is available through channels such as Rural Direct and the <em>Rural Funding Opportunities Guide</em> leaflet, published by the Scottish Government in 2009. Both are available at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides a range of support for communities throughout Scotland wishing to acquire land. Officials can provide guidance to communities wishing to use the Community Right to Buy provisions in the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Information and guidance is also available on the right to buy website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/farmingrural/Rural/rural-land/right-to-buy/Community" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/farmingrural/Rural/rural-land/right-to-buy/Community</a>.</p>

  <p>We encourage communities to contact officials as early as possible so that they can consider fully the options available to them to purchase land and work up their proposals for the sustainable development of that land.</p>

  <p>In addition work in taking forward the Community Empowerment Action Plan includes a two year programme addressing awareness raising among councillors, local authority officers and community groups about the benefits of community asset ownership and asset transfers; identifying and disseminating lessons from effective practice, and providing targeted development support for selected community groups to enable them to take on transferred assets.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of patients discharged from hospitals in Scotland with a diagnosis of poisoning by methadone over the last 10 years, broken down by health board of treatment. A breakdown by hospital of treatment is not available due to small numbers and the potential risk of disclosure.</p>

  <p>We recognise that we need to know more about these individuals and their circumstances to protect others from overdose. That is why the Scottish Government is working closely with the National Drugs Deaths forum, comprising of experts including (amongst others) general practitioners, paramedics, pathologists and individuals in recovery. The forum is leading on the development of the drug-related deaths database. The Scottish Government has invested significantly in this database so that the circumstances around each death are better understood and consequently preventions better planned, at a local and national level.</p>

  <p>The GROS annual publication <em>Drug-related Deaths in Scotland</em> provides background information about drug-related death statistics, covers the definition of the kinds of death which are counted as drug-related and how the drugs involved in such deaths are reported (and can be found at the following link: <u><a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/drug-related-deaths/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/drug-related-deaths/index.html</a></u> ).</p>

  <p>The latest report explains why there is a break in the series of figures for drugs reported between 2007 and 2008 which can be found at the following link:</p>

  <p><u><a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/stats/drug-related-deaths/drug-related-deaths-in-scotland-in-2008.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/stats/drug-related-deaths/drug-related-deaths-in-scotland-in-2008.pdf</a></u>.</p>

  <p>The figures which are available are given in table 1, It is important to note that alcohol was also present in some cases.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it accepts all the recommendations in Audit Scotland&rsquo;s Review of orthopaedic services and, if so, what action it will take, together with NHS boards, to improve services.</p>

  <p>I welcome Audit Scotland&rsquo;s Review of orthopaedic services and the Scottish Government Health Directorates have already begun to implement several of the recommendations. We have established an &quot;Efficiency &amp; Productivity&quot; programme, closely linked to our Quality Strategy, to improve productivity and the efficiency of services. Progress is already being made by shifting the balance of care to more community and team based services, improving benchmarking information and supporting boards to further increase rates of same day surgery.</p>

  <p>The increasing demand on orthopaedic services for joint replacements has been significant. From 2000 to 2008, the number of knee replacements increased by 106% and hip replacements increased by 43%. The Scottish Government has continued to increase investment in orthopaedic services with &pound;370 million dedicated towards this area last year alone and this report recognises that considerable improvements have been made. An area of significant improvement is in waiting times. NHS boards have exceeded their waiting time targets by effectively meeting the March 2010 targets in March 2009. This is a substantial achievement by NHS staff.</p>

  <p>Service improvements related to orthopaedic services are being taken forward by the national and local NHS board 18 Weeks Improvement Teams and the focus of this activity will be targeted at the key areas within this report.</p>

  <p>Approximately 71,000 charges of assault are recorded by the police each year. Eight hundred and fifteen people in 2008-09 and 546 in 2009-10, have been issued with direct measures for assault to injury by procurators fiscal in terms of the Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>

  <p>The new direct measures, introduced with unanimous support by this Parliament in 2007, have helped to make the summary criminal courts in Scotland faster and more effective and over 50,000 police officers and members of the public have been spared the need to go to court to give evidence.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is taking steps to help local authorities to benefit from each others&rsquo; experiences in relation to looked-after children, including those in kinship care, for example</p>

  <p>We have written to local authorities following the release of the latest Children Looked After Statistics, reminding them of their obligations and asking what further support they need to deliver these. We will use this dialogue to arrange a meeting with elected members and senior officials to explore progress made and how this can be replicated.</p>

  <p>In partnership with the Association of Directors of Social Work, we are organising a seminar to consider what our shared priorities should be in ensuring looked-after children, young people, care leavers and the people who look after them get the support they need.</p>

  <p>We are funding the Corporate Parenting National Training Programme, developed by Who Cares? Scotland. The programme is aimed at improving awareness and capacity of elected members, community planning partners, health board members and relevant health professions of their corporate parenting responsibilities.</p>

  <p>We have set up a Looked After Children Strategic Implementation Group to drive forward key elements of the agenda around improving outcomes for looked after children. This is a high level group with a membership which spans the looked after sector and local authorities will be represented by COSLA. The first meeting of this group will take place on 19 May 2010.</p>

  <p>The information requested is provided in the following table for 2005-06 onwards, the period for which electronic records are available. The information for 1999 to 2005 could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. Allocations are based on an application process, rather than being made automatically. The figures given below are total allocations for two separate grant schemes, relating to Local Air Quality Management and vehicle emissions testing. Not all local authorities apply for funding in a given financial year. Complete figures are not yet available for 2009-10.</p>

  <p>From 2008-09 all local authorities have also received a direct non ring fenced allocation for air quality work. This is a consequence of the concordat signed by the Scottish Ministers and the COSLA presidential team in November 2007, which rolled up a number of specific capital grants into a single General Capital Grant. The air quality allocation is based on funding provided over the previous five years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government expects NHS Grampian to provide the highest possible standard of healthcare and it has received a cash increase of &pound;16 million in its 2010-11 budget. NHS Grampian has advised that whilst the local requirement to deliver a 5% savings target during 2010-11 is challenging, it is achievable. The board is currently looking at a whole range of efficiency measures with a view to identifying those that will not impact on patient care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with local partners to promote a range of support which can help everyone, including people in this age group, to improve their ICT skills. This includes adult learning schemes, such as ICT training materials developed for tutors through the Adult Literacies Online website, and programmes in Scotland&rsquo;s libraries, which also offer free broadband internet access and often have specific initiatives aimed at older people. The Scottish Government is also reviewing the previous <em>Digital Inclusion in Partnership</em> national strategy &ndash; published under the former administration &ndash; and will use the output from that exercise to consider what further measures may be necessary to continue to improve digital inclusion in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government guidance on the use of planning agreements is set out in Planning Circular 1/2010: <em>Planning Agreements</em> . The guidance sets out a series of policy tests which are to be met before a planning agreement is sought. Planning authorities are expected to satisfy themselves that a planning agreement is both necessary and justified in any particular instance.</p>

  <p>In developing the guidance in Circular 1/2010 the Scottish Government undertook extensive public consultation. All views expressed were taken into account and the guidance, including the policy tests, has been generally welcomed by both public and private sector interests.</p>

  <p>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>To assist in managing the consequential risks associated with the pressure on the prison system when the prisoner population reaches defined levels in each establishment, the Assessed Operational Limit (AOL) was introduced in 2008 to establish the numerical level at which prison management assess they can safely operate the establishment in the short term.</p>

  <p>The AOL is a dynamic risk assessment of the capacity beyond which prison management assess there to be unacceptable risks, taking into account the health and safety of both prisoners and staff, the need to deliver an acceptable regime, European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) and other minimum requirements.</p>

  <p>When the prisoner population is in excess of the AOL, the SPS can no longer guarantee that the continued operation of Scotland&rsquo;s prisons is operationally safe or complaint with legal obligations.</p>

  <p>The AOL for each prison is reviewed periodically as circumstances change. The current AOL for each establishment is:</p>

  <p>The Energy Saving Scotland home renewables grant scheme has been withdrawn for electricity generating technologies and new build properties because new initiatives will encourage significant uptake of these technologies and in these properties. Home renewables grants will therefore have a greater impact if focussed on heat generating technologies in existing buildings.</p>

  <p>The forthcoming Feed-In Tariff will offer renewable electricity microgenerators a guaranteed payment for the electricity they generate for the next 20 years (25 for solar photovoltaic) and is expected to give an annual return on investment of 5-8%.</p>

  <p>In terms of new build, the Scottish Government is committed to improving the energy performance of new build homes and the 2007 document, <em>A Low Carbon Building Standards Strategy For Scotland</em> also known as <em>The Sullivan Report</em> produced by an expert panel for Scottish ministers, recommended staged standards leading towards zero carbon buildings by 2016-17, if practical.</p>

  <p>As a first step, the 2010 change in energy standards for homes should deliver carbon dioxide savings of 30% more than 2007 standards and the use of low carbon equipment and renewables will become increasingly common to comply with this minimum standard.</p>

  <p>Because of the unexpected spike in demand the Scottish Government did not formally consult with industry representatives regarding the withdrawal of the Energy Saving Scotland home renewables grants for electricity generating technologies. But we have an ongoing dialogue with industry representatives through the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland and the Scottish Microrenewables Working Group on the future of microgeneration support and the Feed-In Tariff.</p>

  <p>Also, our recent consultation on Conserve and Save: The Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Scotland asked questions on how Scottish Government support for microrenewables should be delivered in light of the UK Government&rsquo;s Clean Energy Cashback Schemes and how we can improve the energy performance of Scotland&rsquo;s housing to help meet our climate change objectives. The response to this consultation are available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>The Energy Saving Scotland home renewables grant scheme was ended for electricity generating technologies because this funding was allocated on a first come first served basis and saw a substantial increase in the uptake of grants for these technologies over the last few months.</p>

  <p>This led to a more rapid reduction of funds than anticipated and meant the scheme had to stop accepting new applications for electricity generating technologies just short of the introduction of the Feed-In Tariff on 1 April 2010.</p>

  <p>Home renewables grants currently remains open for heat generating technologies in existing buildings. New initiatives in relation to electricity technologies such as the Feed-In Tariff and enhanced energy standards in new buildings will encourage significant uptake of these technologies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive in what ways the WATERS fund will differ from the Wave and Tidal Energy Support Scheme in terms of (a) project eligibility, (b) applicant eligibility, (c) the type of support available, (d) the distribution of payments and (e) the expected number of successful applicants.</p>

  <p>The eligibility criteria under WATERS are broadly similar to those which applied under WATES. The key difference with respect to projects is that there is no requirement to locate at EMEC, or to connect directly to the relevant local distribution network. Meanwhile, WATERS has also ruled out from its current call applications for collaborative projects, as these have the option to respond to a separate call from the Technology Strategy Board.</p>

  <p>While capital intervention under WATES was capped at 40%, WATERS will be able to award grants ranging from 25% to 50% of eligible costs, depending on both the nature of the application and the size of the applicant. Unlike WATES, there will be no revenue payments available through the WATERS fund.</p>

  <p>Payments under WATERS will be made quarterly in arrears, based upon actual expenditure against pre-defined eligible costs. This is similar to the system of payments under WATES, which have been issued in arrears subject to the achievement of key agreed milestones. The expectation is that projects receiving support through WATERS will typically be of 18 to 24 month duration.</p>

  <p>One area where WATES and WATERS are entirely in sync is that neither fund opened with a view on the expected number of successful applicants.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that all patients have appropriate and timeous access to the services they need in NHS Scotland. It is, however, for NHS boards and local authorities to determine the level of service provision required for speech and language therapy based on local needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not set waiting time targets for the Allied Health Professions, including speech and language therapy. Waiting times are variable across Scotland and patients are seen on the basis of clinical need using locally determined criteria. The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 introduced a framework to support children and young people who face barriers to learning and guidance will be published this summer to support joint working between Allied Health Professionals and Education. This will enable more flexible working to deliver responsive, appropriate, timely and effective services. The act imposes a duty on appropriate agencies (including NHS boards) to comply with a request for help from a local authority within a period of 10 weeks.</p>
