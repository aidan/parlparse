  <p>No such assessment has been made. The aim of the proposed aggregates levy is to reflect, in the price of aggregates, the environmental costs imposed on society by quarrying. The public sector will face these costs in the same way as private business. The levy will increase the incentive to economise on the use of aggregates and to consider use of recycled material.</p>

  <p>There is no separate budget for the Agricultural Business Improvement Scheme (ABIS) which forms part of the Highlands and Islands Agricultural Programme (HIAP). The HIAP budget for the period 1994-99 is as follows:</p>

  <p>Of this, &pound;2.4 million has been revoked as it was not taken up by applicants within the two-year period for carrying out work and claiming grant. This leaves &pound;1.2 million of the total &pound;14.7 million to be reallocated. This sum has now been supplemented by an additional &pound;1 million announced by me on 16 November.</p>

  <p>Charges under the Groundwater Regulations are determined by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency which has responsibility for setting levels which enable the agency to move towards full recovery of the costs of regulation, in line with the polluter pays principle. These costs include those of inspecting authorised disposal areas, monitoring of groundwater, reviewing authorisations and maintaining records and public registers.</p>

  <p>The results of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions sponsored Study - Inverness-London Air Service: Economic Impact Assessment has not yet been submitted to Ministers and publishing arrangements have not been finalised. Scottish Executive officials commented on the methodology and on a draft report. Under the terms of the Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information, it would not be appropriate for the Executive to disclose information which would harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion and advice, including between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government. However, the emerging issues from this study, and those from the Scottish Airports and Air Services Study and other Regional Studies in the rest of the UK, are being co-ordinated and audited for consistency as part of the Regional Air Services Co-ordination (RASCO) Study. Once RASCO has been completed the next step will be for a UK-wide public consultation exercise.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to best value and modern government for Scotland. Ministers recognise that the staff of the Executive has made immense efforts to deliver devolution. The aim of civil service reform is to maximise the effectiveness of the staff of the Executive in order to deliver 21st <sup> </sup> Century Government and make it work for the people of Scotland. The Executive is developing and implementing innovative approaches, from more participative and issue-based policy making, to continuous improvement in delivery of services by the application of information and communication technology.</p>

  <p>To develop and lead the modernisation process, a parallel programme of civil service reform is under way. The Executive&#8217;s action plan focuses on key developments in leadership, business planning, performance management, diversity, and attracting and developing talent. To equip the staff to meet these challenges, training priorities have been overhauled and refocused; external recruitment is taking place at all levels; business processes are being re-engineered, and internal communications have been systematically developed and improved.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce the Executive has been successful in securing an additional &pound;3.58 million from Cabinet Office funds to support and accelerate this work. These funds will help develop corporate leadership by supporting the newly established Scottish Leadership Foundation and introducing 360 degree feedback; help to develop a new integrated business planning and performance management system; to increase diversity in the Executive by encouraging the recruitment and progression of people from traditionally under-represented groups &#8211; women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities; to boost the range of skills and experience available by substantially increasing staff interchange in partnership with public and private sectors; to raise skills levels, especially among junior staff, by introducing formal qualifications, and to develop more flexible ways of working which exploit the potential of information technology with benefits both to staff and to the Executive.</p>

  <p>On the basis of numbers in recent years, and taking into account the reducing trend in the need for paediatric cardiac surgery, it seems likely that around 4-7 children each year from the Borders Health Board area will require to have this form of surgery in Glasgow. Children from Dumfries &amp; Galloway Health Board are already referred to Glasgow for cardiac surgery.</p>

  <p>The statistics provided in question S1W-3322 cannot be broken down into source of referral. However, a referral for breast screening in a woman over the age of 64 is normally initiated by the woman herself. On occasions, women may seek the advice of their General Practitioner.</p>

  <p>Health boards are responsible for raising awareness about the breast screening programme and for providing information reminding women over 64 that they can attend for screening by contacting their General Practitioners or their local screening centres. In addition, breast screening centres are pro-active in raising awareness in women over the age of 64 when undertaking mobile screening in localities.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that the fourth progress report of action to implement our wide-ranging and extensive Land Reform Action Plan is published today. All MSPs are receiving copies.</p>

  <p>From this, members should note that we now plan to launch our draft Land Reform Bill in February 2001. Our strong commitment to this original and groundbreaking legislation means that we want to take the necessary preparation time to produce legislation that is effective in delivering our proposals for a community right to buy, a crofting community right to buy and a right of responsible access to land and inland water. There are many complex issues involved, and matters were raised with us during consultations which require consideration. I cannot promise that we shall please all consultees, but our aim is to strike the right balance and commitment of time at this preparatory stage is time well spent. We shall, of course, consult on the draft Bill.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to say that, since the May progress report, the National Parks (Scotland) Bill has completed its parliamentary passage and we have undertaken to consult on the principle and detail of possible legislative proposals to assist the Carbeth hutters.</p>

  <p>Both the tax regime and the regulation of the oil and gas industry are reserved matters.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is fully aware of the problems facing the fabrication industry, not only in Scotland but throughout the rest of the UK and indeed Europe, and of the impact of this on employment and the economy. The Oil and Gas Industry Task Force, on which the Executive is represented, has set up a group to look urgently at these problems, which are largely structural. They arise from changes, such as the much smaller field sizes currently being exploited as the UK Continental Shelf moves towards being a mature province, and from developments in production technology, including sub-sea technology.</p>

  <p>In <i>A Programme for Government</i> , the Scottish Executive has made a commitment to expanding treatment and rehabilitation facilities for drug, alcohol and substance abuse. An action priority in Scotland&#8217;s drug strategy is to provide a range of services to meet the assessed needs of drug misusers and their families, including improved and appropriately targeted services for women. At local level, the Executive funds &quot;Routes out&quot; Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) in Glasgow. This SIP specifically aims to prevent women entering into prostitution and seeks to help those already involved in it, to leave prostitution behind. Support is offered to access services such as safe housing, childcare support, drug programmes and training and employment opportunities. The Rough Sleepers Initiative (RSI), a centrally funded Challenge Fund which considers local authority bids for funding, accepted a Glasgow bid to fund a project/research worker at Base 75, a drop in centre for prostitutes in Glasgow.</p>
