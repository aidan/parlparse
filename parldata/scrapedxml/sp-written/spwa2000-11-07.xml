  <p>No. The five-year set-aside scheme was a stand-alone EU scheme for taking land out of agricultural production and pre-dated the Arable Area Payments Scheme.</p>

  <p>All new Accident and Emergency ambulance vehicles are commissioned into service fully equipped to the specification current at the time of procurement. Operational arrangements are in place to maintain the ambulances to the specification standard. There are no equipment shortages, although there are occasions when ambulance crews are obliged to leave equipment, such as cervical collars and spinal boards, with the patient on arrival at hospital. These are retrieved later once x rays have been taken and a diagnosis confirmed.</p>

  <p>A key element of the Scottish Ambulance Service&#8217;s Operations Rooms Review is the separation of the Non-Emergency Service control function from the Accident and Emergency function. Non-Emergency Service controls will in future operate from an increased number of hospital and regionally based sites, providing a more flexible, locally based service to better meet the needs of non-emergency patients. Non-emergency staff will not handle emergency calls and the service will continue to take emergency cases to the nearest appropriate hospital.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the letter of 4 October 2000 from Ross Finnie to me regarding the Climate Change Levy (CCL) and the Scottish tomato industry, whether, given that the CCL discount amounts to 50% whereas Dutch tomato growers are to receive 100%, it is making representations to Her Majesty&#8217;s government with regard to this differential and whether any assessment has been made of the impact of this differential discount on the viability of the Scottish tomato industry.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-11-07.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1107.htm#10507">

  <p>The 100% exemption from the energy tax enjoyed by the Dutch horticulture sector ended in 1999 and only covered natural gas, LPG, semi-heavy oil and gas oil. They still benefit from a much reduced rate for these fuels, but this is balanced by the fact that they pay the full rate for electricity, and receive no special treatment under other taxes on energy products.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s position on greenhouse gas reductions is that every energy user in every sector and geographical area in Scotland should contribute to meeting the UK&#8217;s Kyoto commitments. However, the UK Government has recognised the special position of horticulture as an energy intensive sector, exposed to international competition but not eligible for a negotiated agreement. In addition to the 50% discount, which applies for five years not only to gas and oil but also to coal and electricity, the package of benefits to the horticulture sector will also include:</p>

  <p>targeted support from the climate change levy energy efficiency fund;</p>

  <p>an extension to the list of investments qualifying for enhanced capital allowances to include thermal screens.</p>

  <p>It is extremely difficult to make a meaningful comparison between the horticulture sectors in different countries because several other factors affecting costs need to be taken into account in addition to Climate Change Levy arrangements, including the relevant rates of other forms of taxation.</p>

We therefore propose to make up to &pound;0.5 million available in each of the next three financial years to promote and deliver safety training for fishermen in Scotland.

The Scottish Executive has provided additional funding for the Health Service this year, and we have announced further real terms funding increases over the years 2003-04. We are also working with NHS Trusts to encourage them to develop and adopt new processes and ways of working which are designed to suit patients and to reduce avoidable waiting.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory definition of a local holiday. Dates of local holidays vary from area to area across Scotland and are usually agreed between local government, local business interests and other interested local parties. Such holidays often have their roots in historical events of significance to the locality or represent the traditional holiday period in that area. Local holidays are not prescriptive and employers are not obliged to give employees leave on any such day, subject to the terms of any contract of employment. The dates of local holidays across Scotland can be obtained from the publication <i>Scottish</i> <i>Public</i> <i>Holidays</i> <i>2000</i> , a copy of which has been placed in SPICe for reference purposes (Bib. no. 9399).</p>

  <p>Bank holidays in the United Kingdom are established under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 (C.80). The 1971 Act provides that banks are not liable for failing to process certain transactions on such a day. Schedule 1 to the 1971 Act prescribes the dates recognised as bank holidays in the United Kingdom, though that list may be supplemented by an annual Royal Proclamation of additional bank holidays. Bank holidays are not prescriptive and employers are not obliged to give employees leave on any such day, subject to the terms of any contract of employment. A full list of Scottish bank holidays for this year is set out in the publication <i>Scottish</i> <i>Public</i> <i>Holidays</i> <i>2000</i> , a copy of which has been placed in SPICe for reference purposes (Bib. no. 9399).</p>

  <p>There is no definition of a public holiday in Scotland, although the phrase is sometimes used as a generic term to refer to both bank and local holidays. Bank holidays have their basis in the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 and their dates are consistent across Scotland. Local holidays are not prescribed in statute, but vary from area to area across Scotland; they are usually agreed between local government, local business interests and other interested local parties. The dates of both bank and local holidays across Scotland can be obtained from the publication <i>Scottish</i> <i>Public</i> <i>Holidays</i> <i>2000</i> , a copy of which has been placed in SPICe for reference purposes (Bib. no. 9399).</p>

  <p>Most of the Parliament&#8217;s publications are made available both on the Internet (not the Intranet) and in printed form. This is to ensure that information about the Parliament and its work is accessible equally to all parts of society. Print publication costs for Core Parliament Publications (Business Bulletin, Minutes of Proceedings, Official Report, Written Answers Report, Committee Official Reports, Committee Reports, Bills, WHISP) from May 1999 to end September 2000 are &pound;253,911. On average 93% of these documents are delivered to the SPICe Document Supply Service, the balance being retained by the product owners or issued to the media, the Legal Office and Public Information, among others. Despatch costs, i.e. the shipping of Parliament documents between the Print Centre and the Parliament, are an average &pound;689 per month, although some 10% of these costs relate to other ad hoc Parliament publications. Costs of sending Core Publications to MSPs&#8217; local offices are an average &pound;541 per month.</p>

  <p>The Information Systems Manager maintains a close watch on Parliament staff requirements for paper documents before authorising payment of invoices, to ensure that only those that are needed are produced. This figure fluctuates depending on the perceived importance, usually in terms of media interest, of committee reports in particular. Otherwise only those copies that are explicitly required are printed, and thus costs are kept to a minimum. MSPs are entitled to two printed copies of each of the Parliament&#8217;s core publications (Business Bulletin, Minutes of Proceedings, Official Report, Written Answers Report, Committee Official Reports, Committee Reports, Bills, WHISP). The SPICe Document Supply Service encourages MSPs to use the electronic version on the Internet, but will supply printed copies where this is preferred. Individual MSPs must stipulate in writing if printed rather than electronic copies are required.</p>
