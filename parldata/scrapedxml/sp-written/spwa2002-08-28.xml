<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-08-28.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0828.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided the Scottish Ambulance Service with an allocation of &#163;108.783 million for 2002-03, an increase of 7.4% on last year. The indicative allocations for 2003-04 and 2004-05 provide for further uplifts of 7.4% in each year. These represent unprecedented levels of investment and reflect our support for the service's modernisation agenda.</p>

  <p>Across Scotland these increased resources will support the improvement of the service's operations rooms functions, the roll-out of priority based dispatch, the conversion of a number of part-time ambulance stations to full-time and the introduction of dedicated non-emergency transport services for renal dialysis patients. The service plans to employ around 200 additional staff over the next two years to support these developments.</p>

  <p>How these improvements are rolled-out across Scotland and how these additional staff are deployed are operational matters for the Scottish Ambulance Service and its divisions. For Lanarkshire, this means an additional 10 accident and emergency staff this financial year to help alleviate the problems of uncovered shifts. They will be fully trained and operational by mid-September. Over the next two years, the service will also be providing an additional 24 front-line paramedic vehicle crew staff for priority based dispatch. These two initiatives represent a 23% increase in current staff establishment. Another step which has been taken in Lanarkshire is the introduction of revised shift rotas to provide more effective cover. These rotas are constantly reviewed to ensure that resources match demand. The merger of the Glasgow and Motherwell operations (control) rooms (at Glasgow) in October will also allow for better deployment of emergency ambulances in the Lanarkshire area, since the merger will enable the operations rooms staff to know immediately where the emergency resources are across the area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive monitors the performance of the Scottish Ambulance Service and holds the service to account through the Accountability Review process supported by the Performance Assessment Framework. The issues surrounding performance within the West Central Division, including Lanarkshire, were discussed at the Accountability Review meeting on Monday 5 August 2002. Response times performance across the six divisions of the service shall continue to be monitored by the department.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources and to improving the regulatory regime in the marine and coastal area by simplifying administrative arrangements. A number of initiatives in this field have already been undertaken, or are on-going, such as the review of aquaculture regulation and the Water Environment and Water Services Bill.</p>

  <p>The review of regulation of development in coastal and marine waters in England and Wales is of close interest to the Scottish Executive, as the Executive has devolved responsibility for the main legislation which the review will cover. The Executive is monitoring the progress of the review, in particular through our representation on the review forum, and will consider the possible implications of the process and findings for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>During 2001, there were 15 injury road accidents that were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on the A811 between its junction with the A81 at Ballat Cross and the centre of Stirling.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that this figure is based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. It may differ from any figure which the local authority would provide now, because it does not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>Information on spending on the strategic road network is not held by local authority area. Detailed information on historic spending on motorways and trunk roads is set out in the annual publication <i>Scottish Transport Statistics</i> . Copies of this are held in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Healthy Respect, the national health demonstration project currently running in Lothian, has launched its innovative postal testing kit for chlamydia, which is now available from non-medical settings such as music stores and pharmacies.</p>

  <p>The Executive has funded one recently completed and two on-going studies investigating the feasibility, acceptability and cost-effectiveness of screening for chlamydia in a range of clinical settings and populations.</p>

  <p>I have also recently announced the membership of the group taking forward the development of a national Sexual Health Strategy for Scotland. The strategy will include measures to tackle the rise in sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia, and to enhance the provision of sexual health services around Scotland.</p>

  <p>I recently announced our plans for taking forward the development of a national Sexual Health Strategy for Scotland. The strategy will include measures to tackle the rise in sexually transmitted infections and to enhance the provision of sexual health services around Scotland.</p>

  <p>The initiatives undertaken by the Health Education Board for Scotland and NHS boards in the sexual health field will also contribute to the aim of reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted infections.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no such plans. If the local authority or the new National Park Authority had proposals these would be subject to approval from the Scottish Executive.</p>
