  <p>VisitScotland recognise the importance of preserving historic graveyards and gravestones, since being able to see them is important for the many visitors interested in their Scottish ancestors. Historic Scotland publish a guide for practitioners on conservation of historic graveyards, covering technical conservation issues relating to graveyards such as advice on specialised repair and conservation techniques, and an inventory of Scottish sites.</p>

The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) collates this information and codes the cause of death data using the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

  <p>Responsibility for responding to incidents such as the sinking of the <em>Jambo </em> is reserved and rests with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which is co-ordinating the current salvage effort.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency, and a number of other relevant organisations, is involved in an environment group which has been set up to monitor and advise on the situation in accordance with the National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations (a copy of which is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre - Bib. Number 17730).</p>

  <p>The first priority was to identify the points of release, and stem the flow of, diesel oil leaking from the wreck and to undertake analysis of the cargo with a view to its removal as quickly as practicable. The MCA has advised that the recovery of the ship's diesel fuel bunkers and other pollutants was completed as far as practicable on 8 July. Salvage plans for the removal of the cargo have also been prepared and agreed. A number of strategies are also being considered to minimise the impact of any potential pollution on fish farms in the area.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the (a) capital cost and (b) annual operational cost (i) in total and (ii) per place will be of the 29 additional secure accommodation places referred to in its news release SEed228/2003 of 24 March 2003.</p>

  <p>The capital costs will be around &#163;45 million, which will cover both the development costs of the additional 29 places and the modernisation of 78 places. Current average weekly costs are around &#163;3,000 for each child. Secure schools are responsible for managing their operational costs and setting their costs per place. The Executive has asked them to look to minimise their weekly costs while delivering a high level of care and education for the young people in their care.</p>

  <p>So far as those persons in respect of whom the Scottish ministers exercise discretion over the place and conditions of detention are concerned, there was one case in 2001 where the unavailability of a suitable place in secure accommodation led to the young person being detained initially in a penal establishment.</p>

  <p>Directors of social work decide whether a child should be placed in secure accommodation following a supervision requirement. Neither Scottish Children's Reporter administration nor local authorities categorise secure authorisations on offence or non-offence grounds.</p>

  <p>The Executive gave the Parliament's Audit Committee the information held centrally to support the case for an increase in secure accommodation on 27 June. This includes details of &quot;unmet need for secure accommodation&quot; identified by councils in 2001-02.</p>
