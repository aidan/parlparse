  <p>Independent reviews of the physical security arrangements for processing the 2001 Census information and the measures to protect the statistical confidentiality of the data were commissioned by the Registrar Generals for Scotland, England and Wales, and Northern Ireland and undertaken last year. The outcome of the reviews and recommendations of the Review Teams, including a joint statement from the Registrars General were published today in a report by the Office for National Statistics, the General Register Office for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. The Registrars General have accepted all the recommendations and have acted on them or are taking action to ensure they are implemented.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and its agencies currently have around 230 posts in Dumfries and Galloway. There has been no transfer of Scottish Executive posts to this area since July 1999. Two new posts have been created in the region.</p>

  <p>Last December I announced to Parliament that detailed reviews of the Edinburgh operations of six public bodies would be undertaken to individual timetables based on lease breaks and other operational factors. In accordance with this timetable we aim to be in a position to make decisions on the location of the Scottish Public Pensions Agency by the end of March and the Health Education Board for Scotland in mid-2001.</p>

  <p>It is considered that the practice of keeping reasons for prosecution decision making confidential is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Convention does not give victims any general right to have cases prosecuted but the Article 8 right to respect for private life does militate against any step which risks putting private information about victims or unprosecuted accused persons into the public domain. The possibility that prosecution might well be necessary in some cases in order to protect inter alia the Article 8 interests of victims is, of course, a factor in decision making.</p>

  <p>The rules which govern the advertising of vacancies for general practitioners are set out in the National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995. The regulations require the notice of vacancy to include details of the practice and the closing date for applications. They also require the health board or Primary Care Trust to bring the vacancy to the attention of prospective applicants outside the area. These requirements were followed by Highland Primary Care NHS Trust in relation to the vacancy at Helmsdale.</p>

  <p>The number of adverts to be placed, the duration of the exercise and the publications in which adverts appear are not laid down in regulations and are matters for decision locally.</p>

  <p>It is open to national voluntary organisations involved in health-related activities, which complement those provided by the NHS, to apply for funding assistance under section 16B of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. Health boards also have delegated authority to provide grants under section 16B to local voluntary groups, where appropriate. Each application received is carefully considered on its merits, alongside competing demands. I understand that the Executive has not received an application for section 16B funding from any group supporting those suffering from the side effects of hormone replacement therapy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that the implications of this Act are wide ranging and its interpretation not without difficulty. For this reason the Confidentiality and Security Advisory Group for Scotland (CSAGS) was established to provide advice on the confidentiality and security of health-related information to the Scottish Executive, the Public and to Health Care Professionals.</p>

  <p>CSAGS will, subject to consultation, issue policy advice and a series of guidance notes intended to codify practice in the proper use of personal health information for reasons other than direct patient care. Guidance and information is being sought from both the Information Commissioner and the GMC.</p>

  <p>The main task in the immediate future is to develop a small number of principles to underpin the use of personal health information by the NHS Scotland and related bodies (including disease registers). The principles will be incorporated into a revised Code of Practice on the Confidentiality of Personal Health Information providing detailed guidance to the NHS Scotland and other agencies prior to the expiry of the main batch of transitional arrangements to the 1998 Act in October 2001.</p>

  <p>Scotland has a unique Health Data Set that permits more detailed analyses of health information than is possible in the rest of Europe, apart from the Scandinavian countries. Patient identifiable data have been collected for over 30 years, and used to link together individual patient experiences until death. By linking administrative data sets with individual research and audit data we can investigate the impact of key policy changes and medical interventions on improving survival rates and reducing incidence and prevalence of disease. Examples include:</p>

  <p>improving survival rates from diagnosis of cancer;</p>

  <p>demonstrate the benefits of cancer screening and impact of adjuvant therapy on survival for breast cancer;</p>

  <p>identify clusters of disease which could not have occurred by chance;</p>

  <p>identifying possible contacts for infectious disease outbreaks (AIDS; E.coli; BSE; meningitis) for fast tracing to contain the outbreak;</p>

  <p>post-market surveillance of drugs and vaccines for adverse effects in the general population.</p>

  <p>It is not known whether any significant collections of health information have been discontinued due to the introduction of the Act and subsequent guidance issued by the General Medical Council (GMC).

  <p>The NHS in Lothian and various Edinburgh-based voluntary organisations have conducted a number of exploratory research projects and analyses of the health needs of the homeless population.</p>

  <p>This year, the Lothian RSI partnership received around &#163;1 million to improve health care services for rough sleepers. This will provide additional health workers, not just in Edinburgh but also in East and West Lothian; enhanced services, upgraded medical equipment and it will fund two research projects.</p>

  <p>Lothian has also taken advantage of new Personal Medical Services arrangements for GPs. The Edinburgh Homeless Practice has three salaried GPs and a dedicated primary care team for homeless people. Independent research carried out on The Edinburgh Homeless Practice recently, as part of its Personal Medical Services pilot, praised the service provided to homeless people, and the approach taken by staff.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health</i>, the Health Plan for Scotland, recognises the need for the NHS to respond effectively to the needs of homeless people and rough sleepers as a key element in tackling health inequalities. The Executive is continuing to act to ensure that the health needs of rough sleepers are addressed effectively.

  <p>The joint &quot;It Pays to Pay&quot; Working Group on council tax collection, which we established, is preparing protocol guidance for local authorities which will promote uniformity of practice. The protocol will set down appropriate procedures to be adopted between local authorities and agents employed by them when recovering debt and instructing enforcement action. In addition, COSLA is preparing best practice guidance for issue to local authorities.</p>

  <p>Poindings and warrant sales are, of course, to be abolished not later than 31 December 2002. The working group set up by the Deputy First Minister to identify a replacement for poinding and warrant sale is making good progress and is due to report to the Deputy First Minister in June. Any replacement which is brought into effect will be the subject of appropriate guidance.</p>

  <p>The remit and details of the work of the working group are available on the Scottish Executive website. The full address can be obtained from the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. The Deputy First Minister announced on 8 June 2000 that, in addition to the work on poinding and warrant sale, the Executive would review the law of diligence as a whole, and made clear that representations would be welcome from anyone. In any event, any proposals for reform will be the subject of consultation. It is, of course, open to the working group to make known any concerns which it may have as a result of its deliberations but which lie beyond its own remit.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> , confirmed our publication plans for the national review. The promised audit document was published on 12 February and at the same time all health and social care agencies received a progress assessment report specific to their own area set within the national context findings.</p>

  <p>This now provides agencies with the original 1999 template guidance, a local digest of their own position within the national context and a care pathway planning and audit tool. Summary reports on continuing progress have been invited from all agencies for September this year and thereafter.</p>

  <p>Work continues with the local authorities and NHS Trusts on a National Discharge Protocol for Mentally Disordered Offenders for publication later this year. Work is also progressing on the recommendations of the Millan and MacLean Committees, some of which focus on mentally disordered offenders. Our policy proposals will be announced in the coming months following proper consultation.</p>

  <p>Student nurses receive funding support by way of a non-means tested bursary and other allowances where appropriate. Generally other students in higher education are eligible to apply for support in the form of paid tuition fees and a partly means tested repayable loan.</p>

  <p>The main difference, therefore, is that some higher education students may get less support for living costs than others because their level of funding is dependent on family and personal circumstances; and that living costs support is partly repayable. By contrast the student nurses receive the fixed rate of bursary (lower and higher dependent on age) and paid tuition fees irrespective of circumstances.</p>

  <p>Arrangements for student nurse financial support are currently being reviewed.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s future strategy for ports is set out in the ports policy paper, <i> Modern Ports</i> , published on 27 November 2000, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 9874). The paper provides a comprehensive statement of future policy on a wide range of issues relating to the ports industry, both devolved and reserved. It presents a strategy for devolved ports issues in the context of shared UK-wide policy aims, agreed between the Scottish Executive, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the devolved Administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>The paper sets out objectives for the departments concerned to achieve through working together with the industry, its users and other interests. It recognises the importance of the ports industry in Scotland to the local and national economy and integrated transport policy and for the ports industry to develop and promote its commercial opportunities.</p>

  <p>Funding is available from the Executive for certain fishery related harbour development, for piers and harbours improvements in the Highlands and Islands and from the EC through European Funds in eligible areas. Freight Facility Grants can also be available for inland waterway projects which can include expenditure on ports and harbours.</p>

  <p>Historical figures for pupil:teacher ratios are published regularly in Statistical Bulletins. The following table sets out the pupil:teacher ratio for publicly funded primary and secondary schools for selected years since 1980 together with the fraction of a teacher per pupil derived from them. Projections on a similar basis from 2000 up to 2015 are also given. These projections take into account the additional teachers planned following the recent agreement on teachers&#8217; pay and conditions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-1786 by Sarah Boyack on 17 May 2000, why the Scottish ministers did not lay before the Parliament in December 2000 their proposals for the setting of a national road traffic reduction target as required by the Road Traffic Reduction (National Targets) Act 1998.</p>

  <p>My previous answer was based on an expectation that research commissioned to inform the road traffic reduction report would have been completed. However, the research proved more complex than anticipated at that time and the final report is not yet ready. Once received, its conclusions will need to be analysed and a decision taken on whether further work is required.</p>

  <p>The road traffic reduction report will now form an integral part of Scotland&#8217;s Transport Delivery Plan which is expected to be published later in the year.</p>

  <p>We expect discussions regarding the restored supply of the BCG vaccine to be concluded shortly.</p>

  <p>The Executive wrote to health board immunisation co-ordinators in Scotland on 15 March to establish how many secondary school children are currently eligible to be vaccinated but who remain unvaccinated. Priority will be given to those pupils due to leave school this summer.</p>

  <p>A consultation paper on the Water Services Bill is being published today. It describes the Executive&#8217;s proposals for creating a single all Scotland public water authority and for establishing a regulatory framework to ensure that increasing competition in the water industry benefits customers, while safeguarding public health, the environment and social objectives. Copies of the paper have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 12181) and will be available shortly on the Executive website. The deadline for comments on the paper to reach the Scottish Executive is 13 June 2001</p>

  <p>As stated in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change </i> the Executive proposes a wide-ranging consultation on children&#8217;s oral health, which will seek views on a range of measures, including ways in which the benefit of fluoride can be made available, for example through the fluoridation of public water supplies or by means of fluoridated drinks or tablets. A draft consultation paper and arrangements for the consultation are currently being developed and will be announced in due course.</p>
