  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to ensure that the testing for Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) at all times achieves the highest standards of accuracy; what criteria must be met in order to have the ban lifted, and how many areas are near to meeting these criteria.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-11-30.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa1130.htm#2402">

  <p>The Fisheries Research Services&#8217; Marine Laboratory in Aberdeen undertakes the testing for ASP. They maintain the highest possible standards of accuracy by analysing three samples of both Laboratory Reference Material (LRM) and Domoic Acid standards with every batch of samples tested.</p>

  <p>The ban on scallop fishing will be lifted when toxin levels are consistently below the legal limit and scientific advice indicates that it is safe to do so.</p>

  <p>There is a downward trend in the results of tests for ASP carried out on scallops collected from the North Minches and indeed an area of water in the North Minches was re-opened to scallop fishing on 9 November 1999.</p>

  <p>There are, to the best of my knowledge, no courses which fall within this definition.</p>

  <p>I understand from UHI, the company promoting the University of the Highlands and Islands Project, that all degree courses approved through UHI in 1998 were also subsequently offered this academic year.</p>

  <p>Securing the validation of proposed courses is the responsibility of UHI and its partner colleges.</p>

  <p>Validation of proposed new degree courses is a matter between the college and the validating body. I understand that an Open University Validation Service panel met on 28 and 29 June 1999 and agreed to validate the proposed BA in Fine Art, but imposed conditions which Moray College has not yet been able to meet. The College had previously offered a BA in Visual Arts, validated by The Robert Gordon University. That degree has been discontinued.</p>

  <p>The current aid limits are 30% in Development Areas and 15% in Intermediate Areas, though the majority of assisted projects are aided at a level significantly below these limits. New aid limits have not yet been decided but EU guidelines allow for a maximum of 20% in most Scottish areas on the proposed new Assisted Areas map.</p>

  <p>Tayside University Hospitals NHS Trust reported a year to date deficit of &pound;4.9 million as at end September 1999. The Trust report the reasons as including the impact of revaluation of their estate on their capital charges; the need to ensure full preparation for the Year 2000 date change; and a range of other cost pressures. The Trust and Tayside Health Board are working jointly on measures to remedy the position.</p>

  <p>In the current financial year, the Scottish Executive has committed over &pound;388 million to Tayside - 4.25% more than last year, and we look to the Trust and Health Board to ensure that a financial balance is achieved over the year as a whole.</p>

  <p>There is no definition of a high technology or low technology bed. Data that would specifically identify the cost of providing a high technology or low technology bed is not collected centrally. Cost data is collected by specialty or specialty group.</p>

  <p>However, an indication of bed running costs can be obtained if it is assumed that beds within the &quot;specialty&quot; Intensive Care Unit (ICU) equate to high technology and that all other specialties combined equate to low technology. The other specialties can be further disaggregated to show the costs of long stay beds.</p>

  <p>The cost per occupied bed day, inpatients only, in 1998-99 was as follows:</p>

  <p>CoSLA has suggested that this matter could be considered by the Scottish Executive. This might appropriately be undertaken in the context of any future review of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.</p>

  <p>Expert advice on the hazards associated with the use of sunbeds has been provided most recently by the National Radiological Protection Board in its report <i>Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation on Human Health</i> (Stationery Office, 1995). The report recommends that the use of sunbeds and sunlamps for cosmetic tanning should be discouraged. Health Education Board for Scotland leaflets for the public on avoiding cancer and on being safe in the sun confirm that the use of sunbeds is not recommended.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is very much in favour of people with asthma being fully informed about their treatment and as far as possible taking an active role in the management of their condition. The Health Department, at the request of the National Asthma Campaign (Scotland), met the costs of the self-help card <i>Control Your Asthma</i> which is intended as a self-management tool for people with asthma. Supplies of the card are still available.</p>

  <p>It must be borne in mind, however, that the treatment of people with asthma is not identical in every case, and must ultimately be a matter for individual clinical judgement after discussion with the patient and, in the case of young children, the family.</p>

  <p>Table 2 shows the number of patient episodes per consultant at each centre. The figures in the table were arrived at by adding the number of patient episodes for each centre for medical oncology and for clinical oncology and dividing by the whole time equivalent consultant figures given in Table 1. Patient episodes comprise inpatient, outpatient and day case episodes. The number of patient episodes is not the same as the number of patients, as the number of visits by an individual patient varies according to the type and stage of the disease. The figures do not include outreach patients seen outwith the centre and do not show the total workload per consultant. The table should be read in conjunction with the notes below.</p>

  <p>In keeping with the priority that we attach to cancer, the Scottish Cancer Group has been set up to take forward at national level the further development of cancer services. The Group&#8217;s tasks include the establishment of robust systems of clinical audit to underpin quality assurance systems, the development of waiting time targets for cancer services and the establishment of managed clinical networks.</p>

  <p>Specific financial information related to new investment in cancer services at local level is not, however, held centrally. Health Boards are given an annual general revenue allocation. It is for Health Boards to determine within the funds available how to manage and deliver local healthcare services that meet the healthcare needs of their resident populations, including cancer services, one of the clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive endorses the position taken by successive Governments for many years, that complementary or alternative therapies may offer relief to some people suffering from a wide variety of conditions. Legislation allows practitioners of such therapies to offer their services, subject only to some general restrictions such as those on prescribing and supplying medicines and giving injections. Members of the public are free to use these services privately if they choose, and a GP or hospital clinician may refer a patient for alternative treatment. The GP or hospital clinician would require to be satisfied of the value of the treatment and the competence of the practitioner, and would remain responsible for the patient&#8217;s medical care. It is also open to Health Boards to provide alternative therapies.</p>

  <p>Many forms of alternative therapy are already available as NHS treatment. The Scottish Office Department of Health&#8217;s National Medical Advisory Committee produced, in November 1996, a report on the current activity levels in acupuncture, homeopathy, osteopathy and chiropractic, which included guidelines for Health Boards on making purchasing arrangements for their provision. These guidelines, as the report made clear, might be applied to other forms of alternative therapy. Herbal medicine would come into that category. The guidelines do not, however, require Boards to purchase particular therapies, which is a matter for the Boards, based on assessment of need in their areas.</p>

  <p>With regard to criminal trials, standing the decision in Starrs, the Lord Advocate has decided that cases will not be prosecuted before temporary Judges. I understand that the Lord President has decided that no new civil cases will be allocated to temporary Judges meantime. There are no adjourned trials before a temporary Judge. Four criminal cases require to be called before temporary Judges for sentence. One temporary Judge is engaged in three civil cases, in two of which the parties have agreed that he should continue to hear the case. In the third civil case the question of whether the temporary Judge should continue to deal with the matter remains before the court for consideration.</p>
