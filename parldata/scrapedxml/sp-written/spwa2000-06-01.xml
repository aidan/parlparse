  <p>The information held is incomplete and is not broken down by local authority.</p>

  <p>The HM Inspectors of Schools report <i>Achievement for All</i> published in 1996 drew on the results of international studies on achievement, a review of research literature and the Assessment of Achievement Programme to help inform its findings. There has been no recent specifically Scottish research which examines the effects of class organisation on learning and teaching.</p>

  <p>Judgements made during HMI inspections suggest that when used effectively the use of attainment groups, setting or broadband setting, can help improve pupil performance.</p>

  <p>Targets for S1 and S2 attainment are set for reading, writing and mathematics but not for science and modern languages. Progress against each of these targets, by authority, are detailed in the publication <i>Raising Standards &#8211; Setting Targets, Setting Targets in Scottish Schools National and Education Authority Information 1999</i> published by HMI Audit Unit in December 1999.</p>

  <p>The framework for setting targets in secondary schools to raise levels of achievement in numeracy and literacy has offered a clear focus for improvement for schools and authorities which will help improve ability and raise attainment in these subject areas.</p>

  <p>Scottish Homes has recently published design guidance entitled <i>Housing For Varying Needs</i> which endorses barrier-free design as the preferred standard for mainstream housing. Scottish Ministers have agreed that, where possible, all new housing funded by Scottish Homes should be built to the standards contained within the guidance. The guidance is also recommended to local authorities and commended to the private sector.</p>

  <p>The barrier-free requirements in the Scottish Homes guidance are broadly equivalent to the English and Welsh &quot;Lifetime&quot; standards concept.</p>

  <p>Building regulations are presently being considered for amendment, to ensure that effective energy efficiency measures are incorporated into new buildings. It is the intention to issue a consultation document in July on proposed changes to Part J, <i>Conservation of fuel and power</i> , of the Technical Standards for compliance with the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1990.</p>

  <p>The information requested is given in the table below.</p>

  <p>We are committed to ensuring that the courts have a wide range of sentencing options available so that sentencers can make a non-custodial decision where they consider it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

  <p>We are working with local authorities to improve the quality and effectiveness of community disposals with the aim of increasing the confidence of sentencers and the public in such disposals. (The use of probation and community service orders has almost doubled over the past 10 years.)</p>

  <p>We have funded the national roll-out of Supervised Attendance Orders for fine defaulters and are considering extension of the current pilot diversion from prosecution schemes.</p>

  <p>New community disposals being piloted include Drug Treatment and Testing Orders for drug misusers who commit frequent crimes to fund their drug addiction.</p>

  <p>We are also piloting Restriction of Liberty Orders (electronic tagging) and are reviewing options for wider use of electronic monitoring.</p>

  <p>Funding for community disposals has increased by 21% over the past two years to stand at &pound;42.8 million.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the UK Government recently announced targets for road accident casualty reductions in the period to 2010. These include a 50% reduction in the number of child fatal and serious casualties. The targets, together with a strategy for achieving them, were published on 1 March.</p>

  <p>Road safety publicity is a powerful tool which has had a major influence on public attitudes and behaviour. The Scottish Executive provides funding to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign for the development of key road safety educational resources and publicity messages. The campaign has produced a range of excellent road safety educational resources and conducted highly effective publicity campaigns.</p>

  <p>The Executive will be allocating a further &pound;500,000 to the campaign in the current financial year, in addition to the planned funding of &pound;1,745,000, to enable it to step up its programme of road safety publicity and education initiatives.</p>

  <p>The consultants have held a series of focus groups and individual in-depth interviews in West Central Scotland and a consultative forum in Cumbernauld. The forum was well attended and provided the opportunity for comment on the range of problems and possible solutions, the scope of the study and the study objectives. A further consultative forum is planned before the end of June. We expect the consultant&#8217;s report on the preliminary stage of the study around the end of July.</p>

  <p>It is entirely a matter for councils as local roads authorities to determine expenditure on the structural and cyclical maintenance of local roads in their areas from within the block resources available to them for financing a wide range of services for which they are responsible. It is for local authorities to determine their spending priorities across these services.</p>

  <p>The Special General Meeting being held by Standard Life on 27 June 2000 will include a vote on the company&#8217;s mutual status. The issue of demutualisation is a matter for the members and the board of Standard Life and the Executive does not therefore wish to anticipate the outcome of the vote. However, as Standard Life is a major Scottish employer, the Executive will continue to monitor developments.</p>

  <p>The list below contains details from our records on Article 4 directions. The list contains directions, approved for conservation areas, which include restrictions on permitted development rights for telecommunications development. Our records prior to 1992, when the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992 came into force, may be incomplete.</p>

  <p>The promotion of Article 4 Directions for conservation areas is usually a matter for individual planning authorities in the first instance. Such directions require the approval of the Scottish Ministers. The Scottish Ministers may also promote Article 4 Directions for any area that they may specify. This power does not extend to all permitted development rights but does include those for telecommunications code system operators. We have no plans at present to use this power.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ministers may also remove specific permitted development rights by amending the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive proposes in the Integrated Transport (Scotland) Bill to take powers which will enable Ministers subsequently to set, common to all Scottish local authorities, a minimum level of concession for pensioners and disabled people travelling within Scotland. A research study is currently underway examining the costs of a variety of different options, with a view to reporting in August. Free travel on rail, bus, ferry and underground services throughout Scotland is already available to blind people following the introduction on 1 December 1999 of a national concessionary travel scheme. It was brought about through a voluntary partnership agreement between the Scottish Executive, Scottish local authorities, Strathclyde Passenger Transport and rail, bus and ferry companies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to require local authorities to specify that only transport with fitted seatbelts can be used on contracted services conveying pupils to or from school.</p>

  <p>Contracts for the provision of school transport are matters for the local authorities and there are no plans for the Executive to make specific requirements relating to the fitment of seat belts. It is open to local authorities, as a matter of their own policy in awarding a contract, to consider specifications which exceed legal requirements.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many awards of Transport Challenge Funding have been made, committed or offered to local authorities for projects which include dedicated bus lanes; what procedures it uses to ensure that such projects will reduce congestion, and whether it sets performance targets for local authority projects when it awards Transport Challenge Funding.</p>

  <p>So far 11 projects which include dedicated bus lanes have been awarded funding from the Public Transport Fund. In addition, a further two projects were awarded funding from the previous Government&#8217;s Transport Challenge Fund. When a bid is received an assessment of the proposed aims of the project is carried out and this is taken into consideration in assessing competing bids. Successful authorities are required to submit an action plan for their projects against which implementation of the proposals is monitored by the Executive but no specific performance targets are set. The monitoring of projects in terms of reducing congestion is a matter for local authorities; no bus lane project supported under the Public Transport Fund is yet fully complete.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it takes after the implementation of bus lanes supported by Transport Challenge Funding to ensure that congestion has been reduced, that performance targets have been met and that bus lanes are fully used.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of a project after its completion is an important part of any project. However, it is a matter for local authorities to monitor the effects of the projects for which they are responsible. The guidance issued to local authorities inviting bids to the Public Transport Fund (PTF) sets out how the Scottish Executive expects local authorities to evaluate projects after completion. The Scottish Executive places considerable weight on evaluation of its own projects and expects local authorities to do the same. As part of their bids local authorities are expected to demonstrate that appropriate evaluation and monitoring procedures will be followed and explain how they intend to measure whether the objectives have been achieved. This is an important part of the Executive&#8217;s appraisal of a bid and to be successful the Executive must be confident that these procedures are in place.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to developing a stable funding environment for the voluntary sector. Matched funding, which can be in cash or in kind, can strengthen the impact of the work of a voluntary organisation in a number of ways in addition to the financial benefit. It can, for example, ensure a local stake in a group or project, or promote partnerships. Central Rape Crisis has been granted &pound;12,800 from the Domestic Abuse Service Development Fund with matched funding coming from Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-6104 by Mr Frank McAveety on 10 May 2000, whether it will consider a contribution from public funds to the proposed memorial of the 15 Lanarkshire men who won the Victoria Cross, given that it is a memorial to famous Lanarkshire people rather than a war memorial.</p>

  <p>Further to my answer to question S1W-6104, memorials, whether they are war memorials or memorials, are traditionally raised by public subscription and private donations, rather than from public funding. Although the Scottish Executive is unable to assist financially with the cost of funding this memorial, we are willing to assist in whatever other way we can. If the campaign organisers have not already done so, I suggest they contact both North and South Lanarkshire Councils, in order to establish whether they can offer any form of support also.</p>
