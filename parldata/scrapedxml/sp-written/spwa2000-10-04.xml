  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s commitment to public health in general and cancer in particular are set out in the White Paper <i> Towards a Healthier Scotland. </i> The links between deprivation and cancer are recognised, into which the paper from Professor Hole and Dr Symonds provides further insight.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has pledged to tackle the root causes of ill health such as poverty and deprivation and a wide ranging programme of national and local initiatives are underway seeking to improve Scotland&#8217;s poor health record: all of which will contribute to the aim of reducing mortality from cancer by 20% in the under 75&#8217;s by 2010.</p>

  <p>Health boards are responsible for promoting the benefits of cervical screening, particularly through health promotion programmes targeted at areas of low uptake. At March 1999, the percentage of the eligible population screened in the last 5.5 years was 86.6%.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a range of subjects including firearms legislation. I understand that the UK Government has no plans to lift or relax the ban on handguns.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware that Home Office Ministers have considered a formal request from the National Rifle Association and have agreed that pistol shooting events can be held at the Commonwealth Games in 2002 and at its precursor event in September next year. This is not a relaxation or weakening of the handgun ban. Competitors bringing pistols into the UK would require to be authorised by the Home Secretary under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 as amended. The Scottish Executive does not consider that this decision would have any impact on crime or public safety in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scottish Trade International is already actively addressing e-business in close consultation with Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s e-commerce team and has undertaken a number of activities in the Eastern European market place. These will also be key areas in the new international strategy which is currently being developed by Scottish Trade International and has involved extensive consultation including with the Scottish Council Development and Industry. The new strategy will be launched early next year and will follow on from the present five-year Export Development Strategy for Scotland launched in 1995.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the average cost is of all work and procedures, including time expended by its own and Scottish Natural Heritage&#8217;s employees, involved in consulting on and making a designation order in respect of (a) a Special Area of Conservation and (b) a Site of Special Scientific Interest.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-10-04.S1W-9998.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1004.htm#9998">

  <p>The process of designating Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) is not yet complete and it is not possible, therefore, to provide the detailed costs requested.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) are currently engaged in a programme of consultations on behalf of Scottish Ministers on a further 90 proposed SACs. In accordance with existing policy, sites proposed under European nature conservation directives are normally protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as Sites Of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Where appropriate, the SSSI notification process, including consultation with affected parties, takes place at the same time as SAC consultation to avoid duplication of effort by SNH.</p>

  <p>The cost of notifying and consulting on a potential SSSI or SAC varies enormously according to the size of the site, the number of consultees and possible reference, in the case of SSSIs, to the Advisory Committee on SSSIs. An average figure is, therefore, meaningless.</p>

  <p>All statistical bulletins in the Criminal Justice Series except those relating to motor vehicle offences and offences involving firearms include information at the lowest level of geographic detail collected centrally. The lowest level of geographic detail at which statistics are collected centrally is unitary authority or, for courts and prisons statistics, the individual court or prison. The nine police divisions in Strathclyde divide the police force area in a different way from the twelve unitary authorities. For example, the Glasgow City unitary authority covers four different police divisions in whole or part. The information collected centrally therefore cannot be aggregated to distinguish all individual police divisions within the Strathclyde police force area.</p>

  <p>Statistics on the number of crimes recorded by the police are presented on a divisional basis in the Strathclyde Chief Constable&#8217;s Annual Report.</p>

  <p>I announced my decision on the future of the Diversion from Prosecution scheme on 22 September.</p>

  <p>Diversion will be made available to procurators fiscal throughout Scotland as an alternative to prosecution from next January. The expanded schemes will be targeted on those groups which research has shown benefit most from diversion. These are accused people who are experiencing mental health difficulties; those misusing drugs and alcohol; female accused, and young accused aged 16 and 17 years.</p>

  <p>Additional funding is being made available and this, together with a redistribution of existing funding which reflects the refocusing and targeting of the schemes, will result in a total of &pound;1 million being made available to support these schemes.</p>

  <p>Under the present arrangements both capital allocations and the total grant paid to councils are included in the Assigned Budget. The method by which grant is distributed to councils takes account of councils&#8217; debt servicing costs through an amount for loan and leasing charges.</p>

  <p>Within national accounting, to avoid double counting, the repayment of debt by local authorities is excluded from public expenditure totals. This is consistent with the accounting treatment of local authority borrowing and debt repayment across the United Kingdom. Any change in the capital arrangements, or in their accounting treatment might well lead to a corresponding adjustment to the Assigned Budget.</p>

Although the &pound;42 million undistributed Excellence Fund formed part of the total GSE figure for education in <i>Investing in You</i> ; a distribution was not available for inclusion in the Order. Councils have since received their allocations for most of the funding and will be advised of their allocations of the remaining &pound;13.45 million in due course, but the original individual AEF figures for councils are not revisited after approval of the Order.

  <p>The conclusions of the review will help to inform consideration of the local government finance settlement allocations which are laid before the Parliament each year.</p>

  <p>The &pound;8.9 million extra money allocated to the police earlier this year is sufficient to allow forces to recruit more than 300 extra police officers. However, decisions on the allocation of resources are matters for chief constables in consultation with their police authorities. It will be for them to decide on the levels and pattern of recruitment in this and subsequent years. A carry-over provision is available to police forces.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>In a period of change, Scottish Prison Service Management remains committed to working with staff in the way that it has earned its Investors in People recognition. But the SPS faces competitive challenges requiring us to make significant changes in our working practices designed to improve our competitiveness and increase job security. Our current aim is to proceed without compulsory redundancies.</p>

  <p>There is uncertainty over the future of Peterhead. Once a decision has been taken it will be conveyed as soon as possible to those directly involved. Our estates review is focussed on the need to improve the SPS estate and the SPS&#8217;s competitive position, thereby improving the value for money the SPS provides to the taxpayer and is no reflection on the high standard of work undertaken by our staff.</p>

  <p>As part of the consultation on the wider Scottish Climate Change Programme, the Scottish Executive sought views on its proposals to secure an additional 5% of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2010 by means of the proposed obligation on electricity suppliers. Over 80 responses to this proposal were received. I am considering these along with the responses to the Scottish Climate Change Programme and will make a statement in due course.</p>

  <p>Consultation on the draft revision of National Policy Planning Guideline (NPPG) 6: <i>Renewable Energy</i> closed on 28 July. Over 100 responses were received and are currently being considered. We aim to produce the final NPPG later in the summer.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Parking charges on the esplanade for residents of Stirling Old Burgh were introduced on 30 May this year. The number of residents now using the esplanade is very small and the annual revenue raised from them is expected to be less than &pound;100. The main reason for introducing charges, however, was to maximise the space available to visitors to Stirling Castle given the rise in numbers in recent years. This is expected to produce significant additional revenue from admissions, retail and catering, as well as helping the tourist economy of Stirling and providing a better service to the public.</p>

  <p>The original bid by the City of Edinburgh Council to the Transport Challenge Fund envisaged that the project would be operational by 2001. Subsequently, the council requested that the Transport Challenge Fund award should be re-phased to take account of delays in the project related to the preparation of a Parliamentary Order and the development of the Private Finance Initiative package. The department agreed to this request.</p>
