  <p>Following the announcement on 21 March 2002 of &#163;5 million to expand the park and ride facilities at Croy Station, Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority (SPTA) plans to deliver this project in two phases. The first phase, for which the Scottish Executive has made total payments of &#163;152,913 to date to SPTA, involves the provision of a temporary car park, the introduction of a feeder bus service from Cumbernauld to the station, and the development of long-term proposals for park and ride provision.
