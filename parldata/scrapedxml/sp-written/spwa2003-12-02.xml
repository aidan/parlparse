  <p>The Scottish Executive has allocated &pound;30 million over 2004-06 to local authorities to fund community wardens and other community based anti-social behaviour initiatives. In addition, we are making available a further &pound;65 million, over the same period, to tackle anti-social behaviour.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also provided &pound;10 million this year to local authorities to help support the work of local youth justice teams and enable them to improve the range and quality of community based services for young offenders that are available. This will increase to &pound;13 million in 2004-05 and &pound;15 million in 2005-06.

On 30 June 2001, 1% of Scotland's population of children were subject to a supervision requirement. SCRA will shortly be publishing more up-to-date information in its 2002-03 annual report. Indications are that the figures for the number of children subject to supervision requirements are similar to previous years. Information on allocation of social workers is not held centrally.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what provision is made in the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Bill to prevent the human disturbance of the communal, non-breeding roosts of species that are listed on schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and Annexe 1 of the EU Birds Directive 79/409/EEC such as white-tailed eagles, red kites, hen harrier and marsh harrier.</p>

  <p>White-tailed eagles, red kites, hen harriers and marsh harriers are all specially protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The act implements the United Kingdom's principal obligations under the birds directive.</p>

  <p>It is an offence to intentionally kill, injure or take such birds; or to disturb them, or their dependent young, whilst on or near the nest. It is also an offence to take or destroy the eggs of any wild bird. The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Bill further enhances the protection of birds, including by introducing the offence of recklessly committing such acts.</p>

  <p>Extending protection to the communal roost sites of certain species was suggested by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the course of consultation on the draft bill. But I am not aware of any detailed evidence or data to suggest that communal roost sites are under particular threat from human disturbance, or that the level of protection afforded by the new bill is inadequate.</p>

  <p>The specific information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of discharges from neonatal units in Scotland, for years ended 31 March 1997 to 2002 by NHS board area. A neonatal unit is a facility which provides neonatal special care (Special Care Baby Unit) and/or neonatal intensive care for sick babies. It is not possible to separate the information into care types i.e. intensive or special care.</p>

  <p>The average total call time to NHS 24 is 11 minutes. This compares well with the benchmark for consultation by GPs which is 10 minutes. Call length is determined by clinical need. Calls which are urgent are dealt with more quickly. Calls that result in self care advice, and patients calling with mental health problems, usually require more time. Calls for health information tend to be shorter in length and on average take 3.5 minutes.</p>

  <p>Calls to NHS 24 are received by a call-handler to establish whether the caller wants health information or advice on symptoms from a nurse. Thereafter the average time for a nurse to give the caller advice and complete the call is some 8.5 minutes.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to promoting disabled people's rights and tackling discrimination and inequality. Our equality strategy provides a framework for this work across departments.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also using the opportunity provided by the European Year of Disabled People to promote disabled people's rights. We have allocated &pound;200,000 for a programme of activities to celebrate the theme of the year - promoting rights and participation. This has included a major transport conference in September, support for a business start up event in November, activities to raise awareness of disability with young people and arts activities. A 16 page newspaper supplement entitled <em>Promoting Rights and Participation</em> was published in January 2003 in order to highlight disabled people's rights and has been widely distributed since then at a range of events. Copies have been placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 26033).</p>

  <p>In addition, to help us to better understand disabled people's needs, we are providing &pound;250,000 to two national grassroots disability organisations, Inclusion Scotland and the Scottish Disability Equality Forum. The funding will allow the organisations to develop the channels and structures for Executive consultation with disabled people in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Any proposal to construct or operate an electrical generating station with a generation capacity in excess of 50MW requires consent from Scottish ministers under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. When consent is granted, ministers also grant deemed planning permission under section 57(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) 1997.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers must consult the relevant local authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and may also consult other parties with an interest in the development.</p>

  <p>Applicants are required by statute to publish notices in the local and national press which describes the proposal and advise how representations should be made.</p>

  <p>Under the Electricity Works (Environment Impact Assessment) (Scotland) Regulations 2000, ministers are required to consider whether a proposal is likely to have a significant effect on the environment. Any section 3 application must be accompanied by an environmental statement.</p>

  <p>In reaching decisions, ministers are guided by the provisions contained in Schedules 8 and 9 of the Electricity Act 1989 and by Executive planning policy as set out in National Planning Policy Guideline 6: <em>Renewable Energy</em>.</p>

  <p>Ministers can grant consent to a proposal as it stands (or with conditions), reject it, or refer it to a public local inquiry.</p>

  <p>The work which the Scottish Criminal Record Office undertakes through Disclosure Scotland on behalf of Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) is related to applications for Enhanced Disclosures under Part V of the Police Act 1997. This work is part of Disclosure Scotland's core business and is not having any adverse effect on Disclosure Scotland's performance.</p>

  <p>The CRB is not at present issuing basic disclosures and Disclosure Scotland, at the request of the Department for Transport rather than the CRB, has agreed, as a temporary measure, to accept applications for basic disclosures from airside staff at airports across the UK. These are staff who, for security reasons, require a criminal record check to help assess their suitability for employment airside. The additional volume of applications from this source coupled with increasing volumes from &quot;domestic&quot; sources has had some effect on Disclosure Scotland's turnaround times. The problem is being actively addressed with a view to reducing turnaround times.</p>

  <p>No targets have been set for reaching a full complement of qualified social workers for either Glasgow or Scotland, but the position is being carefully monitored through research and via the formal collection of statistics. Demand for social workers remains high and it is accepted that immediate action and longer term workforce planning will be necessary to create a sufficiently large, confident and competent workforce. However, there are more social workers in Scotland now than at any time in the past, a net increase of 51 qualified social workers in the current year, and 25% more graduates entering the workforce this year than last.</p>

  <p>In addition, projected figures on active social work students at the universities shows increased numbers, from 1,803 students in 2004 to 2,006 students in 2008. Many employers are also focusing on generating their own social workers through trainee schemes and through combining active recruitment with effective &quot;grow your own&quot; policies<em>.</em></p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive commissioned research project on home supervision, reported in December 2002, found 22% of the 189 cases examined had no allocated social worker. The detailed findings are at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/</a> . In addition, Audit Scotland reported in 2002 on children on supervision for reasons which include offending that between 300 and 500 were not receiving the service prescribed. Performance audit clearly plays a valuable role in assessing the effectiveness of youth justice policies and Audit Scotland has undertaken to provide updates. The first update in November 2003 reaffirmed the earlier findings and identified areas for further action by the Scottish Executive and councils. The Scottish Executive has accepted all of the report's recommendations.</p>

  <p>: There is separate accommodation at Holyrood for the Presiding Officer and the Deputy Presiding Officers in Queensberry House, 18 ministers in towers three and four, and 108 members in the members' block. The provision of accommodation is a matter for the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, but it has agreed to seek the views of the business managers before deciding how the space in the members' block should be allocated. The allocation of rooms within political parties will be a matter for the parties themselves.</p>
