  <p>Funding of &#163;22.5 million over three years from April 2001 will enable at least 80,000 people to be helped. &#163;18.5 million of this is being allocated through local authorities to Community Learning Strategy Partnerships where all providers can access the funding.</p>

  <p>A new national development unit on literacy and numeracy is being established within Communities Scotland and a national training programme for tutors is already under development. On 16 April, I announced the launch of four pathfinder projects, three of which provide the first national support for raising awareness of the issue within the workplace. I also announced the development of a national curriculum for adult learners.</p>

  <p>Yes, their introduction has led to an identifiable improvement in children&#146;s education. In January 2000, the Scottish Executive commissioned the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) to evaluate the classroom assistants initiative. Its interim findings, published on 3 September 2001, indicated that the supporting role assistants play in the classroom will indirectly improve the quality of children&#146;s education by allowing teachers to concentrate on individual and group teaching and lesson preparation. Apart from allowing children to benefit from improved teaching, they can also have a positive effect on pupil learning experiences by keeping pupils on task, encouraging good working practices and providing support for children with particular learning difficulties. I expect to receive SCRE&#146;s final report shortly.</p>

  <p>The recent UK budget is good news for Scotland and good news for Grampian. As the First Minister set out in his statement on 18 April, the budget will benefit business, the health service, older people, children, families and people in and out of work. The detailed impact on Grampian or any other region will depend on the individual circumstances of the businesses and households in that region. To assess this precisely would require detailed economic analysis - but for every region we would expect the benefits to significantly outweigh the costs. It is our responsibility to make sure we make the most of the opportunities the budget offers.</p>

  <p>We have no plans for community support officers with police powers to undertake neighbourhood patrols.

  <p>The efficiency of administration is one of the issues that will be examined in each review, although the recommendations are likely to range more widely, into structure, jurisdiction and other aspects of criminal procedure.</p>

  <p>A great deal of polluted land has been inherited from past generations when little or no consideration was given to the impact of our actions on the environment. Today&#146;s announcement will help to address this legacy.</p>

  <p>We have allocated &#163;4.5 million capital resources for 2002-03 to help local authorities carry out their statutory responsibilities under the contaminated land regime which came into force in July 2000.</p>

  <p>The regime provides the best solution to bringing polluted land back into productive use, especially in areas where commercial redevelopment is not likely to bring this about. Its main objective is to provide an improved system for the identification and remediation of contaminated land where the contamination is causing unacceptable risk to human health and the wider environment. By providing a vehicle for cleaning up contaminated land it will also facilitate the re-use of brownfield sites and promote the regeneration of urban areas.</p>

  <p>The funds will help local authorities to identify and investigate sites, take forward enforcement action and, in cases where they are unable to identify those responsible for the contamination, carry out remediation work at their own hand.</p>

  <p>Together with the resources we announced in February last year, over the three years 2000-01 to 2002-03 the Executive has made capital allocations totalling &#163;9.7 million available to local authorities for work associated with addressing the problem of contaminated land.</p>

  <p>The distribution of capital allocations to local authorities is shown in the table.</p>

  <p>On 19 March, Wendy Alexander and I visited Kingswells Park &amp; Ride site and met with representatives from NESTRANS, the north-east Scotland transport partnership. It was an extremely productive and useful meeting and will be followed up with meetings between officials over the coming year. NESTRANS was invited to proceed with modelling the traffic and impact of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and to come forward with a STAG appraisal by the end of the year to inform further discussion with ministers.</p>

  <p>Immediate action as a result of this meeting includes:</p>

  <p>The Executive to provide additional funding of &#163;585,000 in 2002-03 from the Integrated Transport Fund to match fund Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire Councils&#146; collective contributions for the further development and implementation of the Modern Transport System (MTS).</p>

  <p>The Executive to provide a further &#163;600,000 in 2002-03 for Aberdeen City Council to take forward its Urban Realm project, to meet both its traffic reduction and development aspirations for the city and the wider north-east economy.</p>

  <p>The Executive to develop a free-standing Sub Area Model to determine the character of traffic in the north-east. The model will be used by NESTRANS to assess its MTS projects.</p>

  <p>The trunk road operating companies, Amey Highways and BEAR Scotland Ltd, are contractually required to clear litter from motorways and special roads in accordance with the standards laid down in the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and the associated Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse. Under the act, responsibility for the clearance of litter from all other trunk roads rests with the local council through whose area the trunk road passes. The operating companies liaise with local councils to ensure that council policies meet with the requirements of the act. Local councils are also responsible for the clearance of litter from local roads.</p>

  <p>The Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse sets out examples (by way of photographs) of the standards to be met in particular circumstances. It should be noted that the Environmental Protection Act 1990 allows litter levels to accumulate to certain grades before action needs to be taken. The operating companies then have various timescales to return the litter levels to acceptable standards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has appointed the Performance Audit Group to audit and monitor the activities and performance of the operating companies and this includes their litter clearing performance.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to do so. Household income is used as a proxy for standard of living when measuring income poverty. This does not apply to those living in institutions, and therefore they cannot be included in any estimates of the incidence of income poverty.</p>

  <p>However, low income is only one of a number of factors which determine whether or not people are in poverty or socially excluded. The <em>Social Justice Annual Report</em> presents 29 milestones which describe different aspects of poverty and exclusion and many of these cover people who live outwith private households.</p>

Tartan Week greatly increased Scotland&#146;s profile both in New York and Washington.
