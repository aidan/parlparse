  <p>The Scottish Government does not generally fund festivals directly, although on occasion exceptional one-off grants are made.</p>

  <p>Grants for culture are distributed via relevant agencies. In the main, funding for festivals comes from the Scottish Arts Council, Scottish Screen, and EventScotland.</p>

  <p>A breakdown of funding in relation specifically to festivals is not held routinely for the years requested by all of these bodies. However, the following information relating to 2006-07 and 2007-08 has been extracted.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government places great importance on ensuring that the functions and policies for which its directorates are responsible are subject to equality impact assessment. The government&rsquo;s equality impact assessment tool and process not only enables us to impact assess those areas currently covered by legislation, but also includes our voluntary commitment to impact assess for sexual orientation, religion/belief and age. All government directorates, including health directorates, are working to equality impact assess their new and developing policies. Equality impact assessment is an on-going process and all assessments will be published on the Scottish Government website once they are complete.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for individual public authorities to ensure they comply with the gender equality duty. While responsibility for providing support and guidance for the duty lies with the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Scottish Government worked with the Commission&rsquo;s predecessor, the Equal Opportunities Commission, to support the implementation of the duty in Scotland including sectoral guidance, which encourages the involvement of fathers, and commissioning the gender audit of statistics to develop the evidence base for gender equality.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the important role of fathers in their children&rsquo;s lives and has funded Children in Scotland&rsquo;s Children, Fathers and Fatherhood Project to explore, promote and support the involvement of fathers in the care of their children. As part of this work, Children in Scotland organised a conference in June to consider the impact and opportunities for fathers presented by the public sector gender equality duty.</p>

  <p>Patients want swift, high quality treatment as close to home as possible. That is what the NHS in Scotland aims to provide. In the event of an NHS board being unable to meet national maximum waiting times for hospital inpatient and day case treatment (currently 18 weeks) locally, the board is expected to arrange for the patient to be treated quickly in the NHS in Scotland, including at the Golden Jubilee National Hospital or the Regional Treatment Centre at Stracathro, the NHS elsewhere in the UK, or by a private sector provider.</p>

  <p>We have made clear on a number of occasions that the NHS in Scotland is free to use the services of the independent health care sector to ensure timely care and treatment of NHS patients, where necessary to meet peaks in demand. But we will not invest in building up the independent health care sector. That will continue to be the position.</p>

  <p>There is no clear indication yet of what the UK Government&rsquo;s intentions are in relation to the fee cap. While the timescale for any change is also still unclear, it is unlikely to impact before our consideration of the next spending review in 2009.</p>

  <p>We believe that there is currently broad parity between Scottish universities and those elsewhere in the UK in terms of funding even with the current introduction of variable fees in the rest of the UK.</p>

  <p>Any review of the cap in England will of course be important to Scottish higher education institutions and the Scottish Government and we will take an active interest in the review.</p>

This is supplemented by submissions from the Scottish Funding Council and other partner bodies and by further consultation, including with Whitehall Departments and the Research Councils. In making their allocations in the Spending Review, ministers will be considering how science-related budgets can help to deliver across all of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s objectives and how these budgets can work together optimally on priority areas for science investment.</p>

  <p>We have commissioned research to provide an accurate picture of the use of park homes as dwellings in Scotland as the basis for the development of policy in this area.

  <p>Planning controls may already apply to operations in relation to park homes, depending on the particular circumstances of a case.</p>

  <p>The planning system applies to operations which amount to &quot;development&quot; as defined in section 26 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. Subject to certain exceptions and clarifications, &quot;development&quot; means the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under land, or the making of any material change in the use of any buildings or other land. As well as certain exceptions from the definition of &quot;development&quot;, some operations which are &quot;development&quot; benefit from a general grant of planning permission set out in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992 which removes the need for planning permission.</p>

  <p>The 1992 Order grants planning permission for certain activities, in certain circumstances, associated with &quot;caravans&quot;, the definition of which includes any structure designed or adapted for human habitation which is capable of being moved from one place to another.</p>

  <p>If there is any question about whether certain activities or structures require planning permission, these should be addressed to the planning authority for the area in the first instance, and would ultimately be a matter for the courts.</p>

  <p>We will consider whether any change to planning legislation is necessary in relation to park homes in the context of the current review of the 1992 Order and the specific review of issues affecting park homes. On the latter, I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-5213 on 26 October 2007.

  <p>The Financial Services Authority (FSA) defines &quot;subprime&quot; mortgages as those &quot;targeted at consumers with impaired or low credit ratings who may find it difficult to obtain finance from traditional sources&quot;.</p>

  <p>Data are available for those with impaired credit ratings but not for those with low credit ratings. In the year to June 2007, the FSA found that 6,953 mortgages arranged in Scotland were in cases where the main, second or other borrower had an impaired credit history. This represents 3.5% of the total number of mortgages (200,261) issued in Scotland over that period. However, the definitions used by the FSA have fairly high minimum threshold conditions. That is, they do not count arrears of a level that many lenders would consider as adverse credit history. 6,953 is therefore likely to be an underestimate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government would discourage borrowers from taking on unsustainable mortgage commitments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government did not collect information on the external debt of local authorities in that time period. However, the following tables show the total level of outstanding loans pool debt for each local authority in each of the last 10 years. Local authorities are required by legislation to operate a loans pool, and all monies borrowed by the local authority are paid into the loans pool, which makes advances to service accounts to fund capital expenditure. The level of debt recorded by the loans pool is the value that must be charged to services over a number of years. We would not expect the level of external debt to be significantly different to the loans pool value.</p>

  <p>Loans Pool Debt Outstanding by Local Authority, 1998-2007 (&pound;000)</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-5272 on 26 October 2007 and S3W-5344 on 26 October 2007. The Scottish Government did not historically collect information on the external debt of local authorities, and we do not have validated data to provide such figures. However, the following table shows the total level of outstanding loans pool debt. The level of debt recorded by the loans pool is the value that must be charged to services over a number of years. We would not expect the level of external debt to be significantly different to the loans pool value.</p>

  <p>Loans Pool Debt Outstanding as at 31 March 2007 (&pound;000)</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-5272 on 26 October 2007, and S3W-5343 on 26 October 2007. The following table shows the latest available information on the costs to each local authority of servicing their outstanding loans pool debt. Local authorities are required by legislation to operate a loans pool, and all monies borrowed by the local authority are paid into the loans pool. All interest paid on external debt is paid from the loans pool and then charged to services. For completeness, the table includes the statutory charge for repayment of loans, and any finance leasing charges.</p>

  <p>The Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 (section 35) places a duty on each local authority to determine the maximum level it can allocate to capital expenditure (and hence borrow). In doing so, they must have regard to the CIPFA Prudential Code for Capital Finance in Local Authorities. This requires local authorities to take into consideration indicators in relation to affordability, prudence and sustainability. Each local authority, therefore, sets their own maximum borrowing level, and keeps this under review on an on-going basis.</p>

  <p>The passage of the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006 was the first step in a modernisation process aimed at creating a more efficient, inclusive and sustainable planning system that is fully fit for purpose. Immediate priorities are now focussed on implementing the act and realising a change in culture among planning professionals and other stakeholders in the planning system.</p>

  <p>While some elements have already been commenced, for example on the National Planning Framework, Marine Fish Farming and Business Improvement Districts, the main elements on Development Planning and Development Management are likely to be commenced around the end of 2008. This is because secondary legislation is required, on which we are due to consult shortly.</p>

  <p>There is a table that can be accessed on the Scottish Government website which gives the list of what has commenced and the implementation timetable:</p>

  <p>The remit of the review panel is to provide views on individual cases to assist Scottish Ministers in reaching a decision on whether or not to grant planning permission to a particular farm, either conditionally or unconditionally. There are around 900 existing farms in Scotland. Due to the number of farms involved, each farm is being assessed according to the expiry date of its existing development consent from the Crown Estate or where applicable works licence from Shetland or Orkney Islands Councils. A farm has generally been given a 15 year consent. It will therefore take a number of years to complete this work although we are considering whether the process could be completed in a shorter timescale.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the Police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the Stats 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured and which become known to the police. The returns do not cover damage only accidents or accidents of which the police are unaware because they were not reported by the public.</p>

  <p>The method of identifying foreign vehicles in the Stats 19 returns changed at the start of 2005. Up until the end of 2004, Police Forces were asked to identify foreign vehicles by means of special code in the &quot;Vehicle Registration Mark&quot; field. The following table shows the numbers identified using this old method.</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">

</table></p>

  <p>Following a review of the Stats 19 specification, with effect from January 2005, police forces have been asked to identify foreign vehicles by means of a new &quot;Foreign Registered Vehicle&quot; field. The following table shows the numbers identified using this new method.</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">

<td width="16%" align="center" valign="top">Year</td>

<tr>
<td width="16%" align="left" valign="top">2006</td>
<td width="84%" align="right" valign="top">138</td>

</table></p>

  <p>It is clear that the new method has resulted in the identification of more foreign vehicles in the Stats 19 returns.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Science Advisory Committee (SSAC) is currently running on a temporary basis, reporting to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA), following the decision to end the funding arrangement under the auspices of the Royal Society of Edinburgh as from December 2006. Since then, the future of the SSAC has been under review.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that ministers have now decided that the CSA should continue to be supported by the SSAC, with revised reporting arrangements. The SSAC will continue to comprise a standing committee of experts drawn widely from the science and innovation base, in order to ensure that the Scottish Government can be provided with authoritative, independent advice across all scientific disciplines and issues. The SSAC will report directly to the CSA, who will chair the Committee in conjunction with a co-chair elected by committee members. The SSAC&rsquo;s advice will be provided to ministers through the CSA and in conjunction with the co-chair where this is helpful. Although the SSAC will not be constituted as a formal advisory public body, the operation of the committee, including the recruitment process for new committee members, will follow the spirit of the Nolan principles. The committee membership will be refreshed over the next few months with new members being appointed by early 2008.</p>

  <p>We believe that there is currently broad parity between funding for Scottish universities and for those elsewhere in the UK. Any review of the cap in England will of course be important to Scottish higher education institutions and the Scottish Government.

  <p>The Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 gives local authorities powers to license the operation of private hire cars in their area.
