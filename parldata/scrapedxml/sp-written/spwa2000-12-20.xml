  <p>Action on specific allegations of violence is for the police in the first instance and some of the young people interviewed reported positive support in these circumstances. Similarly the report acknowledges measures taken by schools to combat racism or anti-social behaviour. We will study carefully the recommendations in this report directed specifically at the Executive.</p>

  <p>The following expenditure has been incurred by the Scottish Executive in support of crime prevention measures in the financial years 1986-87 to 1999-2000. Separate figures for expenditure on crime prevention prior to these years are not available. The increase in funding from 1996-97 onwards reflects the introduction of the Scottish Executive CCTV Challenge Competition. The variation in the annual figures from then reflects extra funding added to the CCTV element in years 1996-97 and 1997-98.</p>

  <p>There were 110 responses to the <i>Opportunities and Choices</i> consultation exercise from a wide range of agencies including colleges, the enterprise network, employers, National Training Organisations, local authorities and representative bodies. There was general agreement with the objectives outlined in the consultation paper. The responses also made suggestions and comments on how to increase the value of work-based training; to assist transfer band progression across training and further education; to improve the assessment of trainees and the guidance they receive; to increase the uptake of Modern Apprenticeships, and to develop a better range of integrated training and further education provision.</p>

  <p>In response to this, and to increase the training opportunities available to young people, we have agreed revised and extended training criteria for 18 to 24-year-olds who wish to take up Modern Apprenticeships. The Scottish Executive has established a working group to take forward the results of the consultation exercise over the next 12-18 months. The group, which includes representatives of the enterprise network and the further education sector, is developing practical proposals for integrated training and further education programmes, and pilots are being set up to test the improvements suggested in response to the consultation paper.</p>

  <p>63% (660 out of 1,055) of general practices in Scotland responded to the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health&#8217;s (SCIEH) end-October request for influenza immunisation uptake data for the 65-year-old and over at risk group. From the responses received, 50.1% (284,353) of patients aged 65 and over, from those practices which responded, had received the vaccine as at 31 October 2000. This includes that considerable progress is being made towards meeting the Scotland-wide target of 60% uptake. Further data will be collated by SCIEH to reflect the position at 30 November and 31 December.</p>

  <p>Influenza immunisation is also recommended for patients with chronic illnesses. There are no reliable statistics of the number of people in this group, and uptake data are not available.</p>

  <p>Health boards, NHS Trusts and local authorities have been asked to put in place arrangements to evaluate uptake of the flu vaccination by staff.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority receives grant-in-aid and grant for three areas of work: 5-14 Programme; Accreditation Unit running costs; and development work for the new national qualifications introduced in academic year 1999-2000. A detailed profile for these payments is not projected at the start of the financial year to provide flexibility. The amounts and dates of payments for each of the two previous financial years, and for the current year to 31 October, are given below. The tables are not directly comparable since further payments will be made during the current financial year.</p>

  <p>I am today placing in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre details of the rates of those loans and grants not covered in my answer of 10 November, which will be available to eligible undergraduate and postgraduate students in full-time higher education in 2001-02.</p>

  <p>In 2001-02 a general uprating factor of 2.4%, in line with inflation, will be applied to those existing schemes of support which are normally subject to annual uprating, thus maintaining their value in real terms. We are also increasing by the same factor the standard rates of payment made to institutions by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland.</p>

  <p>These changes are consistent with those for England and Wales announced by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment.</p>

  <p>Scottish Trade International promotes trade and exports from Scotland through development assistance to companies at an individual level. It does not undertake the generic marketing of Scotland in terms of trade.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Tourist Board has 50 staff, from Director level to clerical support, directly involved in marketing Scotland as a tourist destination to the UK and internationally. They are supported by the remaining 160 staff who are indirectly involved in marketing-related activities.</p>

  <p>All of the British Tourist Authority&#8217;s 506 staff are directly or indirectly involved with the promotion of Scotland as part of the &quot;United Kingdom&quot; as a tourist destination.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the Minister for Transport&#8217;s comments to the Transport and the Environment Committee on 8 November 2000 ( <i>Official Report</i> , col. 1155), whether it will confirm that it will not approve any road user charging scheme which is paper based.</p>

  <p>The Transport (Scotland) Bill allows local authorities to introduce a variety of electronic or paper-based road user charging schemes. While the Executive does not believe that a paper-based scheme is suitable for a large-scale urban area, there may be local congestion hot spots where paper is appropriate. Any paper-based proposal would have to win the support of the local community and others before the Executive would consider its merits.</p>

  <p>The Transport (Scotland) Bill allows local authorities to require, if they so wish, specified equipment to be carried in, or fitted to, a motor vehicle while it is on a road on which charges are imposed. It is up to the local authority as to whether road users will be expected to pay to acquire and fit such equipment. This information will be made clear to road users when local authorities consult on their proposals.</p>
