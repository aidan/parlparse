  <p>Slightly inflated incidence in 1996 is due to the introduction of a standard definition of incidence date across Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-09-06.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0906.htm#9229">

  <p>Information in the form requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to tackling cancer in the most effective ways possible, including screening programmes.</p>

  <p>The current advice from the UK National Screening Committee is that a national prostate screening programme with current techniques would not give benefits and might actually do harm. This is because the current prostate specific antigen testing technique produces too many false positive or negative results and cannot distinguish accurately between cancer and other infections.</p>

  <p>This does not exclude testing men who have symptoms or a family history of prostate cancer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is keeping this policy under review as new techniques and evidence become available. In addition, the Scottish Cancer Group has set up a Review Group to consider the issues surrounding the management of prostate cancer and will report to the Scottish Executive Health Department early in 2001.</p>

  <p>Circular SWSG1/97 gives guidance to local authorities on charging for non-residential care services. In the case of residential or nursing home care, guidance to local authorities in assessing ability to pay and who should contribute is given in Circular SWSG 6/98 as amended by Circulars SWSG 2/99 and CCD 2/2000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no formal definition of elder abuse. We know that some organisations subscribe to the definition that elder abuse is a single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person. This definition would appear to reflect the general understanding of what is meant by elder abuse.</p>

  <p>Neither the Scottish Executive Health Department nor the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health is aware of the application of uptake targets in other European countries. Similarly, the Department of Health in England has no information in this area. The target was agreed with representatives of the BMA in Scotland as a Scotland-wide target, which is regarded as both achievable and beneficial in current Scottish circumstances.</p>

  <p>No formal consultations are being carried out in what is an internal SPS business review, though informal discussions have been undertaken with a number of bodies with an interest in penal issues. No date has been set for the end of the review. The review will assist discussions with Ministers on SPS strategy over the next few years.</p>

  <p>Following the Strategic Roads Review, I announced on 4 November that the A68 Dalkeith bypass and two other schemes would be held in abeyance. The words in the document <i>Strategic Roads Review - Scheme Decisions</i> were &quot;...these schemes should be held in abeyance so that they can be considered, alongside other emerging priorities, for inclusion in a future trunk road programme. It is envisaged that future appraisals will be conducted using a multi-modal approach which will allow potential trunk road schemes to be considered alongside other potential transport improvements in the area&quot;.</p>

  <p>The last comprehensive review of the trunk road programme was completed only nine months ago and no timescale has been set for a further review. The Executive is focusing on delivering the &pound;444 million investment in trunk roads, which I announced on 31 March. This includes the five major schemes and the multi-modal studies agreed following the Roads Review and the schemes at Soutra Hill and Drygrange Bridge on the A68.</p>

  <p>The administration of the examinations is a matter for the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). On (a), I have asked the Chairman to reply to you and a copy of his reply will be placed in SPICe.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive first became aware of potential problems with the SQA&#8217;s Award Processing System in March. These were discussed with the SQA on several occasions and the Executive received reassurances about remedial action being taken.</p>

  <p>Further administrative problems were reported to the Scottish Executive by the SQA in June. After a meeting to discuss these problems with SQA, officials in the Scottish Executive were in continual contact with SQA, and continued to receive reassurances.</p>

  <p>My officials keep me informed of all major issues on a regular basis.</p>

  <p>We are today publishing a policy position paper entitled <i>The Way Forward for Care. </i> This sets out our proposals for modernising the regulation of care services and early education and ensuring that we have a confident and competent social services workforce in Scotland. The policy proposals in the paper were developed as a result of extensive consultation and will form the basis of the legislation required to achieve these <i>Programme for Government</i> priorities.</p>
