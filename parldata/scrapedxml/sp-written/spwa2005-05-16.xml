</table></p>

  <p>The passing of calls between NHS 24 and the Scottish Ambulance Service is a two-way process and the number of calls which the ambulance service passed to NHS 24 to manage during March was 364. The 4,237 calls passed to the ambulance service represents 2.8% of the calls handled by NHS 24 during this month.</p>

  <p>The roll-out of NHS 24 across Scotland has caused no noticeable negative impact on the use of the ambulance service and their response times. The ambulance service regularly monitors the calls received from NHS 24 to ensure that these calls are being appropriately transferred.</p>

  <p>It should be remembered that NHS 24 is not an emergency service &ndash; the clear advice to the public is that in emergencies callers should dial 999. That only 2.8% of the calls handled by NHS 24 are passed to the ambulance service suggests that most people make the right choice in these circumstances.</p>

  <p>The conference will discuss the recent report by Professor James McEwen, Emeritus Professor in Public Health, on <em>Chronic Pain Services in Scotland</em> . We hope to hold the conference in early July.</p>

  <p>Service planning is, as far as possible, devolved to NHS boards and financed from board&rsquo;s unified budgets, which have been increased in this financial year by an average of 7.6%, more than twice the rate of inflation.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question <a href="../wa-04/wa1216.htm">S2W-12866</a> on 16 December 2004, on action by GPs to manage chronic pain patients.

  <p>The Executive prefers to maximise the unified budgets made available to NHS boards for the treatment of all chronic conditions, rather than hold back funds for specific conditions. In the current financial year unified budgets have been increased by an average of 7.6%, more than twice the rate of inflation.</p>

  <p>Information about expenditure incurred by ministers travelling by air is available only from April 2002. All journeys undertaken by ministers were for official business purposes relating to their ministerial duties.</p>

  <p>The expenditure incurred on air travel is as follows:</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The replacement of medical equipment, including CT scanners, is a matter for NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Audit Scotland Report <em>Better Equipped to Care? &ndash; Follow-up report on managing medical equipment</em> recognised that there were issues around the strategic management of medical equipment.</p>

  <p>The Executive responded positively to the Audit Committee on 14 December 2004 to the concerns raised in the Audit Scotland Report and have undertaken a number of procedures to address the issues raised.</p>

  <p>Capital is distributed to NHS boards using the Arbuthnott formula adjusted for cross boundary flows and weighted for the provision of regional specialities. This means that boards can determine, based on their local knowledge or the local needs of the local area how this money should be spent. In 2005-06 &pound;220 million has been distributed to NHS boards by formula, which is an increase of 10% over the 2004-05 formula allocations.</p>

  <p>Record levels of capital funding are being made available to NHSScotland with &pound;426 million, &pound;458 million and &pound;532 million being provided in 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively. Within the total capital provision available over this period, &pound;125 million has been specifically identified for the purchase/replacement of medical and diagnostic equipment. &pound;40 million has been made available in the current year with a further &pound;40 million and &pound;45 million distributed in 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively.</p>

  <p>To create better conditions for long-term planning NHS boards have been notified of fixed formula allocations for the three year period 2005-06 to 2007-08. This has improved certainty for NHS boards and will allow for the allocation of budgets to budget holders earlier than otherwise would be the case. Capital delegated limits for NHS boards have also been increased from 1 April this year which will allow greater autonomy and will enable capital projects to be taken forward without seeking prior approval from the Health Department for all but the largest projects.</p>

  <p>The replacement of medical equipment, including CT scanners, is a matter for NHS boards. NHS boards are given general revenue and capital allocations and it is for the boards to decide, based on their local knowledge, of local needs, how these resources should be deployed. In 2005-06 NHS Greater Glasgow received a formula capital allocation of &pound;55.661 million which is an increase of 9.2% over the 2004-05 allocation. The board has also been allocated an additional &pound;9.925 million specifically for the provision of medical and diagnostic equipment. However, as I previously confirmed, following from the planned NHS Greater Glasgow Board meeting on 17 May, when the 2005-06 capital programme is due to be discussed and formally approved, a replacement scanner will be in place at the Western Infirmary within three months.</p>

  <p>Health boards are responsible for leading improvements in sexual health and are adopting locally appropriate structures and arrangements to do so. Therefore, the extent to which speech and language therapists and other communication expertise are involved in the delivery of the sexual health strategy will vary between NHS boards.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of recent reports that the incidence of low birth weight is increasing and in view of the evidence that effective smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy reduce the prevalence of low birth weight, whether the Executive has any plans to set targets for reducing smoking in pregnancy broken down by deprivation quintile, given that in 2003 the smoking rate among pregnant women was in the least-deprived quintile 13.6% but in the most-deprived quintile 35.8%.</p>

  <p>As part of the Spending Review in 2004 the Scottish Executive announced new targets aimed at increasing the rate of health improvement for the most deprived communities. This includes a target to reduce smoking during pregnancy for mothers in deprivation quintile 5 by 10% from 35.8% in 2003 to 32.2% in 2008.</p>

  <p>A <em>Breath of Fresh Air for Scotland</em> (published January 2004), the first ever Tobacco Action Plan designed specifically for Scotland, confirmed that key priority groups for action and smoking cessation support should be pregnant women, children and young people and adult smokers in deprived communities.</p>
