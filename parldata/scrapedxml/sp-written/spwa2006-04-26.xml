  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the following table indicates the number of farms in Scotland which have been subject to restrictions as a result of the Chernobyl accident in each year since 1995.</p>

  <p>Farm numbers are approximate since part-farms may have restrictions removed; also farms and part-farms may be split and/or amalgamated. Accordingly, restrictions are defined in The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Radioactivity in Sheep) Order 1991 No. 20 (as amended) in consistent terms of defined boundaries rather than as individual farms. The remaining farms are located in the East Ayrshire and Stirling Council areas, although established policy is not to identify individual holdings without the consent of the farm owner.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-04-26.S2W-24889.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0426.htm#2">

  <p>Attacks on NHS staff who are trying to help people is not acceptable in any circumstances. This is why we have spent over &pound;700,000 on projects aimed at reducing violence and aggression over the last few years.</p>

  <p>The centrally collected data available on violence and aggression related incidents can be seen on the Scottish Health Statistics website under workforce statistics, <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a>. The Scottish Ambulance Service recently provided locally held information on recorded violent or abusive incidents under Freedom of Information from 2002:</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="23%" valign="top">Year</td>
<td width="19%" align="center" valign="top">2002</td>
<td width="19%" align="center" valign="top">2003</td>
<td width="19%" align="center" valign="top">2004</td>
<td width="19%" align="center" valign="top">2005</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="23%" valign="top">Incidents</td>
<td width="19%" align="right" valign="top">1</td>
<td width="19%" align="right" valign="top">1</td>
<td width="19%" align="right" valign="top">97</td>
<td width="19%" align="right" valign="top">258</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>The rise in reported numbers of incidents is thought likely to be as a direct consequence of increased staff awareness, better reporting and ambulance staff no longer being prepared to see violent or abusive behaviour as being just part of the job.</p>

  <p>It is not known how many of these incidents resulted in prosecutions. However, since the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act came into force in May 2005, 116 charges are known to have been raised concerning ambulance service staff. 39 of the charges have resulted in a guilty verdict, 13 not guilty, six have been dealt with in a non-court disposal and 58 are still being dealt with.</p>

<p>The SBSA has to date considered using SAP 2005, SBEM, rdSAP and the Scottish Energy Rating Tool for newly-constructed privately-owned dwellings. It is proposed that energy certification will be wholly subsumed by the pre-emptive process of obtaining a building warrant prior to building work commencing and the acceptance or rejection of a completion certificate at the end of the work. Consequently, no attempt has been made to disaggregate any data collection time from the Scottish building regulations compliance process.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>No independent assessments have been undertaken regarding the cost of using the different methodologies as hourly and daily rates vary from company to company or from sole trader to sole trader. Independent research has however established the following data collection times for existing buildings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three days for very large non-domestic buildings.<br />
                One day for average size non-domestic buildings.<br />
                Two hours for a full data methodology for dwellings.<br />
                One hour for a reduced data methodology for dwellings.</p>

<p>It is proposed that asset ratings are adopted for the purpose of implementing Article 7.</p>
<p>To rely solely on the use of operational ratings would make it very difficult to compare the energy performance of the &quot;built form&quot; of different buildings. To allow the option of either an asset or an operational rating would again make it very difficult to compare the energy performance of the &quot;built form&quot; of different buildings. Neither of these two approaches would be useful to prospective owners and tenants, nor visitors to buildings.</p>

  <p>The merchant shipping legislation relating to ship-to-ship transfers of oil and other chemicals is not specifically covered by Part IV of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp; c.) Regulations 1994 and as such Regulation 48 and 49 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp; c.) Regulations 1994 do not apply as a matter of law to such proposals. However, Regulation 3(4) of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp; c.) Regulations 1994 requires every competent authority in the exercise of their functions, to have regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive so far as they may be affected by the exercise of those functions. Regulation 48 and 49 transpose the requirements of Article 6(3) and 6(4) into domestic law.</p>

  <p>Where a European Protected species (EPS) is present and the project is likely to cause any effects which would constitute an offence under Regulations 39 or 43, the promoter of the project requires a licence under Regulation 44, which will only be granted if the three tests in that Regulation are met. These tests apply whether the EPS is within or outside a European site.</p>

As at January 2006, there are approximately 50 part or fully funded Choose Life initiatives across Scotland where self-harm is identified as a key aim of local Choose Life action plans. The Choose Life strategy includes only those aspects of self-harming behaviour which might be considered as an indication of the risk of suicide. Choose Life receives funding of &pound;8.6 million from 2006 to 2008.</p>

  <p>Full details of all local Choose Life action plans can be viewed at <a href="http://www.chooselife.net" target="_blank">www.chooselife.net</a>.</p>

  <p>The <em>Additional Support for Learning Act 2004</em> provides a framework for the provision of support to children and young people who have additional support needs. Additional support needs can arise from a range of factors and circumstances and may include children and young people who self-harm.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive currently has no plans to commission any specific research on the extent of self-harming incidents in the past 10 years.</p>

  <p>Information relating to hospital discharges with a diagnosis of self-harm is already available, as are data relating to numbers of self-harm incidents in prisons and young offenders&rsquo; institutions.</p>

  <p>Establishing accurate prevalence rates is problematic because many self-harm injuries are untreated, or treated at home, so do not reach the attention of services or professionals.</p>

  <p>During their initial teacher education courses, student teachers are required to undertake specific core modules which develop their understanding of health, health promotion and related issues. These core modules also support learning, recognition and understanding of a range of sensitive issues such as pupil stress, depression and bereavement.</p>

  <p>After qualifying, valuable continuing professional development (CPD) is offered to teachers by local authorities and other providers. CPD courses focus on all areas of learning and teaching and are expected to meet the development needs expressed by individual teachers, including during the annual process of professional review and development. Many of the courses concerned with behaviour management incorporate aspects such as recognising and identifying depression, mood swings and changes in pupil behaviour patterns.</p>

  <p>NHS boards, through structures such as community health partnerships, support primary care services to people with depression. This includes initiatives for GPs, pharmacists and primary care mental health workers to deliver appropriate integrated care, as locally as possible. The voluntary Quality and Outcomes Framework of the new General Medical Services Contract also has incentives for GP Practice teams to improve the quality of care for those with depression. In addition, the model schemes for pharmacy in some areas are delivering mental health services.</p>

  <p>These approaches and others will be informed by the findings of the external evaluation of the <em>Doing Well by People with Depression</em> initiative which has been commissioned and will report over the summer.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>The SPS considers, for the reasons set out in the answer to question S2W-22728, on 8 February 2006, that it is self evident that costs in open prisons are lower than those in closed establishments.</p>
<p>Reasons for these differences include the lower standards of security required including lower levels of staff supervision. Greater access to the community by prisoners also requires less duplication of facilities and services which in the case of open establishments, can be accessed in the community. We could determine the exact difference in cost but to do so would be at disproportionate cost and would represent poor value for money.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-28161 by Mr Frank McAveety on 30 August 2002, what advice it has received about the implications of the House of Lords decision in Robertson (AP) <em>v </em> Fife Council on 25 July 2002 relating to the provision of residential accommodation and whether it will be seeking to amend the relevant legislation.</p>

  <p>Following an assessment of the implications of the House of Lords decision, the Scottish Executive Health Department issued a letter on 5 March 2003 to local authorities and voluntary organisations. That letter endorsed the guidance issued by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). The COSLA guidance said that the effects of the judgement were that local authorities were required to make arrangements for residential care for any person whose care assessment indicated it was required, regardless of their ability to pay. Residents would still be required to undergo financial assessment and would be liable to reimburse the council for the board charge if they were assessed as being able to do so in terms of the National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992. The Executive also endorsed COSLA&rsquo;s advice that there was no change to the rules for assessing notional capital as a result of the judgement. Accordingly, the Executive has no plans to amend the relevant legislation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive currently has no plans to ban nut products or products containing nuts from schools. However, the Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring that schools and education authorities are aware of, and implement, measures to protect pupils from possible nut allergies and has issued guidance on this matter through <em>Hungry for Success</em> .</p>
