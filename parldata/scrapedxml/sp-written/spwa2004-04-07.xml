  <p>Meetings are held in Bute House for a wide range of purposes. The Cabinet meets there regularly and there are also frequent meetings of Cabinet Sub-Committees and informal meetings of ministers and officials. Bute House is also used to welcome visitors of all kinds who have a reason to meet ministers. No central record covering all such occasions is held.</p>
