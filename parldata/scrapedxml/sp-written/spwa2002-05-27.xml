  <p>The Scottish Executive has no function in relation to unemployed people, including carers, seeking employment. The responsibility for assisting unemployed people into work rests with Jobcentre Plus.</p>

  <p>Carers are benefiting from changes to the earning limits for Invalid Care Allowance which mean that those who combine work with their caring responsibilities can keep more of their earnings.</p>

  <p>The reference made by the First Minister in his recent speech to giving national and devolved parliaments in Europe a greater role in the EU decision-making process is fully consistent with previous interventions on this issue. The point was included in the Executive&#146;s formal response to the recommendation at paragraph 217 of the European Committee&#146;s <i>Report on the Governance of the European Union and the Future of Europe: What Role for Scotland?</i> . The Executive believes that both sub-member state administrations and parliaments have an important role to play in redressing the democratic deficit which currently exists within the EU and it will continue to press this proposal through the many channels available to it. The Executive has already suggested in its joint submission with COSLA in response to the Commission&#146;s Governance inquiry that the sub-member state level should be consulted on new Commission proposals at the pre-legislative stage, and might also be involved in the proposed subsidiary watchdog.</p>

  <p>The statement was not inaccurate. The principle of adjustments is firmly embedded in the Statement of Funding Policy. At the time the Deputy Minister spoke, we had agreed the adjustment figure for 2000-01, and were in the process of agreeing the figure for 2001-02, as his words indicated.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for occupational health and safety matters for staff working in childcare rests with employers, whether local authority, private or voluntary sector providers.

  <p>The childhood immunisation programme aims to prevent disease at the individual level <u>and</u> control or eradicate disease at the population level. As such, the Executive will continue to encourage high immunisation uptake, in order to protect the population as a whole.

SNAP reports review practice and service provision across Scotland, identified gaps and local effective practice, and make recommendations on how local services can improve their response to a particular condition. SNAP reports are therefore developed by Scottish Public Health staff to support their local work and it is local Public Health Departments, working in co-operation with their local partners, who are responsible for their implementation.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also recently awarded an additional &#163;20 million in revenue funding to local authorities to tackle the backlog of repairs to local roads. This extra cash injection is in addition to an extra &#163;70 million in capital allocations over the three years to March 2004 for local roads and bridges.</p>

  <p>Under the Public Transport Fund 79 projects are supported across Scotland with investment of &#163;175 million.
