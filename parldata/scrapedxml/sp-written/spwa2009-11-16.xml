<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-11-16.S3W-28930.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1116.htm#1">

  <p>The organising committee for the 2014 Commonwealth Games will announce on 16 November that a funding boost has been agreed to strengthen our ability to deliver an outstanding games for Glasgow and Scotland. The increase follows a thorough review of the original budget prepared in 2007 as part of the bid for the games. The review carried out for the organising committee concluded that the original budget was insufficient to ensure that the games are delivered successfully and to the required standard. This is largely because of legislative changes, rising broadcasting costs and a more developed understanding of what is needed to deliver a successful games. The review also found that the level of contingency in the original budget was too low to provide cover for all the risks that have now been identified around the games.</p>

  <p>The games partners have concluded that, as a consequence of this review, the games&rsquo; budget should increase from &pound;373.4 million to &pound;453.6 million. The additional funding will come from a mix of public and private money. The Scottish Government will provide an additional &pound;37 million and a &pound;20 million reserve fund. Glasgow City Council will contribute an extra &pound;9 million and the organising committee will raise an additional &pound;14 million through increased commercial activities. All of these figures are expressed at 2007 prices to allow direct comparison with the bid budget. The additional resources will be made available over the next five financial years.</p>

  <p>The 2014 Commonwealth Games can be the catalyst for significant change and will generate enormous sporting, social and economic benefits for the whole of Scotland. The games need to be funded properly and the budget that is being announced will enable the potential benefits to be realised. The fact that 70% of the venues for the games are already in place and the reserve fund that is being held by government will help guarantee that there is no further pressure from the games on the public purse.</p>

  <p>Planning for the games is on track and there has been good progress with key developments such as the games village and the National Indoor Sports Arena as well as on infrastructure projects such as the M74 extension. The organising committee has its full senior staff team in place and is working well. Planning for the handover ceremony during the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi is well underway and legislation has been made to protect the Glasgow 2014 brand and ensure that income from sponsorship can be maximised. The Commonwealth Games Federation has stated publicly that the Glasgow preparations are going well and that it has confidence in the arrangements in place.</p>

  <p>We have no immediate plans to replicate the Home Office scheme in Scotland, but will continue to monitor the impact of this innovative approach to public engagement with interest.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Justice and Communities Analytical Services Division worked with Scottish forces and Office of the Chief Statistician on the development of the crime domain in the 2009 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). The <em>Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2009 General Report</em> was published by the Scottish Government on 29 October 2009, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 49652). The report can also be accessed via the following link <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/10/28104046/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/10/28104046/0</a>.</p>

  <p>The SIMD crime domain measures the rate of recorded SIMD crime at small area level using 2007-08 recorded crime data and is based on five indicators of broad crime types: crimes of violence; domestic house breaking; vandalism; drug offences, and minor assault.</p>

  <p>The SIMD is presented at data zone level, enabling small pockets of deprivation to be identified. The data zones, which have a median population size of 767 in SIMD 2009, are ranked from most deprived (1) to least deprived (6,505) on the overall SIMD and on each of the individual domains. The result is a comprehensive picture of relative area deprivation across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics website can be used to carry out more detailed analysis of the SIMD through comparison of the results with a range of socio-economic indicators:</p>

  <p>The SIMD crime domain measures the rate of recorded SIMD crime at small area level using 2007-08 recorded crime data and is based on five indicators of broad crime types: crimes of violence; domestic house breaking; vandalism; drug offences, and minor assault.</p>

  <p>No changes have been made to the crime domain indicators since SIMD 2006. As a result, the indicators and the overall domains between SIMD 2006 and SIMD 2009 are directly comparable.</p>

  <p>The SIMD is presented at data zone level, enabling small pockets of deprivation to be identified. The data zones, which have a median population size of 767 in SIMD 2009, are ranked from most deprived (1) to least deprived (6,505) on the overall SIMD and on each of the individual domains. The result is a comprehensive picture of relative area deprivation across Scotland.</p>

  <p>A new SIMD 2009 interactive mapping tool has been designed. The Full Interactive Mapping option allows the user to zoom in and out of any area of Scotland selecting SIMD and contextual data for any datazone they wish. It also allows the user to compare datazones. Both road and aerial mapping are available</p>

  <p>The statistics in this bulletin are derived from returns submitted by police forces in Scotland in respect of crimes and offences recorded by them in which a firearm is alleged to have been used. It is not possible to identify from these returns how many of the individual offences resulted in individuals subsequently being proceeded against in court.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-11-16.S3W-28628.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1116.htm#2">

  <p>The official statistics, published on 27 October by Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician, show that there was an overall fall in firearms offences of 17% for Scotland. I am confident that Lothian and Borders police are taking appropriate action to tackle the misuse of firearms in their local area.</p>

  <p>Funding for police forces is at its highest ever level, &pound;1.115 billion in 2009-10. In June 2009 we passed the milestone of 1,000 additional officers for the first time, well ahead of the pledge to do so by the end of this Parliament.</p>

  <p>Earlier this year we launched an award-winning campaign to highlight the dangers of firearms, but more can always be done to protect our communities. We need a robust firearms regime - more straightforward for legitimate users to comply with and more efficient for the police to administer and enforce. Above all there must be a much greater focus on public safety. The Calman Commission recommended devolution of air weapons. I will continue to press Westminster for full devolution of firearms to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>Estimates of the employment impacts of the accelerated capital spending programme have been produced using the Scottish Government input-output model. The Budget for 2009-10 accelerates &pound;293 million of capital spending into 2009-10, in addition to &pound;53 million accelerated into 2008-09. In total, it is estimated that this accelerated capital investment will support over 5,000 jobs in the Scottish economy over the period.</p>

  <p>The Scottish input-output model provides estimates of impacts by industry sector, and shows that of the 5,000 jobs supported, over 2,500 jobs are in the construction sector with the remaining jobs spread across the other sectors of the economy.</p>

  <p>LEADER (Liaison Entre Actions de Developpement Economique Rurale) or (Links between actions for the development of rural communities) is part of the Scotland Rural Development Programme (2007-13). The aim of LEADER is to enhance rural communities through helping those active in rural areas to consider the long term potential of their area and encourage the implantation of integrated, high quality, original strategies for sustainable local rural criteria.</p>

  <p>In respect of the project areas and criteria for support, it is for each LEADER local action group to determine what projects will deliver a wide community benefit within their area and which fall within their overall approved local strategy. These projects need to demonstrate an element of innovation and should not be used to fund areas that are already covered by other bodies or public sectors.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government funds the Energy Saving Trust to manage the Energy Saving Scotland advice network. The network comprises five Energy Saving Scotland Advice Centres (ESSACs) across Scotland, each providing local advice on a range of sustainability issues including potential sources of support to increase the thermal insulation of homes.</p>

  <p>The ESSAC for south west Scotland is delivered by the South Ayrshire Energy Agency, who have a proportionate share of the network&rsquo;s cumulative target of reaching 220,000 unique customers in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>In common with households across Scotland, residents of South Ayrshire can apply to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Energy Assistance Package, which is a holistic scheme aimed at those in fuel poverty to help maximise incomes, reduce fuel bills and improve the energy efficiency of homes, including through the provision of insulation measures.</p>

  <p>We shall also consider in due course a bid made by South Ayrshire Council for participation in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Home Insulation Scheme in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>South Ayrshire Council&rsquo;s fifth progress report, under the Home Energy Conservation Act (1995), describes a range of initiatives, including those in relation to thermal insulation in domestic homes that contributed to an estimated overall improvement in energy efficiency of 19% between 1997 and 2007.</p>

  <p>Substantial evidence already exists of the links between a range of socio-economic factors and dwelling fires. The Scotland Together report highlights that those agencies already tackling such factors should consider how fire prevention can become an integral part of their wider planning and individual case management.</p>

  <p>Previously, in developing the financial business case for the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) project, several contracting strategies and funding options had been considered by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT), in accordance with the requirements of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Value for Money (VfM) Assessment Guidance. This detailed analysis was undertaken by SPT between April 2006 and January 2007, and considered all funding options available at that time.</p>

  <p>The analysis determined that for the agreed contracting strategy the option to (1) fund all of the main line works and railway systems through Network Rail&rsquo;s Regulatory Asset Base (RAB) funding and (2) the branch line civils works through conventional capital grant funding would provide the value for money solution when compared against the Design Build Finance and Transfer (DBFT) option, which is in itself consistent with the characteristics of non-profit distributing (NPD) model.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth told the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee on 3 November why he did not consider it would have been possible to have financed the whole GARL project through Network Rail&rsquo;s Regulated Asset Base (RAB). The reasons were twofold. First, it was not clear that it was practical or straightforward to include the considerable amount of site preparation activity on the RAB. Second, the amount of expenditure to be put on the RAB has of necessity to be prioritised and, if applied to GARL, would have jeopardised the investment process. Finally, it should be noted that inclusion of expenditure on the RAB can only ultimately be determined by the regulator.</p>

  <p>NHS boards and clinicians in Scotland are already expected to take full account of advice provided by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) in the planning and provision of NHS services. Drugs that are accepted by SMC, or their equivalents, are expected to be available within NHSScotland. This means that NHS boards must offer these treatments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach to providing services for people living with long term conditions, such as myasthenia gravis, is outlined in the Long Term Conditions Action Plan, which was issued to NHS boards as CEL 23 (2009) on 16 June 2009.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) has developed generic clinical standards for all neurological conditions, which it expects to launch formally in January 2010. They will be accompanied by a self-evaluation framework for NHS boards&rsquo; use, and an implementation and improvement plan containing detailed tools and techniques for service improvement. The development of these standards forms part of a comprehensive programme of work being planned by NHS QIS over the next five years to support continuous quality improvement in neurological services.</p>

  <p>All of this work will help NHS boards to fulfil their responsibility for the planning and provision of services that meet the needs of those living in their area with neurological conditions such as myasthenia gravis.</p>

  <p>Glenfield Hospital in Leicester is the UK&rsquo;s nationally commissioned centre for adult respiratory ECMO and through UK national specialist commissioning arrangements, adult patients from across the UK are referred there for treatment. Leicester is and remains the gateway and first option for access to this treatment in the context of the current H1N1 pandemic.</p>

  <p>The UK National Commissioning Group has commissioned additional surge capacity in the context of the pandemic at Leicester, the Royal Brompton and Papworth Hospitals. When this capacity is reached, Stockholm is the final option for referral for treatment under current commissioning arrangements.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary is the only site with ECMO machines and a clinical team trained by Leicester to provide adult respiratory ECMO. However, it has not been accredited or commissioned through the process outlined above and therefore will only be considered for the provision of ECMO when current UK and Stockholm capacity has been reached, and only with the agreement and ongoing support and advice of Leicester clinicians in the context of the current H1N1 pandemic.</p>

  <p>In 2008, committees of the Private Rented Housing Panel determined a rent lower than that set by the statutory rent officer in three cases. For 2009 to the 31 October, the figure is five cases.</p>

  <p>Historically this information was not recorded centrally, but we are currently working with NHS boards to put in place by April 2010 a referral to treatment waiting time target for specialist child and adolescent mental health services.</p>

  <p>The aim of developing local service is to build NHS 24 capacity, aid the recruitment of specialist nurses and improve the performance of the NHS 24 service. These centres support the development of close relationships with the host territorial health boards and aim to improve patient satisfaction levels through better local service delivery. They afford the opportunity for flexible working and improved work-life balance for the nursing workforce within these localities.</p>

  <p>All these sites have resilient telephony and IT links, and operate as part of an integrated national network. The telephony design is aimed at ensuring patient calls are answered at their closest regional centre and if a consultation with a clinician is required the call is routed to their designated local centre. However, in the case of serious and urgent calls, if a local nurse is unavailable within a pre-determined timescale, the call will automatically look for the first available nurse to ensure patient safety is maintained at all times.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 is also working with the Scottish Ambulance Service on plans to relocate the East of Scotland Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre within NHS 24&rsquo;s regional centre at Norseman House in South Queensferry. This relocation is due for completion in early 2010.</p>

  <p>This follows the successful co-location in 2008 of NHS 24&rsquo;s Glasgow local centre, NHS 24 headquarters, the Scottish Ambulance Service&rsquo;s West of Scotland Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s out-of-hours service control centre at Cardonald.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards in Scotland have responsibility for supporting staff. Employees are encouraged to raise concerns without fear of penalty or victimisation.</p>

  <p>All boards have delegated responsibility to ensure that there is a clear commitment to operate in an open, consistent and fair manner with an aim to create a no-blame culture. This commitment is underpinned by the Partnership Information Network (PIN) Policies &quot;Dealing With Employee Concerns&quot; and &quot;Management of Employee Conduct&quot;. The &quot;Dealing with Employee Concerns&quot; PIN includes a model Freedom of Speech Policy which each board is expected to adopt. If a member of staff in the NHS in Scotland has evidence of a compromise to patient or staff safety it is their duty to bring this to the attention of the appropriate manager.</p>

  <p>Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) will each be considering, in the context of their community plan and their single outcome agreement (SOA) with the Scottish Government, what strategic improvements can be encouraged within their communities to facilitate economic growth and development, including tackling unemployment. The approach taken by each CPP will start from an assessment about what is important in and appropriate for their local area and it is important to consider each approach in its own right.</p>

  <p>Local Employability Groups or Economic Forums are the key groupings within CPPs who take responsibility for driving the theme around employment, unemployment and inactivity forward. These are multi-agency cross sectoral groups reflecting a coherent and joined-up approach from across the public, third and private sectors to this agenda. They report progress back to the main CPP. Additional support to these groups is given via Scottish Government&rsquo;s Employability Team and the Employability Learning Network which has been established to provide additional support to CPPs to tackle this issue.</p>

  <p>Local Employability Partnerships access information from a variety of sources to populate their employability indicators.</p>

  <p>Some information about progress with tackling unemployment in each CPP area will also be the in the annual reports on implementation of the SOAs that CPPs make to their communities and to the Scottish Government. The answers to the questions S3W-28310 and S3W-28311 on 16 November 2009 provide further information about the SOA reports.

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Programme states that we will do all we can to help Scottish businesses and we are committed to ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have fair and equal access to public sector contracts in Scotland. To achieve this, we have introduced the Public Contracts Scotland portal, providing businesses with easy access to contract opportunities. Earlier this year, I asked all public bodies to adopt six simple steps to improve access by small and medium-enterprises to contract opportunities. They are:</p>

  <p>Adopt the Supplier Charter;</p>

  <p>Use the Public Contracts Scotland advertising portal;</p>

  <p>Review contract award procedures;</p>

  <p>Use outcome based tender specifications;</p>

  <p>Include in terms and conditions a requirement that contractors pay any sub-contractors within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice, and</p>

  <p>Monitor spend with SMEs.</p>

  <p>I also announced, on 28 October 2009, that following discussion with Scottish Chambers of Commerce, the Scottish Government intends to introduce, in 2010, a national database for pre-qualification information, to reduce the burden of tendering for public contracts.</p>

  <p>One of the six single steps I announced on 28 April 2009 was that public bodies should monitor the proportion of their procurement spending with SMEs. At a national level, information from the Scottish Procurement Information Hub (covering 2005-06 to 2007-08) suggests that public procurement spending with SMEs has remained stable at around 48% of total public procurement spending. As Chair of the Procurement Reform Board I intend to monitor this figure closely.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware that the Big Lottery Fund has supported a number of renewable energy projects in Scotland. Scottish Government officials recently met with Big Lottery staff based in Scotland to emphasise the importance of continuing support for community renewable energy projects.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports the development of renewable energy projects for charities and not-for-profit community-based organisations through the Community And Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES). The scheme provides eligible organisations with free advice and potentially grant funding for the installation of devices such as small wind turbines, micro hydro, solar energy systems, heat pumps and woodfuel boilers. A network of CARES Development Officers covers the whole of Scotland.</p>

  <p>In March this year the Scottish Government published guidance to help communities develop their own renewable energy projects. The Community Renewable Energy Toolkit includes advice on the available technologies and highlights some of the issues which communities may need to address. It also signposts potential sources of funding, including the Big Lottery Fund. The Toolkit is available online at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/03/20155542/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/03/20155542/0</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides support for businesses to invest in renewable energy through a number of schemes. These include the Energy Saving Scotland small business loan scheme, which provides small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with interest free loans of up to &pound;100,000 to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Biomass Heat Scheme is specifically targeted at SMEs and is helping businesses to reduce emissions and potentially save money, while supporting jobs in forestry and the supply chain. A recent round of the scheme saw over &pound;1 million allocated to business across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Rural Development Programme offers financial support to eligible businesses to take up renewable energy technology and reduce their emissions.</p>

  <p>In addition, businesses who wish to invest in renewables and energy efficiency initiatives may be eligible for support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).</p>

  <p>It is our intention to declare the remaining properties owned by the Scottish Ministers which were acquired for the upgrade on the A74 in Dumfries and Galloway surplus to requirements. Raecleugh and Longbedholm Cottage have already been declared surplus and Transport Scotland&rsquo;s appointed agent is preparing schedules with a view to advertising the properties on the open market in the spring.</p>

  <p>Cauldwellknowe Farm will be declared surplus once the access road serving the property has been upgraded and adopted by Dumfries and Galloway Council. Milagro will be declared surplus once the issues regarding access rights are resolved.</p>

  <p>Following the publication of the <em>School Estate Statistics 2009</em> on 29 September 2009, it transpired that a programming error had led to an incorrect table being produced. Whilst quality assurance work was being progressed, additional concerns were identified and revised information was provided by two local authorities on the afternoon of 7 October 2009. Statisticians in Scottish Government completed further quality assurance work and were in a position to publish the revised publication later that evening.</p>

  <p>Two separate revisions were made to table 4 of the publication The following table presents the revisions (as a result of the programming error) to the number of primary schools rebuilt or substantially refurbished (non-PPP methods) in the last financial year:</p>

  <p>A revision was also made to Argyll and Bute and Glasgow data (picked up during quality assurance checks) concerning the number of &quot;completed PPP/NPD new build or PPP/NPD refurbished schools&quot; in the last financial year. These are:</p>

  <p>In the revised publication Argyll and Bute are recorded as having no PPP primary schools, newly refurbished or completed. In the original publication four PPP primary schools had been reported, and</p>

  <p>In the revised publication Glasgow are recorded as having no PPP primary schools (compared to one in the original publication) and no PPP special schools (compared with one in the original publication).</p>

  <p>The revision to the <em>School Estate Statistics 2009</em> was the subject of an exception report to the UK Statistics Authority. This report is available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>Through hub, the Scottish Futures Trust are putting in place arrangements for long-term partnerships. The model is flexible and will be able to be used for both publicly and privately financed projects. The south east and north pathfinder projects decided to proceed on the basis of a firm commitment from their public sector participants (NHS and local government) to the process, a strong pipeline of projects and a confirmed high level of market interest following market soundings.</p>

  <p>Profits generated by the hubCo will be shared between the public sector and the private sector to reflect their respective shareholdings in the hubCo. On individual hubCo projects, a mechanism will be put in place to ensure that unexpected or windfall profits (if any) that accrue are shared with the public sector organisation(s) paying for the particular project in question. Ultimately returns will therefore be capped.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s &pound;435 million Fairer Scotland Fund (FSF) has been allocated to all 32 local authorities and their community planning partners to regenerate communities, tackle poverty and improve employment prospects. Decisions on the investment of the FSF are a matter for each local authority area and as such the amount of FSF invested in credit unions is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>In delivering on its commitment to developing an enterprising third sector, which includes credit unions, the Scottish Government has also made available &pound;42 million of third sector funding. Credit unions are eligible to apply for this funding, which includes &pound;250,000 specifically for credit union development. To date, credit unions&rsquo; in South Lanarkshire (&pound;90,500), Falkirk (&pound;43,500) and Ayrshire (&pound;49,000) have had bids approved for grant funding.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold this information as taxation matters are currently reserved to the UK Government. We expect HM Revenue and Customs to publish the draft Regulations to implement the change and a Regulatory Impact Assessment with the pre-Budget Report shortly.</p>

  <p>The fund will be available to third sector organisations which can demonstrate that they provide essential front-line services which, as a result of the recession, require short-term financial support to maintain these services. Examples of the how the recession has affected organisations can include the loss or withdrawal of income from trusts and investments or the extraordinarily increased demand for services.</p>

  <p>Full details of the application process and further guidance are available at the following link:</p>
