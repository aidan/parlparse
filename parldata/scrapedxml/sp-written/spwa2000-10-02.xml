  <p>I understand that the question refers to the Agricultural Business Improvement Scheme (ABIS) and a letter written by Lord Sewel on 18 February 1999.</p>

  <p>This matter was the subject of proceedings before the Rural Affairs Committee on 3 December 1999. I said to the Committee at that meeting that, in looking at the effect of Lord Sewel&#8217;s letter, it was necessary to take account of the letter to which he was responding, in the context of the explanatory leaflet that sets out the ABIS scheme&#8217;s rules. I also said that my position was that, looked at on that basis, Lord Sewel&#8217;s letter did not amount to a promise.</p>

  <p>I remain of the view, taking account of all the advice I have received<strong>,</strong> that to interpret Lord Sewel&#8217;s letter as amounting to an undertaking is to ignore the context in which it was made.</p>

  <p>It follows that I do not consider that Lord Sewel&#8217;s letter amounts to a promise.</p>
