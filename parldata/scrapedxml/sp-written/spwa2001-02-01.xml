  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether or not the creation of offences under paragraph 19 of the Sheep and Goats Identification (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (SSI 2000/418) was necessary given that Article 9 of EU Directive 92/102/EEC on the identification and registration of animals states &quot;Member States shall adopt administrative and/or penal measures to punish any infringement of Community veterinary legislation, where it is established that the marking or identification or the keeping of registers provided for in Article 4 has not been carried out in conformity with the requirements of this Directive&quot; and whether any infringement of the Regulations could have been dealt with by administrative measures.</p>

  <p>Article 9 of European Council Directive 92/102/EEC gives member states the choice of measures they can adopt, either administrative or penal.</p>

  <p>Penal measures were introduced because the implementation and registration of animals are central both for veterinary and premium control purposes. On the veterinary side, they are essential for the control of outbreaks of disease and on the premium side to ensure compliance with EU Subsidy scheme rules.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Regulations implement European Council Directive 92/102/EEC and this is reflected in corresponding legislation in the rest of GB.</p>

  <p>While there are some minor differences, the Scottish SI is no stricter in its application than the counterpart legislation in the rest of GB. The differences are mainly in drafting including: the implementation date; record keeping for subsidy purposes; movement of sheep off holding to a tattooist, and powers of inspectors and penalties.</p>

  <p>Specifically on record keeping, the veterinary legislation requires records to be kept for six years whereas the premium legislation stipulates a minimum of four years. Since the same flock data is used for both purposes, the Scottish SI specifies six years - to avoid the need to keep separate records.</p>

  <p>The powers for inspectors and penalties in England are given in detail under the Animal Health Act 1981 and therefore not contained in the English SI. Since the Scottish SI is made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, the powers for inspectors and penalties require to be included in the Scottish SI. There are similar powers and penalties under the Animal Health Act 1981.</p>

  <p>On 17 January, the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) announced plans to close its Veterinary Disease Surveillance Centre in Thurso on 31 July 2001. In recent years, demand for consultancy services provided from the Thurso Centre to local veterinary practices and farmers has significantly reduced and the small amount of diagnostic material arising from this is now mainly referred to SAC&#8217;s Central Diagnostic Laboratory. In addition, some research work currently managed through the Thurso Centre will be coming to an end shortly. The centre therefore now provides SAC with very little commercial income, and its residual functions relate primarily to the provision of data for the UK-wide animal disease surveillance programme.</p>

  <p>The decision to close the Thurso Centre was not taken lightly, and SAC appraised all the options very carefully, including the cost implications of keeping the centre open. However, closure of the Thurso Centre represents the most sensible and pragmatic outcome in the circumstances and will make more efficient use of the resources available for veterinary diagnosis and disease surveillance throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Veterinary practices and their farmer clients in the areas presently covered by the Thurso Centre will continue to have access to the full range of SAC&#8217;s analytical, consultancy and animal health schemes through the Veterinary Centres in Inverness (for the North of Scotland and Orkney) and Aberdeen (for Shetland). Staff at these centres will be available to handle enquiries, and samples for investigation or analysis will be conveyed there either by post or by road and/or ferry using refrigerated vans. Under the new arrangements, SAC expects the level of service provided to existing clients to be at least as good as at present, and SERAD is satisfied that the necessary level of animal disease surveillance will be maintained.</p>

  <p>Under arrangements first introduced in 1989, criminal record checks for employment-related purposes are available mainly to employers in the statutory sector who are appointing people to positions which would give them substantial access to children in health, social work and education. Statutory sector employers may check volunteers under these arrangements but such checks are not separately identified.</p>

  <p>A limited scheme was introduced in 1998 allowing criminal record checks to be carried out by the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) on behalf of approved voluntary child care organisations. The cost to SCRO of these checks in each of the last three years is estimated approximately as follows:</p>

  <p>Part V of the Police Act 1997 makes provision for criminal record checks to be carried out at the request of individuals. The first stage of implementation of Part V is planned for the summer. We are, therefore, aiming to have the central body established before then so that it is ready to assist the voluntary sector when Part V is implemented.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it monitors the effectiveness of methadone programmes used in the rehabilitation of drug addicts.</p>

  <p>There is already robust national and international evidence for the effectiveness of methadone programmes. In Scotland research carried out by clinicians and academic institutions consistently shows effective outcomes for individuals. These include reduced criminality, improved health, reduced illicit drug use and spread of blood-borne virus and improved personal, social and family functioning. Methadone programmes that include counselling and other forms of support for the individual are most effective.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s new drugs research programme will include an evaluation of the long-term outcomes and relative cost effectiveness of treatment with methadone. A large-scale research project into outcomes&#8217; effectiveness, funded by the Robertson Trust and supported by the Executive, is also under way.</p>

  <p>Over the next year, the Executive&#8217;s Effective Interventions Unit will be developing detailed guidance on the effective planning and delivery of methadone programmes within shared care arrangements. Initial guidance will be issued to Drug Action Teams and related agencies shortly.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also set a national target that every Local Health Care Co-operative or Primary Care Trust is to have a locally approved shared care scheme by 2004.</p>

  <p>Nicol Stephen, when Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, met the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 13 July 2000 to discuss shipbuilding matters. I have recently had meetings with Patricia Hewitt, Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to discuss digital issues and with Helen Liddell when Minister of State at DTI to discuss energy matters. I plan to see the Secretary of State shortly.</p>

  <p>The salmon farming industry is relatively new and wishes to expand, and to use a range of chemicals. To do so it is seeking consents to discharge into the water environment. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency must reconcile these demands with its duties to protect the environment and to observe the requirements of EU legislation, such as the Dangerous Substances Directive (76/464/EEC). The Scottish Executive believes that the agency is carrying out this task effectively.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Scottish Executive has given careful consideration to the resources which the Scottish Environment Protection Agency requires to carry out its regulatory and monitoring functions. As a result of this consideration, in the Spending Review announced in September 2000, the agency was awarded additional funding of &#163;16.5 million for the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04. The agency&#8217;s total resources over this period, including income from charges, will be about &#163;123 million.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has investigated or will investigate whether the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has misinterpreted the Control of Pollution Act 1974 section 34 (2), misdirected itself in relation to its power to refuse discharge consents and consequently misled Scottish salmon farmers and, if such misinterpretation has taken place, what action it will take.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has recently become aware that certain offices of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency have until recently been issuing standard letters dating from before an amendment to section 34(2) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974. These letters suggest that a failure on the applicants&#8217; part to agree a period longer than four months to consider their application would result in a deemed refusal, whereas the amended legislation would merely give the applicants the option to treat it as such.</p>

  <p>The agency has issued guidance to staff to prevent the issue of any more of these standard letters.</p>

  <p>A great deal of polluted land has been inherited from past generations when little or no consideration was given to the impact of our actions on the environment. We now face the prospect of removing this undesirable legacy.</p>

  <p>We have allocated &#163;5.2 million capital resources for 2000-01 and 2001-02 to help local authorities implement the new contaminated land regime which provides the best solution to bringing polluted land back into productive use. Its main objective is to provide an improved system for the identification and remediation of contaminated land where the contamination is causing unacceptable risk to human health and the wider environment. A further &#163;9.5 million for 2002-03 and 2003-04 will be allocated in due course.</p>

  <p>The funds will help local authorities to investigate sites, take forward enforcement action and, if they are unable to identify those responsible for the contamination, carry out remediation work.</p>

  <p>In addition, &#163;9.7 million is being made available over the five years 1999-2000 to 2003-04 as part of the Annual External Finance settlement for local authority current expenditure.</p>

  <p>The distribution of capital allocations to local authorities is shown in the table.</p>

  <p>The activities into which modulated EU resources can be allocated are specified in Council Regulation (EC) 1259/99. To comply with this legal requirement, estimated amounts of modulated EU resources have been allocated in Scotland to agri-environment and forestry schemes, which apply across all our rural areas. All farmers and crofters in Scotland will have access to these schemes.</p>

  <p>There is no similar legal constraint on the matching resources secured from the UK Exchequer. Where this money is spent on schemes included in the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme, a sum will be allocated which is proportionate to the amount modulated from farmers and crofters in that area.</p>

  <p>The implementation of Best Value has involved no significant public expenditure on the part of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Executive holds no information on the costs to local authorities of implementing Best Value. Such costs would be associated with the review of services and the development of new systems for the public reporting of council performance.</p>

  <p>The implementation of Best Value will, however, afford local authorities opportunities to focus resources on priority services through new approaches to service delivery and more effective performance management. In its consultation paper <i>Best Value in</i> <i>Local Government: Next Steps</i>, published in June 2000, the Executive suggested that local authorities should set themselves an annual target of redistributing 2% of their overall resources through effective implementation of Best Value.</p>

  <p>We have recognised the need to address issues of education, training and workforce planning for Clinical Psychologists. The Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE) was given responsibility for the support of the postgraduate training of clinical psychologists in April 1999. Last August the Scottish Executive allocated &#163;100,000 to SCPMDE to provide extra training posts for Clinical Psychology. In addition, the Chief Medical Officer has appointed a Clinical Psychology Advisory Group to focus on matters such as service design and waiting times. These initiatives are at an early stage and will deal with their remits on a national basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Office Development Department Circular 4/1997 lays down the criteria which require local authorities to notify planning applications to the Scottish Ministers. Reference of a case to the Commissioner for Local Administration in Scotland is not included and, therefore, is not a planning reason for call-in.</p>

  <p>Jack McConnell recently announced an additional &#163;17.2 million in the current financial year to assist authorities in dealing with immediate repairs, maintenance and equipment problems in schools. In addition, by 2003-04 capital allocations for local authority investment in infrastructure will have increased by nearly 40% compared with current levels. We are also providing revenue support for school Public/Private Partnership schemes with a capital value of &#163;530 million and, under the New Deal for Schools, we are making an additional &#163;115.7 million available over five years from 1997. We hope to be able to announce decisions on the allocation of a further &#163;5 million to support early development of potential school PPP projects in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has established a telephone enquiry line to deal with questions about the scheme. While the scheme records will be the main source of the data we will be using, we are also taking the opportunity to invite enquirers to record their current addresses and details of their service with STG with the Executive. This information will be helpful in updating the records but there is no need for anyone to register at this stage. A page on the Scottish Executive website will be published early this month to supplement the telephone enquiry line.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will bring forward proposals as regards the distribution to beneficiaries for the approval of the Scottish Parliament. When Parliament has agreed these proposals and when the records are passed to the Scottish Executive following the wind-up of the pension schemes and dissolution of the Scottish Transport Group, verification of pension scheme membership data will be sought from individual pension scheme members. To ensure that the proposals agreed by Parliament are promulgated widely it is our intention to publish, at the appropriate time, details in national newspapers to alert those who may have an interest in the proposals.</p>
