  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is any proposal in the Scottish Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 to remove the duty to avoid damaging any feature of historic or archaeological interest and to follow Scottish ministers&rsquo; guidance and, if so, what the reasons are for this proposal.</p>

  <p>The European Union&rsquo;s Rural Development Regulation stipulates that the requirements of cross-compliance and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition apply to rural development payments for land-based measures approved under the new Scottish Rural Development Plan from 1 January 2007.</p>

  <p>My officials are considering whether there is a need to supplement these requirements with existing Scottish conditionality relating to features of historic or archaeological interest.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what research has been undertaken to establish whether sufficient numbers of people read expensive public advertisements in the press for the expenditure to deliver best value as a means of conveying information to the public, as opposed to electronic means such as websites.</p>

  <p>The selection of media is based on the advice of our media buying agency and backed by independently audited data. In the case of press advertising the data is compiled by the Audit Bureau of Circulation. The Executive uses a variety of media including online marketing and websites, all of which are monitored for best value results.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what public funding Serco has received, and for what purpose, in each year since 1999.</p>

  <p>Serco have not received public funding from the Scottish Executive. However, Serco Integrated Services are under contract to provide cleaning services to the core Scottish Executive estate and to certain associated agencies that have been given contractual permission to call off from this contract.</p>
