  <p>As <i>Making It Work Together: A Programme for Government</i> explains, the Minister for Parliament is responsible for the management and monitoring of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s business in the Parliament. He is also concerned with the operations and procedures of the Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Finance is responsible for promoting modern and efficient government across the Scottish Executive. As with all members of the Scottish Executive, they work together on matters of mutual interest.</p>
