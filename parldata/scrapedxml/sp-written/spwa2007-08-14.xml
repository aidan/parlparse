  <p>(a) Council tax benefit is administered by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Estimates of the number of people entitled to council tax benefit are available only at the Great Britain level.</p>

  <p>(b) DWP data on council tax benefit recipients aged over 60 in Scotland, and by local authority area, are reported as follows in tables 1 and 2. Please note that prior to May 2004 these data were available at the Scotland level only. Data on council tax benefit expenditure for pensioners in Scotland and by local authority area are shown in table 3. The data source used cannot provide pensioner data separately prior to 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Source: Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit Management Information System, Annual 1% sample, taken in May 1999 to 2003. This source is the only one available that provides pensioner data separately prior to May 2004. It does not provide a local authority breakdown.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The figures are based on a 1% sample and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.</p>

  <p>2. The data refers to benefit units, which may be a single person or a couple.</p>

  <p>3. Caseloads have been rounded to the nearest thousand.</p>

  <p>4. Council tax benefit totals exclude any Second Adult Rebate cases.</p>

  <p>5. &quot;Aged 60 and over&quot; is defined as benefit units where the claimant and/or partner are aged 60 and over. Therefore figures will contain some claimants aged under 60 where there is a partner aged over 60 years.</p>

The reliability of broadband connections is a matter purely for a consumer&rsquo;s Internet Service Provider (ISP) in conjunction with BT. Customers on non-commercial exchanges are treated in the same manner in this respect as those on commercial exchanges.

  <p>The Financial Services Authority undertook an assessment of financial capability between September 2005 and March 2006. This survey included a sample of sufficient size to produce separate results for Scotland. The Financial Services Authority will repeat the survey after four to five years, as one of the measures to assess the impact of initiatives to improve financial capability.</p>

  <p>We already have a programme of activity within and outwith schools to improve the financial literacy of young people. This includes the work of the Scottish Centre for Financial Education and support for Young Scot. The financial services industry is involved in several initiatives in schools. The Financial Services Authority&rsquo;s programmes targeting young people not in education, employment or training and those in higher education also cover Scotland. We will consider future needs as part of the current review of the 2005 Financial Inclusion Action Plan.</p>

  <p>Current activity to improve financial inclusion is set out in the 2005 Financial Inclusion Action Plan. This focuses on three strands: financial education, money advice, and access to financial products and services, including support for credit unions. We work with a range of partners, including local authorities and the financial services industry, and take account of UK-wide programmes, for example, the Financial Services Authority&rsquo;s work to increase financial capability. The 11 local authority areas with the greatest levels of financial exclusion have received &pound;10.6 million in 2006-08 to deliver programmes appropriate to their locality, covering the same three strands. Future plans will reflect the review of the Financial Inclusion Action Plan currently in progress.</p>

  <p>The article in <em>The Scotsman</em> refers to maps of body mass index (BMI) for Scotland, but does not give a source for the data used.

  <p>Our immediate housing priorities were set out in the Parliamentary debate on housing on 21 June 2007. It is clear that Scotland needs many more homes of the right type, built in the right places as well as housing solutions which work, which respond to communities needs and which improve the value that we get for public expenditure on housing. The Housing Supply Task Force, our commitment to create the Scottish Housing Support Fund and the forthcoming consultation on Social Housing are all part of the early action the Government is taking in response to these priorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government fully acknowledges the need for a comprehensive and strategic investment programme to address the requirement for more affordable housing in East Dunbartonshire.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland will invest approximately &pound;6 million in 2007-08 in East Dunbartonshire which is the highest amount of investment in recent years and will provide 80 new homes in the area.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland is also working closely with the council and housing associations, through the Strategic Housing investment Plan process, to identify a five year programme to meet housing need identified within the Local Housing Strategy. A major factor in this approach will be to secure a flow of land and additional funding (through commuted sums) from private developers through the council&rsquo;s affordable housing planning policy.</p>

  <p>The level of investment that West Dunbartonshire Council needs to make to achieve the Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS), and how this will be funded, will be set out in the Council&rsquo;s standard delivery plan for achieving the standard. We expect that the plan will be ready in December 2007 for submission once preparatory studies have been completed by the council. All Standard Delivery Plans are required to be assessed by Communities Scotland by March 2008.</p>

  <p>Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) in West Dunbartonshire intend to invest approximately &pound;8.4 million in achieving the SHQS. This is based on information provided in standard delivery plans, self assessments and estimates of spend by national RSLs operating in the area.</p>

  <p>Since the SHQS was introduced in 2004 it has been, and it continues to be, for RSLs to determine how best to use their resources to fund the investment required to meet the SHQS.</p>

  <p>The Local Housing Strategies prepared by East Dunbartonshire Council and West Dunbartonshire Council indicate a requirement for investment in both Milngavie and Clydebank for affordable housing for rent and sale. A good working partnership exists between both local authorities and Communities Scotland which has resulted in five year Investment programmes identifying investment priorities within the parliamentary constituency.

  <p>Further resources have been made available to help these local authorities through the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund to be made available over 2006-07 and 2007-08. This amounts to &pound;4 million in Dundee (following a previous &pound;4 million allocation in 2005-06) and &pound;2 million in West Dunbartonshire.</p>

  <p>Housing Estate Regeneration Fund monies totalling &pound;3.4 million have also been approved for the period 2005-06 to 2007-08 to assist Dundee City Council bringing forward regeneration priorities within the city. The council will use this funding to support the demolition and removal of surplus unwanted housing within priority areas of Dundee.</p>

  <p>Funding of &pound;2.084 million in Dundee and &pound;0.891 million in West Dunbartonshire has been made available through Private Sector Housing Grant in 2007-08 to support improvements in private sector housing. This will support ministerial targets along with those priorities identified through the LHS.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The allocation of the Affordable Housing Investment Programme in 2007-08 at local authority level was announced in March 2007 by the previous administration. The allocations reflected Local Housing Strategy priorities and also capacity to deliver programmes. The allocation allowed for increased investment in both areas of housing shortage and areas of high deprivation requiring regeneration.</p>

  <p>Future allocations of funding for new rented and affordable housing will be considered after the outcome of the current spending review is determined.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Housing refurbishment in Glasgow is mainly as a result of Glasgow Housing Association Ltd&rsquo;s work towards bringing its stock up to the Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS).</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland requires West Dunbartonshire Council to develop its standard delivery plan, demonstrating how it will ensure that all of its stock meets the SHQS, following ministers&rsquo; rejection of the council&rsquo;s application to pursue partial stock transfer in December 2006. It has always been for councils and Registered Social Landlords to determine how best to fund the investment required to meet the Standard by 2015.</p>

  <p>In terms of regeneration, Communities Scotland is planning to increase the level of housing investment in Clydebank, but the supply of land is a critical factor in this. Difficulties in securing land has been a significant inhibiting factor in securing additional investment in the town over the last few years. Communities Scotland will continue to work with the council and local partners to resolve these difficulties.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are required to assess the extent and nature of housing need in their areas as part of their Local Housing Strategy and Development Planning processes. The government is currently conducting an exercise which is seeking to gain a consistent picture from local authorities of their assessments of affordable housing need for their areas, and the evidence which supports this.</p>

  <p>A major piece of research on housing need was conducted for the Scottish government by Professor Glen Bramley and published in November 2006. This contains analysis of housing need by local authority area, and at national level. Although the analysis does not examine projected need in each of the next four years, it contains projections for 2005, 2006, and at five year intervals thereafter.

The notes to the tables explain the coverage of the estimates and the reasons for a possible break in comparability between 2004 and 2005, at which point the Regulated Mortgage Survey replaced the Survey of Mortgage Lenders.</p>

  <p>Mortgage lenders define first-time buyers as those whose names have not previously been on a mortgage contract. As such these figures include divorcees and others who have previously been owner-occupiers but have not been named mortgage holders.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Figures include:</p>

  <p>- Unoccupied dwellings that are exempt from council tax.</p>

  <p>- Dwellings subject to second home or long-term empty property discount (including holiday homes and self-catering accommodation available to let for less than 140 days per year).</p>

  <p>- A small number of dwellings occupied entirely by adults who are &lsquo;disregarded&rsquo; for the purpose of paying council tax, such as adults who are severely mentally impaired.</p>

  <p>2. The figures recorded may fluctuate for two main reasons:</p>

  <p>- Self-catering holiday accommodation available to let for less than 140 days per year will be included. If it is let for more than this, it will be included on the non-domestic rates valuation roll instead.</p>

  <p>- There can be delays in the information on council tax systems being updated, or councils may amend the information held on their systems.</p>

  <p>This is most likely to lead to fluctuations in areas with high turnover, or high levels of vacancies or second homes.</p>

  <p>Comparable figures are not available prior to 1996.</p>

  <p>3. In 2006, Glasgow City Council Financial Services moved to a new software system for council tax. This has resulted in a lack of consistency between the figures on the number of dwellings entitled to discounts and exemptions for 2006, and the figures for earlier years. In order to overcome this problem, the number of discounts and exemptions in 1996-2005 were adjusted to be equal to the figures for 2006. This is in line with other available data, which show little change in the number of vacancies in Glasgow in 2001-06.</p>

  <p>The Housing Supply Task Force will be charged with tackling the obstacles, such as land supply and planning issues that have been hampering the delivery of more housing of all types. I expect it to challenge the way things are done so that more homes are built where we need them. An action plan for the task force&rsquo;s work will be agreed at the first meeting which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday 29 August 2007.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no role or locus on twinning arrangements and keeps no records of these. Decisions on setting up and supporting twinning links are matters for individual local authorities and communities to consider and implement as they see fit. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) does hold some information on twinning links reported to them and can be contacted for details of these.</p>

  <p>The government believes that Scottish Planning Policy (SPP)6 &ndash; Renewable Energy provides a sound national policy context for addressing onshore wind development. We want to see the SPP&rsquo;s provisions taken forward urgently, with local authorities engaging with communities and other parties in the preparation of locational strategies in the form of supplementary planning guidance. These local frameworks should provide greater certainty for developers and local communities and speed up the decision making process. We see this approach as striking the right balance between national and local responsibilities.</p>

  <p>It is likely that authorities will have to review and update their existing policy and we believe there is also scope for authorities to work collaboratively. To assist the authorities at a time when they are addressing the challenges of delivering a modernised planning system, we shall make available a source of expert advice and issue national guidance on the preparation of the supplementary planning guidance. The chief planner will therefore be writing to planning authorities in the near future.</p>

  <p>SPP6 states in its opening paragraphs the energy policy target of 40% of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020 and notes that this is not a cap. This government has ambitions for a balanced approach to renewable energy encompassing a range of measures which extend beyond that. The SPP6 provides for a planned approach to delivering the target through setting the overall policy for preparing spatial frameworks, including the safeguarding of areas designated for their national and international natural heritage value and greenbelts. It gives a clear role to local authorities and national park authorities in relation to local interests and designated areas, in the identification of broad areas of search and in setting policy criteria which accord with the SPP.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that a reasonable estimate of the proportion of the costs of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route attributable to the Stonehaven Fastlink would be the length of the fastlink as a proportion of the length of the overall route, giving a range of 11.5/46 or between &pound;73.57 million and &pound;98.75 million and, if not, what it considers would be a reasonable formula for assessing the proportionate cost of this additional section.</p>

  <p>No. It is not appropriate to attribute costs to the Fastlink or any other individual section of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) in such a way as the cost will be affected by factors such as the number of bridges, complexity of drainage, amount of earthworks involved, cost of compensation for land and the like.</p>

  <p>To be legally enforceable, &quot;zig-zagged yellow lines&quot; around schools must have road markings and road signs in accordance with the provisions of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions and be supported by a Traffic Regulation Order in accordance with the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.

  <p>The Stage 1 location review for the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission, published in January 2007, ranked the Scottish Borders 26 out of 32 local authorities as a potential location for the Commission. Scottish Borders locations were not, therefore, included within the final options appraisal for this location decision.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-2949 on 14 August 2007. All local authorities were advised, through a regular relocation update, of the outcome of the Stage 1 location review for the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission, published in January 2007. As the Scottish Borders was not one of the locations short-listed following the Stage 1 review, no further direct communication was made with the council about the final location decision. All the short-listed local authorities were contacted and advised of the final decision.</p>

  <p>Dunoon Pier is owned by Argyll and Bute Council and the council was responsible for the improvement works at the pier. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s role was as a funder. There were two awards of Scottish Executive funding in relation to the project. The first, involving &pound;2.5 million from the then Public Transport Fund, was announced in October 2001 and was for a breakwater. The second, involving &pound;2 million from the Integrated Transport Fund, was announced in August 2003 and was for a new linkspan.</p>

  <p>I understand that a new linkspan was constructed to keep open the possibility of a vehicle service operating from Dunoon Pier. The original linkspan is designed for side-loading which significantly restricts the range of vehicle carrying vessels that can use the pier. In addition, it is an old structure which has a finite remaining life.</p>

  <p>A range of design options was considered and costed for the project at Dunoon Pier.

  <p>Responsibility for the Dunoon Pier development rests with Argyll and Bute Council. I understand that there were full discussions between the council, the appointed consultant and the two principal ferry operators regarding the need for the new linkspan at Dunoon Pier. The linkspan was designed to accommodate a range of possible vessels, including those operated by both Caledonian MacBrayne and Western Ferries.
