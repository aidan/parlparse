  <p>Information Services Division Scotland (ISD) recently carried out an in-depth review of their core alcohol-related code set and as a result the codes for alcohol poisoning have been changed.

  <p>The Scottish Government published the <em>Special Committee on Seals Report 2008</em> on 23 April 2008.</p>

  <p>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green): To ask the Scottish Executive what evidence has been published to show the extent to which predation by killer whales explains the reported decline in the number of common seals in Orkney and Shetland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what stage any research into predation by killer whales on common seals has reached.</p>

</ques>


<ques id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-05-12.S3W-23415.q3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" spid="S3W-23415" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0512.htm#3">

  <p>The papers considered by the Special Committee on Seals in developing its 2008 report included a scientific paper on research on predation of seals by killer whales. The research is on-going and has not been published but a paper based on the latest findings has been approved for publication in the scientific journal <em>Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems Early View</em> .</p>

  <p>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green): To ask the Scottish Executive what evidence it used as the basis of its statement in a press release of 23 April 2009, regarding the decline in common seals, that &quot;It is already clear that local shooting and disease do not explain the significant reductions reported&quot;.</p>

  <p>In respect of local shooting, scientific advice is that other factors are contributing to the common seal decline. There have been no reports of seal carcasses or seal shooting on the scale required in the areas most affected by the decline. In addition, shooting should equally impact on grey seals but these show no signs of a similar decline. In relation to disease, the latest research carried out to date provides no support for this.</p>

  <p>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green): To ask the Scottish Executive what evidence it used as the basis of its statement in a press release of 23 April 2009, regarding the decline of common seals, that &quot;predation by killer whales is a factor round the Northern Isles whilst competition for food supplies with the larger and more numerous grey seals is likely to be a significant factor across Scotland as a whole&quot;.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what evidence from the Special Committee on Seals report for 2008 it used as the basis of its statement in a press release of 23 April 2009, regarding the decline of common seals, that &quot;The main causes of these local reductions are unclear at present but predation by killer whales in the Northern Isles and competition for food supplies with grey seals could be significant factors&quot;.</p>

  <p>The statements made in the Scottish Executive press release of 23 April 2009 were based on the best scientific advice available, including the latest developments from on-going research currently in progress and the advice of the Sea Mammal Research Unit.</p>

  <p>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green): To ask the Scottish Executive how it plans to respond to the statement in the Special Committee on Seals report for 2008 that &quot;We also know very little about the number of seals shot by fin fish farmers and this information is important for the purpose of seal population management and also to help develop mitigation that is appropriate to the conservation status of seals&quot;.</p>

  <p>As the accompanying documentation for the Marine (Scotland) Bill explains, the detailed arrangements for implementing the proposals in the Bill will be developed in consultation with interested parties and will be the subject of further research. Existing guidance on welfare standards developed by my officials with stakeholders through the Seals Forum and the Moray Firth Seal Management Plan will be of assistance in designing the new system and a firearms licence from the police authorities will continue to be required.</p>

  <p>Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab): To ask the Scottish Executive, if the Conservation of Seals Act (1970) is repealed under the provisions of the Marine (Scotland) Bill, whether the National Environment Research Council will still have a statutory responsibility to provide information on the number and distribution of seals in the waters around Scotland.</p>

  <p>Non-domestic rates are a property based tax calculated using the rateable value of a property, which is set by the Scottish Assessors, who are independent of the Scottish Government, and a poundage rate which is set annually by Scottish ministers.

  <p>An evaluation of the mandatory drug testing of arrestees pilots by independent researchers suggests that the numbers of people tested across the three sites as a result of this initiative has been just 3,308 during the evaluation period compared with the 15,000 arrestees per year anticipated. The pilots failed to meet expectations and we have therefore decided to provide further central funding of the pilots for an additional three month period only to assist with transitional arrangements. By not extending central funding to the pilots any further, we will ensure these resources remain in programmes focused on community sentences.</p>

  <p>Arrest referral schemes, which have similar objectives but entail voluntary engagement on the part of the arrestee, were found to be more cost-effective and will continue to operate in all three pilot areas, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government issues notification of public appointment opportunities to a list of diversity contacts to raise awareness of and indicate where information about vacancies can be obtained.</p>

  <p>Sponsor Teams across the Scottish Government are encouraged to consider all potential client groups when considering their advertising strategies for appointment vacancies. Applications from individuals with a disability, from all age and ethnic groups etc, are welcomed. One of the over-riding principles of the appointments process is that applicants are appointed on the basis of merit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working to implement the recommendations in the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland&rsquo;s Equality Strategy, Diversity Delivers. This includes a dedicated public appointments website which is scheduled to launch this month, improved diversity monitoring and involvement in an implementation group to oversee implementation of the strategy.</p>

  <p>The Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies in Scotland requires successful candidates to declare any political activity in the five years prior to the appointment, in so far as that information is already in the public domain. This information is included in the public announcements of such appointments. Appointees are not asked to provide private information such as membership of political parties or voting preferences.</p>

  <p>Under the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 2007, the commission is required to publish a report every year, as soon as practicable after the end of the financial year, reporting on the discharge of its functions in that year, and such action as the commission proposes to take in the following year.

  <p>Paragraph 11.3 of the Scottish Ministerial Code makes clear that, on appointment to each new office, ministers must provide the Permanent Secretary with a full list in writing of all interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict.

  <p>Following audit compliance work by Disclosure Scotland (DS), both DS and the Central Registered Body for Scotland (CRBS) approached Scottish Government officials to request clarification on their different interpretations of the criteria that should be applied when defining who was eligible for an enhanced disclosure for an adult at risk position.

  <p>The changes arose following audit compliance work by Disclosure Scotland which highlighted that some voluntary and charitable sector positions fall outwith the criteria set out in current legislation. It was identified that some individuals would not have been allowed to have anything other than a basic disclosure check until the commencement of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act in 2010. So for continuity, and to ensure that local authorities are not faced with reduced services, an amendment to current legislation is being brought forward to enable organisations to request enhanced level checks.</p>

  <p>Shirley-Anne Somerville (Lothians) (SNP): To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions took place with local authorities about existing requirements in funding agreements with voluntary organisations for enhanced or standard disclosure checks for staff and volunteers working with vulnerable adults before changes were made to the interpretation of the eligibility criteria for access to such checks.</p>
