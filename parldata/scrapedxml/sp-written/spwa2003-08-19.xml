  <p>The current priority for Drug Treatment and Testing Orders is to make the order available to courts across the country as an option for dealing with drug misusing offenders. For those offenders with alcohol misuse problems, courts can in appropriate cases impose a probation order with a condition of alcohol treatment.</p>

  <p>The Executive regularly meets carers' organisations, including respite care providers, to discuss a range of issues including the provision of respite care. Comprehensive guidance on respite care policy and practice was issued to local authorities by the Scottish Office in 1996. This guidance is still in force. In addition, since April 2002, where respite care includes the provision of accommodation, the service must be registered with the Care Commission, which takes account of National Care Standards in regulating such services. It is for local authorities and NHS services locally to decide on the best way to provide respite services to meet local needs and priorities. Planning authorities need to take account of all relevant matters when considering planning applications for respite care facilities, which may include guidance on policy and practice, and national care standards.</p>

  <p>The UK Health Departments' <em>Drug Misuse and Dependence - Guidelines on Clinical Management</em> provide comprehensive information on the treatment of drug misuse, including residential care.</p>

  <p>The provision of residential care is also addressed in <em>Integrated Care for drug users - Principles and practice</em> and "The effectiveness of treatment for opiate dependent drug users - an international systematic review of the evidence". Both publications are produced by the Executive's Effective Interventions Unit. These publications have been given a wide distribution to Drug Action Teams and other interested parties.</p>

  <p>Decisions on treatment and rehabilitation interventions are for local service providers and individual patients. This principle applies to choices between residential or community-based care. It is for local Drug Action Teams to design and deliver services for drug misusers tailored to meet local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The firemaster, on behalf of the Fire Authority, has a general responsibility with regard to the supply of water for firefighting by virtue of section 13 of the Fire Services Act 1947. When provision of water hydrants for firefighting purposes is being recommended or required, supply pipe size is normally specified, and the firemaster would take into account supply pipe size and water flow potential. Water pressure will be characteristic of the supply network. The firemaster will then, using risk assessed judgements, consider if the proposal specified is appropriate for the specific premises concerned.</p>

  <p>The firemaster may be consulted by the Care Commission in respect of fire safety in individual care premises as part of the registration process, and may make recommendations.

  <p>Firearms legislation is reserved. The Anti-Social Behaviour Bill, currently before the UK Parliament, introduces a number of changes to the Firearms Act 1968 which are intended to deal with the misuse of air weapons and to provide for stricter control over air weapons that are especially dangerous. These include raising the age limit at which a young person may own an air weapon from 14 to 17 and a ban on certain types of air weapon.</p>

  <p>The Executive welcomes these proposals and will continue to work with the UK Government to prevent the escalation of gun culture.</p>

  <p>The Executive has carefully considered the different options put forward in the report of the review team, and decided that the head office functions of Forest Enterprise Scotland will be delivered by its existing territorial offices in Inverness and Dumfries. The views of staff, the trade unions and external stakeholders were taken into account, and our decision is to retain both offices. We have decided that Inverness will be designated as the head office, with Dumfries playing a vital role in support.</p>

  <p>The retention of both offices will, therefore, be guaranteed for the foreseeable future as Forest Enterprise Scotland maintains a dispersed organisation. It will allow for excellent services and a significant presence in both the north and the south of the country, reflecting the importance of forestry to both of these regions.</p>

  <p>In the Executive&#8217;s lifelong learning strategy <em>Life Through Learning; Learning Through Life</em> , published in February 2003, we outlined our vision for lifelong learning in Scotland, which "is to provide the best possible match between the learning opportunities open to people and the skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that will strengthen Scotland's economy and society." The five people-centred goals to realise that vision are:</p>

  <p>a Scotland where people have the confidence, enterprise, knowledge, creativity and skills they need to take a full part in economic, social and civic life;</p>

  <p>a Scotland where people demand - and learning providers deliver - a high-quality learning experience;</p>

  <p>a Scotland where people's knowledge and skills are recognised, used and developed to best effect in their workplace;</p>

  <p>a Scotland where people are given the information, guidance and support they need to make effective learning decisions and transitions, and</p>

  <p>a Scotland where people have the chance to learn irrespective of their background or current personal circumstances.</p>

  <p>The planned 16% increase in higher and further education funding by 2006 referred to in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> will help us meet these goals for the people of Scotland, and for the people living and working in Greenock and Inverclyde.</p>

  <p>While Scottish ministers set the overall policy framework within which our educational establishments operate, the resources made available to individual further education colleges and higher education institutions is a matter for the Scottish Further Education Funding Council and the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council respectively.</p>

  <p>The merger proposals are currently at a very early stage and no final decision will be taken before a full consultation has been undertaken to enable the views of all major stakeholders to be aired and the pros and cons of the proposal considered fully. Bearing this in mind, to offer a view on how any future merger of the funding councils would affect an individual college would, at this stage, be premature.</p>

  <p>Consents to release GM material as part of the farm-scale evaluations are held by the biotechnology company concerned. It is their responsibility to ensure that the conditions of consent are adhered to, whether the land is farmed by the owner or a tenant. As a condition of the consent under which GM oil seed rape has been grown as part of the FSE programme, conventional oil seed rape must not be grown on the same field for the following two years. This period may be reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) for future consents in the light of emerging research findings. Notwithstanding the specific conditions in relation to an FSE consent, however, there remains a general requirement not to market products containing GMOs without an appropriate consent.</p>

  <p>As stated in <em>Building A Better Scotland - Spending Proposals 2003-2006: What the money buys</em>, the Executive will increase the supply and quality of Scotland&#8217;s housing stock by approving 18,000 new and improved homes for social rent and low cost home ownership by 2006.</p>

  <p>The Housing Improvement Task Force final report, published in March 2003, contained a recommendation that the Executive should support a pilot of the single survey. At that time I announced the intention to adopt that recommendation, a decision that is reflected in the <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> agreement, which includes a commitment to introduce a single seller survey.</p>

  <p>Work on developing that pilot is under way, with the intention of robustly testing the single survey approach recommended by the task force, including gauging professional and consumer reaction to it, and identifying the best approach to making it work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continues to work closely with the Enterprise Networks to improve the quality and effectiveness of support for business start-ups and growth businesses throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) is the main national scheme of financial assistance to industry in the Assisted Areas, which very substantially covers Greenock and Inverclyde Scottish parliamentary constituency. Following a review in 2001, the scheme was restructured to strengthen its focus on growing Scottish firms and quality projects. Additionally, closer links have been forged between the Executive and Scottish Enterprise Renfrewshire to ensure that firms in the Greenock and Inverclyde area take full advantage of the opportunities offered through RSA.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Co-Investment Fund (SCF) is administered by Scottish Enterprise. It is targeted at the current equity gap of up to &#163;500,000 and will invest in a range of existing and new private-sector funding vehicles. A number of funds have already signed co-investment agreements and various direct investments in businesses have been made. Companies from Greenock and Inverclyde who wish to access this form of funding can apply directly to the individual fund managers. Businesses can also utilise the new Investment Readiness programme available in the Scottish Enterprise area to help them prepare their investment proposals. Details on this initiative can be obtained by contacting the local Business Gateway outlet in Greenock direct or online at www.bgateway.com.</p>

  <p>As outlined in the Partnership Agreement, steps are in hand to introduce additional support measures for businesses including a new Business Start-Up Fund. The details of the new fund are currently being worked up and will be announced in due course.</p>

  <p>There is no national approved list of medicines, but NHS boards are encouraged to operate formularies, which cover both hospitals and general practice. Hospital formularies have been used in Scotland for the last 30 years and have gained wide acceptance as a means of managing prescribing, particularly when operated within the hospital clinical pharmacy system. Area drug and therapeutic committees were often established to manage the local formulary. Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) in turn was established by NHS boards to provide them and their area drug and therapeutic committees with a single source of national advice on the clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines. While SMC has no role in removing products from local formularies, its existence allows area drug and therapeutic committees more time to review their local formularies.</p>

  <p>Lewd communication with a child through an internet chatroom would constitute the offence of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices. Sexual grooming can therefore already be caught under existing Scots law. In addition, depending on the exact circumstances, an adult who pretends to be a child for the purposes of securing a meeting with a child could be guilty of fraud, or an attempt to commit a sexual offence, or both. We are currently considering whether the law in this area needs to be strengthened.</p>
