  <p>This information is not collected centrally, although we recognise the positive and high quality work already being done by local authorities to respond to the particular educational needs of the children of asylum seekers. One of the purposes for which the Scottish Executive set up the Scottish Refugee Integration Forum was to share good practice in relation to the provision of education for the children of asylum seekers and refugees.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s support for promoting the legacy of Robert Burns has involved various initiatives and is not limited to a single year. Ministers announced early in 2002 the commitment of &#163;300,000 to develop a raft of projects to celebrate the life and works of Burns. These projects will benefit socially disadvantaged areas and under-represented groups and are being implemented this year and next through the Scottish Arts Council. In April 2002, a Tam O&#8217; Shanter CD funded by the National Grid for Learning was issued free to all primary and secondary schools in Scotland. The Executive also provided &#163;100,000 for the inaugural "Burns and a&#8217; that" festival in 2002. The festival received much critical acclaim and, last month, Mike Watson announced that the Executive will provide a further &#163;100,000 for this year's event. Valuable support from our agencies, VisitScotland and the Scottish Arts Council, has also been provided and this continues.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the use of cocaine by young people has increased over the last five years and what links there are between crime and (a) cocaine and (b) crack cocaine use.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-02-03.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80171" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0203.htm#5">

  <p>A Working Group of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse published a report in August 2002 on psychostimulant use in Scotland, particularly cocaine, crack cocaine and amphetamines. The report, which can be accessed on the national drugs website at http:// <a href="www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org" target="_blank">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</a> highlighted a small, but growing, problem of cocaine and crack cocaine use in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Table 1 details the number and quantity of seizures of cocaine and crack cocaine in Scotland from 1995 to 2000, the latest year where published data is available.</p>

  <p>Table 2 details the percentage of new individual patients/clients who reported using cocaine and crack cocaine in Scotland from 1997-98 to 2001-02.</p>

  <p>There is some evidence of the link between cocaine and crack cocaine use and crime. In particular, the use of crack cocaine is associated with both acquisitive and violent crime. Typical crimes committed by crack users are shoplifting and handling stolen goods. In addition, cocaine and crack cocaine have strong links to the sex trade.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p><u>Seizures</u></p>

  <p>1. Information on seizures of drugs controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is published annually by the Home Office in a range of bulletins under the general title &quot;Statistics of drug seizures and offenders dealt with&quot;.</p>

  <p>2. Statistics on seizures cover seizures made during the year by police and by officials of HM Customs and Excise and other bodies. Seizures involving more than one drug are counted as a single seizure in the total number of seizures, but are counted separately against each individual drug or drug class involved.</p>

  <p><u>Scottish Drug Misuse Database</u></p>

  <p>3. The Database collects anonymous information about new problem drug users presenting at a broad range of drug services across Scotland, including general practices.</p>

  <p>4. It is emphasised the information held on the Scottish Drug Misuse Database relates to <em>new</em> patients/clients. The definition of new is (a) the person is attending the particular service for the first time ever, or (b) the person has attended before but not within the previous six months. Thus, the statistics do not reflect the total number of drug misusers seen by services during any period. A study is presently under way on the feasibility of re-reporting individuals to the database at regular intervals. If re-reporting is implemented successfully, the database will provide a better source of information on the total number of people receiving treatment.</p>

  <p>5. All figures in the table exclude penal establishment inmates and information received from needle exchanges.</p>

  <p>6. More detailed information is published in the ISD Scotland publication <em>Drug Misuse in Scotland 2001</em> which is available on the National Drug Misuse website.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to answer this question directly. However, such information as is available is given in the table. Figures for 2001 and 2002 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>The figures provided on the total number of persons with a charge proved for the drug offences of supply and trafficking are derived from the Scottish Executive Justice Department&#8217;s court proceedings database. This database does not hold information on the type of drug involved in convictions for drug offences.</p>

  <p>The Home Office collects data separately on drug offenders, including information on the type of drug involved in court convictions and fiscal fines. The coverage of this data is known to be incomplete. For example, the Home Office data are currently estimated to cover about 91% of Scottish convictions for total drug offences in 2000. However, it is possible to make use of this information to estimate the proportion of convictions involving different types of drug.</p>

  <p>Advice on the support which should be made available to cocaine and crack cocaine users seeking help with their addiction was published by the Executive&#8217;s Effective Interventions Unit in October 2002, following a report by a Working Group of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse. The report, which is available on the national drugs website at http:// <a href="www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org" target="_blank">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</a> highlighted a small but growing problem of cocaine and crack cocaine use in Scotland and made a wide range of recommendations covering prevention, the planning and delivery of services, treatment, research and information, availability and resourcing. The recommendations are currently being implemented by the Executive.</p>

  <p>Drug Action Teams (DATs) and their local partners should be assessing need and enhancing service provision in line with the guidance, funded from the substantial additional drug treatment and rehabilitation resources allocated to NHS boards and local authorities for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04. DATs will be requested to detail in this year&#8217;s corporate action plans, what work has been undertaken or planned to ensure the needs of cocaine and crack cocaine users in their areas are being met.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive has committed funding of &#163;100,000 per annum over the following two financial years for a pilot service for cocaine and crack cocaine users in the Aberdeen area, where a particular problem has been identified. Officials are currently working with the local DAT and local agencies on the details of the pilot service, which it is hoped will become operational before the end of this financial year.</p>

  <p>We are working on new information materials on cocaine and crack, but anyone seeking advice on these drugs can contact the free and confidential Know the Score Informationline, or they can log on to the Know the Score website http://<a href="www.knowthescore.info" target="_blank">www.knowthescore.info</a>.</p>

  <p>The term &quot;registered addict&quot; is no longer used. Research commissioned by the Executive concluded that there were around 56,000 people in Scotland misusing opiates and benzodiazepines in 2000. A similar study will be undertaken this year.</p>

  <p>Information on drug seizures, drug-related offences, convictions for drug-related offences, and drug-related deaths can be obtained from the Drug Misuse Statistics Scotland 2002 which were published electronically by the Information and Statistics Division on 31 January. The statistics can be accessed at <a href="www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org" target="_blank">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</a>. Criminal statistics cover recorded crimes, rather than the numbers of people arrested, and breakdowns by drug type are not available for every category requested.</p>

  <p>There is no comprehensive information on the costs of drug-related crime in Scotland which, for example, includes estimates of social and economic costs beyond the public sector. However, a Scottish Executive Policy Unit review in 2000 provided a broad estimate that aggregate expenditure by public sector organisations in Scotland (including enforcement activities, court proceedings, health and social care, support for families and children) is over &#163;330 million per annum.</p>

  <p>Funding to Scottish fishing communities is available through both European Structural Funds Programmes and other Community Initiatives. For individual communities the availability of funding is determined by the geographic coverage of programmes and initiatives and the specific measures targeted within each.</p>

  <p>Discussions with the Commission establish and set the total funding available to Scotland for each Structural Fund Programme. On-going discussions with the Commission as part of the monitoring process will assess whether any re-prioritisation of funding between measures is required and also to establish whether co-operation between programmes is required to target aid towards specific communities.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Rates are calculated using the Registrar General&#8217;s annual mid-year estimates of population which are being revised following the 2001 Census results. The figures for 2000 and 2001 use provisional revisions that have already been made on this basis. Revisions covering 1982-2000 will be made by the end of February 2003, so the rates given here will be subject to revision after this time.</p>

  <p>2. The rates given here are not age-sex standardised and hence do not take into account the age-sex mix of the two populations.</p>

  <p>The Executive has concluded that competition on the public water and sewerage networks would have to be restricted if our public health, environment protection and social objectives for the water industry were to continue to be safeguarded.</p>

  <p>Legislation to provide for this will be a matter for the next Administration in the next Parliament.</p>

  <p>The purpose of any legislation would be to protect public health and the environment by prohibiting common carriage on the public networks and ensuring that Scottish Water alone was able to add treated drinking water to and draw wastewater from the public networks. It would safeguard social objectives by prohibiting anyone other than Scottish Water from retailing water services to households on the public networks. This would mean that domestic water charges could continue to reflect customers' ability to pay by retaining the link between domestic charges and the banding and discount arrangements of the council tax system.</p>

  <p>Any legislation would also ensure that business customers on the public networks could benefit from the introduction of choice in the provision of retail services, while ensuring that they continue to pay a fair share of the costs of the networks, by introducing a licensing regime for non-domestic retail services.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for Scottish Water. I have asked Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Through regular sampling of drinking water supplies, Scottish Water identifies areas where water is picking up lead from old plumbing and treats the water so it is not absorbing so much lead. When renewing old water mains, Scottish Water replaces the part of any of their lead service pipes that have been uncovered. They advise customers about lead in private pipework and steps that can be taken to reduce any risk. When a customer replaces their private lead pipes, Scottish Water also removes any lead pipes that are their responsibility. In addition, Scottish Water is working closely with the Scottish Executive to develop a long-term strategy to reduce lead in drinking water supplies.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for Scottish Water. I have asked Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>There are areas of Scotland where there are no lead pipes on the public water supply network, although there may still be lead in customers&#8217; private service pipes and plumbing.</p>
