  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is concerned that the data on consumption of alcohol contained in the report, <em>Independent Review of the Effects of Alcohol Pricing and Promotion</em> , by the University of Sheffield is five years out of date and does not take into account the improving trends on consumption contained in the 2008 Scottish Health Survey.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to the impact that the most recent consumption figures, showing that the proportion of men and women drinking over the weekly recommended limit has declined since 2003, would have on the minimum pricing modelling used in the University of Sheffield appraisal of alcohol minimum pricing and off-trade discount bans in Scotland.</p>

  <p>This category of crime includes production, manufacture and cultivation of drugs. While the total number of crimes in this category has increased it represents a small (1.4%) proportion of all drugs crimes.</p>

  <p>Serious organised crime groups are heavily involved in the production and cultivation of drugs including &quot;cannabis farming&quot; operations. To combat cannabis cultivation, the police have instigated &quot;Operation League&quot;, an intelligence and enforcement operation involving all police forces in Scotland, the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and HM Revenue and Customs. Since Operation League&rsquo;s commencement, over 111,000 cannabis plants with a value of &pound;34.2 million have been seized.</p>

  <p>The category of offence which accounts for the increase is that of non-money laundering offences described as &quot;Drugs, other offences&quot;. While there has been an increase, the total number of such offences remains small, less than 1% of total drugs offences.</p>

  <p>We are committed to tackling drug use and drug crime. Enforcement action has seen unprecedented successes, with last year the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency seizing a record amount of Class A drugs.</p>

  <p>Grampian police are committed to tackling violent crime and are undertaking a number of targeted initiatives to address violence throughout the force area. For example, through the &quot;Unight Aberdeen&quot; initiative they are working in partnership with city nightclubs and entertainment venues to tackle evening economy crime, and in particular violence. During the recent national anti-violence campaign, a range of activities were undertaken from the display of anti-violence messages in nightclubs and on public screens, through to the innovative use of police bail conditions in Aberdeenshire to prevent offenders at the traditional games and shows attending other similar events.</p>

  <p>Over the last five years, there has been a decrease in the number of domestic housebreaking crimes recorded by the police per 10,000 population for Scotland. There has also been a general decrease in the number of domestic housebreaking crimes recorded by the police per 10,000 population in Aberdeen City over this period. In 2005-06, the rate for Aberdeen City was almost two and a half times the Scottish average but the latest figures for 2008-09 show that the rate stands at just over twice the Scottish average.</p>

  <p>Domestic housebreaking has been a priority for Grampian police force for a number of years and this type of crime received significant focus of resources, with significant reductions being achieved. Additionally, funded by the Scottish Government, the Scottish Business Crime Centre runs a number of retail and acquisitive crime initiatives, including the Scottish Safer Areas Initiative and the Retailers Against Crime Initiative.</p>

  <p>Sections 50A(1)(a) and 50A(1)(b) of the Criminal Law (Consolidation)(Scotland) Act 1995 introduced two new offences of racially aggravated harassment and racially aggravated conduct. These sections of the act came into force on 30 September 1998.</p>

  <p>The number of racially aggravated harassment and racially aggravated conduct offences (554) recorded by Grampian police in 2008-09 is the highest figure recorded, based on information available from Grampian police force following the introduction of this legislation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to tackling racist crime and racism more broadly in Scotland. Police and other organisations are working hard to build networks and provide reassurance and advice to ethnic minority communities. That has led to greater awareness within these organisations and within communities of racist crimes, and an increased willingness to report these incidents by the public.</p>

  <p>We are aware that Grampian Police have identified that throughout 2008-09 improvements have been made to reporting and recording practices, to ensure all incidents are captured and shared with partners, such as Grampian Racial Equality Council (GREC).</p>

  <p>We will shortly be launching another phase of the One Scotland anti-racism campaign which seeks to tackle racist attitudes at a national level. 29 October will see a Rock Against Racism event take place in Aberdeen. This event and the publicity around it seek to take the anti-racism message to a younger audience. In addition, we are providing support to a number of organisations across Scotland working with ethnic minority communities to encourage integration and improve community cohesion. Two projects, Grampian Racial Equality Council (GREC) and Minority Ethnic Aberdeen Limited (MEAL) are working specifically on this issue in the Aberdeen area.</p>

  <p>Through the National Community Safety Strategic Group which I chair, we are working closely with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the Scottish Business Crime Centre, and other partners to deliver a co-ordinated response to this issue.</p>

  <p>There are a number of factors that may influence the level of acquisitive crime. It may be committed for monetary gain and therefore a loss of income or economic opportunity through unemployment could make these crimes more attractive to some individuals. However, other factors can also explain changes in crime.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the publication of <em>Recorded Crime in Scotland, 2008-09</em> , what assessment it has made of the lack of a significant percentage reduction in recorded crimes for handling an offensive weapon and what action it will take over the next year.</p>

  <p>The percentage change in handling offensive weapons is influenced by a range of factors, including the extent of targeted action by police. For example, in 2008-09, police in Scotland stopped and searched around 257,000 people, supporting the Violence Reduction Unit&rsquo;s on-going anti-violence campaign.</p>

  <p>Such proactive action may mean the reduction in handling offensive weapons is not greater because the police are catching more criminals. We will continue to take action to reduce crime related to offensive weapons. For example, we will invest at least &pound;13 million through to 2011 in youth diversionary activities to keep young people out of trouble and away from knives.</p>

  <p>Information on convictions in 2008-09 is not yet available. The data on court proceedings is planned for release in February 2010. Please refer to tables 2 and 4 in the <em>2007-08 Criminal Proceedings in Scottish Courts</em> statistical bulletin for the latest available data on persons with a charge proved for housebreaking:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/04/27103325/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/04/27103325/0</a>.</p>

  <p>The 2,720 cases of housebreaking referred to in the question are the number of crimes recorded by the police. The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim. The crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also, a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year. Crimes committed by children aged under 16 are also generally dealt with through the children&rsquo;s hearings system rather than the courts.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The recording of aggravators has improved with time therefore caution is needed when comparing changes over time. 2005-06 is the first year where it has been considered that the use and recording of domestic abuse aggravator codes from the Scottish Government Court Proceedings Database has been of sufficient coverage to be used.</p>

  <p>2. An admonishment is a court disposal given after an offender has been found guilty. The offence is recorded as a conviction and the court warns the offender of the consequences of their future conduct, but no other penalty is imposed.</p>

  <p>3. Includes absolute discharge, remit to children&rsquo;s hearing, caution, no order made.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government committed to a one year temporary expansion of the Open Market Shared Equity Pilot scheme and this is being successfully delivered. We plan to carry out an independent evaluation of the Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers (LIFT) shared equity schemes next year in order to inform the schemes&rsquo; long-term future.

  <p>The Scottish Government does not centrally hold information relating to the age of perpetrators of crime. For information, the majority of charges against under 16&rsquo;s are dealt with by the Children&rsquo;s Reporter.</p>

  <p>Yes. This is a priority for this government and I announced on 1 September that we now have 17,278 police officers in Scotland, which is 1,044 higher than at May 2007. The Scottish Government is directly paying for the recruitment, training and salary of 801 officers recruited since May 2007 and we are committed to meeting the costs of an additional 201 officers in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>There are currently 1,044 more officers in our communities than at May 2007. The deployment of these officers is an operational matter for chief constables but it is long-standing practice that all new recruits gain operation policing experience. The majority of these officers will therefore be allocated to frontline duties in our communities.</p>

  <p>The development of the Community Policing Engagement Principles by the Scottish Government, and subsequent work being taken forward locally by police forces and police authorities to develop their own community policing engagement standards, takes full account of the recommendations of the Justice Committee.</p>

  <p>In particular, the committee recognised the importance of ensuring that the Scottish Government met its pledge to deliver 1,000 additional officers over the life of this Parliament. In fact, we passed this milestone in June 2009, nearly two years early.</p>

  <p>We have also given police authorities sufficient resources to maintain police numbers. Funding for police forces is at its highest ever level, &pound;1.115 billion in 2009-10, which will help to ensure that local communities continue to grow safer and stronger.</p>

  <p>Each chief constable, working with local police authorities, is using their policing capacity and additional resources to best deliver the type of frontline policing that their communities want.</p>

  <p>The report of the Justice Committee&rsquo;s <em>Inquiry into Community Policing</em> acknowledged that &quot;a one size fits all model for community policing was not advantageous&quot; and that &quot;forces must be able to have flexibility to tailor their particular definition to their geography and populations.&quot; It is not, therefore, helpful to assess how one force model is or is not applied in another force area.</p>

  <p>Community policing refers to the way in which policing takes place in our communities. This is at the heart of the government&rsquo;s commitment to strengthening operational policing in our communities.</p>

  <p>Community policing directly contributes to the outcomes we seek in relation to people living their lives free of crime and in having strong, resilient and supportive communities where people take responsibility for their own actions and how they affect others.</p>

  <p>For 2010-11, we are faced with a &pound;500 million cut in planned expenditure imposed on Scotland by the UK Government, and accelerated capital expenditure. However, despite this pressure we are providing an increase of 3.1% in police grant, which is &pound;586.7 million in 2010-11 and providing direct funding for the 1,000 extra police officers in our communities.

  <p>Children are already entitled to free prescriptions and so are not affected by our policy to abolish prescription charges.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of children living in a household with an annual income of under &pound;16,000 affected by the extension of free school meals is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The extension to free school meals extends eligibility to households in receipt of both maximum child tax credit and maximum working tax credit and income under &pound;6,420 (as assessed by HMRC in 09-10). Using 2007-08 data provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) it is estimated that there are approximately 6,500 pupils in Glasgow who will benefit from this extended entitlement to free school lunches. It should be stressed that this an estimate and is thus subject to some uncertainty.</p>

  <p>We are unable to answer this question in full because the information requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>We provide funding for a number of projects for more than one year and allocate funding for each of the years of the grant. It is expected that allocations will be used in the financial year for which they are given. Where funds are not fully utilised in that financial year, the funding needs to be adjusted or reprofiled to take account of the underspend.</p>

  <p>The table below lists projects where there was an underspend in 2008-09 and grants were adjusted accordingly.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many, and which, voluntary sector organisations have been allowed to carry grants forward to future financial years or had them reprofiled to that effect by the Equality Unit since 2003 and what the amount was in each case.</p>

  <p>We are unable to answer this question in full because the information requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>We provide funding for a number of projects for more than one year and allocate funding for each of the years of the grant. It is expected that allocations will be used in the financial year for which they are given. Where funds are not fully utilised in that financial year, the funding needs to be adjusted or reprofiled to take account of the underspend.</p>

  <p>The table below lists projects where there was an underspend in 2008-09 and grants were reprofiled accordingly.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has recently issued guidance to the demolition industry or landfill operators to ensure that construction waste containing special or hazardous materials, such as plastic foam insulation containing ozone-depleting substances from steel-clad buildings, is disposed off correctly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) published guidance in July 2008 on the current legal requirements for the disposal of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) material.</p>

  <p>This can be found at :</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/idoc.ashx?docid=bbd86b60-2ff6-47cd-85da-f23fdac3bc2f&amp;version=-1" target="_blank">http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/idoc.ashx?docid=bbd86b60-2ff6-47cd-85da-f23fdac3bc2f&amp;version=-1</a>.</p>

  <p>I understand that SEPA have also written to the National Federation of Demolition Contractors to highlight that this guidance is available and to ensure that it is suitable for the needs of the industry.</p>
