  <p>The Executive has no plans for a national strategy for asthma. I have, however, arranged to meet representatives of the National Asthma Campaign Scotland, the British Lung Foundation and Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland to discuss services for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions.</p>

  <p>Specialist training for nurses in asthma is available in Scotland, for example, through the National Asthma and Respiratory Training Centre which provides courses based at Stirling Management Centre. It is the responsibility of the NHS trusts to identify and meet their respective training needs for staff.</p>

  <p>In answer to this question and also to questions S1W-22824, S1W-22826 and S1W-22827 I would advise that, in response to concerns about access to audiology services and quality of treatment, Good Practice Guidance on Adult Hearing and Fitting Services was issued to NHSScotland in March 2001.</p>

  <p>The Executive has commissioned a wide-ranging review of audiology services, which is due to report in the autumn. The review group report will provide costs and recommendations to NHSScotland on how to address any shortfalls identified in the service provided. The review will also report on progress on implementation of the Good Practice Guide.</p>

  <p>The Good Practice Guidance recommends that all patients should be reviewed at least every three years as part of a process of continuing care. It also recommended that digital aids should be supplied whenever clinical judgement indicates that they would provide benefit to the patient involved that would not be provided by other types of hearing aid.</p>

  <p>Digital hearing aids are included within the wide range of hearing aids available on the central contract for NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS boards and trusts to assess and provide for local needs and to determine staff numbers and the design of teams required for effective delivery of service outcomes. The number of higher specialist training posts available in Scotland is regularly adjusted to meet the projected number of new consultants needed to meet known and anticipated turnover and local service developments.</p>

  <p>To help inform local decisions in this area, the Executive has initiated a wide-ranging review of audiology services, which is expected to report in autumn 2002. The review group will report initial recommendations on staffing, training and skill-mix by the end of March 2002.</p>

  <p>Digital hearing aids provided by NHSScotland are provided free of charge. Each individual case must be a matter for the clinical judgement of the clinicians concerned as is the question of whether a person requiring two digital aids will have both provided at the same time.</p>

  <p>I have looked into this issue further.

  <p>None. There is no specific financial assistance available at present but carrying out conservation management proposals which meet the objectives of a nitrate vulnerable zone is one of the criteria used to prioritise applications to join the Rural Stewardship Scheme. As regards 2002-03, regulations are being prepared to allow for a Capital Grant Scheme to be introduced. The proposed scheme would assist farmers in nitrate vulnerable zones by offering grant at a rate of 40% towards the building or upgrading of storage facilities.</p>

  <p>The Executive monitors local authorities&#146; implementation of mandatory licensing by means of an annual statistical return. Figures from the first returns, covering the period up to 31 March 2001, were published in the <i> Housing Statistical Bulletin</i> last September. This is available on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>In addition, when the order was originally introduced in 2000, the Executive agreed that it would review mandatory licensing after its first year of operation. We have therefore commissioned independent researchers from the University of Glasgow and Heriot-Watt University/Edinburgh College of Art to carry out research on housing in multiple occupancy (HMO) licensing in conjunction with wider research on the private rented sector. As far as possible, we expect that the researchers will seek to establish the impact of HMO licensing to date, but the evidence may be rather limited and inconclusive after only one year of licensing, which has applied only to larger HMOs. Given the fairly extensive nature of this research, it will not be completed until the summer this year.</p>

  <p>The research will include in depth interviews with a sample of landlords, interviews with tenants of HMOs and focus groups with tenants of institutional HMO landlords. Although these interviews and focus groups will have a qualitative focus and will not offer any statistical data, they may highlight whether there are concerns from tenants that mandatory licensing has caused an increase to their rents that is not commensurate with improvements in the property condition. That said, it will be very difficult to identify any direct link between licensing and rent increases, as the level of rent paid for a private tenancy is very much a matter for individual agreement between the landlord and tenant and in general will reflect the market rent for that area.</p>

  <p>Western Isles Islands Council lost &#163;23 million following the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Since there was no immediate prospect of recovering the money and no chance of continuing to be in a position to discharge its statutory obligations without revenue borrowing, the council wrote to the Secretary of State in August 1991 requesting special borrowing consent to replace the &#163;23 million.</p>

  <p>Exceptionally, on account of the scale of the loss in relation to the council&#146;s total financial resources, the Secretary of State granted the council consent to borrow in terms of paragraph 1(2) of schedule 3 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975 to make good the shortfall and maintain its day-to-day cash flow requirements during the remainder of 1991-92. Since the loss was consequent on <i>ultra vires</i> investment activity, the terms of the consent specified that the interest and repayment costs of the borrowing must be met entirely by the council without any grant aid or other financial assistance from the Government.</p>

  <p>The local government revenue grant is already distributed by a needs based system that takes account of the impact of deprivation on the costs of service delivery. There are 13 assessments within the formula - mainly those for social work and education &#150; that include deprivation adjustments. In addition, a number of important social work assessments are influenced by health indicators which reflect deprivation. The Scottish Executive and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities together carried out a thorough review of the account taken of deprivation in the local government finance system last year. As a result we have redistributed an additional &#163;16 million to help councils tackle the effects of deprivation in schools. We have also made available through the Better Neighbourhoods Services Fund an additional &#163;90 million to help improve services within the most deprived neighbourhoods.</p>

  <p>The information on bus and rail travel is not available in the form requested. The <i>Scottish Executive Concessionary Fares Study Report</i> (November 2000) indicated that providing free off-peak bus and rail travel across Scotland for pensioners and disabled people would cost in the region of &#163;96 million per annum. That figure did not take account of potentially very large additional operating costs. The report is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 12085). The information required to estimate the cost of providing free domestic fuel for all Scottish pensioners is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-21002 by Lewis MacDonald on 3 January 2002, whether it has had discussions with Her Majesty&#146;s Government concerning the restriction of rail freight through the Channel Tunnel that began on 7 November 2001 and its impact on Scotland and, if so, on what date these discussions took place, who took part and what the outcome was.</p>

  <p>Rail freight generally is a reserved matter, as are European railway services. The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including freight services through the Channel Tunnel. Contact on this issue has continued throughout the period in question, including most recently a letter earlier this month to George Foulkes, Minister of State at the Scotland Office, in which I reiterated our concern to see this matter resolved.</p>

  <p>It is not usual to provide details of discussions between officials and third parties, as the disclosure of this information would harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion. This policy is supported by the<i> Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</i>, which provides that information should be released except where disclosure would not be in the public interest, as specified in Part II of the Code.</p>

  <p>Stop signs and markings are only considered where visibility at a junction is severely restricted. The Scottish Executive has no plans to erect a sign at this location, as it does not satisfy this requirement. An Accident Investigation and Prevention study carried out at the A1/Torness Power Station junction in 2001 recommended measures to improve safety and these have now been implemented.</p>

  <p>The Operating Company contracts and the M6 DBFO contract each have similar service standards specified for the management and maintenance of the network. The Performance Audit Group and Scott Wilson Scotland Limited monitor the performance of the Operating Companies and Autolink respectively against the requirements of each contract. Each of these supervision commissions stands to be re-awarded later this year and a common competition is now being promoted to appoint a single organisation to oversee all of the contracts.</p>

  <p>There was a treatment failure at North of Scotland Water Authority&#146;s Newmore water treatment works on 5 February. This resulted in an overflow from the wash water recovery tanks into the local watercourse. Wash water is liable to contain aluminium sulphate, which forms part of the treatment process. The water authority immediately took remedial action to prevent any further discharge and reported the incident to the Dingwall office of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). Any follow up actions by SEPA will be a matter for them. However, they have received no reports of any adverse impact arising out of this incident.</p>

  <p>The incident was also notified to the Water Services Unit at the Scottish Executive in accordance with agreed procedures.</p>
