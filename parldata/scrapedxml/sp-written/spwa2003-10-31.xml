  <p>Closing the opportunity gap is part of the Executive&#8217;s overarching approach to social justice. <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> , published in May 2003, set out all the ways in which we will deliver on this, including the ways in which we will continue to work for a safer Scotland, reducing crime, particularly violent and drug-related crime and reducing re-offending.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s <em>Draft Budget 2004-05</em> contained our spending plans for 2003 to 2006. Within the Executive, the Justice Department has responsibility, amongst other things, for the police, criminal justice social work services, criminal justice policy, and administrative support to the Supreme and Sheriff Courts. The budget document set out not only the objectives and targets which have been set for the police and the wider criminal justice system but also how the resources available to the Justice Department have been allocated across these various agencies and services. A copy of the full budget document is available on the Executive&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-29869, which set out details of the three-year spending package of &#163;128.3 million made available to augment the estimated &#163;141 million per annum already spent on tackling drugs. Total expenditure on tackling drug misuse spans a variety of funding streams, administered by a wide range of organisations. The Executive does not hold all of this information centrally.</p>

  <p><a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>..</p>

  <p>However, the Executive has provided direct funding, over the last three years, to the following national organisations working in the drug misuse field, as follows:</p>

  <p>The consequences of the Altmark case for ferry services are far from clear.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what levels of mercury emissions would be defined as being dangerous to health and what the current levels are broken down by local authority area</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-10-31.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa1031.htm#7">

  <p>The risks to public health posed by mercury emissions depend on the resulting public exposures. Because of the diversity of emissions (for example, to water or air) and the complexity of the exposure pathways by which environmental mercury in its various forms can be inhaled or ingested, it is not possible definitively to state a level of mercury emissions that would be defined as being dangerous to health. The Scottish Executive is content that the current legislation for limiting industrial emissions and for the control of contaminants in food and water are sufficient to ensure that the risks for the health of the general public from environmental mercury are properly controlled. The Food Standards Agency has provided additional, related advice for susceptible groups on limitation of consumption of certain foods.</p>

  <p>Information on mercury emission levels broken down by local authority is not held centrally. However, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) hold details of mercury emissions from certain sites regulated as Part A installations under the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000, where these emissions exceed certain reporting thresholds. For mercury, these thresholds are 10 kg/year to air and 1 kg/year to water.</p>

  <p>The following tables provide a summary of the emissions data held by SEPA for 2002. Some types of installations that emit mercury, e.g. crematoria, are not regulated as Part A processes and the table therefore does not include emissions from such sources. Crematoria are, nonetheless, subject to strict regulation as Part B processes under the regulations.</p>

  <p>It should not be inferred that reports above the threshold imply a risk to health, since, as described in the tables, risk is related to degree of exposure rather than the level of emission.</p>

  <p>Petition PE578 invites the Scottish Parliament to consider extending absolute privilege to children and other vulnerable people reporting abuse to an appropriate authority.</p>

  <p>At present, any person, including the alleged victim, who reports such matters to an appropriate authority will benefit from the protection of qualified privilege. Qualified privilege will protect the person from a successful claim of defamation, unless it can be proved that the person making the defamatory statement was motivated by malice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive takes child protection very seriously and is committed to protecting children and young people from all forms of abuse. However, the Executive also has a responsibility to individuals who may be accused falsely and maliciously of abuse. Extending absolute privilege to young people could impact unfairly on the rights of a potentially defamed person. The practical effect of extending absolute privilege would be to offer protection to an individual who maliciously makes false allegations of abuse. The Executive does not consider that it is necessary or desirable to do this to achieve the objective of protecting children and young people.</p>

  <p>The underlying concerns in this area are best addressed through guidelines on the handling of situations in which young people allege abuse, rather than by attempting to reconcile the divergent interests of accused and accuser through amendments to defamation law.</p>

  <p>The local government finance settlement provides resources to fund universal services, which all councils need to provide. Some of these services are more expensive to deliver to deprived populations and the system recognises this. It is up to each council to decide how best to direct its resources according to local needs and priorities. Glasgow City Council will receive an above inflation increase in revenue grant this year (6.6%, or &#163;65 million) and further above inflation increases for the next two years (2004-05 and 2005-06).</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive provides specific resources to directly address deprivation including the &#163;90 million for Better Neighbourhood Services Fund, of which Glasgow received 30%, or &#163;27 million, over 2001-04, and social inclusion partnerships funding of &#163;60 million for 2003-04 (Glasgow will receive 41%, or &#163;25 million).</p>

  <p>The main additional funds specifically allocated to tackle deprivation are social inclusion partnership (SIP) funds and better neighbourhoods services funds (BNSF).</p>

  <p>In relation to the SIP fund, a Monitoring Framework has been in place since 1999, which requires each SIP to submit an annual report. These reports form the basis for appraisal by Communities Scotland, including formal appraisal visits. All SIPs have stated objectives and progress against these forms part of the appraisal process. SIP grant recipients are also required to submit quarterly financial returns.</p>

  <p>The BNSF is monitored through the submission of annual reports by each of the 12 BNSF Pathfinders. These annual reports detail progress against the output and outcome targets detailed in the Local Outcome Agreement (LOA) agreed with the Scottish Executive at the outset of the programme.</p>

  <p>Both BNSF (first year) and SIP annual reports are held by the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. The SIP monitoring framework is available on the Communities Scotland website: <a href="http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk</a>.

  <p>The National Waste Plan target of recycling and composting 25% of municipal solid waste by 2006 applies to Scotland as a whole, rather than individual local authorities. Integrated Waste Management Plans under the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 will lay down specific targets for local authorities.</p>

  <p>However, in the bids to the Strategic Waste Fund which have been funded or which are under assessment, five local authorities estimate that they will achieve 25% recycling and composting of municipal waste by 2006 and 15 (including three in a joint bid) that they will achieve more than 25%. A further eight bids have been received and are to be assessed and four more are expected.</p>

  <p>The five authorities that estimate achieving 25% are Aberdeen City, Glasgow, Argyll and Bute, Fife and Dumfries and Galloway. The 15 authorities that estimate achieving more than 25% are Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dundee, East Ayrshire, Inverclyde, Moray, North Ayrshire, Orkney, Perth and Kinross, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Western Isles and, in a joint bid, Clackmannanshire, Falkirk and Stirling.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The main work Scottish Water carries out on pollution prevention relates to its wastewater treatment services and operationally Scottish Water spent &#163;345 million in 2002-03 on these services. In addition, between 2002 and 2006 a further &#163;800 million is being invested to improve sewage treatment throughout Scotland. This spending ensures that waste on the public network is collected, treated to meet legislative standards, and safely returned to the environment. Scottish Water also carries out work to minimise the risk of pollution from industrial waste, to protect the drinking water supply from pollutants and to work within catchments to ensure drinking water is of high quality, to assist in clean up operations, and on other environmental efforts such as sustainable development. The cost of these pollution prevention activities are contained within various budgets and cannot easily be quantified separately.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to reforming the voting arrangements to increase participation at local government elections, including further investigation of postal and electronic voting, and is holding a joint seminar with the Electoral Commission and COSLA in November to discuss election pilots. The Electoral Commission&#8217;s remit includes raising awareness of electoral and democratic systems in the UK and they have undertaken campaigns targeted specifically at raising awareness amongst 16 to 24-year-olds. We are also providing support for the Scottish Youth Parliament to develop its role in stimulating debate amongst and presenting the views of young people in Scotland.</p>

  <p>MSPs&#8217; staff cannot participate in the occupational pension schemes open to SPCB staff and MSPs. The SPCB has no plans to consider this matter. Payment towards pension provision for MSPs&#8217; staff is, however, made under the members allowance scheme.</p>
