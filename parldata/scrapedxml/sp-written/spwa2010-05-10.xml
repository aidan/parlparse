  <p>During the years where the ring-fenced Languages Fund operated (2001 to 2008), the Scottish Government requested annual returns from local authorities on how they used the funding. In 2007-08 this included information on the numbers of pupils studying modern languages at different stages; the range of languages offered; the numbers of teachers trained in Modern Languages in the Primary School (MLPS), and other information pertaining to specific priority outcomes highlighted for that year e.g. using new technologies, promoting interdisciplinary work and reflecting on the place of modern languages within Curriculum for Excellence as set out in <em>Building the Curriculum 1 - the contribution of the curriculum areas</em> .</p>

  <p>Languages Fund awards were allocated on a broad basis to support learning and teaching of modern languages in schools - local authorities were responsible for deciding precisely how they would spend their allocations. In addition to funding MLPS training, local authorities used their funding for other purposes, for example to pay for foreign language assistants, employ additional teachers or develop language resources at local level.</p>

  <p>We need to focus our resources on key areas of Gaelic development in order to increase the numbers of Gaelic speakers and thus secure the future of the language. The b&ograve;rd has identified action areas which are key areas of Gaelic development and has identified initiatives that can help make the progress we need to make in these areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is in full agreement with the b&ograve;rd&rsquo;s analysis of current needs and we are confident that the focusing of resources is achievable and that the areas selected of early years, school education and adult education have the potential to increase the numbers of speakers.</p>

  <p>The key to meeting the aims of the action plan is ensuring that there are effective means of delivery in the key action areas identified. We will continue to work closely with the b&ograve;rd to put in place and support the necessary initiatives and to achieve the required outcomes.</p>

  <p>In order to achieve the aims set out in the action plan, the b&ograve;rd will direct its funding to the action areas identified in the action plan and has already entered into agreements with Gaelic organisations to begin delivering some of the initiatives identified in the action plan over the course of 2010-11. The b&ograve;rd will also ensure that key areas from the action plan are prioritised in the preparation of Gaelic language plans and in the distribution of support to community groups.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a critical role in this and the b&ograve;rd will seek to support authorities as they implement the commitments in their Gaelic language plans and extend Gaelic education at all levels. Along with expanding Gaelic education, we also recognise the importance of the quality of Gaelic educational provision.</p>

  <p>The aims of B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig&rsquo;s action plan are complementary to the Curriculum for Excellence. The Curriculum for Excellence guidance on Gaelic for both Gaelic learners and Gaelic speakers recognises Gaelic as being a mainstream subject and a valuable resource for young people to learn about culture, identity and language in Scotland. The Curriculum for Excellence guidance will provide an effective and supportive framework to B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig&rsquo;s plans for an increase in Gaelic speakers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish and UK Governments were not represented at the recent European Stakeholders Conference. We are not aware of the Scottish Government being invited to attend the conference. We understand that the UK Minister for Tourism, Margaret Hodge MP, was not able to attend due to the UK General Election. The conference coincided with an informal ministerial meeting on tourism that was hosted by the Spanish Presidency and the UK was represented at that meeting by the British Embassy in Madrid.</p>
