  <p>The Scottish Executive published Guidance for Scottish Public Authorities and Interested Parties on the implementation of the <em>Environmental Information (Scotland) Regulations 2004 </em> in September 2005. Copies can be obtained in the Blackwell&rsquo;s Bookshop, South Bridge, Edinburgh or may be viewed on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The definition of &quot;Scottish public authority&quot; may apply to bodies which are not public bodies but which meet criteria of control and public responsibility, function or service in relation to the environment. The guidance discusses factors relevant to implementation, including functions typically subject to the Regulations and the nature of control.</p>

  <p>The Executive considers many factors which could impact on progress with its Financial Inclusion Action Plan, published in January 2005. We continue to work with a range of partners, including local authorities, banks and other financial institutions, community groups and organisations such as Citizens Advice Scotland to address the various issues involved.</p>

  <p>While the number of charging cash machines is increasing, there is no evidence of a significant decline in the number of free machines, which account for 97% of all such cash withdrawals. The recent report, Out of pocket, from the Citizens Advice network, provides new information on the impact of charging cash machines on vulnerable and low income groups. We will consider the report&rsquo;s recommendations alongside our existing work to increase access to money advice, improve financial capability and encourage access to financial services such as bank accounts.</p>

  <p>Where a death is referred to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, procurators fiscal generally release post mortem reports to the immediate family on request. It is normal practice to suggest that a copy be sent to the family&rsquo;s GP as the language can be quite technical and the contents distressing. A meeting with the pathologist who carried out the post mortem can also be arranged so that he or she can explain fully to the family the results of the post mortem.</p>
