  <p>The Executive&#8217;s extra investment of &#163;21 million over the next three years will target areas of work with young people at risk of misusing drugs and forms part of the &#163;100 million Spending Review package in support of our anti-drugs strategy. &#163;3 million will be deployed on taking forward our agenda on drug education in schools. &#163;18 million will be administered through the Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund on new preventive and treatment services for young people. The allocations to local authorities take account of deprivation and other factors affecting children and young people.

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that pig meat sold in Scotland will have been produced in accordance with the stringent provisions laid down in EU and domestic legislation intended to safeguard human health. These provisions demand veterinary inspection before slaughter to ensure animals are free of disease, as well as subsequent checks on careful handling and inspection of the carcase before it leaves the abattoir. There is, however, a risk at any point in the food chain that meat may become contaminated with harmful organisms. It is very important that there is good hygiene at all stages from the abattoir to the table and proper cooking of meat.</p>

  <p>Her Majesty The Queen has now approved further details of the programme of celebrations during 2002, the focal point of which will be the Jubilee weekend period covering 1 to 4 June. As I announced on 23 November 2000, Monday 3 June will be an additional Bank Holiday for the Golden Jubilee and Tuesday 4 June will be a Bank Holiday, in place of the Spring Bank Holiday that would otherwise fall on 27 May 2002.</p>

  <p>This significant national anniversary of 50 years of The Queen&#8217;s reign will offer people of all ages and cultures and from all walks of life the opportunity for celebration, and the events surrounding the Jubilee will provide numerous opportunities for voluntary and community service. It should be a time for looking forward as well as back &#8211; including at the great changes that have taken place in the nation&#8217;s life during Her Majesty&#8217;s reign.</p>

  <p>The main features of the programme approved so far by Her Majesty have been announced by the Prime Minister today. The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh plan to travel as widely as possible around the United Kingdom during the year 2002, including visits to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These tours around the UK will be focussed on the summer months. The Queen will visit each region, but it will not be possible to visit all cities and counties.</p>

  <p>Details of The Queen&#8217;s visit to Scotland from 23 to 29 May 2002 will be announced later. I have previously announced that Her Majesty will attend the opening of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh on 25 May 2002.</p>

  <p>To help local communities mark and celebrate the Jubilee, Lottery funding will be available from the Arts Councils, the Sports Councils, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Community Fund and the New Opportunities Fund. Voluntary organisations and local groups in the community will be able to apply through the cross-distributor Awards for All for grants of between &#163;500 and &#163;5,000 for Jubilee-related projects. Projects must meet existing criteria and involve one or more of the Lottery good causes of the arts, sport, heritage, charities, health, education or the environment. I hope people in Scotland will take advantage of this opportunity to use Lottery money as a means both of celebrating the Jubilee and providing a lasting legacy for their communities.</p>

  <p>The official Golden Jubilee website is being launched today at:</p>

  <p>http://www.goldenjubilee.gov.uk/.</p>

  <p>It will include details of celebrations and events taking place throughout the United Kingdom during 2002, including The Queen&#8217;s programme of visits. It will also provide members of the public with a central point for enquiries, suggestions and comments on any aspect of the celebrations. By the autumn of this year, it will incorporate, or give access to, other sites containing information about the plans for the Jubilee.</p>

  <p>The Queen has accepted a recommendation for the design for a Golden Jubilee Emblem which members of the public, commercial and public services and manufacturers may use, at no cost, to &quot;brand&quot; events, services, souvenirs and other items connected with the Jubilee. The emblem, together with guidance on its use, can be obtained from the Golden Jubilee website.</p>

  <p>The Queen has made clear that she wishes there to be no undue expenditure from public funds on the celebrations. She has asked that those organisations or individuals wishing to celebrate the Golden Jubilee with some form of donation be encouraged to give either to one or to more of the following five charities of which Her Majesty is Patron: Barnardo&#8217;s, CRUSE bereavement services, I CAN (national education charity for children with speech and language difficulties), the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution, and the Soldiers, Sailors and Air Force Association (SSAFA) &#8211; or to the British Commonwealth Ex-Services League, of which The Duke of Edinburgh is Grand President. Further details will be available on the Golden Jubilee website.</p>

  <p>In 1998 the Scottish Office adopted a target that all of non-specialist paper should contain 75% post-consumer waste by 1 August 1999. Operational problems with some office machinery meant that this target was not met. In 2000-01, 77% of non-specialist paper used by the Scottish Executive was from recycled sources. Future targets on the use of recycled paper are currently being reviewed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive expects all associated departments, Executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies to adopt a Greening Government Policy.</p>

  <p>As the National Audit Report makes clear, the figure of &#163;23.64 million was calculated in 1991 as the maximum toll revenue which Skye Bridge Limited may collect in order to recover their costs of constructing and operating the bridge, after taking account of taxes to be paid by Skye Bridge Limited and the department&#8217;s forecast contribution to the cost of the approach roads. It follows that the percentage requested is zero.</p>
