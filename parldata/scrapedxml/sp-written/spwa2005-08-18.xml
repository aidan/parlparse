  <p>There are no discrete waiting lists for cancer treatment which can take place in either an out-patient or in-patient setting. As soon as a cancer diagnosis is confirmed treatment is discussed and agreed between the consultants concerned and their patient and appropriate arrangements made to commence that treatment as rapidly as possible, dependent on the patient&rsquo;s own circumstances.</p>

  <p>We are seeking to ensure that every child in Scotland has access to services that support them in being physically active. Services should be at a level that children can meet the minimum activity required for health. The Executive has invested &pound;24 million in Active Schools and more than 600 Active School Co-ordinators have already been recruited. The co-ordinators have developed programmes of high-quality opportunities to enable children to participate in regular, frequent, safe and fun activities incorporating physical activity, sport, play and active travel.</p>

  <p>In response to the PE Review Group report published on 14 June 2004, the Minister for Education and Young People outlined a 10-point action plan aimed at providing more time for physical education, more teachers of physical education and more choice in physical education. The Scottish Executive Education Department are working with Learning and Teaching Scotland, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) and other stakeholders to take this forward.</p>

  <p>For children of pre-school age, physical development and movement is one of the five key aspects of <em>A Curriculum Framework for Children 3 to 5. </em>This underpins the provision of pre-school education and providers are required to provide opportunities for physical activity both indoors and outdoors. In addition the <em>National Care Standards for Early Education and Childcare up to the age of 16</em> include a requirement for children and young people to have the opportunity for energetic physical play. Quality in pre-school education and child care is ensured through inspection by HMIE and the Care Commission.</p>

  <p>The subsidy currently being paid to NorthLink reflects an agreed budget covering the period 1 June to 30 November 2005. This budget envisages subsidy of &pound;11.4 million being payable over that period. However, the actual subsidy payable will depend on trading performance over this period and the funding arrangements provide incentives to NorthLink to reduce costs and increase revenues whilst maintaining service standards. A further detailed budget covering the period from 1 December 2005 until the contract handover date will be discussed with NorthLink in due course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has consulted with NHSScotland on adoption and implementation of a Scottish Code of Practice. A partnership approach has been taken through the Human Resources Forum and agreement in principle was secured. Further consultation with human resource managers will take place shortly and the independent sector will be involved in discussions through existing networks. It is expected that a Scottish version of the code will be launched later this year.</p>

  <p>Monitoring arrangements for the Scottish Code are still being finalised and options are being considered including utilising the current arrangements for the rest of the UK. To date no instances have been reported of NHSScotland recruiting outside the principles of the code.</p>

  <p>Ramifications of non-compliance would be that a letter of caution would be issued by me as Minister for Health to the chief executive of the health board in breach of the code.</p>

To help them they are able to draw on a Scottish Needs Assessment Programme on osteoporosis, which was produced by the Public Health Institute of Scotland (PHIS) (now part of NHS Health Scotland), and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) good practice clinical guideline on the management of osteoporosis &ndash; SIGN Guideline 71.</p>

  <p>In 2001, the Chief Medical officer wrote to all NHS boards, Directors of Public Health and former NHS trusts to draw attention to the leaflet <em>Carbon Monoxide: the</em> <em>forgotten killer</em> produced by Scottish Gas. British Gas also directly distributed over 1.4 million leaflets to health centres and Citizens Advice Bureaux across the UK.</p>

  <p>This was part of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s continuing support for the on-going gas safety campaign by Scottish Gas which has since included the issue of an updated version of this leaflet <em>Winter flu(e) alert</em> in 2003 and a campaign in 2004 Vent or Repent aimed specifically at students.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Health and Safety Executive publish several leaflets on gas safety, including carbon monoxide risks. A wide variety of other bodies also work to raise awareness, these include Age Concern, Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the National Caravan Council.</p>

  <p>In March 2005 the Executive launched its Clean Hospitals Campaign, which builds on the extensive work programme of the Ministerial Healthcare Associated Infection Task Force. The focus of the campaign is to prevent and control the spread of HAIs (including VRE) by ensuring that good hygiene procedures are embedded into everyday practice. &pound;15 million has been allocated for this purpose over three years (2005-06 to 2007-08).</p>

  <p>The measures to control VRE are largely those which are being put in place to control other health care associated infections (HAIs), such as standard infection control precautions, isolation of infected patients, routine scrupulous hand hygiene with use of alcohol based handrubs, and prudent prescribing of antibiotics.</p>

  <p>A raft of infection prevention and control standards, professional guidance, education and training programmes and clear staff roles and responsibilities has been produced by the collaborative work programmes of the Ministerial HAI Task Force, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, NHS Education for Scotland, NHS Health Protection Scotland, and others. Work is underway to improve surveillance and monitoring of VRE and other antibiotic resistant infections.

  <p>Data is not available specifically for cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. However, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) produces quarterly figures on the number of reported cases of all glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (which includes vancomycin-resistant strains). These are available on the HPS website ( <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/scieh/PDF/pdf2005/0518.pdf" target="_blank">www.show.scot.nhs.uk/scieh/PDF/pdf2005/0518.pdf</a> ), but not by health board or by type of infection &ndash; at least some of these reports will, for example, relate to symptomless carriage of the infection rather than illness.</p>

  <p>Data collection and reporting on glycopeptide-resistant enterococci is recognised as being incomplete and inconsistent at present, which makes interpretation of reported cases very difficult. Several initiatives are planned to improve this situation.</p>

  <p>Centrally held information on consultants can provide a breakdown by specialty only and does not allow the identification of posts attached to specific diagnoses. Osteoporosis is a condition that may be treated by a number of medical specialties, including; rheumatology, orthopaedics, primary care, community gynaecology, trauma and, endocrinology. However, the majority of patients diagnosed with osteoporosis will be treated in the specialty of orthopaedics. Information on NHS Scotland consultants is published on the Scottish Health Statistics website under Workforce Statistics, <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a> . Section B gives details of the consultant staff in post in NHS Scotland. In particular, table B8 and B9 shows consultants by time, specialty and NHS board. Latest available figures are at 31 March 2005.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS does not have such information. But we know that about three quarters of men and over 80% women entering prison have an addictions problem and about half of prisoners return to prison within two years. The SPS has a comprehensive Addictions Policy which provides the basis for the positive work conducted with those offenders who have an addiction problem. Our joint national Throughcare Addictions Service will provide further support to enable prisoners on release to sustain a drug free lifestyle.</p>
