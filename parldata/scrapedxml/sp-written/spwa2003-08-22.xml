  <p>Up until 31 March 2002:</p>

  <p>The R1: Residential Care Homes Census, run by the Scottish Executive, collected information on the funding of all long-stay residents in residential care homes. Residents were classed as being funded: (1) Wholly or mainly by private means; (2) Wholly or mainly by local authority; (3) Wholly or mainly by DSS &#8211; preserved rights residents, and (4) Wholly or mainly by health board.</p>

  <p>The ISD(S)34 Private Nursing Homes and Hospices Census, run by ISD, Scotland, collected information on the funding of residents in nursing homes. Residents were classed as being funded by: (1) local authority; (2) health board; (3) self-finance; (4) DSS, and (5) Other.</p>

  <p>Results from these two surveys are published in <em>Scottish Community Care Statistics</em> each year.</p>

  <p>In 2003, a new <em>Scottish Care Homes Census</em> was introduced to replace both of the above surveys. Information is collected on the funding of all long-stay residents as follows:</p>

  <p>Financial Support</p>

  <p>Receiving free personal care (Y/N)</p>

  <p>Receiving free nursing care (Y/N)</p>

  <p>Mainly or wholly funded by: (1) local authority; (2) private means; (3) NHS.</p>

  <p>Former preserved rights resident (Y/N)</p>

  <p>The results of the <em>Scottish Care Homes Census</em> will be published at the end of the year.</p>

  <p>Aggregate data is held within ISD Scotland on the funding of places in nursing homes for each year from 1997 to 2002:</p>

  <p>For years ending 31 March 1999 to 31 March 2002, data are available, by means of funding (namely local authority, health board, DSS, self-financed, and other) on the following: numbers of residents at the beginning of the year, numbers of admissions (by type of resident: &quot;long-term&quot;, &quot;respite&quot; and &quot;other short-term&quot;), numbers of discharges, numbers of deaths, numbers of residents at the end of the year (by type of resident: &quot;long-term&quot;, &quot;respite&quot; and &quot;short-term&quot;).</p>

  <p>For years ending 31 March 1997 and 1998, data are available on residents by main source of financial support (local authority, NHS, self-funding (self or relatives), DSS (preserved rights)), and by type of resident (&quot;long-term&quot;, &quot;respite&quot; and &quot;other short-term&quot;).</p>

  <p>In addition, for years ending March 2001 and March 2002 data are available on numbers of self-funding residents by gender, age, and by client group, namely: dementia, learning disabilities, physical disabilities, mental health problems, alcohol-related problems, drug-related problems, other health care needs.</p>

  <p>No data other than those already published are available for years prior to 1997.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the introduction of newborn hearing screening will be taken forward in two steps. The first step which involved the establishment of two screening pathfinder sites in Tayside and Lothian NHS Boards is in place with screening of newborn babies in these areas beginning in January and March 2003 respectively. The second step involving the roll-out of the screening programme in all NHS boards areas across Scotland is expected to be in place by April 2005.</p>

  <p>The National Care Standards address the issue of nutrition in care homes and day centres. The standards say that meals should be varied and nutritious, reflect the service user&#8217;s preferences and any special dietary needs including ethnic, cultural and faith ones. Meals should be well prepared and cooked, and attractively presented. The Care Commission, in carrying out its regulatory function, will expect providers to demonstrate that they are meeting the standards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) aims to provide adequate and nutritious food and offer a balanced diet and is working towards national targets within the framework for promoting health in the SPS.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland has consulted on a new standard for food, fluid and nutritional care in all Scottish Hospitals. It is expected to be published in September.</p>

The timescale for concluding the legal agreement is a matter for the signatories.</p>

  <p>2. Edingham waste transfer station (Dalbeattie): The applicant has appealed to the Scottish ministers against the council&#8217;s refusal of planning permission. A public local inquiry has been held and the decision will be issued in due course.</p>

  <p>3. Locharmoss leachate pipeline (Dumfries): A planning application for a pipeline to remove leachates from the existing landfill site at Locharmoss to the town sewer in Dumfries is currently being processed by the council.</p>

  <p>The Executive remains committed to ensuring that Government in Scotland is efficient and decentralised, as part of the wider vision of more accessible, open and responsive Government. We are committed to examining opportunities as they arise and on a case-by-case basis. In this context, no areas of the country are targeted and equally none are ruled out, nor are there any targets for the number of jobs to be relocated or the areas to which they might go. Greenock and Inverclyde will continue to be considered as potential relocation sites.</p>
