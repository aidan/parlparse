  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Details of scheme usage relate to the contractual arrangements for the 16 local concessionary travel schemes throughout Scotland and are between the local transport authorities and the transport operators. We will gather information on the current local schemes as part of the preparation for the introduction of the new national concessionary fares scheme.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering the claim for additional funding submitted by the Strathclyde Concessionary Travel Scheme Joint Committee. The claim was submitted under arrangements agreed at an earlier stage with COSLA. Those arrangements were agreed because it was recognised that the enhanced funding allocated for concessionary travel under the local government formula grant arrangements might not be sufficient to meet the costs arising following the introduction of free local off-peak travel in some cases.</p>

  <p>We have announced today that the <em>ex-gratia</em> payments will be administered through a UK-wide scheme which will operate on the same basis as the Scottish scheme previously announced. A copy of the full press release has been posted to each MSP and also placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The independent body that will administer the scheme will be set up as soon as possible. Once the necessary mechanisms for accepting claims and making payments are in place, we will announce the final details of the scheme and will work closely with the health service, clinicians and voluntary groups to ensure claimants know what to do in order to make an application.</p>

  <p>No. Funding for local roads and bridges forms part of the general local government finance settlement. As part of this, Stirling Council receives above inflation increases in revenue support of 9.1% this year, and of 6.3% and 4.4% over the next two years. It is entirely a matter for the council to decide its own spending priorities.</p>
