  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>The contract documentation, issued as part of the tendering process, emphasises a range of quality criteria such as enhanced delivery, improved service and better quality workmanship. The successful tenderer must deliver the programme in such a way that these standards are achieved. In addition, a performance-related fee element has been introduced to the contract to incentivise the managing agent to deliver a high standard of service.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the contract specification may result in the removal of subcontractors or termination of the contract.</p>

  <p>The <em>2003-2004 Scottish Household Survey </em> (SHS) report contains the most recent information on access to the internet. However, the survey does not provide data broken down by parliamentary constituency or by social class.</p>

  <p>Instead, helpful information is available in the 2003-04 SHS report which provides data on adult (home or other) access to the internet, broken down by local authority. This breakdown by local authority is available every two years, covering two year periods. The data for 2005-06 will be published in 2007. For reasons of representativeness, data for single years (e.g. 2003, 2005) can only be presented by the five largest local authorities and a further nine local authority groupings. Single year data for 2005 will be published in August.</p>

  <p>An indication of household access is available at national level each quarter, broken down by household type, urban/rural classification and net annual household income (which is used as an indicator for the SHS instead of other socio-economic groupings).</p>

  <p>This and other data on internet access and use from the <em>2003-2004 Scottish Household Survey Report</em> can be found at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/08/03155211/52413#620" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/08/03155211/52413#620</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not consider applications for the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme, although it can provide advice on the requirements. All applications are made to, and considered by, either UKVisas (for those applying from abroad) or the Home Office&rsquo;s Immigration and Nationality Directorate (for those applying within Scotland).

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been working closely with the Home Office to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s needs are reflected in the new points-based managed migration system. The arrangements for the system, which were announced by the then Home Secretary on 7 March 2006, include a reduced qualifying period for some tier 1 (highly-skilled migrants) and for tier 2 migrants (skilled people with a job offer) who wish to settle in Scotland, meaning that people who show a commitment to Scotland will be able to settle permanently much quicker than migrants elsewhere in the UK, and a Scottish shortage occupation list which will allow us to bring in people with skills that are in short supply in Scotland. The existing Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme will continue under the points based system (following an evaluation of how it is working in practice). Overall, the new arrangements are positive and should be hugely beneficial in attracting the best talent to Scotland and keeping it here.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s commitment to tenant participation is set out in the national strategy for tenant participation <em>Partners in Participation </em> published in 1999 (Bib. number 2471). This commitment is underpinned in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 which introduced a legal framework for tenant participation. local authorities and registered social landlords are required to publish a tenant participation strategy and are responsible for implementing the strategy, in consultation with their tenants and Registered Tenant Organisations.</p>

  <p>Development support for tenant participation is provided by Communities Scotland&rsquo;s Tenant Participation Development Team and how well tenant participation is working within individual local authorities and registered social landlords is assessed as part of Communities Scotland&rsquo;s inspection programme.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>As part of the Communities Scotland inspection regime, all local authorities have to demonstrate how well their tenant participation strategy is working and the views of tenants and tenants groups are considered.</p>

  <p>Whilst much has been achieved and good progress has been made by some local authorities recent research and the public reporting of landlords inspections has highlighted that more work needs to be done to improve the level and quality of tenant participation across the country. The Minister for Communities announced in March 2006 that Communities Scotland will be commissioning further research into landlords&rsquo; progress on tenant participation later in the year to help to tailor development support, help to drive up standards in tenant participation and encourage improvements in landlords&rsquo; performance.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>No tenants&rsquo; organisations are directly funded by the Executive or its agencies. A grant scheme is available for registered tenant organisations to fund projects which improve tenant participation in their own areas. Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 local authorities and registered social landlords are legally required to carry out an assessment of the resources required to implement tenant participation, including the funding of tenant organisations. Resources should be negotiated and agreed with tenants and reviewed regularly.</p>

  <p>Rateable values for non-domestic properties are set independently by the Scottish Assessors. Wider issues around local taxation are being considered as part of the independent review of local government finance which is due to report later this year. However, we have put in place a number of measures to assist retailers. In April 2006, we reduced the non-domestic rate poundage gap with England by half and we have committed to close the gap fully from April 2007. We are also legislating for Business Improvement Districts and are currently funding six pilots including a number in town and city centres.</p>

  <p>The Executive has decided to undertake a review of the current arrangements for scrutiny and regulation in Scotland, meaning the inspection, regulation, audit, and procedures for formal external investigation of complaints relating to devolved public services in Scotland. The review will recommend how to ensure that that the scrutiny regime is fit for purpose in a reformed public sector, and it will pave the way for more proportionate and streamlined regulation of public services. The review will be led by an independent Chair, Professor Lorne Crerar and will last approximately 12 months. It will produce an interim report to ministers in early 2007, followed by a final report and recommendations.</p>

  <p>The review will draw on complementary evidence and recommendations from work that is underway by the Scottish Parliament Finance Committee Inquiry into Accountability and Governance.</p>

  <p>The <em>National Audit of Scotland&rsquo;s Sports Facilities summary report </em> is being published by <strong></strong> sportscotland today and can be accessed on <strong></strong> sportscotland&rsquo;s website at: www.sportscotland.org.uk. Copies are also available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39798). The report highlights the significant investment required in Scotland&rsquo;s existing facilities largely as a result of poor design quality and inadequate maintenance regimes. However, it also questions whether we have the right facilities in the right locations to meet the demands of changing sporting trends and demographics. It also highlights the importance of local sports facilities strategies as an essential tool in establishing what facilities will be required to meet future demand.</p>

  <p>We are at a key stage in the development of sport in Scotland. The report provides valuable information and poses important questions. These will be considered more fully in the context of the updated sports strategy at a summit the First Minister is convening in September.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive encourages local authorities to make appropriate arrangements under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the Local Government Act 2003. The provision of library services and subscription to RNIB&rsquo;s Talking Book Service are matters for local authorities.</p>

  <p>We are not currently aware of any conditions within the Scottish Parliament building which would present respiratory problems to those who occupy or visit it. The building management system controls ventilation, temperature and fresh air input, based on the automatic monitoring of internal conditions. In addition, any work activities which may release fumes or dust have strict control measures applied at source and timed to avoid affecting occupants or visitors.</p>
