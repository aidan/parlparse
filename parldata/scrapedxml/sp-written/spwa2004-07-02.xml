<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-07-02.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0702.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>Part 5 of the act, which came into force on 1 July 2002, provides important safeguards for adults with incapacity who need medical treatment. At the same time, it brings helpful clarity to a hitherto uncertain area of law for health care professionals who give such treatment.</p>

  <p>Following concerns about some of the procedures introduced by part 5 and the accompanying Code of Practice, the Executive set a review in train last year. This included a written consultation (an analysis of which is in The Scottish Parliament Reference Centre, Bib. number 31350), qualitative research (placed today in The Scottish Parliament Reference Centre, under Bib. number 32709) and discussions with key stakeholders. In the light of these processes, and bearing in mind the relatively short period part 5 has been in force, the Executive proposes two changes to part 5 as follows:</p>

  <p>- to allow health care professionals other than registered medical practitioners to issue certificates of incapacity under section 47, provided they have the necessary expertise to assess capacity.</p>

  <p>- to allow the maximum duration of section 47 certificates to be extended from one to three years, in certain circumstances, for example where the adult has a degenerative or progressive illness.</p>

  <p>These changes to the act will be made when a suitable legislative vehicle becomes available.</p>

  <p>A revision of the Code of Practice has also been set in train to bring greater clarity to current procedures and, within the framework of the act, to facilitate the operation of Part 5. The Section 47 certificate is likewise being adjusted in this sense.</p>

  <p>Enhanced training and education for health care professionals and other stakeholders in respect of part 5 of the act are also being considered.</p>

  <p>Our aim in this review has been to find ways to help improve the operation of this important legislation, while at the same time maintaining its principles and ensuring the continuing benefits and protection it provides for this vulnerable group of adults.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes the measures proposed will serve to this end.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised me that a comprehensive source of information on EU member states enforcement systems is not available. However, I am advised that in contrast to the system in Great Britain where enforcement for animal feed law is enforced by some 200 local authorities, most member states appear to have a central government body responsible for carrying out enforcement checks often with a regional/local structure. In most other cases enforcement is carried out by a number of public bodies, working together in close union.</p>

  <p>The Agricultural Industries Confederation's (AIC) <em>Code of Practice for the Manufacture of Safe Compound Animal Feedingstuffs</em> is a voluntary code. The question of whether the code encourages the importation of cheaper animal feed from other European Union countries is a matter for the AIC and those who adopt the code.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency informs me that it is not aware of any concerns in respect of other European Union member states' enforcement of animal feed legislation. The EU Commission Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) is responsible for ensuring that Community legislation on food safety, animal health, plant health and animal welfare is properly implemented and enforced across all member states. Any problems in implementation of animal feed legislation across the Community would be highlighted by their inspection programme.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency informs me that over the past five years, there have been four recorded cases of contaminated animal feed in Scotland. There were two cases in 2002 and two in 2003. These cases include contaminated feed entering Scotland from outside the EU, feed entering from other member states and a case of feed produced in Scotland which was subsequently discovered to have become contaminated.</p>

This meets the First Minister's commitment on 28 May 2003 to consult. The consultation period will run until 30 September 2004. The consultation paper and the draft bill will be available on the Scottish Executive website after 2 July 2004 at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has carried out investigations into the administration of the Tariff Rebate Subsidy (TRS) scheme for bulk freight, following concerns that one or more of the operators in receipt of support under the scheme may not have been complying with its terms and conditions. This investigation started in December 2003 and the processing of claims was suspended pending completion of the investigation, since it would clearly have been inappropriate to continue to make payments in such circumstances.</p>

  <p>The investigation concluded that the scheme was in some cases not being operated as intended. There was however no evidence to suggest that any claims were being made fraudulently.</p>

  <p>Following the investigation we have reviewed the scheme and have concluded that it has not been demonstrably achieving its central objective of maintaining and improving sea transport services serving the Highlands and Islands. We have noted that the great majority of bulk freight transported by sea in the Highlands and Islands does not benefit from bulk freight TRS. Currently only three companies are eligible to claim TRS. Independent consultants commissioned by the Executive some time ago to evaluate the scheme reported that:</p>

  <p>the overall contribution of TRS to economic development in the relevant areas has been very limited;</p>

  <p>it has made only a limited contribution to sustaining bulk shipping capacity in the Highlands and Islands;</p>

  <p>the absolute level of TRS is insignificant compared with the companies' costs and turnover, and</p>

  <p>any reduction in consumer prices (for bulk freight products) will have been slight and it is not clear that TRS support has fed through to reduced prices for the end consumers.</p>

  <p>For all these reasons, we have decided that the bulk freight TRS scheme should remain in suspension. We have paid all outstanding claims to 31 March 2004 but have no plans, at present, to make further funding available under the scheme. The three companies that have been entitled to claim have been advised accordingly.</p>

  <p>We remain very keen to encourage greater use of shipping for freight. In this regard we will be introducing later this year the new Waterborne Freight Grant Scheme to grant aid the operating costs of new shipping routes which remove lorries from roads. Details of the scheme are still being finalised.</p>

  <p>There are a small number of mixed-sex wards which do not completely comply with guidelines on mixed sex accommodation at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Stobhill Hospital and the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. The Royal Edinburgh Hospital provides psychiatric care. Where a ward in any hospital remains mixed-sex, interim arrangements must be agreed with the local health council to ensure the privacy and dignity of patients at all times.</p>

  <p>A programme of work at Stobhill Hospital should end mixed sex wards by September, while work at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary will be completed by December.</p>

  <p>Provision of a new building will end mixed sex wards at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. However, proposals have been developed and agreed with patient groups and the local health council which will safeguard the dignity and privacy of patients in the current accommodation and this work will be completed by December.</p>

  <p>The position taken by the prosecutor in relation to any application for bail is entirely a matter for the Crown Office which represents the requesting state in the courts. In every case when bail was applied for it was opposed mainly because of the risk of the individual absconding.</p>

  <p>Between 1 January 2004 and 31 May 2004, 86.2% of the suppliers' invoices processed by the Scottish Executive's Accounting System were paid within 30 days of the date of receipt, or within the terms of specific contracts. This compares with 74.8% for the same period in 2003, and 74.4% for this period in 2002, when teething problems with a new computerised financial system led to a drop in levels of performance.</p>

  <p>The Executive is taking a range of steps to improve performance. For example, the roll out of the EaseBuy electronic procurement system will ensure that these payments are made consistently and promptly. For low value ad hoc purchases the Government procurement card operates like a credit card, ensuring that suppliers get paid within a few days by the credit card company, while the Scottish Executive gets a monthly consolidated invoice from the card company. For other items, we have analysed in which parts of the Executive late payments arise, and are tackling those problems.</p>
