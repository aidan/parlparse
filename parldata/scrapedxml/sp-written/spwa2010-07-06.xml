  <p><strong>Keith Brown: T</strong>he governing bodies of both colleges and universities already include members who are elected by staff.</p>

  <p>My officials are currently discussing with the STUC and the organisation Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges a range of issues relating to the composition of college boards of management. It is too early to say if this will result in agreed recommendations on extending the current number of elected places.</p>

  <p>Universities, as autonomous bodies, are responsible for seeking to make changes to their own governance arrangements and ministers have no powers to direct them. A governance code of practice and general principles in the higher education sector is provided by the Committee of University Chairs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive to what appointments to senior posts in colleges and universities the Nolan principles apply</p>

  <p>The appointment of staff at all levels is a matter for individual colleges and universities. The importance of Nolan principles is emphasised in both the guide for college board members produced by the organisation Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges, and in the guide for members of higher education governing bodies produced by the Committee of University Chairs.</p>

  <p>The financial memorandum agreed between the Scottish Funding Council and institutions it funds provides that &quot;The Council must be able to rely on the whole system of governance, management and conduct of the institution to safeguard all funds of the institution deriving from Scottish Ministers and to achieve the purposes for which those funds are provided. As a recipient of public funds, the governing body of the institution will strive to achieve at all times good practice in the governance, management and conduct of the institution.&quot;</p>
