  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) of the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care with the NHS in Scotland. The CSO portfolio includes more than 57 cancer-related projects. Although none of these deals specifically with mesothelioma, many of the findings will be relevant to all tumour types.</p>

  <p>The CSO also funds the indirect costs of cancer research. In 2001-02, approximately &#163;7.7 million of the Research and Development Support Fund allocated to the NHS in Scotland for research was used in support of cancer studies &ndash; again with findings potentially relevant to all tumour types. The CSO always welcomes quality applications for consideration through their peer review and committee processes.</p>

  <p>The treatment of patients with mesothelioma is a matter for specialists experienced in the management of cancer. For rare cancers such as mesothelioma, treatment may be arranged on a UK rather than national (Scottish) basis. Clinicians are responsible for making appropriate decisions on treatment in individual cases, in consultation with their patient.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland, an agency within the Scottish Executive, can provide grants for the repair of properties within conservation areas that have been classified as outstanding for the purposes of grant. This provision includes grants for the repair, renewal or re-instatement of traditional timber sash and case windows, normally as part of a comprehensive scheme of repair. All applications are assessed on the basis of a need for grant and rates of grant vary according to personal circumstances. Local authorities have similar powers to award repair grants and can also set up joint-funded Town Schemes with Historic Scotland to assist owners with grants of 50% (25% each from the local authority and Historic Scotland). Town Schemes can address discrete items of repair such as windows.</p>

  <p>Government advice on window replacement is given in the <i>Memorandum of Guidance on Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas</i> . The latest edition of the memorandum was published by Historic Scotland in 1998 and is the document to which all planning authorities are directed by Scottish Office Development Department Circular No.13/1998 in their consideration of conservation and listed building consent matters.</p>

  <p>Although principally aimed at planning authority staff, the guidelines about windows set out within it are of use also to applicants and their agents, and to manufacturers of replacement windows. The first point of enquiry about replacement windows should always be the local planning authority, which will offer advice on the basis of both local plan policies and Government guidance within the memorandum.</p>

  <p>: On-farm quality assurance schemes are industry-led and the Scottish Executive has no direct control over standards and certification procedures. There are no specific provisions to protect farmers who are in quality assurance schemes which would wholly protect them against animal contamination, wild or domestic.

  <p>A very small proportion of patients may have had more than one episode of detention in each year.</p>

  <p>These figures have been derived from the Mental Welfare Commission&rsquo;s patient record&rsquo;s system.

  <p>It is the responsibility of the relevant local authority to consider what steps should be taken to meet any public transport requirements it considers appropriate and which would not otherwise be met. I understand that City of Edinburgh Council have put in place a range of contingency measures in the event a bus strike, and I welcome this approach. In addition, I understand that the Traffic Commissioner for Scotland has indicated that he will accept emergency local bus registrations if other bus or coach companies wish to run replacement services for the duration of any strike action.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is a member of the steering group which has been established to ensure a co-ordinated approach to delivering a vision for Waverley. Other members of the group are the Strategic Rail Authority (which chairs the steering group), Railtrack (the owners of Waverley Station) and the City of Edinburgh Council (as the local planning authority). Before any detail design work can begin, considerable investigative and preparatory work is required. The Executive has made up to &#163;1 million available to enable that preparatory work to begin. This work will help inform the final design of the station and determine the necessary funding required to develop it. Until this work is completed, it is too early to determine responsibility for project management, construction and where the necessary funding for the project will be obtained.</p>

  <p>The current Scottish passenger rail franchise term ends in March 2004. Scottish ministers gave Directions and Guidance (D&amp;G) for the next franchise to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) on 28 June 2002. The D&amp;G instructed the SRA that the franchise should enable the operator&rsquo;s performance to be monitored and assessed over time and be capable of termination if performance were consistently deemed to be unacceptable. A copy of the D&amp;G is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 22122).</p>

  <p>Monitoring of performance will be a matter for the SRA, and a report on the operator&rsquo;s performance will be published in the SRA&rsquo;s Annual Report.</p>
