  <p>The next summit level meeting of the British-Irish Council will be hosted by Jersey in April 2002, and will focus on the issue of Knowledge Economy. Following that, we look forward to hosting a summit in Scotland in autumn 2002 on the subject of social inclusion, in conjunction with our colleagues in the National Assembly for Wales</p>

  <p>The British-Irish Council held its second summit meeting in Dublin on 30 November. The main focus of that meeting was the issue of drugs misuse, and how co-operation in this area might be developed within the British-Irish Council. The meeting was a useful and constructive one. It is clear that the other council members share the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to protecting young people from the problems of drugs in our communities. There will be reports to future summits on the practical progress being made by members on tackling drugs matters together.</p>

  <p>We announced on 23 October details of two new vessels, the first for Mallaig-Armadale and the second for the Sound of Harris service between Leverburgh and Berneray.

  <p>The Executive has a range of activities, over and above local initiatives by its partners, to address social injustice wherever it occurs in Scotland. In Ayrshire there are four Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIP), with the East Ayrshire Coalfields Area SIP in particular covering rural parts of the area. The SIP in Girvan also does outreach work to its surrounding rural communities and in North Ayrshire the SIP is moving on to take a more strategic look at exclusion across the area. Each partnership receives &#163;60,000 from the Executive specifically for supporting community involvement and to build capacity and confidence in these excluded communities. We also have Kickstart, a programme to enhance the uptake of funding in our disadvantaged areas, by helping communities to help themselves.</p>

  <p>In addition, we have provided the Coalfields Regeneration Trust with &#163;4.5 million over the last three years to support local activities in local coalfield communities, including those in Ayrshire. Communities Scotland is promoting and supporting a wider role for Registered Social Landlords, both in urban and in rural areas, through the provision of funding, information, advice and guidance.</p>

  <p>Scottish Rural Partnership Fund (SRPF), which is operated by an annual biding process, offers grant aid to rural communities to build community capacity and help communities to find local solutions to local problems. The closing date for applications to the 2002-03 round was 12 October 2001 and the bids received are currently being assessed. These include seven bids from the North, South and East Ayrshire areas combined. An announcement regarding successful projects will be made early in the New Year.</p>

  <p>Scottish NHS primary care trusts are not responsible for commissioning health services, and consequently we have no such plans. However, we have announced a number of waiting times targets which will help to reduce waiting in the NHS, and this remains our top priority. We are establishing a national waiting times unit to ensure that available capacity in the NHS in Scotland and spare capacity in the independent health care sector are used to best effect to reduce waiting for NHS patients. We have no immediate plans to purchase health care capacity outside Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what legislation, regulations and guidance relating to environmental protection and public safety a local authority must take into account when considering a planning application.</p>

  <p>The planning system does not seek to duplicate controls in other legislation. A grant of planning permission does not remove the need for a developer to comply with other legislation dealing with environmental protection or public safety.</p>

  <p>General advice on the role of the planning system in controlling pollution and its relationship with a number of environmental control regimes is given in Planning Advice Note 51 - <i>Planning and Environmental Protection</i>. It includes advice on planning proposals which raise environmental protection issues and the considerations which a planning authority might regard as material.</p>

  <p>A number of requirements are placed on planning authorities in relation to these matters including:</p>

  <p>The Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) (Scotland) Order 1992 governs the processing of applications, including the bodies which should be consulted by the planning authority in particular circumstances. These bodies include Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA);</p>

  <p>the Environmental Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1999. Planning authorities must also consider whether an environmental impact assessment may be required. The Scottish Executive Development Department&rsquo;s Circular 15 of 1999 contains guidance on the legislation and Planning Advice Note (PAN) 58 contains advice on best practice in this regard;</p>

  <p>the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 also place obligations on planning authorities when considering proposals affecting European sites, as defined in the regulations. The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department has also published guidance in this regard;</p>

  <p>directions issued under planning legislation also require planning authorities to consult Scottish Natural Heritage regarding certain development in National Scenic Areas (Development Department Circular 9/1987) and aerodrome interests if developments are proposed in public safety zones or safeguarded areas (Development Department Circular 16/1982). These directions contain notification requirements so that in specified circumstances the planning applications may require to be notified to the Scottish ministers should the planning authority wish to grant planning permission;</p>

  <p>general notification directions (Development Department Circular 4/1997 as amended refers) set out the circumstances in which applications must be notified to the Scottish ministers. These directions include notification requirements in certain circumstances where SNH, SEPA or HSE have objected to a proposal. Notification allows the Scottish ministers to consider whether or not a planning application requires to be called in for their determination.</p>

  <p>The Executive produces National Planning Policy Guidelines (NPPG) on a variety of topics. Such guidance may constitute a material planning consideration when determining a planning application. For example, the NPPGs on Flooding and on Opencast Coal and Related Minerals contain information on environmental impact and minimising impacts on the public. Planning Advice Notes also provide advice on best practice and further information on a number of subject areas. Lists of NPPGs and PANs, and the text of many of these documents are available at www.scotland.gov.uk/planning.</p>

  <p>The National Planning Policy Guidelines, Planning Advice Notes and circulars (including the guidance on the Conservation (Natural Habitats etc.) Regulations 1994) referred to in this answer can be obtained from the Executive.</p>

  <p>Producer responsibility for packaging is already in place. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 require most manufacturers and users of packaging materials and products to ensure the recovery of 56% and recycling of 18% of the packaging materials which they handle. It is proposed to increase these targets to 61% and 20%, respectively, from 2002. There are no plans to extend producer responsibility to the disposal of the balance of packaging waste not recovered, although all holders of waste have a duty of care to ensure it is disposed of properly.</p>
