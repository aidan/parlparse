  <p>Part 7 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 (the 2004 Act) provides that a local authority can issue an Antisocial Behaviour Notice (ABN) on the landlord of a relevant house where the tenant or occupant is engaging in antisocial behaviour. We consider that a house occupied under a holiday let would be included in the definition of a &quot;relevant house&quot; for the purposes of the 2004 act.</p>

  <p>Local authority officials, at a meeting of the Scottish Houses in Multiple Occupation Networking Group and in direct contact, have informed the Scottish Government of concerns, based on their experience, that some landlords may be evading the requirements for licensing of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) by claiming that properties are let on a short-term basis and that tenants have principal residences elsewhere. This was identified as a particular concern in relation to the accommodation of migrant workers.</p>

  <p>As previously stated, we will be considering the options for implementing new HMO provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 later this year. The issue of short-term lets, and what types of accommodation require to be licensed under those provisions, will be part of our discussions with stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is providing resources of &pound;3.1 million to NHS Western Isles to clear a deficit built up in previous years. NHS Western Isles has balanced its books over the past two years (2007-08 and 2008-09) and the Scottish Government has now agreed a forward financial plan.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue its work to assist the board, which is now also supported by its partner board, NHS Highland, in areas including human resources, governance and planning. Additional annual funding of &pound;0.25 million has also been provided by the Scottish Government to support this collaborative working partnership.</p>

  <p>This brokerage agreement is testimony to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to patients in the Western Isles. NHS Western Isles has already come a long way to turn around its financial situation and we want to give the board a fresh start so that it can lay strong foundations for the future. This support is recognition of the progress that has been made to date. The repayment of brokerage means the board takes responsibility for the past, but in a manageable way, ensuring patient services will not be affected. The board is expected to make repayments over a period of six financial years commencing 2012-13.</p>
