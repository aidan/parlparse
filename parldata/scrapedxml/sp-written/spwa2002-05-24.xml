  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action has been taken following the publication of <i>Task Force on E.coli O157: Final Report</i> in 2001.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-05-24.S1W-26218.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0524.htm#3">

  <p>The Task Force on <i>E.coli</i> O157 was intended to address many diverse issues underpinning the history of <i>E.coli</i> O157 infection in Scotland in an open, innovative and holistic way. The substantive report which emerged from that process in 2001 was cogent and compelling. It provides a fine example of the value which can emerge from the inclusive, cross-cutting and action oriented ethos which is the foundation for all the work of the Scottish Executive. The Executive and the Food Standards Agency (Scotland) are grateful to the chairman and members of the task force, for producing an excellent report and a comprehensive range of related recommendations.</p>

  <p>Since July 2001, the Scottish Executive and the Food Standards Agency (Scotland) have been working, with others, including UK Government Departments and NHSScotland, to consider, cost and implement the detailed recommendations made by the task force. We have already achieved a great deal, for example:</p>

  <p>the Food Standards Agency has initiated a &#163;20 million &quot;Food Hygiene&quot; awareness and publicity campaign which will incorporate food safety advice on <i>E.coli</i> O157;</p>

  <p>the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) has been provided with appropriate additional funding from 2001-02, in order to initiate an enhanced programme of infection and disease surveillance;</p>

  <p>formal guidance has been issued to the National Reference Laboratory (SERL) restating protocols consistent with task force recommendations;</p>

  <p>guidance has been issued to water authorities on the need to give particular attention to testing water from high-risk catchment areas for coliforms and <i>E.coli</i> O157;</p>

  <p><i>Private Water Supply Regulation: a consultation</i> was issued in November 2001;</p>

  <p><i>Guidance on Recreational Use of Animal Pasture</i>, was distributed to relevant organisations in March 2002, and</p>

  <p>the Cairns Smith Group has taken account of task force recommendations relevant to outbreak management and published revised guidance in April 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the Food Standards Agency (Scotland) will build on those achievements, given the continuing threat posed by <i>E.coli</i> O157 and the many diverse actions proposed by the task force.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the Food Standards Agency (Scotland) have today published a joint response to the report of the Task Force on <i>E.coli</i> O157. Copies have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. The report is also available on both the Scottish Executive and Food Standards Agency (Scotland) website.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what financial impact the increase in landfill tax announced in the UK Budget 2002 will have on each local authority and what additional financial resources will be allocated to each local authority specifically to compensate for the increase.</p>

  <p>The intention to increase the rate of landfill tax for active waste from &#163;12 to &#163;13 per tonne in April 2002 had previously been announced in the Government&#146;s 1999 Budget. The tax is intended to be an incentive for all those disposing of waste, including local authorities, to deal with it in more sustainable ways. The financial impact of the tax will depend on decisions made by local authorities about the disposal of waste.</p>

  <p>The second round of the Modernising Government Fund has up to &#163;30 million at its disposal, an increase on the first-round fund and double the amount that was originally announced. It is committed to promoting a citizen-focused approach to modernising the delivery of public services in Scotland across several key areas.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce today that I have been able to provide funding of more than &#163;16 million to support seven key public sector partnership projects, including &#163;5.4 million to develop services to young people and a young persons smartcard, &#163;4.7 million to support local authorities in the development of citizen-focused information systems, &#163;1.4 million to support the NHS and local authorities to develop common social work data standards and single shared assessments and &#163;4.9 million to help establish a national land and property database for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Many other individual bids to the fund pursue common themes, including education services, transport services and electronic health care services. I propose to use the balance of the &#163;30 million fund to encourage a number of these bidders to form further partnerships to pursue these themes and promote them through strategic public sector projects across Scotland.</p>

  <p>One of the key objectives of the framework document is to assist businesses to identify actions that they can take, in order to provide a better standard of service to their customers. An example of improved service is the readily available provision of information about matters such as local public transport options.</p>
