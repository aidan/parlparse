  <p>There is no specialist NHS clinical laboratory facility in Scotland for anthrax testing. Any NHS bacteriology laboratory could potentially make a provisional diagnosis of anthrax where this was not clinically suspected, but confirmation of the diagnosis or handling of specimens where anthrax is clinically suspected is carried out by arrangement with the Category 4 facilities at Porton Down.</p>

  <p>Under existing law, a person may prune back branches of a landowner&rsquo;s hedge or vegetation overhanging his or her property but may not enter a landowner&rsquo;s property without the consent of the owner. While we support in principle the need for a statutory remedy of last resort for people unable to resolve disputes over high hedges, due to competing legislative priorities we are not in a position to introduce legislation during this parliamentary term. However, we have previously indicated our support in principle for the member&rsquo;s bill currently being progressed by Scott Barrie MSP and he will be carrying out his high hedges consultation soon.</p>

  <p>No. We are content that an application for financial settlement made in terms of sections 9(1)(b) and 9(1)(c) of the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985 would be capable of attracting an award that reflects the Law Lords judgement in this case. Section 9(1)(b) allows one of the parties to a divorce to claim a net economic disadvantage suffered in the interests of the other party or of the family. Where this is proved, it is open to the courts to make a fixed sum compensatory award payable in lump sums or instalments. There is no three year or other limit on the duration of the period over which the instalments can be ordered. Section 9(1)(c) allows a claim to be made for the equal sharing of the economic burden of caring, after divorce, for a child of the marriage under the age of 16.</p>

  <p>This must be considered in the context of an increasing workforce. We remain on track to achieve and surpass the 2002 Partnership Agreement target of attracting 12,000 nurses and midwives into NHSScotland by 2007. Between September 2002 and September 2005 we recruited 11,504 nurses and midwives.</p>

  <p>The total number of nurses and midwives employed within NHSScotland is at an all time high. Nursing and midwifery staff numbers have risen to over 65,000 (headcount), including almost 47,000 registered nurses (head count). In addition, we have record numbers of nursing and midwifery students in training (9,726).</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. Under the Race Relations Amendment (Act) 2000, local authorities must have a Race Equality Policy in place. Local authorities must monitor and assess the impact of their policies including the Race Equality Policy on minority ethnic groups. Recording of racist incidents is one method of monitoring the impact of the Race Equality Policy. The majority of authorities instruct their schools to collect these statistics and provide them to the authority. They can be obtained direct from local authorities.</p>

  <p>We have asked groups of local authorities to submit Strategic Outline Cases outlining the infrastructure they think is required to meet the targets in the Landfill Directive on diverting biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. The Strategic Outline Cases include proposals for energy from waste. We are currently assessing these Cases. A copy of the Strategic Outline Cases, with certain commercial in confidence information removed, can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://search.scotland.gov.uk/search/pages/search/basic.asp?QuerySubmit=true&amp;Paging=true&amp;Page=1&amp;QueryText=strategic+outline+case" target="_blank">http://search.scotland.gov.uk/search/pages/search/basic.asp?QuerySubmit=true&amp;Paging=true&amp;Page=1&amp;QueryText=strategic+outline+case</a>.</p>

  <p>Two groups of local authorities, North and South Lanarkshire and the Edinburgh, Lothians and the Scottish Borders are in the process of preparing more detailed Outline Business Cases on proposals to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.</p>

  <p>It is, of course, always open to developers to put forward proposals for energy from waste plants and other waste infrastructure.</p>
