  <p>The Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme and the Scottish Rural Development Plan include measures to support the diversification of agriculture, including the growing of novel crops. These proposals are currently under negotiation with the European Commission, and an announcement will be made when new schemes are open for applications.</p>

  <p>Currently, however, producers are permitted to set aside up to 100% of the land on which they are claiming aid under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) when all that land is used for the production of multi-annual biomass crops, e.g. short rotation coppice. AAPS aid is paid at the same rate as that for cereal crops. In addition, the Forestry Commission provides an establishment grant for short rotation coppice (SRC) both on land set aside as part of AAPS and on other agricultural land.</p>

  <p>The decision on divulging patient information needs to be taken by those involved in the care of the individual. The Code of Practice on the Confidentiality of Personal Health Information makes clear that personal health information should not be divulged without the explicit consent of the patient. There are exceptions to this general principle. These include circumstances where there is a "need to know" so that effective treatment and care can be provided; where it is in the wider public interest to disclose or where the information is necessary to prevent serious injury or damage to the health of a third party. That judgement is a matter for clinical decision.</p>

  <p>All of the principles set down in the Code of Practice have to be followed by all NHS staff and the staff of the Scottish Ambulance Service with their vital contribution to front-line patient care are no different in that respect.</p>

  <p>Ministers and officials in the Executive meet with the scientific community on a regular basis to discuss issues of interest including commercialisation. Along with officials from the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning and Rural Affairs Departments, I recently visited Glasgow University and the Roslin and Moredun Institutes where the discussions included the issue of commercialisation.</p>

  <p>The scientific community is also represented among the membership of the Knowledge Economy Taskforce, chaired by myself and which is considering barriers to commercialisation as part of its wider remit.</p>

  <p>Officials met recently with the Research Advisory Committee of the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals (COSHEP) and the Scottish Agricultural and Biological Research Institutes (SABRIs).

  <p>Along with COSHEP and SHEFC, the Executive is a founding member of Technology Ventures Scotland which seeks to promote and accelerate the commercialisation of science and technology in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The European Communities Directive 97/11/EC made new requirements for the procedures in making Environmental Impact Assessments in relation to private and public works. These changes build on the requirements already in place in the substantive Environmental Impact Assessment Directive made in 1985 (85/337/EEC), which has been incorporated into UK legislation for some years.</p>

  <p>The changes in procedure for harbour works projects requiring Environmental Impact Assessments under the Directive are being introduced to GB legislation by the Harbour Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/3445). These Regulations have been made on a GB-wide basis under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 to implement Community obligations. The Regulations (SI 1999/3445) were made on 21 December and came into force on 1 February.</p>

  <p>I have written to the Chairman of the Transport and Environment Committee giving further details of the technical changes and effect of the Regulations in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Grampian Health Board and Grampian University Hospitals NHS Trust have taken steps to ensure that hearing aids will continue to be issued during the current financial year.</p>

  <p>These steps did not require the Scottish Executive to commit extra resources to the Trust. Nor should they have. There has been record investment in the Health Service in Scotland this year. From &pound;300 million extra allocated to health in Scotland, each health board received an increase substantially above inflation to meet the health care needs of their resident populations.</p>

  <p>It is for health boards and NHS Trusts to determine local priorities for expenditure of the monies allocated to them &#8211; but the Scottish Executive expects them to ensure that essential services are maintained. I am therefore pleased that Grampian Health Board and Grampian University Hospitals Trust have acted to reinstate the hearing aid service in full.</p>

  <p>Health spending per head of population in Scotland is significantly higher than in England. Nevertheless, as pledged in the <i>Programme for Government</i> , the Scottish Executive will substantially increase NHS spending in real terms over the coming years. The actual increases will be determined in the context of the 2000 Spending Review.</p>

  <p>The 1998 recorded crime figures compiled by the Scottish Executive Justice Department reveal that the police recorded eight occasions on which they reported to the Procurator Fiscal an alleged breach of a civil non-harassment order for consideration of criminal proceedings. However, an examination of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service office system has not revealed any cases of breach of a civil non-harassment order. Of the eight cases recorded by the police to date one has been identified. It was in fact reported by the police as a breach of the peace, as opposed to a breach of an order, and no criminal proceedings were taken.</p>

  <p>Efforts are ongoing to identify the remaining cases. I will write to the Member as soon as the information is to hand.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The figures in the table are gross expenditure.</p>

  <p>2. The 1996-97 information is taken from authorities HSG1A return, the 1997-98 from the HSG1 and the 1999-2000 from the HRA estimate return.</p>

  <p>3. Housing Revenue Account expenditure is almost entirely self-financed through rental income (including housing benefit).</p>

  <p>It should be noted, however, that the figures in the tables are not directly comparable year-on-year, as the figures for earlier years are actual expenditure, whereas the figures for the later years are still estimates at this stage.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the devolution settlement for railways announced on 31 March 1998, now incorporated in the UK Transport Bill introduced on 1 December 1999, the Scottish Ministers will be able to issue directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority for the franchise providing passenger rail services which begin and end in Scotland. They will reflect priorities for the provision of passenger rail services throughout Scotland. It would then be for the train operating company, in conjunction with Railtrack, to ensure the availability of the necessary infrastructure to meet the terms of the franchise.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ministers took the view that the proposals, which were in accord with the statutory development plan, did not merit call-in.</p>

  <p>In intimating this decision to Midlothian Council, it was emphasised that the Scottish Ministers were aware that the Council is committed to pursuing other initiatives as part of a package of measures to improve transportation within and outwith Midlothian. The Scottish Ministers encouraged the Council to pursue these initiatives with a view to delivering a comprehensive and sustainable package of transport improvements as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>The main activities remaining are minor adjustments to the design to take account of changes to farm accesses, drainage and landscaping. These changes are likely to result in supplementary side road and land orders. The preparation of the tender document will follow, with ground investigation and archaeological investigations to be undertaken. My officials are working to a programme to invite tenderers to submit bids for a Design, Build, Finance and Operate (PPP) contract in spring 2001 with a view to a contract being awarded in spring 2002. Design and construction work will be undertaken in advance of the main contract to provide replacement holes at Eastwood Golf Course.</p>
