  <p>In legal terms, the Care Development Group&#8217;s definition of personal care covers both personal care and personal support (as defined in the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001). The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 therefore requires that neither personal care nor personal support be charged for. It also specifies that no charge should be made for the specific types of care listed in Schedule 1 to the Act (even if they would not be classified as personal care or support under the terms of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001).</p>

  <p>We have created the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland to bring together stakeholders to work with the Executive to ensure that Scotland can take full advantage of these opportunities. With support from the enterprise networks, Scotland has already succeeded in creating new jobs in the production of renewable energy devices, most notably at Vestas Celtic in Campbeltown. The recently published gap analysis study commissioned jointly by the Executive, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the DTI showed that there are currently around 2,000 jobs in the renewables industry in Scotland with the potential to increase this number significantly in the period to 2020, both in the existing technologies of wind and hydro power and in the new renewables technologies such as wave, tidal and biomass.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-02-26.S2O-1356.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0226.htm#6">

  <p>In December 2003 the Executive increased the packaging waste recovery target from 59% to 63% and set a target of 70% for 2008. It also set specific recycling targets for different types of packaging material, ranging from 18-65% in 2004 to 21-71% in 2008. These compare to the original (1998) recovery and recycling targets of 38% and 7%, respectively. Increasing companies&#8217; recovery and recycling obligations for packaging waste in this way constitutes a strong incentive for them to minimise the amount of packaging they use in the first place.</p>

  <p>In other respects The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 require packaging to be manufactured in such a way that its volume and weight are limited to what is necessary to maintain the safety, hygiene and acceptance of the packed product for the consumer and commercialised in such a way that its impact on the environment is minimised when the packaging becomes waste. Policy responsibility for this matter is reserved to the United Kingdom Government.</p>

  <p>No guidance is given specific to dementia. However, the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death used in Scotland follows that recommended by the World Health Organisation and general training material on how to complete this was provided in 1999 to directors of post graduate GP education, post graduate deans, post graduate tutors and NHS Education.</p>

  <p>Every pack of certificates which issues to GPs also includes guidance on completion, including how to record the disease or condition that led directly to death, the underlying cause and any significant contributing condition, disease or accident, which was not part of the sequence leading directly to death.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to reply. His response is as follows:-</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland carries a wide range of general interest and Scottish related publications, chosen for their appeal to its diverse visitor profile. Relevance to particular sites and to Scottish history and culture more generally is an important criterion and there is thus a significant emphasis on books about Scotland, many of which are published in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In rural Grampian, local field marketing under the broadbandforscotland initiative has helped with the very recent triggering of the Banff and the Turriff exchanges. Nine other exchanges have recorded significant increases in registrations following recent field marketing activities. Around 30 more field marketing visits are planned in the area for the remainder of this financial year. If all 43 of the exchanges that have been set a trigger level by BT are enabled as a result of these activities, coverage in rural Grampian will rise from 13.8 % to 91%.</p>

  <p>The e-business demo centre in Huntly and the mobile demo unit also help to advise and stimulate demand for broadband in this area, with over 300 workshop attendees in the mobile unit over the past year at the 13 locations it has served in rural Grampian.</p>

  <p>For remoter areas where there is little commercial prospect of a mass-market service, the Executive is considering more direct measures to assist communities to access an affordable solution. These will be announced in due course. My officials also liaise regularly with Scottish Enterprise Grampian officials, and are briefed on the progress of other local broadband initiatives such as the wireless pilot in Deeside, the powerline trial in Stonehaven and the Building Buchan New Beginnings project.</p>

  <p>A number of measures are currently under way which will radically reform the criminal justice system.</p>

  <p>The Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill will reform the High Court following the recommendations in a report by the Hon Lord Bonomy. The Stage 1 debate took place on 25 February.</p>

  <p>The report from the summary justice review committee chaired by Sheriff Principal McInnes has been submitted to ministers and I expect to make an announcement on its publication in the near future.</p>

  <p>We have set up the National Criminal Justice System Board following the recommendations of the Normand report.</p>

  <p>We are also carrying out a comprehensive programme of modernisation and reform within the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p>

  <p>The Knives Act 1997 makes it a criminal offence both to market a knife and to publish material in connection with the marketing of a knife in a way which indicates that the knife is suitable for combat or in a way which is likely to encourage violent behaviour involving the use of the knife as a weapon.</p>

  <p>Section 141 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 makes it a criminal offence to import, manufacture, sell or hire an offensive weapon, or expose or possess such a weapon for the purpose of sale or hire. The list of weapons which have been specified as offensive weapons includes various types of knife.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Executive is committed under the partnership agreement to review the law and enforcement of knife crimes. In this regard we are currently considering whether there is any need for further legislation in this area, or whether there may be additional non-legislative measures which might be introduced. The outcome of the review will be announced in due course.</p>

  <p>The 1% of values that are longer than the 99 <sup>th</sup> percentile shown in the answer to S2W-4809 on 19 January 2004 cannot individually be relied upon as these will include a mixture of actual times and times that are a result of recording errors. Of those patients who have actually waited longer for in-patient or day case treatment than the value of the 99 <sup>th</sup> percentile there will be some whose waiting time is affected because their doctor has agreed that the guarantee is not appropriate because: it would either not be in their best medical interests; their condition is of low clinical priority; their treatment is highly specialised; or because they are failed to attend earlier appointments; or because the patients themselves have cancelled or refused appointments.</p>

  <p>Among the actions taken by ISD Scotland in response to the Audit Scotland Report <em>Review of the Management of Waiting Lists in Scotland</em> is the planning of a quality assurance review of waiting lists, to start in March 2004.

  <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland published a Scottish Police Service People Strategy document in August last year and intends to introduce a strategy for a healthy police service as part of an associated action plan. The strategy document makes clear that the service recognises that its most valuable asset is its staff; that officers may be subject to stress and some may suffer from mental health problems; and that it is important that forces are able to provide appropriate occupational health and welfare services.</p>

  <p>Last summer we set up the Expert Group on Prostitution to examine the legal, policing, health and social justice issues surrounding prostitution in Scotland and to consider options for the future. The expert group will examine all aspects of prostitution in a phased programme of work, starting with, in the first year, the issues surrounding street prostitution. This group is not primarily about exploitation of workers in the sex industry but its recommendations are likely to have an effect in this area. More directly, section 22 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 created a new offence of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The provisions outlaw the practice of trafficking people for use in the sex industry. In addition, we are providing &#163;283,222 to the Routes out of Prostitution Social Inclusion Partnership in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>This information is not available centrally. However, the Executive is committed to further consideration of the position of other care groups, such as younger people with disabilities. We propose to commission research on the needs of younger people with physical disabilities and dementia, and the services they can receive. Our intention is to discuss the possible aims and focus of this research with stakeholders and draw up a specification. The stakeholder group set up for this purpose has already met, and has scheduled further meetings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will encourage and, where it can, assist any measures likely to make an effective contribution to combating sectarianism within sport and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Sporting events do play a part in the promotion of Scotland as a tourist destination but there is nothing to suggest that sectarianism in sport has any impact on this. Similarly, we are not aware that it has had an effect on any inward investment projects.</p>

  <p>The Executive, through Communities Scotland, currently provides financial support to Social Firms Scotland to help them set up new social firms across Scotland. We are also providing direct funding to Social Firms Scotland for a project to assist the expansion of the social firm model for mental health sufferers.</p>

  <p>Also, as you are aware, we are in the process of reviewing our policies to support and develop the social economy in Scotland. Early last year I published <em>A Review of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Policies to Promote the Social Economy</em>. An action plan to implement the report&#8217;s recommendations is being developed and I hope to make an announcement about this soon.</p>

  <p>The aim of the Active Schools Programme is to increase the numbers and range of opportunities for young people to be more active in a variety of settings. It will be for individual local authorities and schools working with the Active Schools Co-ordinators to determine what activities will be promoted. Each Co-ordinator will have a budget which can be used to buy in services such as instruction in martial arts.</p>

  <p>The advertisement for the post of Chief Investigating Officer was published in <em>The Scotsman</em> , <em>The Herald</em> , <em>The</em> <em>Press and Journal</em> , <em>The Courier</em> and <em>Daily Record</em> . Seventy-one applications were received. A copy of the text is provided below for reference.</p>

  <p>&quot;Chief Investigating Officer (CIO)</p>

  <p>The Chief Investigating Officer will be responsible for investigating and reporting to the Standards Commission on alleged breaches of the Codes of Conduct relating to Councillors and members of devolved public bodies. The investigatory functions of the CIO will be independent of the adjudicatory functions of the Commission. Accordingly, the CIO will have discretion about the conduct of his or her duties. The CIO will be able to investigate alleged breaches by both serving and former councillors and members of relevant public bodies.</p>

  <p>Candidates must have leadership skills and a preparedness to demonstrate high standards of probity and integrity expected by the public; experience of conducting investigations (gathering information, interviewing, analysis etc); an understanding of the importance attached, by politicians, the public and the press, to ethical standards; management and communication skills and the ability to write thorough and soundly argued reports; the ability to reach sound, independent and reliable judgements; tact, discretion and an understanding of confidentiality, transparency and accountability.</p>

  <p>The Chief Investigating Officer is expected to devote 2.5 days per week and attracts a salary of &#163;30,000. The post is pensionable. This salary is currently under review. Applications will be considered on a loan or secondment basis if suitable arrangements can be made with your present employer.</p>

  <p>Members of the Commission and the Chief Investigating Officer will be appointed by Scottish ministers. Appointments will be made on the basis of equal opportunities and on terms and conditions as ministers determine. Applications are welcomed from all suitably qualified people regardless of race, gender, marital status, disability or sexual orientation. Applications from under-represented groups are actively encouraged. The Executive is committed to the principles of public appointments based on merit with independent assessment, openness and transparency of process. Political activity will not be a criterion for appointment but candidates must subscribe to the objectives of the Commission.</p>

  <p>Appointments will initially be for three years, renewable at the discretion of Scottish ministers. Time commitments specified above will be reviewed in light of experience and may be amended.</p>
