  <p>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 14 and 15 October in Luxembourg, together with Elliot Morley.</p>

  <p>On fisheries, the agenda covered reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP); a recovery plan for stocks of cod and hake, and an action plan for fisheries management in the Mediterranean Sea. No decisions were taken.</p>

  <p>There was a policy debate on aspects of the Commission&rsquo;s CFP reform package. This centred on access to resources, good governance, and control and enforcement.</p>

  <p>On access to resources, we stressed the need to maintain restricted access to coastal waters (such as the six and 12 mile limits and Shetland Box). We also urged the Council to support the retention of the quota allocation system within the EU, protecting the principle of Relative Stability among member states. In that context, we particularly emphasised the importance of the so-called Hague Preference, which we regard as an integral part of Relative Stability particularly beneficial to the Scottish industry.</p>

  <p>On good governance, we emphasised to the Council the importance to be attached to the proposed Regional Advisory Councils (RACs). We stressed the importance of getting their composition and remit right, and of ensuring that they are centred on the experience and knowledge of the fishing industry. We also argued that the Commission and Council of Ministers should give particular weight to any recommendations made by these RACs.</p>

  <p>On control and enforcement, we lent our support to various ideas designed to improve co-ordination and co-operation (and therefore a &quot;level playing field&quot;) within the EU. These include proposals to extend satellite monitoring, and to facilitate inspections by Commission officials.</p>

  <p>There was also a policy debate on the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a Cod and Hake Recovery Plan. Most Member States acknowledged the need for urgent action. We emphasised the need to develop workable proposals based on the latest science, and based on close consultation with stakeholders. We indicated (as did others) that effort control might be a necessary part of any solution.</p>

  <p>The Commission also gave a presentation covering its action plan for fisheries management in the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>The agriculture agenda covered three main issues: three specific proposals on food safety matters; the recent Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development, and the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).</p>

  <p>The food safety proposals considered by Council covered the monitoring and control of zoonoses and genetically modified food and feed. There was some useful clarification of positions but it was not possible to reach agreement on this occasion.</p>

  <p>The Council assessed the agricultural priorities flowing from the Johannesburg World Summit and agreed conclusions accordingly.</p>

  <p>On CAP, the Council continued its consideration of the mid-term review proposals, concentrating on those concerning rural development and farm audits. Supported by a number of other Member States, we stressed the importance of a shift from production-linked support under the CAP to rural development programmes, and reiterated the importance of a fair distribution of funds between Member States. On the commodity side, there were discussions on new market measures for nuts and for rice. There was also a discussion on the options for change in the milk sector.</p>

  <p>Under other business, the Commission dealt with enquiries about olive oil promotion, aid to Greek cotton producers and negotiations with third countries over grain imports.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that new research into the relationship between phytoplankton and algal toxin levels is due to run between January 2000 and September 2003, with costs of &#163;450,275 spread over that period. On continuing funding to develop testing regimes, between August 2000 and August 2002, &#163;266,779 was made available for assessment of new system for rapid detection of ASP and DSP (MIST AlertTM). In addition, the FSAS algal toxin shellfish monitoring programme was launched in January 2001 and is set to run until March 2005, at a total cost of &#163;2,012,954 plus approximately &#163;250,000 per annum for charter vessels required to collect samples. No new research has taken place into the alleged link between fish farms and outbreaks of ASP.</p>

  <p>The names of convicted adult offenders and the crimes of which they have been convicted are in the public domain. The information is available from the Depute Principal Clerk of Justiciary at the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Trials of children for serious offences are held in public but the proceedings are subject to statutory reporting restrictions. The names of convicted children could not be disclosed by the media unless the reporting restrictions were dispensed with by the court during the trial or by the Scottish ministers after the trial.</p>

  <p>On the grant of interim liberation, the names of adult offenders are also in the public domain. All court proceedings involving children are covered by the statutory reporting restrictions. This would therefore include proceedings on the grant of interim liberation pending appeal.</p>
