  <p>Published Scottish Office research papers are in practice held by the Scottish Executive. I understand that the UK Government has no objection to such papers being placed in the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and many already have been. However, the Executive does not see any need to place <i>all</i> published Scottish Office research papers in the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. Putting together a complete set of all of the research papers which have been published over the years would be a costly and time-consuming exercise and many of these papers would now be of little interest to members. Where a paper in which a member is interested is not available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre, the member can easily obtain a copy from the Scottish Executive, or the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre can do so on their behalf.</p>

  <p>We would not anticipate any difficulty in making research published by the Scotland Office freely available to the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is today publishing the Scottish farm income figures. The estimated figures show that Total Income from Farming (TIFF) fell by 13% in 2000 to &#163;228 million. The fall in agricultural incomes reflects the lower prices for many agricultural commodities due to the continued strength of the pound during 2000. Average net farm income is estimated to have fallen marginally, with some variation across sectors. Detailed estimates of the outputs, inputs and income of Scottish agriculture at both the aggregate level and by farm type will be published this morning and will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Within the Scottish Executive Health Department, the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within NHSScotland and, as such, is the main departmental funder of NHS-related research. The most recent published results of a scientifically controlled trial on Secretin of which CSO is aware appeared in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> , 9 December 1999, volume 341, number 24. This came to the conclusion that Secretin achieved no significant improvement in various outcome measures as compared to a placebo.</p>

  <p>CSO has no plans to promote or commission research projects<i> </i>on the use of the drug Secretin for treating sufferers from autism, although it would be pleased to consider funding proposals for innovative studies of a sufficiently high standard in relation to the treatment of<i> </i>autism.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not made an estimate of the effects of tobacco smuggling on the Scottish economy. Tobacco taxation is reserved to Westminster. However, data on the effects at the UK level of tobacco smuggling are available from Customs and Excise. Customs and Excise data show that for 1999 all forms of tobacco smuggling cost the UK Exchequer &#163;2.5 billion in forgone tax revenues.</p>

  <p>A range of mechanisms exists for monitoring the quality of care which the NHS in Scotland provides for older patients. This includes the work of the Scottish Health Advisory Service, regular meetings with bodies such as Age Concern and the Scottish Branch of the British Geriatrics Society. The generic standards developed by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland are another valuable way of monitoring attitudes to older patients, and reviews of standards for specific services, such as for those recovering in hospital after a heart attack, will also check for evidence of age discrimination. The Chief Medical Officer will also, at my request, be leading an expert group to address the care of older people across Scotland and to look at how their journey through the health care system can be improved.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. We know that the therapies most commonly offered within the NHS are acupuncture, homeopathy, osteopathy and chiropractice, but it is open to a GP or hospital clinician to refer a patient for any alternative therapy. The GP or hospital clinician would require to be satisfied of the value of the treatment and the competence of the practitioner, and would remain responsible for the patient&#8217;s medical care. Some GPs and other medical professionals themselves are also qualified to offer particular alternative therapies. Whether the costs of alternative therapies are met by the patient or the NHS would be for the health board to decide. It is also open to health boards to arrange for the provision of alternative therapies, but that would be a decision for the board based on its assessment of local needs.</p>

  <p>In response to the consultation paper published last year, we received 90 formal responses. At the same time the Executive also received over 120 letters from members of the public, many of whom went to great lengths to describe the difficulties they were experiencing as a result of high boundary hedges. We consider that though the experience of such problems is not so widespread in Scotland as south of the border, the suffering in individual cases is just as acute.</p>

  <p>We have accordingly decided in principle that a statutory remedy of last resort is required, involving complaints to the local authority and enforcement action in appropriate cases, where other avenues have been exhausted. No commitment can be given at this stage as to when legislation can be brought forward.</p>

The Scottish Executive did not know what funding was available for this purpose from local authorities or health boards as this information is not collected.</p>

  <p>Officials have now met with the Scottish Course to Train Tutors in Lip-reading based at Donaldson&#8217;s College, Edinburgh to explore the possibility of funding. Section 9 Grant under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 has now been awarded. This pump priming grant will provide a basis to extend local services and develop the links between audiology clinics and further and adult education provision.</p>

  <p>The number of listed building consent applications involving demolition, which were notified to Scottish Ministers by planning authorities during 1999, under the requirements of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997, and for which consent was granted, was 37.</p>

Many of these powers are for local authorities to use in relation to buildings in their areas.

  <p>The World Heritage Committee of UNESCO determines whether sites should be inscribed on the World Heritage List. Sites must be nominated by national governments.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers nominate Scottish sites for inscription drawing from the UK Tentative List which was published in 1999, following public consultation. For cultural sites they are advised by Historic Scotland, which is the relevant agency within the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland is responsible for the preparation of the detailed submission for any Scottish cultural site which is nominated. The case is then assessed by independent experts appointed by the World Heritage Committee.</p>

  <p>Following a review of the position with representatives of the specialty the establishment of training posts for clinical oncology at Specialist Registrar level was increased by 7 in March 2000, which will allow an increased growth in consultant numbers in the future.</p>

  <p>1. Rates per population are based on population estimates at mid-June.</p>

  <p>2. Staff numbers were taken as at 30 September.</p>

  <p>3. WTE is calculated by dividing the number of contracted hours/sessions by the normal (conditioned) hours for the group of staff.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, via the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE), provides funding for retainer schemes for both GPs and hospital doctors. These schemes assist in retaining doctors who are unable to work full time for whatever reason and in keeping them in touch with developments in clinical practice. SCPMDE also facilitate return to work courses for dentists and refresher courses for doctors who have taken career breaks in order to encourage them to return to the NHS.</p>

  <p>Most, although not all, of the work covered by the current tendering process is re-tendered.</p>

  <p>Until 1996 the majority of maintenance operations on trunk roads were managed and undertaken by local authorities. In 1995 competitions were held leading to the award of contracts in 1996 for three Operating Companies responsible for this work across the Central Belt of Scotland and five Managing Agents covering the management of the network over the rest of the country. The Managing Agent contracts were re-tendered in 1998 to provide this service over the period 1999-2001.</p>
