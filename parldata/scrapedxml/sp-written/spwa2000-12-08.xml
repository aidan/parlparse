  <p>The Scottish Executive has not cancelled any Empty Homes Initiative (EHI) or Rough Sleeper Initiative (RSI) projects. However, there have been a number of instances where councils have been unable to progress approved projects. In EHI cases we have worked with the council to identify a suitable substitute project. Where that has not proved possible the funding has been made available for re-allocation to EHI projects elsewhere. For RSI projects we have sought revised proposals from the councils concerned. The tables below sets out the individual EHI and RSI projects affected.</p>

  <p>Informing Parliament of the Executive&#8217;s proposals by means of a parliamentary question is a recognised and accepted process. The issue of the term and timing of local government elections is one on which we have already consulted in the response to McIntosh.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will enable geriatric nurses&#8217; duties to be split between geriatric nursing and other nursing areas with a view to boosting recruitment of nurses to geriatric care.</p>

  <p>There is no barrier to nursing jobs being designed in this way, provided that each nurse is appropriately skilled for a split role.</p>

  <p>Older people are not only nursed in specialist &quot;geriatric&quot; units, but are important users of services across the NHS. Whatever the setting, the older person and their carers should receive nursing services based on their individual assessed needs. Such assessment will ensure that services are co-ordinated, and delivered across settings and specialities with which the person comes into contact. It is for NHS Trusts to decide how to structure their nursing posts taking account of local circumstances.</p>

  <p>Introduced in 1999, the Scottish Household Survey (SHS) is the largest sample survey ever undertaken in Scotland and currently collects information which can be disaggregated by sex, household type (including lone parents), ethnic origin and whether respondents report any long-standing illness, health problem or disability.</p>

  <p>The next results bulletin, which will be published in January, will focus on gender disaggregated results.<br /></p>
