  <p>We do not hold up-to-date details of credit unions in Scotland, including their common bond coverage, which would allow us to provide a breakdown by local authority area. However, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which regulates credit unions, has advised us that 119 credit unions currently operate in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding, &pound;23 billion for the period 2008-10. The vast majority of the funding, including the funding for tackling dyslexia <em>,</em> is being provided by means of a block grant.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities, including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives as set out in the concordat.</p>

</table></p>

  <p>The table also includes the SHCS sample size for each of the authority divisions and the 95% confidence interval. As the figures are derived from a survey they are estimates. So for example the percentage of children living in fuel poverty in East Lothian is 9% +/- 3%. So the 95% confidence interval is from 6% to 12%.</p>

  <p>Fuel poverty measures are dependent on fuel prices. In the three-year period represented in the data, the overall level of fuel poverty is 22%, while by 2007 25% of households in Scotland were in fuel poverty.</p>

  <p>The SHCS sample size is about 3,000 households per year. This is too small to provide reliable estimates at local authority for each year. Nonetheless one can estimate what the figures would have been in mid-2007 using the three year data and the 2007 fuel poverty levels. The following table shows the estimated level of fuel poverty in 2007 - using the three-year data and the 2007 national fuel poverty level.</p>

  <p>Illegal money lending (lending without a credit licence) is a breach of the consumer credit legislation which is reserved to the UK Government. The UK Government funds specialist units to tackle illegal money lending. The Scottish team has no formal partnership arrangements with local authorities, but does inform them before they work in an area, and local Trading Standards officers may accompany them when a search warrant is executed.</p>

  <p>Illegal moneylenders prey on some of the most vulnerable people in society and cause immense misery. It has always proved very difficult to bring them to justice.</p>

  <p>We published the interim Games Legacy Plan on 18 December 2008 which set the direction in providing a lasting legacy from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and also the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games. We aim to publish our full Legacy Plan later this summer. Throughout the process of developing these plans we have worked closely with a range of partners, including COSLA and their community planning partners to encourage them to maximise the opportunities from London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
