  <p>The Scottish Government is aware that public art has potential benefits in this area, and the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) has funded a number of public art projects through National Lottery funding that have been of considerable benefit to people and communities.

  <p>There are a range of factors influencing the choices graduates make about living and working in Scotland. Those who have trained in specific art forms, as well as those who have studied the wider humanities, have access to national bodies, including Careers Scotland and the Scottish Arts Council, who can offer them information, guidance and advice on networking and opportunities for professional development within their chosen field.</p>

  <p>More universally, the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s own Fresh Talent Initiative gives international graduates from Scottish Institutions the opportunity to stay on and live and work in Scotland for up to two years. Graduates from all disciplines are also being encouraged to consider utilising their skills and training in specific workforce areas such as teaching and healthcare management.</p>

  <p>We have provided local authorities with sufficient funding to employ approximately 300 additional teachers from this autumn and have authorised increases of at least 300 in initial teacher education in the coming session which will start to have an immediate impact in schools in 2008 and will be focussed on reducing class sizes in P1-P3. The Scottish Executive will be working with local authorities to ensure we can drive down these class sizes in a managed and staged way which maintains teacher quality, recognises classroom pressures and continuity of class configurations which will deliver practical progress to classes of 18 in P1-P3. These factors, together with the spending review, will drive the timeframe for delivery by making year on year progress towards our target.</p>

  <p>This approach has been recognised by teaching professionals as the best way to delivering our policy of class sizes of 18 in P1-P3 across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The levels of fines imposed on companies which breach the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 are a matter for the courts, which consider the circumstances of each case, including the value of a deterrent, individually.</p>

  <p>A company which breaches Section 33(1) of the Act may be fined up to &pound;40,000 in summary proceedings. However, in proceedings on indictment the fine which may be levied on a company found guilty of such a breach is without limit. The choice of procedure is a matter for the Procurator Fiscal.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is examining all funding for future years as part of the spending review process.</p>

  <p>In this context I note that most of the range of offences which may be committed against the provisions of Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 are regulated and enforced by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Any court action is, of course, a matter for the Procurator Fiscal and the Crown Office bears the costs.</p>

  <p>In respect of offences against the provisions of Section 33(1)(a) and (c) local authorities, together with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the police, enjoy powers to issue Fixed Penalty Notices. The penalty in this case is currently &pound;50. Whichever body issues the notice, the fines are payable to and may be kept by the local authority.</p>

  <p>Caledonian MacBrayne&rsquo;s Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for 2005-06 indicate that the operating loss on the Gourock-Dunoon ferry service was &pound;2.451 million. The 2006 edition of Scottish Transport Statistics indicates that in 2005 624,700 passengers travelled on Caledonian MacBrayne&rsquo;s Gourock-Dunoon route. On that basis the average subsidy per passenger in 2005-06 was &pound;3.92.</p>

  <p>I understand that the restrictions were introduced in 1982, following consideration of a number of other options aimed at removing what was seen as the anomaly of a commercial service facing competition from a service that was receiving Government subsidy. These restrictions were put in place to limit the impact of the subsidised service on the unsubsidised service.</p>

  <p>Guidelines were issued on 1 March 1995 by the then Secretary of State for Scotland to Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. Those guidelines regulate how the company should operate business activities beyond those required to deliver the network of services that qualify for subsidy. The guidelines permit the company to undertake such activities provided that prior approval has been given by the Scottish Executive and subject to a number of conditions. The major condition relates to the need for the activities to be carried out on a fully commercial basis, with no leakage of subsidy from the company&rsquo;s core activities.</p>

  <p>The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) has advised that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not an area where the evidence supports screening of the adult population. Guidelines are however available to clinicians to enable them to target high-risk groups and subsequently jointly manage the condition with the person with CKD, their carers and other agencies. Publication of a SIGN guideline on chronic kidney disease is expected before the end of this year.</p>

  <p>Since April 2006, CKD has been included as a clinical area in the Quality and Outcomes Framework of the GMS contract, and this encourages GP practices to identify CKD early so that appropriate measures can be taken to slow or prevent the progression to more serious CKD and also to combat the major risk of illness or death due to cardiovascular disease.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 6, Renewable Energy, sets a specific and measurable target for improving the use of renewable energy in new developments. It introduced the requirement that all future planning applications proposing development with a total cumulative floorspace of 500 square metres or more should incorporate on-site zero and low carbon equipment contributing at least an extra 15% reduction in CO2 emissions, beyond the 2007 building regulations carbon dioxide emissions standard.</p>

  <p>Local authorities (in common with all building owners) who build new heated and cooled buildings and have existing ones converted, altered or extended require to comply with the energy standards in current building regulations. The revised standards introduced on 1 May 2007 have the capability to deliver the best carbon dioxide savings in the UK. The emissions from new buildings can be assessed from the energy performance certificates that are now required with the introduction of the new standards.</p>

Electrification is one possible option for achieving this and the costs, risks and timescales of such a project will be considered in the wider context of the above service improvements.
