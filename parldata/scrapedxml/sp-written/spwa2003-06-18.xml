  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will review the volume of paperwork that livestock farmers are required to complete and what measures it will take to amend the sheep tagging scheme to a compulsory tagging only scheme when stock leaves a farm.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-06-18.S2W-106.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0618.htm#1">

  <p>My department is already working to reduce the burden of paperwork on farmers. Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department forms and guidance are regularly reviewed to ensure that unnecessary questions are deleted and remaining questions simplified; all Common Agricultural Policy subsidy forms are scrutinised by a panel of farmer and industry representatives before being finalised.</p>

  <p>The current system of sheep tagging was introduced in February 2002, following the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, with the full support of the industry in Scotland. It does not require tagging to take place until the time of the first move. The EC has since published proposals for a new system which includes tagging within one month of birth. I am committed to working towards changes to the EC proposal which are closer to our existing system in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) were introduced by section 19 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. They can be used to address anti-social behaviour by individuals wherever it occurs, so long as the anti-social conduct is not against persons of the same household as the individual named on the application.</p>

  <p>Under section 22(1) of the 1998 Act, breach of ASBO is a criminal offence for which the penalties are up to six months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or both on summary conviction and up to five years imprisonment and an unlimited fine or both on indictment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise. As part of that exercise a twice yearly survey of the vacancies in education authorities is carried out. The results of the 2002 survey do not indicate a particular shortage of modern language teachers.</p>

  <p>Newly qualified teachers are not the only means by which local authorities can fill vacant posts. There are other sources such as those who will be seeking a permanent job after having completed the Teacher Induction Scheme this year, returners to the profession and supply teachers seeking permanent posts.</p>

  <p>The Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (PPC) introduce more stringent controls on industrial processes. The impact of the PPC Regulations on the Longannet and Grangemouth facilities will take effect from 2006, when the combustion and refining sectors are due to transfer to the new PPC regime. Both sites are also subject to the EC Large Combustion Plant Directive and will in due course require to comply with the amended and tighter requirements of that directive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has decided to retain all previously designated (14) sensitive areas, and additionally has designated nine rivers and one stretch of marine water. These have been identified as sensitive areas in accordance with the terms of the Urban Waste Water Treatment (Scotland) Regulations 1994. The additional sensitive areas have been identified because of eutrophication, or in order to meet the requirements of the Surface Waters (Fishlife) (Classification) (Scotland) Regulations 1997, or in order to meet the requirements of the Surface Waters (Shellfish) (Classification) (Scotland) Regulations 1997. In all cases, the consequences of the designations are that Scottish Water has to provide treatment in addition to the standard secondary biological treatment for significant sewage discharges into the catchments of these waters.</p>

  <p>For discharges into the River Don, additional phosphorus treatment is being provided at the Persley treatment works; for the other listed rivers discharges are being treated to reduce ammonia levels to protect freshwater fishlife. In the case of the coastal water from St Andrews round to Fife Ness, additional disinfection treatment has been put into place at the St Andrews discharge to protect the quality of the shellfish water. In all cases the additional treatment provides further protection to these designated waters, resulting in environmental benefits, and to allow the waters to meet relevant environmental quality standards.</p>

  <p>The River Don has been designated sensitive to combat eutrophication. River Isla, Teviot Water (lower), River Ettrick, River Tyne, River North Esk, South Calder Water, River Clyde (lower) and Black Cart Water have all been designated sensitive to protect fresh water for fish. St Andrews to Fife Ness has been designated to protect shellfish water.</p>

  <p>I am placing copies of maps, showing the location of these designated sensitive areas, in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 26935). Copies will also be deposited with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for public inspection. My officials are sending a letter to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency requiring them to ensure, under their statutory powers, that compliance with discharge consent conditions which include tertiary treatment standards are met for discharge to an into the catchments of these sensitive areas. Additionally, my officials will publish a notice of the additional sensitive designations in the <em>Edinburgh Gazette</em>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether Scottish Natural Heritage has made any application for the introduction of the beaver; what information it has received about opposition to any such action from the National Farmers' Union Scotland, the Scottish Crofting Foundation and the Scottish Landowners' Federation; whether the introduction of the beaver will have adverse consequences and, if so, what its position is in respect of such consequences, and whether it will reject any such application.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage submitted an application in January 2002 to <em>trial </em> a re-introduction of the European Beaver to Scotland at a specified site in Knapdale, Argyll.</p>

  <p>Concerns over possible consequences of a trial re-introduction have been received from a number of organisations and individuals. Potential adverse consequences need to be given full consideration before I can take a decision. I have asked Scottish Natural Heritage to let me have further information on their application.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the cost to (a) it and (b) Scottish Natural Heritage has been of all work carried out in relation to the consideration and submission of any application in respect of the introduction of the beaver and what assessment it has made of value for money in respect of such costs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is required to respond to any application of this kind and costs relating to individual applications are not held separately.</p>

  <p>In relation to costs incurred by Scottish Natural Heritage, I refer the member to the answer given to question S2W-449 on 10 June 2003. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>
