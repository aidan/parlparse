  <p>Projected life expectancy figures are not currently available for local authority and NHS board areas because it is difficult to produce reliable projections for such relatively small populations.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have the freedom to allocate resources to best meet the health needs of their populations, whilst at the same time working towards national health improvement targets. The allocation of funding to community health projects is a matter entirely for those bodies which provide the funding, namely NHS boards, local authorities and other community partners.</p>

  <p>Annual Reviews are held with each NHS board where their performance is scrutinised in public. Boards are expected to report progress against health improvement strategies, targets and measures at these meetings.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider establishing arms-length management organisations (ALMO) for local authorities whose tenants have voted against large-scale voluntary housing transfer.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-08-16.7.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0816.htm#4">

  <p>There is already provision in the law which enables councils to set up bodies such as Arms Length Management Companies. Section 20 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 2003 gives wide powers to local authorities to create or enter into arrangements with other persons or companies if that is likely to promote or improve well-being. Creating an ALMO would not, however, qualify the council for Treasury funding to redeem residual housing debt which is available to councils that transfer ownership of their housing to a Registered Social Landlord.</p>

  <p>The consent of the Scottish ministers is required under section 92(5) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 should a local authority wish to provide assistance, including financial assistance, to a person or company managing housing and that assistance is carried to the debit of their housing revenue account.</p>

  <p>We believe that in certain circumstances partial transfer may be an appropriate option for some councils as part of a strategy to meet the Scottish Housing Quality Standard for all of their stock. Details of the support available for partial transfers is set out in the guidance on local authority housing transfers which is published on the Communities Scotland website. The key criteria governing the acceptance of a partial transfer proposal on to the Community Ownership Programme are that the council must have a viable and acceptable Standard Delivery Plan for the stock which it plans to retain and that the business plan support that is offered for partial transfers will not exceed the support that would have been given if the council had undertaken a whole stock transfer.</p>

  <p>In September 2003, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) published standards on food, fluid and nutritional care in hospitals. It is available at: <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/files/Food,%20Fluid%20Nutrition.pdf" target="_blank">www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/files/Food,%20Fluid%20Nutrition.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>Three of these standards have been reviewed by NHS QIS and their report, which was published on 10 September 2006, can be found at: <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/files/FFNCH_NOV_AUG06.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/files/FFNCH_NOV_AUG06.pdf</a></p>

  <p>This report shows that the standards are making a difference. There has been a culture change within the NHS since the standards were first published. They are groundbreaking and the first of their kind in the UK. However, implementation has been slow and there is still a lack of coordination. It is important that the standards are now implemented more effectively.</p>

  <p>Whilst most areas of the Holyrood building are well served by IT cabling, it is recognised that wireless networking, or wi-fi, can sometimes offer a more flexible method of delivering networked services.</p>

  <p>The SPCB has already introduced wireless networking capability in the Holyrood building. After a risk assessment was undertaken, wireless networking was installed in the Education Centre where it has been successfully used to deliver services since November 2004. The technology was deployed because it offered the best solution to address the business requirements.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Business Information Technology Office is currently looking at the feasibility of enhancing the mobile phone coverage in the Holyrood building. One of the solutions being considered offers the option to install wireless hotspots which could be used by visitors to the Parliament.</p>
