  <p>It is for Sector Skills Councils to determine the skills needs of their industry and to identify relevant and appropriate training opportunities to meet the needs of employers. Skillset is the Sector Skills Council for the creative media industries.</p>

  <p>Should employers in the creative media industries require a modern apprenticeship framework, it would be for Skillset to develop an appropriate framework for approval by Scotland&rsquo;s Modern Apprenticeship Group.</p>

  <p>Prior to 1 April 2008, debtors presented petitions for their own bankruptcy to the courts. Since 1 April 2008 those people who wish to make themselves bankrupt must apply directly to the Accountant in Bankruptcy by way of debtor application.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of debtor petitions to the courts in the third quarter of 2007-08 and the number of debtor applications to the Accountant in Bankruptcy in the third quarter of 2008-09. The number of awards of bankruptcy as a result of debtor petitions or applications in the same periods are also shown.</p>

  <p>There is no direct correlation between the petitions or applications for bankruptcy and those awarded in any particular period of time due to internal processes.</p>

  <p>Note: Information on numbers of petitions supplied by the Scottish Court Service. Information on debtor applications and awards collated by the Accountant in Bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>*No information is recorded on debtor petitions to the Court of Session &ndash; the vast majority of debtor petitions would have been presented at a sheriff court.</p>

  <p>No direct comparison can be made between the figures in the current year and figures reported on in previous years as the application process and criteria for award of bankruptcy are different.</p>

  <p>The number of debtor applications and the increase in the number of awards in 2008-09 is associated to a new route into bankruptcy for those with Low Income, Low Assets (LILA) which was introduced on 1 April 2008.</p>

  <p>Prior to 1 April 2008 petitions for bankruptcy were considered by both the sheriff courts and the Court of Session. Since 1 April 2008 it is no longer competent to raise a petition for bankruptcy in the Court of Session.</p>

  <p>The information in the table below reports on petitions to the sheriff courts only. During the third quarter of 2007-08 some petitions will have been presented at the Court of Session however the data collated by the Court of Session cannot be broken down by source of petition for bankruptcy and can therefore not be included. Historically, significantly fewer petitions have been presented to the Court of Session than to sheriff courts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is keen to ensure that the broadcasting industry has access to a highly skilled and flexible workforce. Progress towards this will be set out in our response to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission&rsquo;s report, which will be published shortly. The most significant achievement to date, announced on 10 February by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, is that the Scottish Funding Council had decided to award &pound;5.8 million over five years to Skillset to strengthen creative media education at a number of higher and further education institutions. Approximately &pound;400,000 of it each year will help to fund an additional 80 postgraduate students &ndash; 40 in broadcasting and 40 in other creative industries.</p>

  <p>The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 gave ministers powers to regulate charges for social care. However, the Scottish Executive made clear at that time that it would support self-regulation by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) if it achieved consistency. It also made a commitment to hold these powers in reserve until implementation of COSLA&rsquo;s guidance on charging was evaluated. In its Stage 1 Report on the Bill, the Health and Community Care Committee of the Scottish Parliament endorsed the approach of COSLA in preparing the guidance, and the reserve powers being taken by ministers.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the guidance began in 2004 and revised guidance was issued in 2006. Key stakeholders, including the Scottish Executive were involved in the consultation process. The guidance is currently under further review by COSLA. We continue to support the aim of the COSLA guidance to achieve consistency, whilst allowing for local authority discretion in ensuring that charges are reasonable for each individual client.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans at present to use its reserve powers under the 2002 act to regulate charges for social care.</p>

  <p>Increasing access to careers in the creative media industries is a shared responsibility for the government, the Scottish Funding Council, Sector Skills Councils and individual institutions. For example, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Determined to Succeed</em> strategy aims to better prepare children and young people for the world of work. We also want to ensure that everyone who has the ability gets the opportunity to study for a higher education qualification whatever their background or personal circumstances.</p>

  <p>Skillset, the Sector Skills Council for the creative media, is working with Creative Loop, a consortium of colleges that is accredited as a media academy, to develop creative media courses that have strong links with the community. All the media academies in Scotland are also creating new, more flexible progression routes through the industry.</p>

  <p>Skillset also provides a careers advice service offering unbiased, quality advice on careers in the industry. This can be accessed online through their website, or via the Skills Development Scotland free phone service.</p>

  <p>The First Minister made a two day visit to Washington DC last week to raise Scotland&rsquo;s profile in the US; to strengthen relationships with key policymakers, particularly in the new administration, and to promote the Year of Homecoming in one of Scotland&rsquo;s biggest tourist markets.</p>

  <p>The First Minister met with important figures in the new US administration. The First Minister&rsquo;s meeting with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton marked the deepening friendship between our two nations and provided a good basis for further on-going dialogue in important areas of mutual interest, such as climate change and Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy potential. The First Minister also met with Dr Christina Romer, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to discuss efforts to promote economic recovery, the US stimulus package, and possible areas for future policy discussion and cooperation between the US and Scotland.</p>

  <p>The First Minister&rsquo;s visit to the United States coincided with the launch of a new Scottish Caucus in the US Senate. The newly announced Caucus is one of very few in the US Senate and reflects the ability and efforts of Senator Jim Webb (D-Virginia) and his colleagues. With 30 US Senators &ndash; a third of the Senate &ndash; now joining the 50 members of the Friends of Scotland Caucus in the House of Representatives, Scotland now has a significant asset to promote our long-term interests in the United States.</p>

  <p>In addition, the First Minister hosted a reception to promote scotch whisky, delivered a lecture at Georgetown University, and gave the keynote address at a prestigious symposium on the life and works of Robert Burns, at the Library of Congress. He also undertook various media engagements to publicise the Year of Homecoming and to promote key Scottish industries such as renewable energy, tourism and food and drink, in an effort to spur economic recovery in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-19205 by Kenny MacAskill on 15 January 2009, in relation to the delivery of speedier and more immediate community penalties, (a) what targets it has set, (b) when it expects to achieve these targets and (c) whether it plans to make information on the progress of this goal publicly accessible and, if so, how it intends to do this.</p>

  <p>We have been working very closely with our professional stakeholders to agree a new tighter framework for starting and completing community sentences. New guidance in respect of community service orders, which is about to be issued, will require post sentence interviews to be carried out within one working day of the order being made by the court and the work placement to start within seven working days. The new arrangements will inevitably take time to bed in but should lead to significant improvements over current levels of performance.</p>

  <p>An audit of local authorities&rsquo; performance during November 2008 in relation to time taken to start placements is currently in progress and will be repeated in 12 months time. The results of these audits, when completed, will be made available at the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (SPICe).</p>

  <p>This information has been taken from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Court Proceedings database and does not include young people who have been referred to the reporter. In 2006-07, the latest year for which information is available, there were 641 individuals under 18 with a charge proved for a crime or offence in the Lothian Region. Of these, 393 had committed no previous crimes/offences in the period back to 1 April 1997 and 248 had committed at least one previous crime/offence over the same period.</p>

  <p>Provision for cultural services is included as part of the overall general resources the Scottish Government provides through the Local Government Finance settlement. It is a matter for local authorities themselves to decide how to allocate its resources for a particular service based on their local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>Glasgow has access to central government funding via Museums Galleries Scotland, which distributes grants to museums and galleries throughout Scotland. In 2008-09, Glasgow City Council applied for, and received, grants totalling &pound;11,500. In addition, Glasgow City Council is currently completing a project funded under the Regional Development Challenge Scheme for which it received a total of just under &pound;400,000 over the four years to 2007-08. Glasgow has now also bid for funding under Museums Galleries Scotland&rsquo;s Recognition Scheme. A decision will be made shortly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government allocated &pound;1,235,000 to Museums Galleries Scotland for the Recognition Scheme in 2008-09. &pound;600,000 is allocated to the three major industrial museums and approximately &pound;600,000 is available for grants to the recognised collections. There are now 33 collections in 27 museums which have been recognised as being of international or national importance. The holders of the collections can apply for a grant of up to &pound;40,000 towards projects which assist the organisation to raise standards of collections management and care and/or raise standards of public service delivery. Glasgow City Council has recently applied to the fund and a decision will be made shortly.</p>

  <p>It is clear to me that the recommendations contained in the report of the <em>Audit of Current Scots Language Provision in Scotland</em> cannot be taken forward seriously without involving the Scots language community.</p>

  <p>My predecessor Linda Fabiani also shared this view, and shortly after publication of the audit hosted a conference on 9 February 2009 for individuals and organisations with an interest in Scots language matters, where the findings of the research were formally presented and possible ways forward to better promote and develop the Scots language in future were discussed.</p>

  <p>I intend to capitalize on the suggestions and views expressed by delegates at the conference and as a next step will soon carry out more focused consultation on the emerging issues with representatives from the Scots language community.</p>

  <p>The Audit of Current Provision for the Scots Language was not intended to be exhaustive and could not capture every single act of provision in Scotland during the time available to the staff undertaking the research. However, the Scottish Government recognises the potential that such a resource offers to policy makers and language practitioners, and will take steps to enable individuals or organisations whose acts of provision were not captured in the first instance by the audit to send reports on their activities. Our intention is that the table of provision contained within the audit becomes a &quot;living document&quot;, so that a broader picture of provision in Scotland may be presented throughout the year, as reported by Scots language providers.</p>
