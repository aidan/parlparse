  <p>Henry McLeish and I have decided that this review should cover the impact of Higher Still on teaching and learning, on the curriculum, the workloads of teaching staff and students, assessment &#8211; both internal and external - and staff development and other support provided to schools and colleges. However, the content is not fixed as we wish to respond to feedback from those affected by the reforms.</p>

  <p>This review provides us with the opportunity to learn the lessons from the past year, to identify those areas where improvement is required, and to ensure that the Higher Still programme goes from strength to strength in future years.</p>

  <p>We will take account of all the evidence that is submitted to us, including a recent report on implementation in further education, surveys of the views of pupils, parents and employers, and feedback from teaching unions and education authorities.</p>

  <p>It will also be vital to know the views of individual teachers who have the essential role of implementing the Higher Still programme in schools. We will therefore be commissioning an independent survey of teachers&#8217; views on how the first year of implementation has gone, before compiling the final review report. We are prepared to extend the period for compiling and publishing the report beyond the original target of the autumn, in order to conduct this important survey, and ensure that the review is comprehensive, balanced, representative and objective.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what representations it has made to the European Commission in relation to the enforced discard of quantities of prime saithe or coley.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made clear in its dealings with the European Commission that it is committed to reducing discards of all species. The new EC technical conservation Regulation which came into force on 1 January this year introduced new measures to reduce discarding. Furthermore I am introducing new measures shortly which will reduce discards of juvenile haddock and whiting.</p>

  <p>The lack of UK quota for saithe means that the issue is more apparent for this stock. However, the stock is not in good condition and there is good reason to avoid management measures, such as permitting landing of over-quota fish, which would encourage the targeting of this species. Any reallocation of the stock between member states would, of course, jeopardise the principle of Relative Stability, the basis used to allocate catches between countries. The Scottish Industry have made very clear the extreme importance they attach to the maintenance of this principle.</p>

  <p>I referred to the specific scientific advice in my answer to question S1W-8099.</p>

  <p>I was advised that the scientific merit of the trial had not been compromised primarily because the contaminant in the control crop would not be treated with the herbicide to which it is tolerant and would therefore behave in every respect like the other conventional rape plants in the trial. I was also advised that any gene flow from the trial crop would be distinguishable from that of the contaminant which expresses a different genetically modified trait. The combination of this advice and the views of the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment and the Food Standards Agency that the contaminated crop does not give rise to any safety implications for either the environment or human health were fundamental to my decision that the Daviot trial should proceed.</p>

  <p>As I said during the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on 4 July, we have been in contact with the French authorities since learning that they had discovered low levels (below 1%) of GM presence in conventional maize seed imported into France. They confirmed on 30 June that they had found some GM seed in conventional maize seed, which has been sown in south west France. Three different modifications have been found in a number of varieties of forage maize imported into France by the company Golden Harvest. These are BT 176 and BT 11, and one further, as yet unidentified, modification. BT 176 is insect resistant and has Part C consent within the EU under Directive 90/220 for import, food and feed use, and for cultivation. BT 11 is insect resistant and has Part C consent for import and use in animal feed.</p>

  <p>The French authorities have not yet confirmed which varieties of maize seed are involved, but have confirmed that sweetcorn varieties are not affected. We are seeking further information from France on the varieties concerned. However, as I also stated to the Rural Affairs Committee, it is very unlikely that they would be suitable for cultivation in Scottish conditions.</p>

  <p>We are committed to reviewing the law in relation to harassment and stalking by 2001. To that end, we launched a consultation exercise in March this year, and are now analysing the responses. We will discuss our proposals in the Parliament as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>No. Most authorities have budgeted within guideline this year. Eight authorities have set budgets in excess of the guideline but most have done so by a very small amount. In the case of Aberdeenshire and East Dunbartonshire Councils, we allowed them to continue to budget over guideline this year, on the basis that they would return to guideline in subsequent years.</p>

  <p>The main part of the study into the costs of answering parliamentary questions has now been completed. However, the data collected over the survey period is still being analysed and it will not be possible to complete the study before the summer recess. Rather than publish the report during recess, we now plan to make this available when Parliament reconvenes.</p>

  <p>I have discussed the benefits of identifying the origin of pigmeat and pigmeat products, which in this country are produced to very high welfare and health standards, with Nick Brown, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, on various occasions.</p>

  <p>I have also drawn these attributes to the attention of the major retailers I have met. I strongly support the introduction of a Scottish Pork label, which would enable the consumer to make an informed choice.</p>

  <p>I met representatives of the Scottish pig industry at the Royal Highland Show where representations were made about the need to introduce the special aid measures for this sector as soon as possible. This is being pursued urgently with the European Commission. The state of the industry has been helped by an increase in the price of pigmeat from 60p per kilo at the height of the crisis to just over &pound;1.00 per kilo currently.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes the measures proposed by the UK Government to modernise the Post Office network. The role envisaged for the Post Office fits in well with the Executive`s commitments to rural communities and to addressing the needs of socially excluded people in both urban and rural areas.</p>

  <p>We will be looking at all of the recommendations in the report prepared by the Performance and Innovation Unit of the Cabinet Office and considering how we can assist the UK Government in taking them forward in Scotland. We will also be considering whether any services provided by the Executive or its agencies might be supplied in future by the Post Office network.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made with its policy on the location and relocation of public service jobs in Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-07-06.S1W-8578.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80201" speakername="Mr Jack McConnell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0706.htm#d16">

  <p>We have already announced the establishment of the Food Standards Agency in Aberdeen, and have completed the relocation of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department of the Scottish Executive to Glasgow. The First Minister's answer of 15 September 1999 (S1W-1558, Mr Duncan McNeil MSP) set out the criteria we would use for determining the location and relocation of public sector jobs. The answer stressed the importance of operational effectiveness and of costs, and the need to take account of the position of the staff concerned; and it highlighted circumstances in which we would address alternative locations outside Edinburgh for blocks of work.</p>

  <p>We will be considering during this summer whether a number of bodies covered by the policy which occupy premises in Edinburgh with a property breakpoint arising by 2004 meet the relocation criteria, and whether we should then proceed to scrutinise options in greater detail. In doing so we will have regard to the aims of the policy and the position of staff, and we will seek the views of their trade union representatives and of the management of each organisation. At all times we will ensure that the interests of Scotland as a whole, the efficiency of government, and the delivery of high quality services to the public are central to our consideration. We will be undertaking preliminary examinations of these organisations' circumstances in order to consider whether the option of relocation should be examined further or in detail. We will make a further announcement about the conclusions of this preliminary work in the autumn. Thereafter, we will examine on a case-by-case basis those bodies it is appropriate to include in such an analysis. In the course of any detailed appraisals that follow there will be opportunities for representations to be made about different locations. There will also be full consultation with the organisations concerned and with the relevant trades unions. The organisations concerned are as follows:</p>

  <p>The Common Services Agency of the National Health Service in Scotland</p>

  <p>The Crown Office Management Services Group</p>

  <p>The Health Education Board for Scotland</p>

  <p>Registers of Scotland</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council</p>

  <p>The Scottish Council for Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Education</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporter's Unit</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Pensions Agency</p>

  <p>Sportscotland</p>

  <p>The First Minister's answer indicated a presumption against an Edinburgh location for new bodies. We will therefore also be examining where to locate two new bodies which are in the course of establishment. These are the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and the Scottish Social Services Council. The presumption against location in Edinburgh also applies to the formation of the Public Guardian's Office from the Office of the Accountant of Court.</p>

  <p>Finally, a scientific review has been initiated to investigate the feasibility of locating the scientific work of the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency at a site adjacent to the Scottish Crop Research Institute near Dundee. Should this study suggest that such a move would be feasible, then the agency would be considered along the same lines as the other existing organisations listed above.</p>

  <p>Our aim is to take the policy forward in an open, careful and systematic way, and thereby ensure that the process of Government, the services we provide and the interests of Scotland benefit from sound decisions about the location of the Executive's work.</p>
