  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to further the conservation of the capercaillie in line with the EU Wild Birds Directive and what new actions the Forestry Commission will take to better protect capercaillie within (a) Natura 2000 sites and (b) forests adjacent to Natura 2000 sites.</p>

  <p>In view of the decline in capercaillie numbers, the Scottish Executive has decided to introduce a statutory ban on the shooting of the species. This will be effected by Scottish Statutory Instrument to reschedule the species from Schedule 2, Part I to Schedule 1, Part I of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive receives advice from its statutory nature conservation advisers, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), on the classification as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) of the most suitable territories for capercaillie under the EC Birds Directive. A suite of six SPAs has been classified in Scotland and additional sites are under consideration. These SPAs form part of the Natura 2000 network. Activities within these SPAs must comply with the provisions of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994.</p>

  <p>As required by European legislation, the Forestry Commission will make an appropriate assessment of the implications of proposed forestry operations which are likely to have a significant effect on any Natura 2000 site before deciding whether to approve those operations.</p>

  <p>There is a Species Action Plan for the capercaillie developed under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The steering group for the plan is a broad partnership involving the Scottish Executive, the Forestry Commission, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and others. The Forestry Commission has taken a number of actions, including grant aiding activities that benefit capercaillie with parallel measures in state-owned forest areas; developing policy and guidance to minimise the impact of fences on capercaillie; consulting SNH and RSPB on all new afforestation proposals that could affect capercaillie; requiring grant applicants to take advice from experts on operations that will affect capercaillie, and raising awareness of the plight of capercaillie through publications, a national conference and local workshop. The commission has also led on improved fence designs and the steering group has produced revised guidance on location of fences. In addition, the RSPB and SNH with input from the commission are co-funding a Capercaillie Project Officer who acts as an adviser to landowners as well as SNH, RSPB and commission staff on capercaillie issues.</p>

  <p>SNH, the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department (SERAD) and the Forestry Commission published last year a review of capercaillie research needs. The review identified a number of research priorities including an assessment of factors associated with breeding success. Additionally, SNH in conjunction with the commission, the Scottish Executive and the RSPB, is planning a large-scale management trial in capercaillie core areas. Actions will include predator control, removal or reduced use of deer fencing, minimising disturbance of leks (breeding sites), improving brood habitat, sensitive planting, thinning and woodland management.</p>

  <p>SNH, the Forestry Commission, the RSPB and other potential partners are also working on the preparation of an application under the LIFE III programme to support recovery of capercaillie.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what impact the timber felling recently undertaken on the Invercauld Estate in Aberdeenshire will have on the capercaillie population in the area; whether any representations were made to the landowners in advance of this felling operation about the impact which it would have on capercaillie, and whether this operation complied with all relevant regulations on the protection of capercaillie.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-04-11.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80135" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0411.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>It is not known what impact the timber felling undertaken on the Invercauld Estate may have on the capercaillie population in the area. However, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) will monitor the capercaillie population on the adjacent Ballochbuie Special Protection Area (SPA).</p>

  <p>The Forestry Commission first consulted SNH about this proposal (the objective of which was regeneration of native woodland) in 1995. At that time SNH broadly supported the proposals, particularly the intention to utilise selective rather than clear felling, thereby reducing the visual impact of the scheme within Deeside and Lochnagar National Scenic Area. SNH also suggested further modifications to retain a more natural appearance in the remaining woodland and to safeguard wetland areas from felling operations. At that time, the proposals did not cause concern in relation to capercaillie. After the Forestry Commission approved the Woodland Grant Scheme (WGS) application in 1996, the adjacent Ballochbuie SPA was classified in 1998 for its important populations of Scottish crossbill and capercaillie. Further research on the capercaillie population in the area demonstrated that birds regularly used the area affected by the WGS application. I am not aware of any representations having been made to the landowners, although I understand that the estate sought specialist advice in relation to the potential impact on capercaillie of their fencing proposals.</p>

  <p>The operations were carried out in accordance with the plans approved in 1996. The Forestry Commission recognises that an assessment of the forestry proposals in these plans would have been appropriate in the changed circumstances following the classification of the SPA on adjacent ground in 1998. However, the Forestry Commission is currently identifying all the existing WGS and felling approvals given during the last five years that are likely to have a significant effect on any Natura 2000 site. In some cases assessments have already begun.</p>

  <p>The Forestry Commission is responsible for approving tree felling operations and is currently identifying all the existing Woodland Grant Schemes and felling approvals given during the last five years that are likely to have a significant effect on Natura 2000 sites. Where the proposed work might adversely affect capercaillie, the commission will discuss the proposals with the owners or managers of the land with a view to making specific arrangements for protecting capercaillie. At Invercauld Estate and Curr Wood, the commission has been discussing with Scottish Natural Heritage and relevant experts how best to manage the forestry operations, taking account of the needs of the capercaillie.</p>

  <p>The Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) have already met the owner&#8217;s agents and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds to discuss the felling operations in Curr Wood. I understand that the owner has now agreed to modify his felling proposals to take greater account of sensitive areas used by capercaillie and other priority species.</p>

  <p>A direction to SNH is unnecessary as it is already taking all necessary steps in co-operation with the Forestry Commission. SNH has a duty in terms of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp; c.) Regulations 1994 to exercise its nature conservation functions to secure compliance with the requirements of the EC Habitats Directive.</p>

  <p>Animals can only be moved under licence direct from farm to slaughterhouse. Journeys through an Infected Area are permitted by trunk road, motorway or railway and may come within 3 km of an infected premise. Animals going to slaughter are checked for any signs of foot-and-mouth disease before leaving the farms and hence are most unlikely to be excreting any FMD virus. Closing vents is unnecessary and could give rise to welfare problems in transit.</p>

  <p>Veterinary advice, based on risk assessment, is that the disinfection of trunk roads is not necessary in order to prevent any risk of the disease spreading.

Further details of the construction of these varieties is contained in the public register along with precise location details for each of the trial sites.</p>

  <p>The term &quot;terminator gene&quot; is understood to apply to genetic modifications which leave a plant incapable of producing seed able to germinate (seed sterility). Crop varieties containing these genes have neither been developed nor grown in Scotland.

  <p>Members of the Cawley family met with the precognoscer of the case at the Procurator Fiscal&#8217;s Office in Glasgow on 8 November 2000 when the precognition process, the trial process and the options available to a jury were explained to them. The Cawley family were previously written to by the Procurator Fiscal&#8217;s Office at Glasgow on 13 October 2000 and 2 November 2000 when the involvement of the Procurator Fiscal was intimated to them. They were again written to on 8 December 2000 when the indictment was served and information about the trial diet given to them. A member of the family was spoken to on the telephone by the precognoscer between 8 December 2000 and on 19 December 2000.</p>

  <p>The family were informed the precognoscer was on annual leave over Christmas and given details of the High Court Unit at the High Court of Justiciary in Glasgow should they wish to discuss matters during that period. In advance of that, on 19 December 2000, the family were taken to the High Court in Glasgow for a pre-trial court visit.</p>

  <p>On 8 January 2001, the precognoscer, when attending the High Court to view the trial, informally met a family member and spoke briefly with him.</p>

  <p>On 10 January 2001 the precognoscer attended at court to inform the family that Gary Sanders had been liberated on bail and would be acquitted at the conclusion of the Crown case.</p>

  <p>The Principal Depute at the Procurator Fiscal&#8217;s Office at the High Court of Justiciary at Glasgow met with the family on 9 January 2001. She met further with the family on 10 January 2001 in the presence of the Advocate Depute.</p>

  <p>The Head of the Procurator Fiscal&#8217;s Office at the High Court of Justiciary met with the members of the family on 11 January 2001 after the verdict when the case was discussed with them.</p>

  <p>The family were provided with accurate information on the case against Gary Sanders and Louis McDonald from their first contact with the Procurator Fiscal&#8217;s Office at Glasgow until the conclusion of the case.</p>

  <p>The definition of rural used in appendix 1 of <i>Rural Scotland: A New</i> <i>Approach</i> is based on the population density of local authority areas. It was used for the purposes of analytical simplicity and as a consequence of the way in which many socio-economic statistics are currently presented.</p>

  <p>Assistance to convert vehicles to run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) through the Powershift vehicle conversion scheme is available to applicants throughout Scotland. However, in rural areas priority was given to applicants living over 30 minutes drive-time from settlements with a population of 10,000. In the light of the substantially increased resources available to Powershift between 2001 and 2004 the Scottish Executive is considering how to promote Powershift most effectively in rural areas.</p>

  <p>In advance of the Water Industry Commissioner&#8217;s Strategic Review of Charges, it is difficult to predict precisely how water and sewerage charges will change. Given the need to invest, as set out in the Quality and Standards consultation paper, it is unlikely that charges in the north will fall. It is, however, the case that if a single water authority for Scotland is established, then we would expect that charges in the north would need to rise far less sharply than if the three authorities remained separate.</p>
