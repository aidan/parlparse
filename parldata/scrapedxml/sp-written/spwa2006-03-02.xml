  <p>Our funding policy is, within the resources available, to support the development of a sustainable organic farming industry that makes a strong contribution to the management of Scotland&rsquo;s agricultural land and water resources. The <em>Organic Action Plan</em> , which was published in 2003, sets out the several strands of our funding policy: support for farmers converting to and maintaining organic farming methods; support for marketing and processing of organic products; advisory support and provision of market information to organic farmers, and support for organic research and development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive first published a Biosecurity Code of Practice aimed at all livestock keepers in November 2002. Since then additional biosecurity guidance has been developed in specific documents which have been published in the context of avian influenza. On 21 February the Executive published a document drawing this information together. In addition to being published on the Scottish Executive website and being made available to stakeholder groups, it has also been sent to poultry-keepers who have registered on the new Poultry Register.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in the event of an outbreak of avian flu, it will undertake an emergency vaccination programme to curb the spread of the virus in poultry flocks surrounding the affected area and what preparations it has made to facilitate such a programme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-03-02.S2O-9171.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0302.htm#5">

  <p>In the event of an outbreak of avian flu in Scotland we would cull birds on infected premises with a view to eradicating disease quickly. If further measures to control and eradicate disease in Scotland were needed we would consider the role vaccination could play. Its use is not straightforward given that the vaccination does not provide complete immunity against infection and can make detection of infection more difficult. Additionally, vaccinated birds may continue to excrete virus which has implications for the control of an outbreak.</p>

  <p>Any decision will be based on veterinary and scientific advice and will take into account all relevant evidence relating to any proposed vaccination programme.</p>

  <p>As part of our preparedness work the Executive is working closely with other administrations to explore vaccination&rsquo;s potential as a more developed disease control tool.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>(a) BNSF allocated to Renfrewshire is as follows:</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="25%">

<td width="47%" valign="top"> </td>

<tr>
<td width="47%"> 2004-05</td>
<td width="53%" align="right"> 1.5</td>

</table></p>

  <p>(b) BNSF allocated to Inverclyde is as follows:</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="25%">
<tr>
<td width="47%" valign="top"> </td>
<td width="53%" align="center"> (&pound; Million)</td>

<td width="47%"> 2004-05</td>
<td width="53%" align="right"> 3.0</td>

</table></p>

  <p>Information regarding the amount specifically designated to Port Glasgow cannot be determined accurately as Inverclyde&rsquo;s BNSF programme was delivered on a thematic basis, mostly in social inclusion partnership areas, focusing on employability, neighbourhood services and health and drugs. Three specific target areas were identified for the neighbourhood services element of the programme and these included Robert Street in Port Glasgow.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The development of building regulations is underpinned by current research findings and includes joint working with the other UK administrations. There is also regular liaison on regulatory best practice with the Consortium of European Building Control and the Inter-Jurisdictional Regulatory Collaboration Committee.</p>

  <p>On 1 March 2006, the Executive commenced public consultation on further amendments to energy standards, the principle aim of which is to reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that occur as a result of energy usage in heated/cooled new buildings and existing ones that are being converted, altered or extended. A secondary objective is to cause designers of buildings to give consideration to the incorporation of building integrated low and zero carbon energy generating technologies, such as solar water heating and photovoltaics.</p>

  <p>The SBSA is presently working on the implementation of the EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings and how it impacts on the regulations. It is intended to issue a further consultation package on this in the near future.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The introduction of condensing gas boilers into Scottish building regulations is under consideration at present as part of a major review of energy standards. Proposals as a result of this review were issued for public consultation on 1 March 2006, with a view to amending regulations coming into force in spring 2007. The consultation can be accessed on <a href="http://www.sbsa.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.sbsa.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to assess the community care needs of older people, and to meet those needs, including the provision of free personal and nursing care where appropriate.</p>

  <p>I am aware that a number of local authorities are operating waiting lists for personal and nursing care, and my officials are pursuing this matter with the councils in question.</p>

  <p>We will work with those councils to help them understand and address their responsibilities for the provision of care, and to ensure that older people are able to access the services to which they are entitled.</p>

  <p>Consideration of individual planning applications, together with the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), is a matter, in the first instance, for the planning authority concerned, in this case South Lanarkshire Council. I understand that South Lanarkshire Council commissioned a screening report which concluded that this application did not require to be the subject of an EIA.</p>

  <p>Following consideration of this application South Lanarkshire Council indicated, on 28 February, that it is minded to grant planning permission. But before doing so the council will notify the application to Scottish ministers for their consideration. As part of their consideration, ministers will also look into the question of whether an EIA is required in this case.</p>

  <p>The 2002 Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) is currently the most up-to-date source of information on fuel poverty in Scotland. It does not permit us to establish how many households would return to fuel poverty as a result of a 25% increase in the price of gas as the survey is not longitudinal in design and does not therefore track households over an extended period.</p>

  <p>However, analysis of the 2002 SHCS data shows that, had mains gas prices been 25% higher in 2002-03, an additional 64,000 households would have been in fuel poverty.</p>

  <p>There will be five pilots in the first phase of Prevention 2010 &ndash; our programme to tackle health inequalities by enhancing primary care in deprived areas - two in Greater Glasgow, and one each in Lothian, Lanarkshire and Tayside. We used the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation to identify areas with the highest numbers of data zones in the most deprived 15%. We plan a second phase of pilots next year, when we will target more areas with high levels of deprivation. The approach will be extended to all those at risk through deprivation once we know what works best.</p>

  <p>We are on track to achieve the Partnership Agreement target of attracting 12,000 nurses and midwives into NHSScotland by 2007. This target is associated with all qualified nurses and midwives, including neonatal nurses. Information on neonatal nurses is not collected separately.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive published the <em>National Workforce Planning Framework 2005 </em>in August 2005 which sets out a workforce planning cycle at national, regional and NHS board level. This planning cycle allows for a bottom up evidence based approach to future staffing numbers across all staff groups, including nurses and midwives. Workforce forecasts contained within NHS board workforce plans will help inform national decisions on future training numbers and supply.</p>

  <p>A Paediatric and Neonatal Nursing subgroup of the Nursing and Midwifery Workload and Workforce Planning Steering Group has been established to consider appropriate workload measurement tools to be piloted across NHSScotland. This will assist with overall action for workforce planning purposes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring that professionals in the NHS have the necessary experience, skills and competencies to provide skilled care. We are determined to ensure a clear career structure which places nurses and midwives at the centre of neonatal care. To this end we are funding 18 nurses and midwives to complete the two year advanced neonatal nurse practitioner course.</p>

  <p>Health boards, as NHS employers, are required by the mandatory Staff Governance Standard to ensure that all their staff, which includes their nursing and midwifery staff, are appropriately trained for the environment they work in. The Staff Governance Standard is monitored by the Scottish Partnership Forum and in that way the performance of each individual health board is monitored.</p>

  <p>There is a statutory requirement for pharmaceutical producers to be inspected by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) within a two year period. In 2004 MHRA highlighted a need to upgrade systems and procedures at the Protein Fractionation Centre (PFC) to ensure continued compliance with current EU Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, and follow-up action was taken to implement improvements. An inspection by MHRA in January identified further areas where improvement is needed. As a result PFC has suspended the production of plasma products to allow the development and introduction of these upgrades.</p>

  <p>Health Protection Scotland (HPS) published a report from the Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI) surveillance programme in June 2005. This is available on the HPS website:</p>

  <p>Participation in the CAUTI surveillance programme is voluntary and not all NHS boards have participated. Therefore, the report does not provide full data on CAUTIs in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department has commissioned HPS to conduct a national survey on the prevalence and burden of healthcare associated infections (HAIs). As part of this, data on health care-associated UTIs will be collected across Scotland. The prevalence survey is due to report in 2007.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for decisions on the funding of individual higher education institutions lies with the funding council. The present system of current revenue funding is designed to allow the greatest financial flexibility to funded institutions who then make their own decisions on the allocation of funds and places.</p>

  <p>However, we recognise that there are concerns about how the costs of delivery are reflected in the present system. Ministers have therefore asked the funding council to take forward as a priority a review of its funding methodology. The aim of the review is to develop an approach to funding provision by colleges and universities which is related as closely as possible to the actual costs of delivery. The review will be undertaken in partnership with colleges and universities and we have asked the council to ensure that the outcomes enable local provision involving more than one institution.</p>

  <p>The Fresh Talent initiative has already made considerable progress in seeking to attract bright, talented and hard-working individuals to come and live, work and study in Scotland. We have established a Relocation Advisory Service to act as a one-stop stop offering advice to individuals interested in relocating to Scotland. For students, we have introduced a number of strands of activity. These include the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme, Scottish International Scholarship Programme Fresh Talent: Supporting International Students Challenge Fund, and funding for the DARE to be Digital and Encouraging Dynamic Global Entrepreneurs (EDGE) programmes. We have recently expanded the Relocation Advisory Service, through the secondment of a Senior Business Development Executive from Scottish Enterprise, to develop advice and support for businesses who might benefit from the recruitment of workers from outwith Scotland. We are in the process of undertaking a number of activities to raise the profile of Fresh Talent with the business community including a series of business briefings run in conjunction with the Scottish Council for Development and Industry. Finally, our Diaspora Strategy aims to encourage the diaspora&rsquo;s active participation and engagement in promoting Scotland as a great country to visit, live, learn, work, do business and invest, as well as considering returning to Scotland themselves.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been in touch with the Commission through UK authorities to make clear its view, based on legal advice, that the Rule of 85 is not compatible with the age provisions of the Equal Treatment directive.

  <p>An original target date of end September 2005 for the assimilation of staff onto the new Agenda for Change paybands was set in partnership with trades unions and professional organisations as part of the overall UK Agenda for Change agreement. It soon became evident that this target was overly ambitious for all UK health services, who subsequently set their own timeframes for full implementation.</p>

  <p>Agenda for Change is being implemented in partnership in NHSScotland, and significant progress has been made. Over 85% of posts which have been submitted to matching panels have been matched against national profiles. Around 53,000 staff in the nursing, midwifery, ancillary and allied health professionals staff groups have been approved for assimilation. In January, the first groups of staff were paid on the new Agenda for Change paybands.</p>

  <p>A plan for 2006, which health boards are committed to delivering, has been drawn up and agreed in partnership. Based on the plan it is anticipated that Agenda for Change will be introduced and operational by the end of 2006.</p>

  <p>The Pay Modernisation Team, alongside the Scottish Executive Health Department, will monitor progress towards the plan for 2006, providing health boards with support and advice as necessary.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of individual health boards to support staff during the implementation of Agenda for Change, and to keep them up to date with progress.</p>

  <p>Health boards are achieving this in a number of ways, such as presentations with Q &amp; A, drop in sessions, poster campaigns, updates in staff newsletters and regularly updated internet and intranet sites. Staff will be notified individually as to the outcome of job matching/local evaluation in their particular case, and will be advised and supported should they seek a review of that outcome.</p>

  <p>Developments with Agenda for Change at a national level are intimated to health boards by way of bulletins from the Scottish Pay Reference and Implementation Group (SPRIG), who are the partnership body overseeing implementation of Agenda for Change in NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>(a) The information requested is not available.</p>

  <p>The official source of low income data for Scotland is the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) dataset available from 1994-95. This is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The sample size of the FRS in Scotland is relatively small and can only be used to provide information for Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>The following link provides the latest low income headline figures for Scotland (2003-04), together with data for previous years. This was published on 30 March 2005:</p>

  <p>(b) The 2002 Scottish House Condition Survey Local Authority report estimates that approx. 45 000 households in Glasgow are considered as being in fuel poverty.</p>

  <p>The next three-year spending review will take place in 2007 in line with the UK Spending Review. We are undertaking preparatory work to take a fresh look at the policy framework and its implications for resources in the years ahead.</p>

  <p>This work will help us to:</p>

  <p>Identify the key trends to 2011 and beyond, and how best to respond;</p>

  <p>Consider policy priorities in the light of these trends;</p>

  <p>Assess the effectiveness of existing policies and what has been achieved so far, and</p>

  <p>Ensure future spending is clearly based on these priorities.</p>

  <p>This will provide a robust basis for our spending review in 2007.</p>

  <p>Yes. regional selective assistance (RSA) can be used to support businesses of all sizes provided projects satisfy the criteria of the scheme. The criteria include demonstrating the need for assistance to make the project happen in an assisted area rather than elsewhere or not at all. An increasing number of companies, particularly those with a variety of existing overseas facilities, have a credible choice of location for their projects. In such cases we carefully consider the arguments used and satisfy ourselves that there are indeed genuine alternative locations.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the enforcement of anti-littering procedures and the clearance of litter from all roadsides, apart from motorways and special roads, lies with the relevant local authority.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what provisions exist to ensure that staff and passengers on public transport will be protected by the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005, particularly on modes of transport where the driver has responsibility for the vehicle and is the only member of staff in the enclosed driving space.</p>

  <p>Transport operators will need to display &quot;no-smoking&quot; notices as required under the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005 and the Prohibition of Smoking in Certain Premises (Scotland) Regulations 2006. These must state that the vehicle is no-smoking; that it is an offence to smoke there or knowingly to permit smoking there, and name an individual to whom a complaint may be made if someone is observed smoking on the bus. This need not necessarily be the driver of the bus.</p>

  <p>A defence under the legislation is that the person took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence. In order to establish any &quot;due diligence&quot; defence in relation to their statutory obligations under the 2005 Act, transport operators would require to show that they had instituted systems for ensuring compliance and that they had put in place all necessary systems or procedures reasonably available to them. In relation therefore to the offence of permitting others to smoke on public transportation, transport operators could be required to show, for example, that they have procedures in place to remove passengers who refuse to stop smoking. They also need to satisfy themselves that any complaints made to the named person will be followed up and appropriate action taken. Complaints may also be made to a national compliance line which will operate when the legislation comes into effect on 26 March. All complaints will be followed up by the relevant Environmental Health Department, who will decide on the appropriate level of enforcement action to be taken.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive launched A Vision for the Voluntary Sector &ndash; the Next Phase of Our Relationship in December 2005. To help implement the Vision the Scottish Executive has committed to the setting up of a new Cross Department Group, which is currently being established. It is likely that the group will be tasked with a range of activities including, but not solely focusing on, enhancement of the sector&rsquo;s role in the delivery of services. Once the group is established (it is due to meet for the time in spring 2006) it will identify the priority areas on which it will focus.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides local voluntary organisations with support through a wide range of initiatives, including in the area covered by Highland Council. However, the majority of grant funding for local voluntary organisations is provided by local agencies, notably local authorities.</p>
