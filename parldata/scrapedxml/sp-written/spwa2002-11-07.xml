  <p>The Executive is committed to promoting environmentally sustainable farming in a variety of ways. One of the key aims of <i>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</i> , which I launched last year, is better integration of agricultural and environmental objectives. We are taking forward the Custodians of Change report which I commissioned following publication of the Forward Strategy and will be consulting early in the New Year on further proposals to improve the operation of agri-environment schemes.</p>

  <p>Over 1.7 million Ha of agricultural land in Scotland are rented under full tenancy agreements (that is, tenancies under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991 with traditional secure tenants or limited partnership tenants, including minor holdings) (source: <i>Scottish Agricultural Statistics</i> , Scottish Executive, 2001). As I explained in the answer given to question S1W-28914 on 18 October 2002, there were estimated to be around 14,000 full tenancy agreements under the 1991 act active in Scotland in 2001. We do not hold information centrally which subdivides this figure further. On the basis of the above information, we estimate that the average size of a holding under a full tenancy agreement in Scotland is around 120 Ha.</p>

  <p>A Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey estimated that around 64% of such tenanted land is held under 1991 act tenancies with a traditional secure tenant (source: <i>Land Tenure Patterns in Scotland</i>, RICS Scotland, 1995, Table 1). This would mean that around 1 million Ha of agricultural land in Scotland are held under traditional secure 1991 act tenancies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Agricultural Business Development Scheme can be extended to areas outwith the Highlands and Islands and, if not, what other assistance can be available to dairy farmers in north-east Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-11-07.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1107.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>The Agricultural Business Development Scheme (ABDS) is an integral component of the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme and is funded jointly by the Scottish Executive and the European Union. The scheme is only open to those applicants who operate an eligible agricultural business within the programme area. This covers some parts of the north-east of Scotland, including the whole of the Highland Council and some Moray Council areas. I have no plans to extend ABDS outwith the programme area.</p>

  <p>However, farming families with holdings located in parts of Scotland, outwith the programme area, may be eligible to apply for assistance under the Farm Business Development Scheme (FBDS), which is funded by the Scottish Executive. In many respects this scheme is similar to the ABDS. It is a competitive scheme offering variable rates of grant to farming families wishing to diversify or to expand or to improve existing diversified enterprises although, unlike the ABDS, it currently does not provide support for investments in agricultural holdings.</p>

  <p>As you might know, the FBDS was designed by my department in conjunction with partner organisations, including the farming industry. It appears to be performing well. However, I recently commissioned a review to assess its first years&#146; performance and to consider whether any improvements to it are needed. The review, which includes full consultation with our partners, is scheduled to report to me early in the New Year. I will of course inform the Parliament should any significant changes emerge.</p>

  <p>The length of time taken to approve an application varies between cases. It depends on such things as whether the applicant is an owner-occupier or private tenant, in which case the landlord&#146;s permission must be sought. The length of time between an application being approved and the central heating going in also varies between cases. It depends on such things as whether a new fuel type has been chosen, in which case planning permission may be required before it can be provided. In all cases the number of central heating systems installed each year is dependent on the budget for the programme.</p>

  <p>The Executive is keen to encourage both men and women to take up careers in childcare. In 2000 it launched <i>Childcare: The Training Challenge - An Action Plan for the Training and Development of Workers in Early Education, Childcare and Playwork</i> . It has also published <i>Working With Children</i> , a guide to qualifications and careers in early education and childcare. Both of these publications make it clear that we welcome men working in childcare.</p>

  <p>In March 2002 I announced an additional &#163;9.2 million for the period 2002-04, which will be allocated to local authorities for the expansion and development of the early years workforce. In the Scottish Budget additional resources were identified and for 2004-05 and 2005-06 the amount allocated to local authorities for this purpose will increase again to &#163;6 million each year. The Executive will write to local authorities giving examples of areas that the funding can be used for, and one area that we will highlight is increasing the diversity of the early years workforce.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of Scottish Court Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Court Service commissioned access consultants to undertake an audit of the court estate to determine the scale and extent of work required throughout the estate to ensure compliance with Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act. That process identified a number of areas where the consultants believed that modification of the court estate could be beneficial to courts users with a disability. These recommendations are currently being examined to determine their feasibility and cost of implementation. There are no plans to publish the audit results.</p>

  <p>Details of the resources for the Scottish Court Service were published in the <i>Building a Better Scotland &#150; Spending Proposals 2003-2006: What the Money Buys</i>. Additional funds have been made available to enable the Scottish Court Service to accommodate pressures on its capital programme. This funding will, in part, be used to provide improved facilities for the disabled in the court estate. The cost of the programme of works required is being assessed. Funds have not been specifically allocated to individual court buildings as the programme of works will be developed and implemented on an estate wide basis.</p>

  <p>Separate from these recommendations the Scottish Executive is involved in a series of initiatives to improve standards in English and related subjects throughout the school curriculum - including Higher English.</p>

  <p>Recent survey information suggests that Scotland is a safer place to live compared to the rest of the UK, not only for older people but also generally, and that the fear of crime amongst older people is also lower.</p>

  <p>We have set a target to reduce the fear of crime or seriousness of worry about crime in the justice section of the recently published <i>Building a Better Scotland &#150; Spending Proposals 2003-06</i>. Whilst no specific target or date has been set for this to be achieved, we aim to reduce the fear of crime for all in our communities by successfully meeting other targets within the same proposals to reduce specific areas of serious crime. This should have a positive effect on how safe our communities feel. We shall use the Scottish Crime Survey 2004 results to measure progress.</p>

  <p>The recent findings published by Scottish Gas and Help the Aged support data from the Scottish Crime Survey which suggest that Scotland is a safer place to live not only for older people but also generally. However, whilst our statistics tend to confirm that older people in Scotland are almost half as likely to be victims of violent crime as those in England and Wales, the level of fear of crime amongst older people in Scotland, whilst still lower than England and Wales, is disproportionate to the level of crime they experience. This message needs to be reinforced and the additional investment we are making to tackle serious crime, such as violence and drugs, the measures we have introduced and the targets we have set to reduce these and other crimes should have a positive effect on how our communities feel.</p>

So the position may change from day to day.</p>

  <p>Fishing vessel licences are issued by the Fisheries Departments in the UK on the basis of a vessel&#146;s port of administration, as set out in arrangements notified to the industry in June 1999.

  <p>A range of measures are in place to support the retention and recruitment of GPs in remote and rural areas. New GPs joining the NHS in remote and rural areas get the standard &#163;5,000 &quot;Golden Hello&quot; payment and a further &#163;5,000 as a special remote and rural supplement.</p>

  <p>Personal Medical Services pilots offer particular advantages to remote and rural practices by tailoring working arrangements and GP contracts to specific practice needs - we are investing &#163;18.5 million over three years in the initiative. The Inducement Payment Scheme tops up rural GPs&#146; salaries. The Associate Allowance helps single handed GPs to employ an associate, and the Scottish Rural Practice Fund compensates GPs for time spent visiting patients in scattered practices. Locum allowances enable GPs to attend educational courses and assist with the costs of out-of-hours cover.</p>

Currently discussions are under way with NHS 24 about its potential role as a single national source of patient information and advice.</p>

  <p>Consideration of the consultative response has confirmed substantial drawbacks to any attempt to legislate in this area. Legislation would be contrary to the fundamental principles of Scots law, in particular that leased land under a short lease reverts to the landlord at expiry of the lease and that property built on leased land belongs to the landlord; legislation could not be retrospective or applicable to hutters only, and its promotion might precipitate changes to the ownership and management of comparable estates in Scotland which would be profoundly damaging to the interests of hutters.</p>

  <p>We are aware that constructive discussions continue at local level to resolve the difficulties at Carbeth. It would not be appropriate for the Executive to seek to intervene in private negotiations between landlord and tenants, but we would encourage local resolution of such difficulties.</p>

  <p>No. As stated in the Executive&#146;s consultation paper <i>on Renewing Local Democracy: The Next Steps</i> published earlier this year, there are no plans to review local authority boundaries in the foreseeable future.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many acute psychiatric beds have been available in each NHS board area in each of the last five years.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to determine from national information the number of beds available specifically for acute psychiatric care. Nationally, beds are classified by clinical specialty and by clinical facility (e.g. standard specialty ward, adolescent unit) only. The following table shows the trend in daily average available beds in all psychiatric specialties excluding Psychiatry of Old Age. In the latter specialty the majority of patients using hospital beds will be in hospital for non-acute reasons. It should also be noted that some of the available beds in general psychiatry, which are included in the table, will be occupied by patients receiving continuing care.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to determine from national sources patients who were treated specifically in beds allocated for acute care. The following table shows the total number of individuals who were informally admitted to a psychiatric hospital or unit, excluding patients admitted to the specialty of Psychiatry of Old Age, on at least one occasion during the year specified.

  <p>One hundred and forty nurses or midwives have returned or are in the process of returning to practice as a result of the introduction of the funded managed implementation programme in six board areas since March 2002.

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The total value of estate development projects completed at HM Prison Aberdeen in the last five years is about &#163;2 million. Options for upgrading the existing health centre are currently being evaluated.</p>

  <p>The Executive has set a national target of 25% recycling and composting of municipal waste by 2006. Eleven Area Waste Plans are being prepared which show how waste will be managed over the next 20 years including measures for recycling. The Executive has allocated over &#163;230 million in the next three years in the Strategic Waste Fund for local authorities to implement the Area Waste Plans.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has also commissioned research to identify possible incentives for householders in Scotland to improve their waste practices.</p>

  <p>The Executive intends to make provision in the Local Government Bill for local authorities to draw up Integrated Waste Management Plans, based on the National Waste Strategy and Area Waste Plans. The Executive will have the power to set targets in these plans, and to revise these plans to ensure that targets, such as those for recycling, are met.</p>

  <p>The new Sandyford Toll roundabout at the A77/A719 junction is, in common with all other alterations to the trunk road network, subject to a Road Safety Audit (RSA) procedure. The third stage in this procedure is a site examination once the works have been opened to traffic.</p>

  <p>The RSA, which took place on 21 October, identified a number of measures which could further enhance safety at the roundabout and these have been programmed for completion in week ending 15 November. Yellow transverse bar markings are currently being designed for implementation on the trunk road approaches to the roundabout.</p>

  <p>Our vision for rural Scotland, published in May 2000, stressed the importance of improving the lives of all those living in rural areas. This included our determination to ensure that our rural areas attract and retain young people to live and work there &#150; to ensure that &quot;getting on need not mean going away&quot;. To realise that vision, we have in place a range of measures across all Scottish Executive portfolios.</p>

  <p>We are increasing employment opportunities through support for rural economic development, improving the provision of child care and school education in rural areas, and increasing opportunities for further and higher education. We are tackling social exclusion, improving the provision of transport in rural areas and improving housing conditions through our community ownership programme. For example, the proposed transfer of Scottish Borders Council&#146;s housing to Scottish Borders Housing Association will generate around &#163;82 million investment in the first 10 years to repair and modernise the housing stock. The knock-on effect of this substantial investment is expected to be more local jobs and training opportunities.</p>

  <p>HEBS evaluates the media impacts of their teens advertising programme through the Teen Tracking Survey, which is carried out every two months with a monthly sample of 300 people aged 12 to 17. Key measures are awareness, understanding of message and emotional response to the ads, with interviews carried out in respondents&#146; homes. Qualitative post-testing is also carried out to explore in greater depth audience responses to the advertising, and this information then feeds into future planning and development. All evaluation research is carried out by independent agencies, which ensures objectivity and critical reflection.</p>

  <p>Awareness of Club Smoking stands at around 74%. Of those respondents, 79% said that "the ad made me think about health issues" and 71% said that "this ad really sticks in my mind". Furthermore, 77% believed "this ad will convince people that even occasional smokers can become addicted" and 73% said "I could relate to what is going on in the ad".</p>

  <p>Parliamentary Headquarters (George IV Bridge)</p>

  <p>Committee Chambers</p>

  <p>Cannonball House</p>

  <p>369 and 375 High Street</p>

  <p>Under the current arrangements options to renew are not necessary, as these contracts continue on a monthly basis unless and until terminated by mutual agreement. Discussions are on-going with the City of Edinburgh Council as to an end date consistent with the migration to the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood. These discussions will incorporate a review of rent. Annual rentals payable in advance of this review are as follows:</p>

  <p>Parliamentary Headquarters (George IV Bridge) &#150; &#163;763,281.48</p>

  <p>Committee Chambers - &#163;214,395.60</p>

  <p>Cannonball House - &#163;37,622.76</p>

  <p>369 and 375 High Street - &#163;122,957.52</p>

  <p>A contract, with an option to extend, exists with the Church of Scotland in respect of the Scottish Parliament&#146;s occupation of the Assembly Hall. Current rent payable is &#163;110,000 per year, payable in equal quarterly amounts. In terms of the contract, a rent review is currently under way. The option to extend has been exercised and negotiations are on-going on a suitable expiry date in relation to migration to Holyrood.</p>

  <p>Contracts also exist in respect of two properties at the Tun development in Holyrood Road, Edinburgh. The first of these provides office accommodation and will expire on 28 May 2017, although a break clause was negotiated allowing the contract to be terminated on 28 May 2004. This will allow the Holyrood Project Team to continue to operate after occupation of the new building. The current annual rent payable in respect of this property is &#163;69,590. The other contract is in respect of the Visitor Centre and will expire on 28 August 2004. The annual rent payable amounts to &#163;24,750.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body also holds a licence for occupation of office accommodation at the MWB Business Exchange in St Andrew Square. The licence will expire on 31 July 2003 but may be extended. The current annual rental of &#163;718,650 will increase to &#163;754,582 from 1 January 2003.</p>

  <p>Members will note the substantial reduction in rental expenditure expected after occupying the new building.</p>
