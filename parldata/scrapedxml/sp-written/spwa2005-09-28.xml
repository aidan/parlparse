  <p>We are currently considering the options for dealing with the issues arising from interposed leases in relation to crofting land that crofting communities wish to purchase under part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003.

  <p>I am aware that the issue of land management contract application forms this year did coincide with the lambing season. It was precisely for this reason, and the desire to give farmers and crofters more time to reflect on what options best suited their individual businesses, that the deadline was extended to 6 June.</p>

  <p>In 2006, the intention is to issue land management contract application forms as part of the process covering the submission of Single Application Forms under the Integrated Administration and Control System. Farmers and crofters are very familiar with this process, and my department aim to issue all forms in mid-March for return by 15 May.</p>

  <p>Participants in the scheme are not required to provide information on their organic status and my department does not hold a register of organically-certified farmers and crofters. Therefore I cannot provide information on their participation in the Land Management Contract Menu (LMC) Scheme. Overlap between some of the LMC measures and the pre existing Organic Aid Scheme means that many organic farmers and crofters are already being paid for measures available to others under the LMC.</p>

  <p>No licences have been granted by the Executive to cull buzzards.

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) closely monitor the attainment levels of minority ethnic pupils to ensure that emerging trends and patterns are identified.</p>

  <p>Attainment data by ethnic background for S4 pupils in local authority schools has been published annually since March 2004. Pupil level information was not available prior to this. The March 2005 publication, <i>SQA Attainment and School Leaver Qualifications in Scotland: 2003/04</i>, is available via the Scottish Executive website &ndash; <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/04/04160342/03445" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/04/04160342/03445</a>.</p>

  <p>A copy is also available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 36264).</p>

  <p>The total number of manufacturing jobs which have been created through inward investment in Scotland and Glasgow is not collected. However, Scottish Development International (SDI) does provide information on the number of jobs planned to be created and safeguarded in different industry sectors through projects supported by SDI.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of planned jobs created for manufacturing sectors over the last five years, and the number of planned jobs created in the Glasgow postcode area over the same period. It should be noted that not all jobs created by a manufacturing project are necessarily manufacturing jobs.</p>

  <p>The Executive was advised of the decision on the day of its publication. However, the decision has no relevance for the tendering of the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services and the Executive was aware of this from its involvement in the lengthy consultation leading up to the publication of the decision. Paragraph 18 of the preamble to the decision makes it clear that subsidies in the maritime area must &quot;also respect the sectoral rules contained in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 when applicable&quot;. It is to comply with Council Regulation 3577/92 (the Maritime Cabotage Regulation) that the Executive has decided to tender the services currently provided by Caledonian MacBrayne.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the statement made by the UK Government in its response to the European Commission&rsquo;s Green Paper on Services of General Interest of May 2003, that the proposed model of splitting Caledonian MacBrayne into an infrastructure-owning company and an operating company creates &quot;an artificial barrier&quot; that &quot;distances the development of the fleet from its operation&quot;.</p>

  <p>The UK Government&rsquo;s response reflected the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s position at that time in relation to the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services. Given the constraints that European law imposes, this does not detract from the Executive view that the best way to tender the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services is through the establishment of a publicly-owned vessel and harbour owning company. This will ensure that the assets are retained in public ownership and made available on a long-term basis to the operator of the services.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised me that it has recently undertaken a country of origin survey to investigate whether the best practice advice issued in the agency&rsquo;s guidance document <i>Food Labelling Country of Origin Guidance</i> (published in 2002) is being followed in the market place. The survey sampled own-brand supermarket products and branded top sellers. The report is currently being finalised and will be published in September 2005.</p>

  <p>It is also likely that an EC review of food labelling legislation, which is currently underway, will address country of origin labelling. The agency supports an extension of country of origin labelling beyond the range of products covered by vertical Directives. In addition, it is important that this information is not misleading, for example when the origin of product and its primary ingredients differ. The agency recognises some of the difficulties involved in this area and the need to define terms such as &quot;produce of&quot;, &quot;provenance&quot; and &quot;origin&quot;. Furthermore, there is a need for any additional country of origin information to be clear and assessed for costs and benefits before any specific proposals are made.</p>

  <p>The Environmental Rural Affairs Department has advised me that they intend to consult shortly on a proposal to require the food service sector to inform consumers about the origin of beef, which they serve.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to amend its procurement rules. The policy and guidance is that purchasers should specify in orders and contracts that suppliers must provide evidence that timber has been lawfully obtained from forests or plantations that are being sustainably managed. Forest certification schemes are a useful guide to purchasers trying to establish whether these criteria have been met, and the Executive accepts the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs&rsquo; (Defra) assessment of which schemes provide acceptable assurances. PEFC and SFI have lifted their standards and following an assessment, Defra has added them to its list of acceptable schemes and will be monitoring their performance.</p>

  <p>However, in line with the commitment that I gave in November 2004, officials of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service have completed the review process and have attended to the required editing of those documents. The redacted documents will be deposited with the National Archives of Scotland this week and will be available for inspection by members of the public from Monday 3 October 2005.</p>

  <p>The editing involved the removal from the documents the names of living individuals and replacing with individual designations, such as &quot;Witness 1&quot; or &quot;Child A&quot; to preserve anonymity but ensure that the edited documents would still make sense to any reader. The process of simply removing an individual&rsquo;s name, in some documents, did not preserve anonymity. It was also considered that some of the documents contained distressing information about the victims and it is therefore not possible for each and every document to be released, even in an edited manner. The Closure Order in respect of files one to four will therefore remain in place for the specified period of 100 years. Files one to four contain profiles, photographs, medical reports and post mortem reports of the injured and deceased respectively. All of the other documents, in their redacted format, will be made available to the public.</p>

  <p>Through its various Patient Focus Public Involvement (PFPI) activities, NHS 24 acknowledges the valuable contributions that &quot;expert patients&quot;, carers and representative groups make to the service that is provided and how it can be improved. The organisation has frequent contact with various groups and individuals and actively encourages community councils, patient representative groups and others to engage in the service improvement initiatives.</p>

  <p>Feedback is already helping NHS 24 to redesign elements of its service, including to the patient journey and access to NHS 24 and the wider NHS services. Improved patient information, such as the Help the Aged booklet and posters and leaflets designed to help people who are profoundly deaf, hard of hearing or who have speech impairments, as well as those provided in minority ethnic languages.</p>

  <p>These initiatives have been carried out in partnership with users and will be built on as the service develops.</p>

  <p>Of final interest, NHS 24 is currently involved in a series of exploratory discussions with the Scottish Executive seeking to improve use of the range of National Helplines available, and to ascertain where NHS 24 expertise could provide a better and more direct service to patients and specific community groups.</p>

  <p>The information asked for is not collected in the requested format. The data available on violence is published on the Scottish Health Statistics website under Workforce Statistics, <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a> .</p>

  <p>Section A gives details of the overall summary of Workforce Statistics in NHS Scotland. In particular, table A8 shows the number of occupational injuries by staff group and type of organisation. Latest available figures are at 31 March 2004.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many people waited for more than 100 days for a hernia operation in each year since 1999, broken down by NHS board.</p>

  <p>The majority of patients who require in-patient and day case treatment, including hernia operations, are treated quickly. Nearly 55% of patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals receive immediate treatment and never join a waiting list. Of those who do wait 41% are admitted within one month and almost 70% within three months.</p>

  <p>For those who wait longer, the current national maximum waiting time is nine months. This guaranteed waiting time will be reduced to six months from the end of 2005 and to 18 weeks from the end of 2007. On 30 June 2005, no NHSScotland patient with a guarantee had waited more than nine months for in-patient and day case treatment.</p>

  <p>The deferred waiting list was abolished on 1 April 2003. Prior to that date, patients admitted for treatment from the deferred list were excluded from any analysis of published retrospective waiting time data. Consequently, as the data prior to 1 April would not be directly comparable with later years, information has only been provided for 2003-04 and 2004-05. The information provided is derived from data on patients treated during the year and includes patients who will have had an Availability Status Code (ASC) applied, for example because they were medically unfit or asked for their admission to be deferred for personal reasons. The following table shows the number of patients who had waited more than a 100 days for a hernia operation in the years ending 31 March 2004 and 2005, by NHS board of residence.</p>

  <p>National Statistics came into force in June 2000 and the Code of Practice was issued in 2002. Information on breaches of the Code of Practice are published each year in the Chief Statistician&rsquo;s Annual Report, which can be accessed via the links below. Six breaches occurred between 2002-03 and 2003-04. All but one of these breaches occurred because information was released before publication date, and were not incidents where information was amended or withheld. The remaining breach was due to a technical problem resulting in data not being available on time.</p>

  <p>Although the code of practice was in draft at this time, it was reported that, as in the 2001 report, there were no breaches of the principles of the code.</p>

  <p>Three breaches were reported.</p>

  <p>2004-05<strong>:</strong> The Chief Statistician&rsquo;s 2005 Annual Report is due to published later this year and will report that there were no breaches in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>2005-06<strong>:</strong> The Chief Statistician is currently investigating a recent breach of the Code of Practice.</p>

  <p>As Mr Canavan will recollect, the current allowances scheme was considered, and approved, by the Parliament in 2001. The Edinburgh accommodation allowance would only be reviewed in the context of a general review of the members' allowances scheme.</p>
