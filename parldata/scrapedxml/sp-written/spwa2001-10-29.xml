  <p>In Scotland, everyone who currently contributes towards the cost of their personal care, whether at home or in a care home setting, will benefit from the introduction of free personal care. There will also be an expansion of personal care services in the community.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Manufacturing Steering Group was successful in identifying a number of initiatives to support manufacturing as set out in <i>Created in Scotland</i> . The Manufacturing Image Group has also taken forward key initiatives.</p>

  <p>Other initiatives are currently being actioned by the Scottish Executive and its agencies. Good progress has already been made, with some of the initiatives having been fully completed. The details of progress against each initiative is set out in a table which is on the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department website and will be updated on a quarterly basis. The members of the Scottish Manufacturing Steering Group will also be informed of progress.</p>

  <p>A new UK Manufacturing Summit is planned for later in the autumn and we plan to review the role of the Scottish Manufacturing Steering Group and the respective roles of the Executive and its agencies in the light of the emerging UK framework.</p>

  <p>We are currently carrying out a final consultation on the detail of the Renewables Obligation (Scotland), or ROS, which we hope to implement from January 2002. The ROS will place a statutory obligation on Scotland&#8217;s electricity suppliers to provide a specified proportion of their electricity from renewable sources, and will encourage the building of many more renewable energy projects, including wind farms. The objective is to ensure that around 18% of Scotland&#8217;s electricity comes from renewable sources by 2010.</p>

  <p>In addition, we have revised the National Planning Policy Guidelines on Renewable Energy, which now provide a planning framework within which developers and planning authorities can work together. These guidelines have been warmly welcomed by the renewables industry and local authorities alike.</p>

  <p>The criteria outlined in the Coaching Certificate were laid down on 12 February 2000 when Amateur Boxing Scotland Ltd (ABS Ltd) replaced the former Scottish Amateur Boxing Association and the Scottish Amateur Boxing Federation. The criteria are kept under review and updated as required. They will be reviewed by ABS Ltd&#8217;s newly appointed National Coach for the Commonwealth Games and the Director of Development.</p>

  <p>Those involved in setting and monitoring the requirements of the Coaching Certificate must be working towards the Boxing Advanced Certificate or equivalent. In addition they must have worked with junior or senior boxers and have good management, written and oral skills.</p>

  <p>The marketing of Scotland as a golf tourism destination is and will continue to be a high priority. VisitScotland has reviewed its marketing strategy in the light of the 11 September events and will target its campaigns carefully in order to maximise opportunities. Funding for VisitScotland is at a record level.</p>
