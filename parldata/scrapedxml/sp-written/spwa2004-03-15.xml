  <p>Local authorities are responsible for the provision of schools. It is for them to consider whether joint campus facilities are appropriate, in consultation with local communities, parents, schools and church representatives. We will support such proposals where they are in the best interests of pupils, and take account of local circumstances and views.</p>

  <p>The Forestry Commission is a cross border public authority, and is not subject to triennial review.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland, which serves as the Executive's forestry department, was set up following the recommendations of the forestry devolution review on 1 April 2003. At the same time Forest Enterprise, which was originally set up as an Executive agency on 1 April 1996 with a Great Britain remit, was trisected on 1 April 2003 to create separate agencies in Scotland, England and Wales.</p>

  <p>Following a review of the appropriate status for Forest Enterprise in Scotland, Ministers decided that continuation as an Executive agency of Forestry Commission Scotland was the most appropriate course of action. A draft framework document will shortly be submitted to ministers.</p>

  <p>The framework document will be reviewed by the national committee no later than 31 March 2007.</p>

  <p>Where more than one application is received from medical practitioners for a general practice vacancy by a NHS board it is required to select the candidate it wishes to be referred to the Scottish Medical Practices Committee. The National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 apply. It is open to a board to establish its own committee to consider applications, and, where appropriate, to interview candidates. The regulations require the board to forward the selected application to the Scottish Medical Practices Committee once the period for appeals by any doctor whose application has not been selected has expired without any appeal being made.</p>

  <p>The Committee is required by the regulations to grant the application which has been selected by the board. Cases do not come before ministers except where there is an appeal. The selection of candidates is a matter for the board and the criteria which the regulations lay down are that the board shall have regard to any desire expressed by an applicant to practise with other general practitioners in the locality or as an additional doctor who may be required in the area or any desire expressed by other doctors in the locality to take any applicant into practice with them. The board shall have special regard to these matters in cases where any applicant is a relative of a general practitioner in the locality.</p>

  <p>The National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 set out the procedures to fill general practice vacancies. It is open to any registered medical practitioner to apply for such a vacancy. The regulations require the NHS board to describe the details of the practice in a notice of vacancy and these will include whether the out-going GP practised alone. They also provide that any applicant may indicate whether he or she, if selected, intends to practise with other doctors and so any practice which was vacated by a single-handed GP may become part of a group practice.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of vacancies which arose in single GP practices is not available. The total number of vacancies which have been filled in the last five years for which information is available is as follows:</p>

  <p>This information is not available in the format requested. Since 2 October 2000, applications for warrants for interception of communications have been made under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which replaced the Interception of Communications Act 1985. The power to sign warrants under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 was executively devolved to the Scottish Ministers on 13 December 2000.</p>

  <p>Details of the number of interception warrants issued by the Scottish Ministers are contained in the annual reports of the Interception of Communication Commissioner, which are laid before the Parliament. The most recent annual report was laid before the Parliament on 9 September 2003, and copies were placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 29093).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-3977 by Nicol Stephen on 21 November 2003, whether it now anticipates that there will not be any significant increase in traffic volumes on ancillary roads as a result of the proposed online upgrade of the A80, in light of the traffic incident at Haggs Interchange on 18 February 2004 and the resultant congestion on ancillary roads surrounding Cumbernauld, and what the reasons are for the position on the matter.</p>

  <p>The recent incident required an unplanned temporary carriageway closure of the A80 for safety reasons during peak traffic hours. The proposed upgrade works will maintain two way, two lane traffic flows at peak times. This means that there will not be any significant increase in traffic volume on ancillary roads as a result of the planned works.</p>

Data provided includes an analysis of VisitScotland marketing campaigns by market, customer group and product group.

  <p>Visitscotland.com became aware of the problems experienced by AOL users approximately four months ago. Visitscotland.com worked closely with AOL to identify the source of the problem. It was established that the problem was one of compatibility between the configuration used by visitscotland.com and that used by AOL (although both were industry approved). A solution has now been found, involving a reconfiguration of the visitscotland.com technical infrastructure.</p>

  <p>The operation of the feeder bus service is the responsibility of Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT). SPT have various procedures in place for monitoring all of its contracted bus services.</p>

  <p>The Croy Interlink services commenced operating on 29 September 2002; from the information supplied to SPT by the contractor the use of the service has been as follows. For the 72 weeks up to 21 February 2004, the average number of passengers for Sundays (when a reduced service operates) was 28 (total 1992), for Mondays 101 (total 7,268), for Tuesdays 111 (total 7,965), for Wednesdays 118 (total 8,489), for Thursdays 100 (total 7,186), for Fridays 119 (total 8,537), and for Saturdays 84 (total 6,051). The overall total number of passengers carried since the service started has therefore been 47,488.</p>

  <p>From the information available, it is not possible to break these figures down into different time periods for each day.</p>
