  <p>At a strategic level, the Scottish Government published a discussion paper in June, setting out a wide ranging set of actions and proposals to tackle alcohol misuse amongst young people and the wider population.</p>

  <p>Action includes supporting schools and local authorities in a number of ways. This includes the establishment of an expert steering group on substance misuse education in schools to produce advice, guidance and proposals aimed at helping schools and authorities to achieve the improvements sought through Curriculum for Excellence. The Scottish Government is developing new guidance, <em>Included, Engaged and Involved: Part 2</em> which will focus on the prevention and management of exclusion from school.</p>

  <p>Actions to tackle alcohol-related issues within schools in the mid Scotland and Fife parliamentary region is a matter for the particular individual local authorities concerned. Therefore, the information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>There were a number of management options for set-aside land, including using the land to grow crops for non-food use. Not all of these options delivered high-value environmental benefits or created ideal habitat for bees. It is therefore difficult to estimate, particularly in the short term, the effect which the ending of set-aside will have on bees or other species.</p>

  <p>The ending of set-aside has been discussed at CAP Stakeholders Group meetings, and we are currently considering whether options can be developed to retain some of the environmental benefits which were produced as a by-product of set-aside. We will consider, as part of that process, concerns about the habitat of bees and other creatures. In the meantime, the Scotland Rural Development Programme contains a number of biodiversity priorities which are designed to encourage farmers to deliver targeted environmental benefits.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W&ndash;11422 by Stewart Maxwell on 24 April 2008, what the average daily waiting times was under the central heating programme in each of the last three months in (a) the Glasgow Rutherglen parliamentary constituency and (b) Scotland.</p>

  <p>Information is not held by parliamentary constituency area, but for Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>The average waiting time during 2008-09 remains around six months. So far, the average daily waiting time for all those that have received a central heating system, this year, is 179 days. At no point since the inception of the programme in 2001 has the average waiting time been less than five months.</p>

  <p>Those waiting longest continue to be a priority. This has reduced their number, but has the effect of distorting the average waiting time figure.</p>

  <p>The average daily waiting time for those who received a central heating system in each of the last three months, as notified by the managing agent (Scottish Gas), is shown in the following table:</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The &quot;Average Waiting Time&quot; is the average time a householder has waited between application and the month in which their system was installed.</p>

  <p>2. Figures for November 2008 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>3. The number of householders waiting more than six months (1,185) is less now than it was at the same time last year (2,788).</p>

  <p>The Scottish European Green Energy Centre will complement and co-ordinate the range of work already undertaken by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s existing departments and agencies in the development of green energy, with a specifically European dimension.</p>

  <p>It will do this by providing a stronger focus and dedicated resources to proactively engage Scottish researchers, companies and government agencies in European energy policy and associated funding opportunities. This will enable Scottish organisations to access the dedicated expertise required to effectively track and influence this policy environment and develop projects for funding.</p>

  <p>The centre will also have a specific focus to disseminate the results of Scottish and other collaborative green energy research across the European Union, raising the profile of Scottish expertise, and capitalising on the significant market opportunities for the green energy sector.</p>

  <p>The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), on behalf of the Scottish Government, are working with retailers, manufacturers and leading supermarkets through the Courtauld Commitment to reduce the amount of packaging used and sold. Earlier in 2008 the signatories to the Courtauld Commitment reported that packaging waste growth had halted. There is now a commitment to deliver a reduction in packaging waste by March 2010.</p>

  <p>WRAP is also working closely with industry to ensure that where plastic packaging is used the packaging is optimised in terms of weight and functionality and designed so that it can easily be reused or recycled.</p>

  <p>In the case of plastic bags, the Scottish Government has secured a commitment from retailers in Scotland to reduce carrier bag usage by 50% by Spring 2009.</p>

  <p>Work with the Scottish Waste Awareness Group (SWAG) includes the provision of information on packaging for consumers on SWAG&rsquo;s web site so that the public is better informed about the role of packaging, how to avoid unnecessary packaging and how to complain about excess packaging.</p>

  <p>Guidance issued in 2005 recommends that public bodies should support fair trade and explains how this can be done within procurement legislation by inviting suppliers to include fair trade options in their tenders and by working on a voluntary basis with suppliers once contracts have been awarded.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government leads by example to the public sector and has successfully put this guidance into practice. By working with the catering contractor, the Scottish Government currently offers a wide range of Fairtrade or ethically traded products (including tea, coffee, sugar, juice and snacks) in its staff restaurants. In addition, Fairtrade tea, coffee and sugar are used as standard hospitality for meetings.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally although all public agencies have received a copy of the guidance issued in 2005 recommending that they should support Fair Trade.</p>

  <p>Research indicates that, at present, eight local authorities in Scotland have achieved Fair Trade Zone status. These are Aberdeen, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Glasgow and Stirling.</p>

  <p>Routine guidance on fentanyl patches is not issued to NHS boards. However, guidance is available to health professionals from a number of sources. Importantly, the British National Formulary (BNF) provides key information on the selection, prescribing, dispensing and administration of medicines. The BNF is issued free to prescribers in Scotland and can be accessed at <a href="http://www.bnf.org" target="_blank">www.bnf.org</a></p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has issued a guideline on the <em>Control of pain in adults with cancer</em>. The advice in this guideline includes the use of fentanyl patches. The guideline can be accessed at <a href="http://www.sign.ac.uk" target="_blank">www.sign.ac.uk</a></p>

  <p>In September 2008, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency issued a drug alert to healthcare professionals alerting them to a recall of lonsys lontophoretic transdermal system - fentanyl 40 micrograms per dose. This drug alert covered Scotland.</p>

  <p>Other sources of guidance and advice on the use of medicines include the Scottish Medicines Consortium <a href="http://www.scottishmedicines.org" target="_blank">www.scottishmedicines.org</a> and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland:</p>

Phase 1 of the campaign started in mid-October 2008 prior to the launch of the Home Report and runs until mid-December.

  <p>The growth of the wind energy sector is providing a platform for the growth of new technologies and a catalyst for the development of a grid infrastructure which will allow us to export some of Scotland&rsquo;s massive green energy potential from a wide-range of renewable sources, thus contributing to future energy security in Scotland and in Europe. An increase in renewable energy capacity will have a beneficial impact on grid security in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Similarly, meeting a greater share of our energy needs from wind and other renewables will reduce emissions and help achieve Scottish and European climate change targets.</p>

  <p>The concordat between Scottish Government and COSLA established a new way of working based upon mutual respect, trust and partnership. The concordat makes it clear that it is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate resources on the basis of local needs and priorities, including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will work with COSLA and local authorities to provide support and resolve problems associated with non-achievement of agreed outcomes.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s beautiful and varied coastline and its wide-range of attractions feature as one of the main activities participated in by visitors to Scotland. VisitScotland&rsquo;s Visitor Experience Survey for 2008 reveals that 52% of UK visitors and 58% of Scots on holiday in Scotland said they had explored Scotland&rsquo;s beaches and coastline, although only 4% of the latter said they had explored Scottish beaches and castles as the main purpose of their trip.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold comprehensive information on this subject. However estimates of the value to the economy of some types of outdoor recreation for some areas of Scotland are available from the British Marine Federation, the World Wildlife Fund and other organisations.</p>

  <p>For example, the federation estimate that the annual economic impact of the marine leisure industry in Scotland is &pound;250 million, supporting around 7,000 jobs, with sailing accounting for &pound;130 million of this. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that coastal tourism in Scotland contributes &pound;375 million to the economy. Sportscotland estimates that sea angling is worth around &pound;150 million, and we are near the end of a study to give us a more precise estimate, while recreational diving is worth upwards of &pound;5 million.</p>

  <p>At the local level, quite small economic impacts can have a major benefit. The Tiree Wave Classic is supported by EventScotland and is estimated to bring &pound;1 million to the Tiree economy each year. The Fife Coast and Countryside Trust estimate that between 480,000 and 580,000 visitors used the Fife Coastal Path between July 2005 and June 2006, generating between &pound;24 million and &pound;29 million of revenues, and supporting 800 to 900 jobs in Fife.</p>

  <p>The concordat between Scottish Government and COSLA has established a new way of working based on mutual respect, trust and partnership. The concordat makes it clear that it is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate resources on the basis of local needs and priorities, including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>The funding from the previously ring-fenced Strategic Waste Fund, plus money from the Zero Waste Fund, and the overall additional funding package resulting from the 2007 Spending review is considered sufficient to meet both landfill directive and zero waste targets for 2010.</p>

  <p>As regards longer term targets, Scottish Government and COSLA are currently discussing how best to ensure that waste management targets are achieved. Whilst those discussions are ongoing the penalties associated with the Landfill Allowance Scheme have been temporarily suspended.</p>

  <p>Funding has also been made available to Eco Schools and for local authority food waste trials. In addition, various community based projects have also benefited from funding provided through the INCREASE III programme which is administered and delivered by WRAP and CRNS.</p>

  <p>It would be expected that the baseline survey commissioned to support a proposal be guided by existing information on those species protected by national and international legislation (Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, Bern Convention, Habitats Directive including European Protected Species) and listed as UKBAP (UK Biodiversity Action Plan) Priority Species or British Red Data Book species, and those outwith the British Red Data Book but with nationally, regionally or locally scarce status.</p>
