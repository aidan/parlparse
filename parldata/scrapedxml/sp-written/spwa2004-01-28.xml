  <p>Responsibility for billing and collecting council tax rests with local authorities. Council tax in-year collection rates have improved year on year since 1998-99. In recent years, the Scottish Executive has introduced legislation to allow the advancement of the instalment scheme to April rather than May and have allowed councils to combine reminder and final notices to allow recovery procedures to begin earlier. These were recommendations which came out of the joint COSLA/Scottish Executive working group report &quot;It Pays to Pay&quot; published in December 1999.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and its agencies are bound by the rules of the Civil Service Commissioners Code on Recruitment against which we are audited. The Code exists to ensure that recruitment to the Civil Service is fair and open, and is conducted in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>

  <p>The retirement practice age for all Scottish Executive staff is 60 years and, in line with this, applications for employment are not normally considered from candidates over 60. This policy is currently under review.</p>

  <p>In line with the Executive&#8217;s equal opportunities policy, we do not discriminate on grounds of age. It is also our aim to become an organisation that broadly reflects the people of Scotland in all aspects of diversity, including age, and, to this end, we are currently reviewing our Diversity Strategy to ensure that continues to support this aim.</p>

  <p>Information is not available in the format requested.</p>

  <p>There are a variety of alternative dispute resolution processes, including direct negotiation, arbitration, mediation and conciliation, and the use of Ombudsmen and regulators. The Executive has recently legislated to establish a new Scottish Public Sector Ombudsman, providing a &quot;one stop shop&quot; in place of several previous bodies.</p>

  <p>Other recent initiatives by the Executive in this area include:</p>

  <p>SE funding for family Mediation Scotland (c. &#163;700,000 per annum);</p>

  <p>SE funding for the Edinburgh In-Court Advice and Mediation Service (&#163;22,000 p.a.). The Executive is currently considering whether to extend funding for mediation, possibly through further pilots;</p>

  <p>Changes to Sheriff Court Rules in Glasgow to allow sheriffs to refer commercial actions for alternative dispute resolution where appropriate;</p>

  <p>SE Procurement Directorate has issued guidance for contractors endorsing the use of alternative dispute resolution in Scotland;</p>

  <p>Justice Department is currently updating a booklet containing general information about resolving disputes without going to court, and officials are in discussion with the Scottish Mediation Network to examine how best the Executive can support the further development of mediation services and encourage greater use of alternative dispute resolution generally;</p>

  <p>A working group has been set up by Health Department to look at the use of mediation in clinical negligence cases;</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill will require local authorities to establish mediation services to help to avoid or resolve disagreements between the authority and parents.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Executive began accepting applications for its &#163;2 million fund to develop post offices in deprived urban areas from March 2003. Post offices (located in Scotland and classified by Post Office Ltd as urban Post Office branches (i.e. located in settlements with a population of 10,000 or more) and in the 20% most deprived post code sectors based on the 1998, 2003 and 2004 indices of deprivation) can apply for grant of up to &#163;50,000.00 to improve the viability of their business by improving the layout of the premises or helping to provide new or extended retail activities; or improving security so as to deter violent and other crime. Further information on the fund, along with details of the application process, can be obtained from Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>Procurement decisions by local authorities are a matter for the individual authority concerned. Where an organisation is employed to assist with the preparation of a tender, it would not be normal practice for that organisation to be invited to submit a bid, as there might be a real, or perceived, risk that such involvement could undermine the impartiality of the procurement process or distort competition. It is normal procurement practice to avoid situations where conflicts of interest may arise.</p>

  <p>However, there may be exceptional or unusual circumstances which result in a contracting authority seeking specialised input to a Specification from an organisation which is subsequently invited to tender. In such circumstances, there is an increased onus on the contracting authority to ensure that any advice does not have such an affect on the Specification as to favour any particular bidder or group of bidders.</p>

  <p>16 and 17 year olds across the UK who are not in full-time education or employment are guaranteed a suitable offer of training. The guarantee is delivered in Scotland by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise as a key element of the Skillseekers programme, funded by the Scottish Executive.

  <p>We expect to be able to make a decision in March 2004. In reaching a determination on applications for consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, ministers can grant consent, with or without conditions; withhold consent or refer the matter to a public local inquiry. In cases where the relevant planning authority has objected to the proposal, and that objection is not withdrawn or cannot be met by condition or changes to the development, ministers are required to call a public local inquiry.</p>

  <p>Our planning policy guidance is given in National Planning Policy Guideline 6: Renewable Energy Developments. Forestry Commission Scotland serves as the Executive&#8217;s forestry department. The corporate plan for the Forestry Commission in Scotland recognises that &quot;Every effort is being made to increase the value and income from leases of many kinds, and from developments such as windfarms, mineral sites and telecommunication masts, for which the national forests can often provide a suitable location.&quot; In this way the national forest lands make a considerable contribution to the Executive&#8217;s targets for increasing the proportion of power generated from renewable sources.</p>

  <p>All proposals are developed with full public consultation, and detailed plans for careful forest restructuring. The usual planning consents and environmental impact assessments are required and environmental, economic and social issues are taken fully into account.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-01-28.34.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80125" speakername="Mr Andrew Welsh (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body)" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0128.htm#26">

  <p>The Parliament has recently been involved in discussions with the Nordic Council through its membership of the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body (BIIPB). The BIIPB will produce a report shortly on its links with the Nordic Council. MSPs and officials from the Scottish Parliament have participated in, and contributed to, the production of the forthcoming report. Most recently, in December 2003, this has involved members visiting Norway to take forward issues in the draft report.</p>

  <p>At present, there are no firm plans to meet with the Nordic Council in 2004. However, it is expected that there will be productive exchanges with countries, regions and institutions from the Nordic/Baltic zone over the course of the year, e.g. SPCB staff are currently working with Nordic parliament secretariats and Scottish universities to exchange views on committee practice. It is probable that there will be further contact with the Nordic Council this year, but there are no plans at present to enter into discussions with the Nordic Council on gaining full or associated membership, nor has the Nordic Council proposed that we do so.</p>
