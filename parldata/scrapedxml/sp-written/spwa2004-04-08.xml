  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what estimate it has made of the impact that delays in installing water and sewage infrastructure have in restricting development, and how such a situation may be improved.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-04-08.S2W-7018.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0408.htm#1">

  <p>The Executive has made no such estimates. In relation to the issue of water infrastructure constraints, Scottish Water has been actively engaged with all Scottish local authorities for some considerable time and there is now a detailed understanding of the extent, location and estimated costs of resolving current and known planned developments throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>In this respect, I would also refer the member to the answers given to S2W-3242 on 4 November 2003, S2W-4418 on 9 December 2003, S2W-4935 on 7 January 2004, and S2O-1107 on 22 January 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&#8217;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottishparliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>In terms of improvement, the position is that in the current investment programme which ends in March 2006, the removal of development constraints was not identified as a specific problem. The current &#163;1.8 billion programme is the biggest ever investment in the Scottish water industry, but it has been aimed at meeting the legislative requirements associated with the quality of drinking water, environmental improvements, and to bring about improvements in customer services.</p>

  <p>However, the Executive, Scottish Water and the environmental and economic regulators are all addressing this issue, which is also being specifically addressed by the Quality and Standards III process which is considering Scottish Water&#8217;s next investment programme running from April 2006 until March 2014. This process will be the subject of an extensive public consultation exercise in the summer.</p>

  <p>Meantime, around &#163;200 million worth of the planned investment in the current programme will provide positive benefits to current constraints through the provision of additional capacity. What this means is that while the investment is not specifically aimed at dealing with development constraints, a beneficial effect of that investment will be the freeing up of existing capacity to allow further development.</p>

  <p>Additionally, a further &#163;41 million was specifically identified for enhancements to help ease such constraints in rural areas and for first time connections. An announcement is expected this month about allocation of most of this funding.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive who will take ultimate responsibility for the implementation of a strategy for pest control.</p>

  <p>The very diverse nature of pests and pest control may require organisations in some instances and individuals in others to take responsibility for implementing pest control measures.</p>
