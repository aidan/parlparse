  <p>In Scotland we elected to base the Single Farm Payment on the historic system consistent with the presumption in the 2003 CAP reform package that member states should consider the simple historic basis as their first option. We will review the position at the appropriate time with no prejudice either for or against a move to an area-based system. Decisions will be taken in the light of how the industry has adapted to the new regime during its first few years of operation and what will best meet the future needs of Scottish agriculture.</p>

  <p>Our policy is to publish information about recipients and amounts of subsidy under the single farm payment and other new support regimes without exception. The details available on our website show the subsidy payments paid to date <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Agriculture/ grants/LatestPayments" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Agriculture/ grants/LatestPayments</a> .</p>

  <p>The details were first published on 3 February 2006 and are updated on a weekly basis. Initially these details excluded non-standard payments, such as those made in Euros for technical reasons, but these have now been included. They are not identified separately as the amounts paid have been converted to sterling in order to provide a consistent report.</p>

  <p>The Executive intends that the reforms in the Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Bill will strike a fair balance between creditors and debtors. As part of striking the right balance, the diligence of arrestment and forthcoming will be reformed to offer much improved debtor protections.</p>

  <p>The new protections include a protected minimum balance where a bank account is arrested, currently of &pound;370. This will make sure that all debtors on low incomes of any kind will have enough money to live on, including debtors being paid housing benefit. There is also protection under the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006, which provides for housing benefit to be paid direct to a landlord where a tenant is in substantial rent arrears.</p>

  <p>There are currently therefore no plans to exempt housing benefit from bank arrestment.</p>

  <p>We have provided substantial funding to local authorities for the delivery of free personal care. For the 2006-07 financial year, we have increased the provision by &pound;9 million to &pound;162 million.</p>

  <p>Local authorities can only be expected to provide assistance with the preparation of food free of charge if the individual concerned is assessed as requiring such assistance.

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally, as the relevant information supplied to the Scottish Executive by local authorities in their Local Financial Returns only specifies their spending on school boards.</p>

  <p>However, in 2004-05 &pound;565,300 and in 2005-06, &pound;736,450 was spent on the promotion of parental involvement by the Scottish Executive. This included consultation and information on the Parental Involvement Bill; the Making the Difference series of leaflets, the preparation of a CD Rom of good practice and the Parentzone website.</p>

  <p>The Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 responds to the changing social climate in relation to alcohol in particular the detrimental effect on individuals and their community. The Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 ensures those who sell alcohol as part of a commercial entertainment service are aware of their responsibilities through training and are held to account through the Licensing Board. This Parliament considered this to be a necessary measure which goes beyond the requirements of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency for operators to have an alcohol policy in place.</p>

  <p>Ferries were exempted on the basis that they are offering a lifeline service to which alcohol is ancillary. However, in recognition that a greater degree of control had to be exercised, ministers also took powers which will enable the sheriff to make an order prohibiting the sale of alcohol completely on any specified route.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines are reserved and are the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA and the Commission on Human Medicines run the UK&rsquo;s spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting scheme, the Yellow Card Scheme.</p>

  <p>Guidelines on reporting of adverse drug reactions through the Yellow Card Scheme are provided to health professionals in the British National Formulary. Health professionals (including doctors, dentists, coroners, pharmacists and nurses) are asked to report suspected adverse reactions to any therapeutic agents, both prescribed products and those available over the counter, including herbal products. Detailed guidelines for health professionals and patients on what to report and how to report suspected adverse reactions are available at <a href="http://www.yellowcard.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.yellowcard.gov.uk</a>. This website also contains an electronic Yellow Card form for reporting of suspected adverse reactions.</p>

  <p>In relation to adverse reactions in children, the guidelines provided in the British National Formulary make it clear that reporting of all suspected adverse drug reactions in children is strongly encouraged through the Yellow Card Scheme. This is because less is known about the effect of drugs in children. Similar guidance is available at <a href="http://www.yellowcard.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.yellowcard.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines are reserved and are the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA and the Commission on Human Medicines run the UK&rsquo;s spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting scheme, the Yellow Card Scheme.</p>

  <p>Patients, parents and carers can report suspected adverse reactions through the Yellow Card Scheme. The MHRA supplied Yellow Cards for patients to a number of National Health Service outlets including all General Practitioners, community and hospital pharmacies in autumn 2005. The Yellow Cards provide guidance notes on when and how to report suspected adverse reactions. Posters were also sent to all outlets with details of how to report. The MHRA leaflet <em>Taking medicines - some questions and answers about side effects </em>also includes information on how to report a suspected adverse reaction. This was launched in December 2005 and the MHRA is working with the Commission on Human Medicines&rsquo; Patient Information Expert Advisory Group to discuss how this leaflet and the patient Yellow Card can be further promoted and made available. The MHRA is also developing a communication campaign, which includes articles in magazines, and working with voluntary organisations to promote patient reporting of suspected adverse reactions.</p>

  <p>The UK Cabinet Office reserved the Second Level Domain (SLD) scotland.eu during the sunrise period on behalf of the Executive.</p>

  <p>The intention is to ensure that those searching for online information about Scotland are directed to the appropriate promotional site which deals with the country&rsquo;s international image and fresh talent initiative.</p>

  <p>When the process moved onto Phase II and applications were opened to everyone. IPD reapplied for two names rejected under Phase I. A decision is still pending.</p>

  <p>Freshtalent.eu</p>

  <p>Fresh-talent.eu</p>

  <p>If successful these will cost &pound;150 (excluding VAT) + annual management charge of &pound;110 (excluding VAT)</p>

  <p>In addition Scotland on Line, the Executive&rsquo;s web hosting contractor bought six names on behalf of the website.</p>

  <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the international organisation responsible for classifying Top Level Domains. The Top Level Domains for countries are all currently two letters long e.g. .es (Spain), .fr (France), .jp (Japan).</p>

  <p>Scotland is included within the two TLDs allocated to the United Kingdom - .uk and .gb, however the Executive has also recently acquired a new Second Level Domain (SLD) - scotland.eu.</p>

  <p>The domain scotland.eu was registered with EURID (European Registry of Internet Domain Names) because it clearly satisfied the criteria which allowed EU member states to apply for domains related to geographical areas. While the abbreviations &quot;sco&quot; and &quot;scot&quot; do have some merit as internet abbreviations, they also have limitations, in particular they are not clearly geographically descriptive. Therefore sco.eu and scot.eu did not satisfy the criteria for domains related to geographical areas and any attempt to reserve them would have been unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that Scotland.eu, combined with the Top Level Domain (TLD) .uk will clearly convey Scotland&rsquo;s online identity.</p>

Dedicated provision of perinatal health care is in place to serve the West of Scotland, Grampian and Forth Valley, and provision to serve Highland, Tayside, Fife, Lothian and Borders will be put in place later this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to reducing the Health Inequalities experienced by people with mental health problems. NHS Health Scotland&rsquo;s priorities for 2006-07 as outlined in their Business Plan mirror ministerial priorities. Within this the main projects this year are focussed on tackling health inequalities (Prevention 2010) and also on key topics of tobacco, physical activity, food and health and alcohol. We expect NHS Health Scotland to underline and underpin each of these priority programmes and for mental health issues to be woven into the delivery of these programmes.</p>

  <p>It is widely recognised that physical activity can have a positive effect on mental health and wellbeing as well as on physical health. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Health Department (SEHD) has funded Paths to Health to a total of over &pound;1.75 million in the past three years. The Paths To Health project is a leading delivery agent for Scotland&rsquo;s Physical Activity Strategy and its success continues to grow. The project has now supported over 90 local schemes to develop walking initiatives in communities, many of which are in deprived areas. Of these 90 schemes, 10 are specifically designated as mental health recovery groups.</p>

  <p>Through funding provided by the Scottish Executive to ASH (Scotland), a number of pilot projects are currently underway in the mental health arena which will help to establish best practice in smoking cessation. In addition, a national framework for moving mental health services towards being smoke-free is currently being developed. It is intended this framework will deal with the specific issues faced by mental health services and their users, particularly in relation to smoking cessation.</p>

  <p>The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) of the new General Medical Services Contract from April 2006 rewards General Practices for providing an annual review of all patients with severe mental illness. This includes their physical health needs and specifies smoking, weight checks and other risk factors for Cardiovascular Disease and other illnesses. GP practices are specifically required to ensure that the patient is offered appropriate health promotion and prevention advice, depending on their needs. This indicator has been introduced in response to concerns about the extra physical health needs of people with severe mental illness. In addition, other indicators in the same part of the QOF encourage practices to chase up people who do not respond to invitations for this check, as well as ensuring they have a care plan or similar, to optimise care for their mental health.</p>

  <p>The Health Department is providing &pound;47,000 to support a project being undertaken at The State Hospital to reduce levels of obesity and improve the physical and mental health of patients by facilitating a healthier lifestyle through therapeutic activity and a healthy diet. This is a five year research project being piloted in one ward commencing January 2006. Following evaluation of the pilot, it is the intention to roll the programme out to all wards during the subsequent four years.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), within the Scottish Executive Health Department, has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. The CSO does not normally commission research but supports research projects of a sufficiently high standard initiated by the research community in Scotland. This role is well known and advertised throughout the health care and academic community.</p>

  <p>A qualitative investigation on &quot;Woman&rsquo;s Experiences of Psychosis following Childbirth&quot; is currently being funded through a CSO NHS research programme and a CSO funded research fellowship entitled &quot;Couples and postnatal depression &ndash; how do partners define support at times of stress?&quot; finished in 2004. A further project entitled &quot;Mellow babies &ndash; improving outcomes for infants with mothers with postnatal depression&quot; is being funded by the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s social research health team. CSO would be pleased to consider further research proposals into this condition. These would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>The National Research Register (NRR), a UK wide research database, records 22 on-going projects on postnatal depression and over 200 completed projects on that subject. Details of these projects are available from the NRR&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.nrr.nhs.uk" target="_blank">www.nrr.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Different prevalent studies have estimated between one in four of the population and one in six of the population suffer mental health problems in any one year. In most cases these are short-term and no or little medical intervention is required.</p>

  <p>Another estimate on diagnosed mental health problems can be based on the number of patients first seen for the condition in general practices participating in Practice Team Information (PTI). PTI date are obtained from a sample of Scottish general practices, covering the full range of age, sex, deprivation and urban/rural classes in Scotland.

  <p>There are no procedure rules for public inquiries held under the Electricity Act 1989. For that reason reporters routinely request in such cases that parties consider whether they would be prepared to agree to apply by analogy the Town and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure) (Scotland) Rules 1997 and thus the content of SODD Circular 17/1998 concerning Procedures and Good Practice. Changes in these rules to deliver the policy intentions underlying the Planning Bill will be the subject of consultation. Consideration will be given at that stage to whether the rules should also cover inquiries held by reporters under legislation other than the Planning Acts.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The approval of Regeneration Outcome Agreements (ROAs) in October 2005 meets our Partnership Agreement commitment to merge Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) with Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs).</p>

  <p>The Community Regeneration Fund (CRF), which replaced SIP funding from April 2005, is allocated to Community Planning Partnerships and targeted principally on the basis of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004.</p>

  <p>Dundee CPP has five key areas which it is targeting as follows:</p>

  <p>CRA 1 &ndash; Menzieshill(part),Charleston, Lochee and Beechwood.</p>

  <p>CRA 2 &ndash; St Mary&rsquo;s, Ardler and Kirkton.</p>

  <p>CRA 3 &ndash; Hilltown, Stobswell and Fairmuir.</p>

  <p>CRA 4 &ndash; Mill o Mains, Fintry(part) and Whitfield (part).</p>

  <p>CRA 5 &ndash; Mid Craigie, Linlathen and Douglas.</p>

  <p>In line with the guidance on ROAs, Dundee CPP is also targeting on a thematic basis two communities of interest: vulnerable young people and young carers.</p>
