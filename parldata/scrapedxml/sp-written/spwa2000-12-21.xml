  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to questions S1W-4517 and S1W-4518 by Colin Boyd QC on 20 March 2000, whether it has considered the recent findings of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee in relation to the crash of the Chinook ZD576 on the Mull of Kintyre in June 1994 and, if so, what action it intends to take.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-12-21.3.r0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Colin Boyd QC" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1221.htm#1">

  <p>The Public Accounts Committee Report <i>Ministry of Defence: Acceptance of the Chinook Mk 2 Helicopter </i> has been considered. The committee was critical of the acceptance procedure and critical of the RAF Board of Inquiry. It considered that it was &quot;very difficult to rule out categorically a technical fault as at least a contributory cause&quot; of the crash but the committee did not identify any factor which might make it possible to go higher than that so as to be likely to cause the Sheriff to reconsider his conclusion that he was unable to determine the cause of the accident and that he should not speculate. Indeed the committee stated its belief that the Ministry of Defence should be guided by the conclusion of the Sheriff. This being so, it appears to me that the position remains as stated in my letter of 19 May to Mr MacAskill: it is highly unlikely that anything that has come to light since the Fatal Accident Inquiry would alter the Sheriff&#8217;s determination. Accordingly, I do not propose to take any further action on this matter.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4886 by Susan Deacon on 1 December 2000, whether it will present the information in the table alongside the total school population of children under the age of 12 in each local authority area.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The data was collected by the annual school census in September 1998.</p>

  <p>2. The figures include:</p>

  <p>i. Children attending special schools with Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <u>main</u> difficulty in learning, whether or not they have a formal Record of Needs. Pupil age was based on the census date of 14 September 1998.</p>

  <p>ii. Children attending mainstream primary schools with Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <u>main</u> difficulty in learning, who have a Record of Needs. Dates of birth are not available for these pupils &#8211; all pupils attending primary schools have therefore been considered as within the scope of the question whereas those at secondary have not.</p>

  <p>iii. Pupils attending both publicly funded and independent schools.</p>

  <p>3. The figures do not include:</p>

  <p>i. Pupils with autism that also have another learning difficulty which is recorded as their main difficulty.</p>

  <p>ii. Any pupils with autism attending mainstream primary schools but who have not had a Record of Needs established.</p>

  <p>iii. Children with autism but who are not attending school - they may be too young to attend school or they may be educated elsewhere.</p>

  <p>4. Where a pupil attends a special needs school in one local authority but is funded by a different local authority, the pupil has been shown under the funding authority. All pupils attending primary schools are shown under the local authority of that school.</p>

  <p>5. In order to preserve confidentiality and in keeping with normal statistical practice, figures have been suppressed for cells with less than five pupils. These have been indicated by an *.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The data was collected by the annual school census in September 1999.</p>

  <p>2. The figures include:</p>

  <p>i. Children attending special schools with Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <u>main</u> difficulty in learning, whether or not they have a formal Record of Needs. Pupil age was based on the census date of 13 September 1999.</p>

  <p>ii. Children attending mainstream primary schools with Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <u>main</u> difficulty in learning, who have a Record of Needs. Dates of birth are not available for these pupils &#8211; all pupils attending primary schools have therefore been considered as within the scope of the question whereas those at secondary have not.</p>

  <p>iii. Pupils attending both publicly funded and independent schools.</p>

  <p>3. The figures do not include:</p>

  <p>i. Pupils with autism that also have another learning difficulty which is recorded as their main difficulty.</p>

  <p>ii. Any pupils with autism attending mainstream primary schools but who have not had a Record of Needs established.</p>

  <p>iii. Children with autism but who are not attending school - they may be too young to attend school or they may be educated elsewhere.</p>

  <p>4. Where a pupil attends a special needs school in one local authority but is funded by a different local authority, the pupil has been shown under the funding authority. All pupils attending primary schools are shown under the local authority of that school.</p>

  <p>5. In order to preserve confidentiality and in keeping with normal statistical practice, figures have been suppressed for cells with less than five pupils. These have been indicated by an *.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4886 by Susan Deacon on 1 December 2000, how many school age children are registered as having autism, either as their main or a subsidiary difficulty in learning, in each local authority area and what the total school-age population is in each area.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The data was collected by the annual school census in September 1999.</p>

  <p>2. The figures include:</p>

  <p>i. Children attending special schools with Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <u>main</u> difficulty in learning, whether or not they have a formal Record of Needs. Pupil age was based on the census date of 13 September 1999.</p>

  <p>ii. Children attending mainstream primary and secondary schools with Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <u>main</u> difficulty in learning, who have a Record of Needs.</p>

  <p>iii. Pupils attending both publicly funded and independent schools.</p>

  <p>3. The figures do not include:</p>

  <p>i. Pupils with autism that also have another learning difficulty which is recorded as their main difficulty.</p>

  <p>ii. Pupils with autism attending mainstream primary schools but who have not had a Record of Needs established.</p>

  <p>iii. Children with autism but who are not attending school - they may be too young to attend school or they may be educated elsewhere.</p>

  <p>4. Where a pupil attends a special needs school in one local authority but is funded by a different local authority, the pupil has been shown under the funding authority. All pupils attending primary schools are shown under the local authority of that school.</p>

  <p>5. In order to preserve confidentiality and in keeping with normal statistical practice, figures have been suppressed for cells with less than five pupils. These have been indicated by a *.</p>

  <p>It is the intention to publish at the end of January the UK Government&#8217;s interim response to the report. The findings of the report raise many important issues, including: properly informed policy-making; joined-up government; best use of advisory committees and expert advice; timely decision-taking; a consistent and proportionate approach to risk management and precaution &#8211; especially when dealing with uncertainty, and effective implementation of policy decisions. The report&#8217;s conclusions also emphasise the need for openness and better communication with the public about scientific knowledge and risk to inform consumer choice. The UK Government is leading the development of the response to the report, a process to which the Scottish Executive is contributing as well as considering the implications for its own procedures.</p>

  <p>The interim response will focus on actions already taken on these key themes, as well as addressing how to deal with the many detailed lessons that the report identifies. It will form the basis of consultations and discussions, enabling all those interested to contribute to the final response that the UK Government will make later next year.</p>

  <p>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is announcing today in the House of Commons that an independent assessment of current scientific understanding, including emerging findings, of the origins of the BSE epidemic is being commissioned. Professor Gabriel Horn has been asked to chair this review.</p>

  <p>The Executive will continue to ensure that the Parliament is informed of developments.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what further details it can provide in relation to its plans for an independent panel of subject experts to review all exam appeals which continue to give grounds for concern and, in particular, what the timetable is for the panel&#8217;s work.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-12-21.10.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80201" speakername="Mr Jack McConnell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1221.htm#5">

  <p>The Scottish Executive wrote to Directors of Education, College Principals and other heads of centres on 18 December inviting them to identify candidates whose appeal results continue to give serious grounds for concern and to submit details of these on a proforma to the Appeals Review Team by 10 January. These will be cases, primarily at Higher, where there is a major discrepancy between the centre&#8217;s estimate and the final award, where a result is very significant for the individual and the centre finds the award very hard to understand, or where there is an apparent significant inconsistency in the results received within a centre.</p>

  <p>For every subject, a review team will be established. Each team will be made up of at least three experienced, good quality markers who did not serve on Examining Teams this year.</p>

  <p>Each team will be briefed by the Principal Assessor and given a copy of the marking instructions used in the summer. For each case, the team will review the candidate&#8217;s examination script, and the evidence submitted by the presenting centre. The teams will write a report on each case. Where the team agrees with the original decision to reject the appeal, the report will explain the reasons for that decision. In cases where the review team disagrees with the original decision, the Principal Assessor will be asked to reconsider that decision. If the Principal Assessor agrees to change the original decision, a report will be prepared by the review team explaining why the grade was increased. If the Principal Assessor disagrees with the review team, the case will be decided by an Adjudication Panel.</p>

  <p>The adjudication panel will consist of three independent members. It will act as follows.</p>

  <p>Where the original appeal result is confirmed, the adjudication panel will send the report to the centre, and confirm the original result.</p>

  <p>Where it is agreed to change the original result, the adjudicators will request that SQA confirm that new result and send a report to the centre explaining the change.</p>

  <p>Where the Principal Assessor and the review team fail to agree, the adjudicators will make a final recommendation of award to SQA, who will be asked to confirm any new result. The adjudication panel will also report the outcome, with explanation, to the centre.</p>

  <p>The adjudication panel will also provide a report on each subject to the SQA Chief Executive, summarising the outcomes of all reviews in that subject, and making any general recommendations, or raising any issues that have emerged.</p>

  <p>The intended sequence of events is as follows. It is hoped to conclude the process quickly, but this is dependent on the number of cases that have to be reviewed.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to make an accurate estimate of the numbers of poindings and warrant sales which might be carried out for the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002. This will depend on the practices of individual creditors and the circumstances of individual debtors.</p>

  <p>The numbers of poindings and warrant sales carried out in the last three years for which figures are available are shown in the table:</p>

  <p>If the trend shown in these figures were to continue, one could expect of the order of 34,000 poindings and 300 warrant sales to take place in the two years to 31 December 2002.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-12-21.15.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80158" speakername="Mr Sam Galbraith" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1221.htm#9">

  <p>The National Cultural Strategy announced that we would support an audit of all museums and their collections, buildings and other resources with the aim of identifying their relative importance in national and local terms; and that priority in the audit would be given to the industrial museums. I subsequently announced a restructuring fund of &pound;3 million over the next three years to help put the museum sector on a sounder financial footing, based on the results of the national audit.</p>

  <p>I have been considering proposals made to me seeking financial support for the three main industrial museums &#8211; the Scottish Fisheries Museum, the Scottish Maritime Museum and the Scottish Mining Museum &#8211; on the grounds that there is already substantial evidence that they are of national importance to our cultural heritage. I recognise that these museums are in particularly difficult financial circumstances and, after careful consideration, I am prepared to accept these proposals in principle.</p>

  <p>In considering these proposals, I was keen to confirm that the local authorities which already support these museums would commit themselves to maintaining their financial contributions at their current level for each of the next three years. I am delighted that Fife Council, North Ayrshire Council and Midlothian Council have pledged to do this. In turn, I will make available from the restructuring fund up to &pound;420,000 a year for the next three years towards the museums&#8217; running costs. The indicative annual figures for each museum are: Scottish Fisheries Museum - &pound;60,000; Scottish Maritime Museum - &pound;160,000; and Scottish Mining Museum - &pound;200,000.</p>

  <p>I believe these museums have great potential and I am determined to ensure that the funding package leads to significant improvements at each museum to allow that potential to flourish. I am putting in place arrangements to address these issues including the potential for joint working between the museums themselves, and for the development of partnerships with other organisations.</p>

  <p>This initiative is undoubtedly a very significant step forward. It presents the museums with a challenge, but it also gives them a real opportunity to secure their future as part of our national heritage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no role in the promotion of new air services. As indicated in the answer to S1W-11315, the development of additional routes and services is a matter for the commercial judgment of the airlines themselves.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Tourist Board work closely with Scottish Airports to support and influence all carriers flying direct into Scotland. Scottish Airports provide a package of direct support which covers both inbound and outbound promotion.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Tourist Board does not give direct financial contributions to the airlines. Their contribution to the promotion of air links comes indirectly through the &pound;700,000 annually spent on marketing in the USA, both direct to the consumer and to the trade. All promotions signpost details on how to get to Scotland. Direct flights are highlighted and several tactical promotions are undertaken specifically with the airline for, for example, city breaks in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Following the withdrawal in 1998 of British Airways transatlantic service to New York, Scottish Enterprise supported the development and marketing of a new direct service to Newark, ensuring Scotland maintained an &quot;all year round&quot; service to North America.</p>
