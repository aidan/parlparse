  <p>Demand for aggregates will continue to be a matter for market forces. A number of initiatives are in place to increase the use of recycled aggregates which are intended to impact on the use of primary aggregates by the construction industry, particularly fiscal measures such as the Landfill Tax and the forthcoming Aggregates Levy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is fully committed to seeking opportunities for sustainable construction and current standards already encourage such techniques.</p>

  <p>As an example, the Scottish Executive Development Department is a signatory to the latest May 2001 version of the Specification for Highway Works, which incorporates new specification clauses permitting wider usage of recycled or secondary materials in road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance. This Specification will be utilised for all trunk road new works projects and will also be available for use by other clients, such as local authorities, where appropriate. Additionally, the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Trunk Roads Divisions are actively involved in research and site trials of recycled road materials where it is hoped that these will provide further valuable support in promoting a sustainable approach to techniques for road construction.</p>

  <p>In relation to reform of regulations for waste management, there is a long-standing governmental commitment to review the exemptions set out in Schedule 3 of the Waste Management Regulations 1994. DEFRA is taking the lead on a UK basis, with a view to the production of a consultation paper by the end of this year. The purpose of the exemptions is to encourage the re-use and recycling of waste. Specifically in terms of Scotland, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency published, in 1999, the <i>National Waste Strategy</i>, which sets out a framework for reduction, re-use and recycling of waste.</p>

  <p>The annual maintenance charge levied by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency under the Groundwater Regulations 1998 is not unfair. The charge, which for the great majority of farmers is &#163;127 or less, covers the costs to the agency of monitoring and administering the scheme.</p>

  <p>Special dispensation will be made for those sheep farmers that have lost stock because of foot-and-mouth disease. Charges will be waived for the current financial year and farmers wishing to delay restocking until 31 March 2005 will be able to have their authorisations revoked without incurring extra fees when reapplying.</p>

  <p>The strategy for assisting employers to up-skill their workforce and for ensuring the availability of appropriate training opportunities was set out in <i>A Smart, Successful Scotland: Ambitions for the Enterprise Networks</i> .

  <p>National training organisations (NTOs) also have an important role in workforce development in liaison with employers in their sector. &#163;1.5 million financial support is being allocated to NTOs over the next three years to encourage work-based training and skills development, for the production of workforce development plans, and to help ensure the relevance of education and training provision.</p>

  <p>The figure quoted in <i>Roots for Growth</i> was calculated using data from the annual employment survey in Scotland. In addition, some allowance was made for those who were self employed, those who worked in related activities in the construction and service industries and those people working in northern England whose economic activity was directly linked with the Scottish forest industry resource.</p>

  <p>The principal reason for the difference in the numbers is the narrower definition of the forest industry used in the <i>Forest Employment Survey 1998/99</i>. This survey only takes into account forestry and primary wood processing jobs which are located in Scotland and which deal with British grown timber. Moreover, its estimate relates to full-time equivalent jobs, whilst the figure quoted in <i>Roots for Growth</i> relates to people in employment.</p>

  <p>The Forest Employment Survey 1998/99, carried out by the Forestry Commission, collects information on employment in forestry and primary wood processing industries. It has shown a decline from 15,245 full-time equivalent jobs in 1988-89 to 10,694 in 1998-99. However, both the scope of the survey and the methodology of data collection have changed, thereby making strict comparisons difficult. No information is collected on whether forest employment was in urban or rural areas.</p>

  <p>Woodland area and timber production have both increased between 1989 and 1999. Woodland area increased from 1.107 to 1.297 million hectares and annual timber production increased from 2.37 to 4.69 million cubic metres.

A number of areas already comply with the recommendation that, where there are births in excess of 3,000, there should be a consultant-led specialist maternity unit.

  <p>In connection with question S1W-14202, the member will be aware of a clinical psychology workforce survey which indicated that there were 44.25 (WTE) vacant posts as at 30 September 1998. More recent information is not available as data on the number of vacancies in clinical psychology is currently not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>The latest information available on the number of consultant and staff grade vacancies in the psychiatric specialties is shown in the following table, which should be read in conjunction with the notes below it. Recent expansion in the psychiatric sub-specialties and the effect of dual training have increased the specialist registrar training period by one year, and this has contributed to the number of consultant vacancies. In recognition of the pressures within psychiatry, the number of posts for doctors in higher specialist training in the psychiatric specialties has been increased from 134 in March 2000 to 139 in March 2001.</p>
