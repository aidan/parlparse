  <p>It is the responsibility of the management at individual football grounds to assess the level of ambulance provision required based on the anticipated attendance. Guidance as to what that minimum provision should be is contained in the &quot;Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds&quot;. The table shows the minimum ambulance provision required against the anticipated attendance, together with the rates charged by the Scottish Ambulance Service for that minimum provision. Total costs may vary, however, depending on the level of additional services which the ambulance service may have been asked to provide by the football ground&#8217;s management team.</p>

  <p>Where a parent places a child in circumstances where concerns arise about the child&#8217;s welfare, it is open to any person to refer the child to the principal reporter. Such circumstances could include parental hardship or homelessness as well as whether the child could be supported by family or friends. The Principal Reporter would have to decide whether any of the grounds for referral under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 existed, and whether compulsory measures of supervision appeared to be necessary in the child&#8217;s interests. Amongst other factors, this decision would take account of the extent to which voluntary support measures were acceptable to the family and sufficient in the child&#8217;s interests. If voluntary support measures were considered inadequate a children&#8217;s hearing would have to be convened to decide whether compulsory measures of supervision <strong> </strong> were necessary and what action should to be taken to protect the child&#8217;s welfare. This process applies to all children in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A cervical smear is not a test for cancer but is aimed at detecting abnormal cells which, if left untreated, could develop into cervical cancer. Information about waiting times for colposcopy investigation following a cervical smear is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>One of the criteria in the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland report on cervical screening, which was released on 24 November, is that a minimum of 90% of all referrals for an abnormal smear should be given an appointment within 40 working days and 90% of referrals with a moderate or severe abnormal smear within 20 working days of the referral being received. The report noted that this target was not being met by the majority of NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Health Department will be considering with the National Services and Information and Statistics Divisions, Common Services Agency the development of appropriate IT system enhancements to allow this data to be more easily accessible in the future which will assist boards to monitor their performance and take appropriate action to meet the standards.</p>

  <p>Resources for colposcopy services are a matter for NHS boards.</p>

  <p>Any death from fire is a tragedy and the Executive is fully aware of Scotland&#8217;s appalling record of fire fatalities. However, we take some comfort that there has been an underlying downward trend in fire fatalities in Scotland over the past decade and we want this trend to continue. The Executive will therefore use the new legislation to work with the service and others to place an even greater emphasis on fire prevention to further reduce the level of deaths and injuries from fire. But we do not believe that it would be appropriate or indeed helpful to use primary legislation to set targets for the level of fire fatalities.</p>

  <p>Fire Service Circular 4/2003 dated 3 April 2003, issued by HM Fire Service Inspectorate for Scotland, advised fire authorities that the Executive, as part of its proposals for developing the service, supported the introduction of a risk-based method of intervention through the development of integrated risk management plans (IRMP). A further fire service circular, 7/2003, dated 8 September 2003, published draft guidance on the production of IRMPs. The development of the guidance was aided by consultation seminars for all the key stakeholder interests conducted during 2003 outlining the IRMP planning process and timescale for action. Comments on this guidance were sought by 1 December 2003. Responses to the consultation are being assessed prior to re-issuing a revised version of circular 7/2003. The inspectorate are currently visiting brigades to assess what preliminary progress has been made on implementation. It is too soon to assess the financial implications of the IRMP approach.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. These statistics are derived from data collected on discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals (SMR01) in Scotland.</p>

  <p>2. Cases where the patient was not admitted to hospital are not included.</p>

  <p>3. Defined as the number of new/first occurrences of a particular disease diagnosed during a hospital in-patient or day case stay.</p>

  <p>4. Patients are counted in the first year that they were diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease. Their patient histories are screened back to 1981 to make sure that had not been admitted prior to the year of interest with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease.</p>

  <p>5. The linked data set required for this analysis contains linked SMR1/01 and Registrar General's death records. All patient records including deaths for each patient are linked together using &quot;probability matching&quot;. The &quot;probability matching&quot; algorithm uses all available identifying information (name, date of birth, postcode, hospital patient reference number etc.) to link the individual hospital records for each patient, thereby creating &quot;linked&quot; patient histories.</p>

  <p>Up to six diagnoses (one principal, five secondary) are recorded on SMR01 returns. All six diagnoses have been used to select pelvic inflammatory disease.</p>

  <p>6. Rates are based on the General Registers Office for Scotland, mid-year population estimates for females only.</p>

  <p>7. PID includes chronic and acute PID and a wide range of disease codes have been used to identify this.</p>

  <p>Homelessness strategies have been developed by every Scottish local authority in partnership with service providers and other stakeholders and in liaison with the Executive and COSLA. Homelessness strategies will form the cornerstone of local authorities&#8217; drive to tackle the issue of homelessness and, increasingly, to prevent it through early intervention. The Executive has allocated &#163;20 million per annum over three years (2003-04 to 2005-06) specifically to assist local authorities to implement their homelessness strategies. This is part of a wider financial commitment of &#163;127 million by the Executive to tackle homelessness.</p>

  <p>Included within the expected changes to the nature of demand on ambulance services in the area is the assumption that more expectant mothers may require to be transferred to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. Additional ante-natal assessments will be carried out to determine which mothers should have a consultant-led delivery. The assessments are designed to minimise the incidence of late/urgent transfers. Where a late hospital transfer to Paisley is indicated then the arrangements provide for a midwife to support the expectant mother in transit.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of midwifery students finding employment is not held centrally. However, the one-year guarantee scheme was put into place to ensure that all newly qualified nurses and midwives could obtain employment in NHSScotland if they wished.

  <p>The cost of the production of hospital meals is a matter for NHS boards and trusts to decide.</p>

  <p>The important issue is that high quality nutritional care is provided for all patients in hospital. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland issued new clinical standards for Food, Fluid and Nutritional Care in Hospitals on 19 September 2003. The standards require that each NHS board has a policy, and a strategic and co-ordinated approach, to ensure that all patients in hospitals receive high quality nutritional care. NHSScotland&#8217;s performance against these standards will be monitored by NHSQIS and reports will be published in due course.</p>

  <p>The Health Department will write to NHS boards and trusts requesting them to respond positively to the recommendations of the Audit Scotland report.</p>

  <p>This involves, where appropriate, purchasing extra capacity in residential accommodation, establishing &quot;pooled&quot; stores of specialist equipment that can be used by vulnerable people at home and establishing specialist admission avoidance teams and rapid response teams to ensure that every effort is made to allow someone to remain in their own home with support rather than be admitted to a hospital or care facility.</p>

  <p>The Executive provides funding for a spectrum of initiatives aimed at promoting positive sexual health across a range of target groups. These include the Inclusion Project which aims to develop a better understanding of issues specific to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, Walk the Talk, which has a focus on sexual health services for young people, and Caledonia Youth which provides a range of sexual health services in centres in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and, shortly, Falkirk. The promotion of sexual health is an important part of the work of NHS Health Scotland, including developing and making available SHARE materials and training for secondary schools.</p>

  <p>Specifically on the prevention of HIV, the Executive provides funding to a range of voluntary organisations which promote safer sexual health practices to prevent the spread of HIV. This includes funding for the Healthy Gay Scotland project, which aims to promote positive sexual health among gay and bisexual men. The Executive also currently provides &#163;8.119 million to NHS boards to assist them with their work to prevent the spread of blood borne viruses, including HIV.</p>

  <p>The Executive has provided &#163;3 million to the Lothian based Healthy Respect health demonstration project, which includes work with parents, and young women, preventing unwanted teenage pregnancies and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections.</p>

  <p>At local level, NHS boards and partner organisations, provide a range of services, responding to their assessment of local needs. Details of all services so provided are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Executive has, under the Inclusion Project, provided &#163;260,000 over the two years from 2002, to fund a project manager to conduct research and develop a mainstreamed approach to the effective inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in health planning and services. It has also, to date, provided &#163;5,000 to fund a series of open-space events to explore issues of information and sexual health for young people in this group.</p>

  <p>We would expect NHS boards to be addressing sexual health issues in their health and homelessness action plans, and to have regard to the needs of other groups in their local needs assessments, where appropriate using the &#163;8.119 million the Executive is providing in the current year to facilitate measures to prevent HIV and other bloodborne issues.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including the implications for devolved matters in Scotland of its legislative programme. This contact reflects the approach, set out in Devolution Guidance Note 1 in accordance with the principles set out in the Memorandum of Understanding, that the administrations normally consult each other from an early stage on the development of relevant legislative proposals.</p>

  <p>Social service workers who will be required to register are expected to meet the criteria set by the Scottish Social Services Council. Part of the criteria for registration will include obtaining or working towards certain qualifications. The payment of fees for registration is the responsibility of the individual. However, training of the social care workforce within the voluntary sector is the responsibility of individual employers.</p>

  <p>To help the sector progress towards any qualifications criteria set for registration, the Executive provide training grants under section 9 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to promote an acceptable level of practice competence in key areas of social work covered by the voluntary sector. This enables voluntary organisations involved to provide or secure training for their paid staff and voluntary workers which would not otherwise be available to them.</p>

  <p>In October 2003, the Executive announced an additional &#163;9 million over the next three years for local authorities to invest in training. Ministers have made it clear that staff who work in partnership with local authorities, including independent providers from the voluntary and private sector will benefit from this additional funding.</p>

  <p>Currently, the Scottish Social Services Council is undertaking an investigation of all the key funding streams available for training in the social work sector and this will include the voluntary sector.</p>
