  <p>Local authorities have a duty under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 to promote and safeguard the welfare of children in need. Responsibility is exercised through the provision of appropriate services and, if necessary, by applying to the court for orders to protect children believed to be at risk, or by referring children to the Principal Reporter. Other statutory agencies have an important contribution to make and guidance issued in 1998 sets a framework for inter-agency co-operation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has introduced or is planning to introduce a further range of measures which either directly or indirectly will help to tackle child abuse. For example,</p>

  <p>a Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care will regulate, among other services, early education, day care and residential care for children and a Scottish Social Services Council will regulate the care workforce;</p>

  <p>the Children&#8217;s Services Development Fund is assisting the setting up a network of children&#8217;s rights officers around Scotland;</p>

  <p>a one-stop shop will be set up to assist in vetting applicants for posts that give access to children; and</p>

  <p>we are consulting on the setting up of an index of adults unsuitable to work with children.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also makes grants to voluntary organisations active in the field of child protection.</p>

  <p>Direct funding of children&#8217;s panels is the responsibility of local authorities. However, The Scottish Executive contributes funding to support the operation of the hearings system.</p>

  <p>In 1999-2000, &pound;211 million was provided for children&#8217;s services under GAE. Local authority returns identify that they spent &pound;1.269 million on the children&#8217;s hearings system. &pound;215.6 million has been provided for 2000-01.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is committed to providing &pound;18.440 million to support the children&#8217;s hearings system in 2000-01. A breakdown of these costs is shown below:</p>

In the current year &pound;428,000 is allocated to support panel member training in order to achieve the competencies set out in the document <i>Children&#8217;s Panel Training: Design, Content And Evaluation</i> , published in 1999.</p>

  <p>The grant aided expenditure allocated to each local authority for services for home-based elderly, residential accommodation for the elderly and for other social work services for 1999-2000 is listed in the Scottish Executive document <i>Grant Aided Expenditure 1999-2000</i> , which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre, Bib.

It should be emphasised that grant aided expenditure assessments form a basis for the allocation of total central government grant to local authorities; they are not spending targets or guidelines.</p>

  <p>Figures for expenditure by local authorities are contained in the CIPFA publication <i>Rating Review: Estimates of Income and Expenditure 1999-2000</i>, also available in the Information Centre, Bib. No. 7547.</p>

  <p>Under the provisions made in the UK Transport Bill, introduced on 1 December 1999, the Scottish Ministers will be able to issue directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) for passenger rail services that begin and end in Scotland (effectively the ScotRail franchise). Since the Bill has not completed its passage through Parliament at Westminster, the Scottish Ministers are not yet able to exercise these powers.</p>

  <p>We will, however, shortly be consulting on strategic priorities for Scotland&#8217;s railways as part of the process of developing these directions and guidance to the SRA. During this process we will give consideration to a wide range of issues, including proposals for improved rail access from Lanarkshire to Edinburgh.</p>
