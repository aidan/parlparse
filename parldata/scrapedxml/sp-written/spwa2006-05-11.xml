  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-24245 by Tavish Scott on 24 March 2006, how many individuals who submitted a valid application before 20 March 2006 did not receive their National Entitlement Card by 1 April 2006; for how long these applicants will be able to use their old travel card, and whether it is aware of applicants being told by local authorities that they may &quot;require to re-apply&quot;.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally, nor is it likely to be available from what is essentially a live database. It is intended that old travel cards will continue to be valid for local travel up to 30 June 2006, and an intensive marketing and publicity campaign is underway to remind any remaining eligible residents to renew their old cards.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of applications have been successfully processed, with over 822,000 cards issued by 4 May 2006. However, a tiny number of applications will inevitably go astray for a variety of reasons, and at this point it is sensible for the local authorities to advise the applicant to re-apply.</p>

  <p>The Executive will continue to support cycling through funding to local authorities and cycling organisations to assist them in delivering the facilities and infrastructure needed to encourage cycling. Local authorities were granted &pound;8.65 million for cycling, walking and safer streets projects in 2005-06 and this will increase by 2.5% to &pound;8.87 million in 2006-07 and by another 2.5% to &pound;9.09 million in 2007-08. It is, of course, a matter for individual authorities as how they choose to spend this money.</p>

  <p>In addition, funding will be provided to Regional Transport Partnerships (RTPs) across Scotland of &pound;35 million in 2006-07 and 2007-08. RTPs are likely to consider regionally strategic cycle projects as part of their Regional Transport Strategies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why CalMac and the Royal Bank of Scotland were among the three companies invited to tender for the Orkney and Shetland lifeline ferry contract, in light of the &pound;71 million subsidy received, against a budget projection of &pound;29.7 million, by NorthLink, the joint venture company in which they were partners, in the first three years of its operation.</p>

  <p>The opportunity to express and interest in tendering for the Northern Isles contract was advertised in 2004 and 26 organisations expressed an interest in the process. The list did not include the Royal Bank of Scotland. Of the 26, nine companies subsequently submitted a Pre-Qualification Questionnaire. These were evaluated by a tendering team comprising Executive specialists in procurement, finance and accountancy, transport policy and an external marine technical adviser, to assess bidders&rsquo; technical and professional ability and financial standing. Caledonian MacBrayne expressed an interest and submitted a pre qualification questionnaire. Caledonian MacBrayne was assessed as meeting the required criteria, along with two other companies. On 19 July 2005, I announced that three companies, V Ships UK Ltd, Irish Continental Ferries plc and Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd had been invited to tender for the public service contract for the Northern Isles Ferry Services currently operated by NorthLink.</p>

  <p>I refer Mr Davidson to the Guidance on Scottish Public Sector Procurement and Freedom Of Information, which sets out what tender information can and cannot be disclosed. The Guidance is available on the Executive website at:</p>

  <p>Both bids were technically compliant. We can only disclose the value of the winning tender after the formal award of contract and we have not reached that point yet. We cannot give details on rankings or financial models or value of unsuccessful tenders at any stage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s position on this issue was summarised in the Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the NorthLink ferry services contract published on 22 December 2005. The Auditor General&rsquo;s report also considered the current tendering process and noted that:</p>

  <p>&quot;NorthLink&rsquo;s financial problems have led the Executive to conclude that an appropriate balance has to be struck between the twin priorities of ensuring the continuity of services and transferring operational risks on to the new operator. The proposed contract does not seek to transfer all such risks to the operator and recognises that costs can be higher and income lower than expected for reasons beyond the operator&rsquo;s control. It will therefore provide some protection to the new operator by allowing the Executive to pay additional subsidy in certain circumstances. Should income fall or costs rise sufficiently in any one year, the operator will be required to bear the impact of not making its anticipated return from providing the service plus a further &pound;750,000 of losses before the Executive will consider paying additional subsidy. Similar to the NorthLink contract, the new contract will include financial penalties for non-performance and the clawback of subsidy if excessive profits are made.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is not possible to accurately report these figures as a percentage as the Child Health Surveillance Programme Pre-School system (CHSP-PS) holds information only on those children who have received a review.

  <p>The information requested is given in two tables in a document entitled Average available staffed beds by health board area, by specialty. A copy of this document has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39494).</p>

  <p>The information shown in table 1 is for the latest eight years only. Changes in the methodology used to record specialty information were implemented from April 1996. These new coding procedures (phased in during 1996-97) mean that information for the previous years is not strictly comparable with the more recent data. Table 2 shows information from 31 March 1990 to 1997 based on &quot;old&quot; specialty groupings; for certain specialty groups there may be discontinuities when comparing figures for pre-1997-98 and post-1996-97 and trend comparisons should be made with caution.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not set target numbers for beds. These are local planning decisions taken by NHS boards who have the information necessary to take the right decisions. There are good reasons for bed numbers to reduce. We need fewer long-stay beds to take forward the policy of caring for the elderly and also for people with chronic mental illness or with learning disability, in their homes or in other community settings. Medical advances continue to reduce length of stay associated with many planned procedures and some are now routinely carried out in a few hours without the need for any overnight stay. And the NHS in Scotland is making better use of available beds. Average bed occupancy has risen from 78.5% in 1997-98 to 81.7% in 2005. But more beds are targeted where they are needed. For example, the number of intensive therapy unit beds is up by almost 20% over the last five years. These are by far the most expensive beds to staff and equip.</p>

There is also the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year.</p>

  <p>The MacLeod reports were not included in the response to S2W-23970 as these were commissioned for use in defence of a civil action. As such, they were neither an investigation nor an inquiry. Their remits were consistent with the purpose for which they were commissioned.

  <p>In relation to restricted patients, the State Hospital adhere to the advice contained in Section 5.10 of the Memorandum of Procedure which provides guidance to professionals for the management of restricted patients. In certain cases, visits to particular locations would not be appropriate and if such limits are identified the reasons for this are fed back to individual patients. It is important that suspension-of-detention programmes are designed and conducted in such a way as to sustain public confidence in the arrangements as a whole, and to respect the feelings and possible fears of victims and others who may have been affected by the offences. Leave will only take place when it is deemed appropriate and safe.</p>

  <p>I announced on 22 March, in response to the deficiencies identified in the Report by the Mental Welfare Commission into the care and treatment of Mr L and Mr M, that we were taking a number of steps to reinforce public confidence in the services that are provided. The full response is available on:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Inquiry/Treatment" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Inquiry/Treatment</a>.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers do not have a statutory role to consent to suspension of detention of non-restricted patients.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland is investing in improvements across the rail network both in infrastructure enhancements and service improvements to promote sustainable travel choices, support growth in the Scottish economy and improve access to jobs, training and services. This investment includes:</p>

  <p>Waverley Station: to provide four more train paths per hour in the station and provide better access for passengers from Princes Street with escalators and lifts up Waverley Steps.</p>

  <p>Edinburgh Airport Rail Link (EARL): to stimulate economic growth in the Edinburgh city region and provide sustainable transport options for travel to Edinburgh Airport.</p>

  <p>Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL): to contribute to the continued and sustainable growth of Glasgow Airport, which is a major employer and is one of the biggest wealth generators in the west of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Airdrie &ndash; Bathgate: to improve direct access to labour markets in Glasgow, Edinburgh and West Lothian for people living in the Airdrie to Uphall corridor.</p>

  <p>Stirling &ndash; Alloa &ndash; Kincardine: to reconnect Alloa to the rail network attracting business and increasing access to jobs, education and services.</p>

  <p>Borders Railway: to transform travel opportunities from Midlothian and the Borders, making a real contribution to sustainable travel and provide a real boost to the economy of the Borders, of Midlothian and of South East Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland is investing in a strong franchise that has delivered improved performance and includes commitments to &pound;40 million of enhancements throughout the franchise period to improve passenger satisfaction and to continue to encourage growth in rail passengers.</p>

  <p>Future improvements will be identified through the rail strategy and the Strategic Projects Review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also funding a number of local authority and regional transport partnership projects which improve interchange and access to the rail network.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

  <p>The Executive response to West Lothian Council&rsquo;s report in July 2004 highlighted that the study had identified key issues which still need to be addressed.

  <p>In 2004-05, ministers set a target to eliminate stocks of domestic First Registrations over 1 year old during the next three years with a milestone reduction of 25% from the stock position at 31 March 2004 by 31 March 2005. Registers of Scotland met this target. The 2005-06 target was to achieve a 62% stock reduction against the 31 March 2004 baseline by 31 March 2006. Registers of Scotland achieved a 52% reduction.</p>

  <p>Experience in working towards these targets demonstrated that factors outwith the control of the Registers of Scotland may influence the time taken to complete domestic First Registrations. The target for 2006-07 has therefore been amended to &quot;achieve recording and registration turnaround times averaging no more than 100 working days for all domestic first registrations&quot;.</p>

  <p>No. The Scottish Executive provides funding to Road Safety Scotland (RSS) for the development of key road safety education initiatives and publicity messages. Campaigns by RSS are mainly undertaken on a national basis and focus on the main causes of casualties. These include issues such as speeding, drink and drug driving, seatbelt wearing and young drivers. RSS is also looking at the development of campaigns addressing motorcyclist safety and rural road safety.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a statutory duty to take appropriate measures to prevent accidents on roads for which they are responsible. This includes the dissemination of information and advice relating to the use of roads.</p>

  <p>Data about personal injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. The following table gives the numbers of road accidents which were identified in these returns as occurring on the A726 between Strathaven and the junction at the south-east of the Birniehill roundabout in East Kilbride, from 1995 to 2004, and the associated numbers of fatalities and serious injuries.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given below are based upon the data which are held in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s road accident statistics database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authorities would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>

  <p>The A726 comprises both trunk and local road sections.

  <p>The remainder of the A726 is a local road and is the responsibility of the appropriate local road authorities, South Lanarkshire, East Renfrewshire and City of Glasgow Councils. Each roads authority is responsible for safety on the section of road for which it is responsible.</p>

  <p>I have today written to Sir John Ward, in respect of Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s budget for 2006-07. A copy of this letter is being placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39557)</p>

  <p>The Executive will provide an additional &pound;45 million of resource cover so Scottish Enterprise can meet its non-cash requirements in 2006-07 and access reserves. Scottish Enterprise will also be able to retain receipts up to &pound;5 million above the previously agreed target. These steps will cover repayment of the non-cash element of the budget overspend in 2005-06. Scottish Enterprise will therefore be able to deploy an additional &pound;50 million of resources. This will now allow the board to agree Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s budget for 2006-07, reflecting Executive priorities, when it meets on Friday 12 May.</p>

  <p>As part of the Action Plan on Tackling Sectarianism in Scotland launched in January we are working in partnership with the Scottish Football Association and <strong></strong> sportscotland to develop a strategy for tackling sectarianism in football. This will be launched by the end of 2006. We will consider how best to engage stakeholders in this process. The Executive has already started a consultation exercise with supporters&rsquo; groups and their views will inform the development of the strategy.</p>

  <p>The Task Group on Tackling Sectarianism in Scotland is made up of Strathclyde Police; Scottish Interfaith Council and Education for Mutual Understanding; Sense over Sectarianism, and the Scottish Executive. The task group is working independently to develop new initiatives to tackle sectarianism and will identify and work with partners to take those initiatives forward. It is anticipated that the task group will present their initial findings to ministers in the autumn.</p>

  <p>There are already some positive examples of work being done by both Old Firm clubs to combat sectarianism. The most recent is the Old Firm Alliance (OFA) project, a joint initiative by Glasgow Alliance, and Celtic and Rangers Football Clubs. Launched in April last year, it uses football to educate young people about the benefits of a healthier lifestyle, raise self-esteem and confidence, provide them with positive role models and challenge racist and sectarian attitudes and anti-social behaviour. Events organised by the OFA have been well attended and well received. I am pleased to confirm that the OFA recently secured further funding to continue its good work through 2006-07. The Executive commends initiatives such as this and welcomes the way the Old Firm clubs are working together to tackle these issues.</p>
