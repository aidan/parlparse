  <p>Following the Executive&#8217;s review of the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board initiated last year, and taking account of views expressed in the course of a public consultation exercise, we have concluded that the board should continue to operate within the existing statutory framework. The next review of the board will take place in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Subject to the necessary legislation obtaining parliamentary approval, we expect the commission to be established in October 2001. Appointments to the commission will be made by ministers in line with the public appointments procedures on the basis of open competition and will take account of the need for a balance of interests.</p>

  <p>The details of our proposals for the commission are contained in the Policy Position Paper <i>The Way Forward for Care</i>, which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>

  <p>The proposed extension of the Freight Facilities Grant Scheme to coastal and short sea shipping for journeys which begin and end in Scotland is a fully devolved matter.</p>

  <p>The extension to the scheme to cover journeys which only begin or end in Scotland is a matter reserved for the Westminster Parliament. However, powers to make grant for such projects are planned to be executively devolved to the Scottish Ministers.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-08-23.S1W-8998.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0823.htm#8998">

  <p>Traffic volume is regulated by the capacity of the adjacent sections of the route rather than by the capacity of the bridge. Currently some 140,000 vehicles per day are crossing the bridge although in the recent past the traffic volume has exceeded 155,000 vehicles per day. On completion of the strengthening works the present traffic restrictions will no longer be required and the bridge could be restored to 10 lanes.</p>

  <p>Once the current strengthening contract and the other planned refurbishment works to the bridge, the approach viaducts and entry/exit ramps have been completed, the complex will revert to a normal inspection and maintenance footing.</p>

  <p>Provision has been made in current spending plans for the next two years of &pound;4.669 million and &pound;9.259 million respectively for replacing the bearings at the north and south ends of the main bridge, replacement of the Stobcross Off Ramp and cope and parapet replacement. Depending on the availability of funding beyond that timescale, the remaining works are expected to take a further three to five years to complete.</p>

  <p>The total cost of constructing the Kingston Bridge complex, including approach viaducts and entry/exit ramps, was just over &pound;11 million (1970 prices). We do not have details of how much was spent on an annual basis by the previous roads authorities (Corporation of the City of Glasgow and Strathclyde Regional Council) between June 1970 when the bridge was opened and 1 April 1996 when the M8 through Glasgow was adopted as a trunk road. However, Strathclyde Regional Council spent approximately &pound;11.6 million between the late 1980s when the complex&#8217;s structural problems first became apparent and that latter date. Actual and forecast expenditure for the complex including the bridge since it became part of the trunk road network is set out below:</p>

  <p>Estimates of costs beyond this period have not yet been prepared because we are awaiting the outcome of further traffic studies and structural investigations that are required to develop a robust maintenance strategy for the Kingston Bridge complex.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides &pound;275,000 annually to promote race equality. The allocation has totalled &pound;825,000 over the past three years. This amount is allocated to the Ethnic Minority Grant Scheme.

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not provide specific funding to local authorities for this purpose. In accordance with the principle of mainstreaming equality, local authorities are expected to fund the promotion of racial equality from their main budgets. Some Race Equality Councils are funded by their local authority.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding to the Unemployed Voluntary Action Fund for the purpose of administering the Ethnic Minority Grant Scheme on its behalf. The Ethnic Minority Grant Scheme is for projects designed to reduce racial disadvantage and promote racial equality. The Executive is currently conducting a strategic review of its funding for the black and ethnic minority voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>Yes. The requirements of Good Farming Practice, which will apply across the whole of any farm, croft or common grazing entered into the Rural Stewardship Scheme, will ensure that peat bogs are maintained in their current condition. In addition, payments are available under the Scheme for management of lowland raised bogs, for moorland which can include such sites and for implementing a special conservation management plan on small units such as crofts which could include peat bogs.</p>

  <p>Raised bogs in Scotland are protected in a number of ways, through planning guidance, forestry guidance and through ownership or management by conservation bodies, but the most comprehensive protection is through statutory site designation. There are at present 69 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) notified in Scotland for their raised bog interest. The sites listed below are also candidate Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the EC Habitats Directive or proposed for SAC status and currently undergoing public consultation. The Habitats Directive identifies active raised bog as a priority habitat for conservation, and raised bog which is degraded but still capable of natural regeneration as also requiring site designation. The candidate and proposed SACs in Scotland for these interests are:</p>

  <p>The sites marked * are also proposed under the &quot;degraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration&quot; category, in addition to Muir of Dinnet. The extent of Scottish candidate and proposed SAC for raised bog is 5,045 hectares.</p>

  <p>The Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 implement the Habitats Directive in Scotland, England and Wales, and place a statutory duty on planning and other public authorities not to permit developments or operations that would be damaging to the features protected within a SAC unless there are imperative reasons of overriding public interest.</p>

  <p>Raised Bog is also a priority habitat under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan and a costed Action Plan for the long-term safeguard and management of the habitat has been published. In addition to this national plan, raised bog has been identified as a priority by several local authorities in their Local Biodiversity Action Plans.</p>
