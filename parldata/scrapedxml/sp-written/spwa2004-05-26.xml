  <p>The charges that can be made for access to information under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 will be governed by fees regulations to be made under section 9 of the act. The draft regulations are presently the subject of a consultation exercise which ends on 31 May 2004. The consultation paper is available on the Executive&#8217;s website at:</p>

  <p>For information being published in accordance with an authority&#8217;s publication scheme, the Scottish Information Commissioner has advised in his guide to publication schemes (paragraphs 4.8 and 4.10) that the authority is free to set its own charges as long as they are not unreasonable.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has, since the publication of the Civil Partnerships Bill in the House of Lords, consulted with Scottish faith communities to ask if they would wish the freedom to choose whether they will be able to officiate in the creation of the civil status that will arise from the Civil Partnerships Bill once enacted in the same way as they may officiate in the creation of the civil status of marriage under the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 and what the results of any such consultation were.</p>

  <p>NHS boards and independent contractors have been advised to conduct audits of their premises to ensure that they have considered what reasonable adjustments may be appropriate to the way they deliver services for disabled people.

  <p>The Health Department carried out a survey to monitor the progress of NHSScotland bodies with disability access audits early in 2003. The survey results were published with <strong></strong> NHS HDL(2003)31 ( <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2003_31.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2003_31.pdf</a> ), issued on 8 July 2003. The Health Department intend to update this information shortly.</p>

  <p>The audit looks at access related to premises and property and may not impact directly on the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing people. However, the good practice guidance on access to services <em>Equality for disabled people in the NHS in</em> <em>Scotland</em> (Bib. number 7233) provides support and guidance for staff in meeting the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing people. This guidance is being updated in partnership with NHS Health Scotland to ensure that the support mechanisms are available for staff to apply the guidance.</p>

The training can include a short practical assessment to ensure trainees have reached a level of competency in using appropriate strategies when communicating with deaf people.</p>

  <p>The regulation of the electricity sector, including the security of electricity supply, is a reserved matter. The Scottish Executive will work with the JESS group to examine how Scottish electricity supply and demand data could appropriately be published or incorporated into the next JESS report.</p>

  <p>At the first meeting of the Financial Services Strategy Group (FSSG) in November, it was agreed that the group would develop a vision and strategy for the future success of the sector in Scotland. Three sub-groups were established to consider particular aspects of the strategy development. A steering group has met monthly since November and has been co-ordinating and overseeing the work of the subgroups. In parallel, a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) and PEST (political, economic, social and technological) analysis was commissioned to examine the environment in which the industry operates and to gather views from across the sector.</p>

  <p>The sub-groups presented their thinking to the strategy group yesterday. One group is compiling a picture of how we&#8217;d like the sector to look in five years time. Another has been considering the potential impact of off-shoring work currently undertaken in Scotland to lower cost regions such as India. The third has been heavily involved in refining the PEST analysis. The FSSG will consider the subgroup reports and other issues over the coming months as it continues to develop its vision and strategy for the sector. It remains on track to develop the strategy by the end of 2004.</p>

  <p>The 40% target is based upon a number of factors - the current level of renewables generation (mainly large hydro), Scotland&#8217;s potential renewable resource (equal to around ten times our peak demand) and the ability within that to develop a wide range of different technologies (for example wind, wave, hydro and biomass). The target was agreed following a consultation with the industry, academia and other expert stakeholders. Respondents agreed that 40% was a sufficiently challenging aspiration.</p>
