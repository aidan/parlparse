  <p>Through the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, Communities Scotland has powers to provide resources through the Housing Association Grant (HAG) scheme to Registered Social Landlords to support them in the provision of new or improved housing for social rent and for low-cost home ownership.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 provides Scottish ministers with the power to set standards for the performance of housing associations and other Registered Social Landlords. Performance Standards are developed and published jointly by Communities Scotland, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and COSLA.</p>

  <p>The current published performance standards set out the performance expectation that housing associations will identify and appraise the most important risks they face, and take a prudent approach to managing them. In meeting this standard, housing associations are expected to carry out regular risk appraisals, to identify key risks and have in place an appropriate risk management strategy. This should include contingency plans to respond to emergency events such as flooding.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 provides Scottish ministers with powers to intervene to address poor performance by housing associations. These powers have been delegated to Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>Where a housing association&#39;s performance is poor and it is failing to meet its obligations to tenants, Communities Scotland, on behalf of Scottish ministers, may:</p>

  <p>Remove members of the governing body of the housing association where their failure to act impedes the proper management of the organisation;</p>

  <p>Appoint persons to the governing body of the housing association for the purpose of improving the management of the organisation;</p>

  <p>Appoint a manager to the housing association, to ensure that the management of its affairs is of an appropriate standard, and</p>

  <p>Instruct a statutory inquiry into the affairs of the housing association, and (if required) a related Extraordinary Audit of its finances. If ministers conclude that there has been mismanagement or misconduct by the housing association, they have a further range of powers including directing the housing association to transfer its land to another registered landlord, following consultation with tenants.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 provides Scottish ministers with various powers in relation to housing associations and these powers have been delegated to Communities Scotland. However, Communities Scotland has no landlord function and no specific power to offer housing accommodation. The responsibility for finding suitable decant accommodation for tenants lies with the housing association. If approached by a housing association where there is insufficient accommodation to house decanted housing association tenants, Communities Scotland would support and assist the housing association by liasing with strategic partners and other housing providers in the area concerned to establish if additional accommodation could be made available by another social landlord.</p>
