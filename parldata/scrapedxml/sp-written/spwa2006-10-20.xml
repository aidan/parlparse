  <p>The payment window for the Single Farm Payment Scheme in the current year, as set in European Legislation, opens on 1 December 2006, and closes on 30 June 2007. My department aims to deliver payments to producers with eligible claims as early as possible in the payment window.</p>

  <p>I cannot, at this stage, give you a broad brush figure of the number of claims we will pay early in the payment window, as we must assess all claims individually to ensure that they are valid. This is set in Regulation.</p>

  <p>Arrangements are in hand for payment of a small number of outstanding cases. These claims were submitted shortly after the original valuations but were held up by a review of policy by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who fund such compensation, and a subsequent decision to cease such payments.

  <p>Historic Scotland does not have specific funds to cover provision for car parking for privately owned monuments. Drystane walling repair might be assisted through the agency&rsquo;s Ancient Monuments Grants programme but only where the walls are themselves of historic importance. Funding for the repair and reinstatement of drystane walls on agricultural land is available through the Land Management Contracts Menu Scheme which is administered by the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department. Support to farmers for building and restoration of traditional drystane walls has been available through agri-environment schemes such as the Environmentally Sensitive Area Schemes and the Rural Stewardship Scheme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of recent concerns expressed by the paper and aluminium industries about the quality of recyclable material being sent for reprocessing, what steps it is taking to ensure that the quality of recyclate is not being compromised in any attempt to increase the quantity of recyclables being collected.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-10-20.11.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa1020.htm#7">

  <p>We are taking action in a number of areas to ensure that the quality of recyclate is not being compromised.</p>

  <p>First of all, Strategic Waste Fund awards to local authorities have included provision for education and awareness, to support local Waste Aware Scotland campaigns, co-ordinated by the Scottish Waste Awareness Group (SWAG). Clear and simple advice to householders helps minimise contamination of recyclate.</p>

  <p>Secondly, both the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and REMADE Scotland carry out work on developing markets for recycled products. Their work includes liaison with local authorities and industry. REMADE, with support from WRAP, are currently undertaking a detailed market analysis for a variety of materials recovered in Scotland, and will be reporting on the state of these markets in the next few months.</p>

  <p>Finally, WRAP are working to develop a specification (PAS 105) for recovered paper. The introduction of a specification will help guarantee the quality of recovered paper.</p>

  <p>The data on numbers on community programmes is at present held at an individual local authority rather than national level. The Executive has developed an accredited Community Sex Offender Groupwork Programme (CSOGP) which is being delivered in five schemes covering 10 local authority areas with work underway to extend coverage to a further three schemes covering 12 local authority areas.</p>

  <p>Ring-fenced funding to local authorities for delivery of sex offender programmes in the community is provided under Section 27 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. Funding allocations for the financial years 1999-2000 to date are as follows:</p>

  <p>Scottish Prison Service Programmes.</p>

  <p>Over the period 2000 to 2006, a total of 283 STOP programmes were completed. In addition, prison based social workers provide focused individual intervention work with certain prisoners, including those who refuse to attend STOP programmes.</p>

  <p>Information on the costs of programme delivery specifically for sex offenders held in custody is not available. However, general information contained in the Audit Scotland report <em>Scottish Prison Service: Correctional Opportunities for Prisoners</em> published in January 2005 indicates the estimated levels of expenditure by SPS on correctional opportunities in SPS establishments.</p>

  <p>The annual rate of completions for the prison based Sex Offender Treatment Programme (STOP) programmes is projected to increase to 85 to 90 in 2006-07 and to 100 completions in 2007-08, compared to the 60 completions in 2004-05 and the 76 completions in 2005-06. Over the period 2000 to 2006, a total of 283 STOP programmes were completed. At present there are approximately 700 prisoners where the offence has a sexual dimension. The Integrated Case Management process determines the best time in a sentence for an individual prisoner to be offered a treatment programme.</p>

  <p>Data on the number of sex offenders attending community programmes, either as part of a community sentence or following discharge from custody, is at present held at an individual local authority rather than national level. However, the Executive will publish data on the number of probation orders with attendance on a sex offender programme as an additional condition, in future editions of the Statistical Bulletin Series on Criminal Justice Social Work.</p>
