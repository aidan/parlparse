  <p>We are aware that a great deal of good practice exists in our schools in integrating asylum seeker and refugee children into the school community. Last week Nicol Stephen launched a newsletter <i>, Welcoming Newcomers</i> , which aims to share best practice and promote race equality in all our schools. This will be distributed to all schools and equal opportunity interest groups.</p>

  <p>On Monday Iain Gray chaired the first meeting of the Scottish Refugee Integration Forum. This new forum will be used to drive Executive policy on the devolved matters which affect people who have been granted asylum, such as housing, health, and education. The forum will help to develop action plans, based on best practice, to bring together refugees and existing communities, with the provision of more accessible and co-ordinated services.</p>

The GROS plans to make the census returns available as indexed digital images in New Register House from 24 January.

  <p>I am personally committed to the promotion of Burns both at home and abroad and I welcome the wide range of events that takes place throughout Scotland to celebrate Robert Burns a literary genius.</p>

  <p>The Executive is playing its part - supporting last week's Children&#8217;s Opera "the Tale o' Tam<i>"</i> and funding A Tam O Shanter CD Project to be distributed free to all primary and secondary schools in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Burns is not just appreciated by Scots and the "Burns an'a that<i>"</i> Festival in May provides an opportunity to promote the life and works of Robert Burns, drawing people to his homeland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive's <i>Drug Action Plan:</i> <i>Protecting our Future</i> sets the national standard that all schools will provide drug education to every pupil and will have written procedures for managing incidents of drug misuse, in line with national advice, by 2002. This commitment to drug education is reflected in our <i>Programme for Government, Working Together for Scotland</i> .</p>

  <p>We undertake an annual survey of schools and in the latest survey 97% of schools reported that they provided drug education to every pupil, 81% in line with national advice. To assist education authorities and schools to deliver the national standards, additional grant funding has been made available in 2001-02 as shown in the following table. No previous grant funding has been made available. A further survey of schools will be carried out this year.</p>

  <p>National guidelines set out the principles which should be observed, but it is for education authorities and school managers to develop their health education programmes and determine the resources that will be used, including the choice of drug education material. We have no plans to specify the choice of resources.</p>

  <p>All SEERAD Area Offices and sub-offices have contingency plans for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks and each of the five Divisional Animal Health Offices have detailed instructions for dealing with all notifiable disease emergencies including FMD. Practical FMD control exercises are carried out every second year by each of the five divisional AHO offices and at every exercise participants are invited from other AHO offices, the State Veterinary Service Head Office in Edinburgh, SEERAD Area Offices, local authorities and other relevant agencies.</p>

  <p>In addition, these instructions and contingency plans are backed by local authority and police authority contingency plans providing detailed instructions for dealing with disease emergencies.</p>

  <p>Since the scale and nature of outbreaks are unpredictable it is not possible to make any realistic estimate about the spread of foot-and-mouth disease or the likely number of cases. SEERAD Area Office and State Veterinary Service plans do not contain estimates for specialist assistance in slaughter or for the hire or purchase of additional equipment. However, information about availability of specialist equipment is usually available from contingency plans drawn up by local authorities, which cover a wide range of emergency situations.</p>

  <p>SEERAD made two key sources of information available to those involved in tackling the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001.</p>

  <p>The first source was basic information held in the EU Agricultural subsidies database, the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) which provided details of all IACS and agri-environment claimants. This covers most agricultural holdings, the exception being pig and poultry farms and non-claimants. The IACS Field Register was used to provide geographic information on the boundaries of fields and farms. The grid reference of each holding found to be infected was used to identify details of fields and farms located within the 3km exclusion zone of that holding. A set procedure was established to ensure that checks were undertaken within SEERAD to verify the grid reference prior to use, to ensure its accuracy. Under the IACS regulations, claimants are subject to a regime of administrative checks and on-the-spot inspections to validate claims, with a percentage of farms inspected each year. The inspection process includes checks on the physical field boundaries. These existing check processes ensured that the data were fit for use in fighting foot-and-mouth disease.</p>

  <p>The second source was the Agricultural Census, which provided a register of all agricultural holdings. Farmers are required to register their agricultural holdings with the census branch under sections 78 and 79 of the Agriculture Act 1947, and thus the details held should be complete and current. However, in reality, it is acknowledged that a small number of farmers refuse to complete census forms or confirm land movements, and thus completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed. The census registration includes pig and poultry farms and non (or part-non) claimants, and so could be used to complement the IACS information.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, local knowledge of SEERAD agricultural staff from the local area office was used to supplement the centrally-held information. There were no significant accuracy issues identified with either data source, although there were a few instances where people owned livestock as pets and so their address was not classified as agricultural premises and not identified by the data sources.</p>

However, in reality, it is acknowledged that a small number of farmers refuse to complete census forms or confirm land movements, and thus completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) holds details of all claimants for EU agricultural subsidies. Both systems are subject to restrictions on the uses to which these data may be put, due to confidentiality constraints. Discussions are on-going to ensure that coverage of both systems is as complete and consistent as possible.</p>

  <p>Retention rates in higher education institutions in Scotland are high by international standards. However, the Scottish Executive recognises that it is important to minimise non-completion, which is why my guidance letter of 10 December 2001 asked the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to continue to work with institutions and with the department, to develop a better understanding of the factors affecting the variation in retention rates between institutions.</p>

  <p>The work of the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB), since its creation a few years ago, has been broadly welcomed by the arts and humanities research community in Scotland as a body which is improving the standing of arts and humanities research and researchers. In the unlikely event that problems were to arise in the future, then we would expect the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to resolve those with the AHRB so that Scottish institutions are properly served.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of road gritters operated by BEAR Scotland Ltd can be found in the Winter Maintenance Plans published by BEAR for the North East and North West Units, copies of which are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. No&#8217;s 18110 and 18114).</p>

  <p>It is not possible to make direct comparisons between BEAR and the previous operator as Highland Council had resources to fulfil its responsibilities on both trunk and local roads. Other factors that influence direct comparisons are the size and the types of vehicles used, age and reliability of vehicles and modern technology.</p>

  <p>It is standard practice for Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) to show all draft reports to the relevant education authority, headteacher and school board chair before publication. Any additional evidence provided at this stage is taken into account by HMIE as they finalise the report. The source of the evidence is not of itself significant in that process. Based on all the evidence gathered in the course of the inspection, the published report records HMIE&#8217;s professional evaluation of the standard of the school. Minor changes are common, but the final decision on every such change rests with HMIE.</p>

  <p>Under the Income Contingent Repayment system, introduced for students starting in higher education from 1998, students are not required to repay their student loans until they leave their course, whether or not they complete it, and are earning more than the annual income threshold of &#163;10,000, after which payments are made at the rate of 9% of income over &#163;10,000.

  <p>Annual estimated deer population figures are not held by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Deer Commission for Scotland (DCS) is the statutory body charged with furthering the conservation, control and sustainable management of wild deer in Scotland and detailed deer data is published in their Annual Report, which is laid before Parliament (Bib. number 17932).</p>

  <p>Estimates of red deer numbers and densities over previous years are also available from the DCS. General indications are that over the last 40 years, in many areas, red deer numbers and densities have been increasing. Similar information on other species is not collated.</p>

  <p>Red deer estimates are based on a rolling programme of deer counts by DCS itself as well as counts carried out by estates which they are encouraged to undertake as part of an integral approach to good land management. There are currently no generally accepted methods of estimating numbers of other species over a large area.</p>

  <p>In recent years, DCS has moved away from national statistics to describe deer populations in Scotland due to the temporal inaccuracy of the data. DCS considers that the best method of deer control is a co-ordinated management approach at local level, where numbers and densities make more sense, through a system of Deer Management Groups. This approach is endorsed by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) became an employer in its own right on 1 April 2000 and began carrying out its own recruitment from January 2000. Prior to that date recruitment was conducted on behalf of the SPCB by the Scottish Office/Scottish Executive. Our records only go back to January 2000.</p>

  <p>Details of advertisements placed in publications outwith Scotland from January 2000 are set out in the table below.</p>
