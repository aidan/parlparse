  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) have advised that they intend to take forward the recruitment of an additional member of staff for the Arrochar station. In addition, this additional crew member will support the elimination of single-rostered crewing in this area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that the SAS continues to provide sage, efficient and effective services to patients across Scotland, including those in remote and rural area. It is also important that patients have confidence in the SAS&rsquo;s ability to respond to emergencies.</p>

  <p>While this presents particular challenges in remote and rural locations, the service seeks to improve performance for all patients and remains keen to seek local solutions that meet the needs of those communities. In addition, the SAS has appointed a first responder co-ordinator in this area to develop and support first responder schemes.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why it reduced the national performance targets for the Scottish Ambulance Service for category A calls from 75% for each NHS board area to 75% across Scotland and whether it is concerned that rural areas will experience reduced response times.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-09-04.S3W-15472.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0904.htm#1">

  <p>It is important to ensure that performance targets are challenging but deliverable. On that basis, the national performance target for responding to category A calls was revised to be achieved across mainland Scotland by March 2009, rather than within each individual NHS board area.</p>

  <p>We recognise that achievement at a Scotland-wide level will mean that there may be some communities where this target is not routinely being met. That is why the Scottish Government is looking for the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) to demonstrate that across all parts of Scotland it is working to secure continuous improvement, particularly in remote and rural areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and the SAS are committed to ensuring safe, efficient and effective health services across all parts of Scotland, including remote and rural areas. The SAS will continue to work with local partners to achieve this.</p>

  <p>The Gull Summit in Dumfries on 24 June 2008 concluded that the implementation of preventative measures such as gull proofing and nest destruction is the most effective way to reduce the size of urban gull colonies and to limit nesting success. Implementation of such measures had been shown to reduce the number of successful nesting attempts in Dumfries between 2002 and 2008 by 23%.</p>

  <p>A report summarising the main points of discussion raised at the summit has been produced by the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency and a copy has been attached to this response. The Scottish Government announced on 22 August 2008 that it had agreed to participate in a pilot project in conjunction with Dumfries and Galloway Council and that a task force would lead work on the identification of suitable management measures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government fully appreciates that urban gull colonies can cause problems for residents and businesses in Scottish towns and together with its agencies is committed to providing information and expert advice to support local management action. The pilot project has the potential to develop a general action plan which could be applied by other local authorities and local communities seeking to manage the effects of urban gull colonies in their area.</p>

  <p>In June 2008, I announced that, alongside the roll-out of the Domestic Abuse Court in Glasgow, the Scottish Government will be extending provision for the ASSIST service to support victims and their children in the 3 police divisions of the city of Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Ministers are currently considering a proposal from ASSIST and I expect a decision to be made shortly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government accepted the conclusion of the feasibility study group that to assist the support to victims and their children across Scotland, development work is required to:</p>

  <p>Develop occupational standards for working with victims of domestic abuse;</p>

  <p>Increase the collaboration and opportunity for joint activity between key agencies working with victims of domestic abuse and other forms of violence against women;</p>

  <p>Work with local partners providing services to victims to develop enhanced support provision, and</p>

  <p>Develop an operational manual that could be used to improve support for victims of domestic abuse and enable organisations to develop co-ordination and advocacy work.</p>

  <p>Further details can be found in section 5 of the feasibility study group report.</p>

  <p>This work will be taken forward over the next three years.</p>

  <p>Ministers and officials have discussed the Gould Report with our UK counterparts on a number of occasions. The Parliament welcomed Ron Gould&rsquo;s report, including the recommendation calling for the further devolution of executive and legislative powers to the Scottish Government and the Parliament for the administration of its own elections and the decoupling of future elections to the Parliament and Scotland&rsquo;s councils. We are very disappointed that the UK Government has not accepted this. We will continue to press them to change their position and allow the Parliament to take responsibility for its own elections.</p>

  <p>I am meeting the Lord Advocate to discuss this issue on 4 September 2008.</p>

  <p>Our aim is to find a solution which allows inquiries into the deaths of Scottish-based service personnel who are killed abroad to be held in Scotland.</p>

  <p>At present, for operational reasons, bodies are returned to RAF airfields in the south of England by the Ministry of Defence. They then automatically become subject to the system of coroners&rsquo; inquests in England. Coroners&rsquo; inquests into the deaths of Scottish-based personnel killed abroad cannot currently take place in Scotland, and fatal accident inquiries can only investigate deaths occurring in Scotland.</p>

  <p>These are difficult legal and policy issues. The Lord Advocate and I will work constructively with the UK Government to resolve them. All of us must remember that the objective is to reduce the stress and anguish for bereaved families in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Because of the defence reservation in the Scotland Act, changes in the law would be required on both sides of the border.</p>

  <p>We are delivering a more effective penal policy, with accelerated justice for offenders and a better targeted and more robust range of sentences for the courts. We are also addressing the underlying causes of offending through our early intervention strategy, including support for young parents, more constructive activities for young people and tackling the &quot;three D&rsquo;s&quot; of drink, drugs and deprivation.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are responsible for commissioning new school buildings, not the Scottish Government. It is authorities who decide on the detail of investment in individual schools from the &pound;3 billion in capital allocated to them over the period of this spending review. As indicated in <em>Infrastructure Investment Plan 2008</em> , published in March 2008, we anticipate that the rebuilding or refurbishment of around 250 schools will be delivered or secured and financed during the current four-year parliamentary period.</p>

  <p>Seven school projects comprising 45 schools have reached financial close since May 2007. A further four are in the pipeline. Combined these projects have a capital value of &pound;1 billion, financially supported by decisions of the Scottish Government.</p>
