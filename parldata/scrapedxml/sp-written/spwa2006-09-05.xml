  <p>As explained in the answer to question S2W-27584 on 17 August 2006, we are currently developing regulations under section 39 of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005, which will implement a new regime for the reorganisation of charities, enabling charities to seek approval for reorganisation from the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) if their constitutions do not permit them to make the change, rather than having to apply to court. These regulations will make provision about the form and manner of applications to OSCR. We intend to consult on the new regulations later this year, with a view to bringing them into force and commencing the provisions in sections 39 to 42 early next year. The exact date for commencing the regulations is dependent on the outcome of the consultation.</p>

  <p>Charities with the necessary powers in their constitutions can seek the consent of OSCR to reorganise under section 16. This section is already in force and OSCR is processing consents under it.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether doctors, veterinarians and farmers are considered to be &quot;operators&quot; under the EU Environmental Liability Directive and would be considered liable for remediation costs in respect of environmental harm if that harm arose from their use of genetically modified vaccines, crops or other organisms unless Scottish implementing regulations define &quot;operators&quot; otherwise.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-09-05.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0905.htm#2">

  <p>The Directive defines &quot;operator&quot; quite widely to include any person who operates or controls an activity, business or undertaking, irrespective of its private or public, profit or non-profit character. Therefore doctors, veterinarians and farmers can under certain circumstances fall within the scope of the EU Environmental Liability Directive.</p>

  <p>However, there would have to be &quot;significant damage&quot; to water, land and the environment and this is highly unlikely given that an environmental risk assessment is undertaken before a genetically modified organism is authorised for release.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what funding will be made available to Scottish Natural Heritage over the next five years for the purpose of monitoring the effectiveness of management agreements entered into with landowners and tenants in the south of Scotland for the improvement of moorland habitats.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) receives funding for all its activities in its annual Grant-in-Aid settlement. Decisions about the allocation of resources within the approved budget are a matter for the board of SNH. SNH&rsquo;s plans take account of the need to provide for effective compliance monitoring of management agreements.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what funding will be made available to Scottish Natural Heritage to ensure that there is continuing monitoring, after the end of a management agreement, of moorland habitats which have been the subjects of management agreements between Scottish Natural Heritage and landowners and their tenants in the south of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Where Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) management agreements come to an end and are replaced by a new agreement, compliance monitoring will continue to take place to ensure that contractual obligations are fulfilled. In other cases where an SNH management agreement ceases and is not replaced by any other form of funding support SNH plans to continue its general programme of site condition monitoring. It is for SNH to determine the appropriate level of resource necessary to fund these requirements within their annual grant-in-aid provision.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, for each project which has been considered for the award of a grant under the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme, who the applicant was, how much grant was awarded, on what date the award was confirmed and what objective assessment processes were used to determine whether or not the application would succeed.</p>

  <p>We introduced the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme in June 2003, and details of the payments made (and those to be claimed once the work has been satisfactorily completed), up to and including Friday 18 August 2006, have been published on the webpages of Forestry Commission Scotland and can be viewed at <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/sfgsgrantdetails" target="_blank">www.forestry.gov.uk/sfgsgrantdetails</a> . The information about grants has been provided in different views and in a separate file to enable further analysis.</p>

  <p>For each component of grant in any scheme, details are provided: a reference number, name of the scheme, Forestry Commission Scotland Conservancy area, applicant&rsquo;s name and (where appropriate) organisation, recipient of grant, local authority area, Ordnance Survey grid reference, date approved, objective type (purpose for which the grant was given), payment date, amount paid, and any outstanding grant. The scheme closed at the end of the August.</p>

  <p>The criteria, against which all applications have been judged, are given in the guidance for applicants published on the webpages (<a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-6T6CBC" target="_blank">www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-6T6CBC</a>) together with the rules (<a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-6J6MGE" target="_blank">www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-6J6MGE</a>) used to determine in which year grants would be paid.</p>

There is no maximum permitted length of time between sample collection, but the regulations require that samples be collected at regular intervals during the year.</p>
