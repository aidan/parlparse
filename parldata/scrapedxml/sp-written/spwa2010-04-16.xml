  <p>The 2020 Climate Delivery Group has been convened by Ian Marchant, Chief Executive of Scottish and Southern Energy, and aims to ensure that all sectors of Scotland&rsquo;s economy and civic society contribute fully to achieving Scotland&rsquo;s world-leading target of 42% emissions reductions by 2020, as set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.</p>

  <p>The group is independent of government, but the Scottish Government is represented on the group by a senior civil servant. Ian Marchant, as convener of the 2020 group, is also an observer on the ministerial/COSLA-led Public Sector Climate Action Group in order to provide crucial co-ordination between the public and private sectors.</p>

  <p>The 2020 group is currently meeting in six sub-groups on public and business engagement, transport, built environment, land use and forestry, finance, and challenges and opportunities. Each sub-group has an observer from the Scottish Government to ensure close alignment with the objectives of the Climate Change Delivery Plan.</p>

  <p>A report on Scotland&rsquo;s ecological and greenhouse gas footprints 1992-2006 by the Stockholm Environment Institute and commissioned by Scottish Government Social Research was published on 29 October 2009 at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/10/28101012/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/10/28101012/0</a> .</p>

  <p>Section 37 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 requires Scottish Ministers to lay before the Scottish Parliament a report on emissions attributable to Scottish consumption of goods and services in respect of each year in the period 2010-50. Scotland&rsquo;s Greenhouse Gas Inventory for 2010 will be available in 2012 so a decision on when to commission the next analysis of Scotland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas footprint will be taken nearer the time.</p>

  <p>Seven councils, a fire board and a non-departmental public body had deposits with Icelandic banks at the time that they were placed into administration or receivership in 2007. The non-departmental public body made an impairment charge to its 2008-09 accounts. Scottish ministers issued statutory accounting guidance in March 2009 to permit the local authorities involved to postpone the financial impact from making an impairment charge for these deposits until 2010-11. COSLA recently requested that this guidance be extended to cover 2011-12 and this request is currently being considered.</p>

  <p>In addition, we controlled the Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA) outbreak in South West Shetland which occurred in various sites in the area from December 2008 to May 2009.

  <p>We have established a Psychological Therapies Group to oversee the implementation of the advice in The Matrix, a tool for NHS boards to use in reviewing available evidence and in considering which psychological interventions might best be used to meet local need and demand, its continuous updating, and to expand its coverage to other key priority areas in mental health.</p>

  <p>In collaboration with Skills for Health, NES has also produced psychological therapy competence frameworks to ensure that training equips staff to delivery therapy safely and effectively. We have also funded NES to support the training of a range of staff in a number of evidenced based therapeutic approaches.</p>

  <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong><strong><span lang="">The objective of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 is to make sure people with mental health problems receive effective care and treatment in a way which accords with the Millan principles. </span></strong></p>

  <p><span lang="">Section 328(1) of the act defines &quot;mental disorder&quot; as &quot;mental illness, personality disorder or learning disability, however caused or manifested&quot;.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Diagnosis of mental disorder can only be made by an approved medical practitioner (AMP): this is a medical practitioner who has been approved under section 22 of the act by a health Board or by the State Hospitals Board for Scotland as having special experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorder. An approved medical practitioner will often be a consultant psychiatrist. All AMPs must undergo a two day training package in the provisions of the act before being approved to carry out AMP duties under the act.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">The act makes provision for the Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland which exercises powers in relation to detention and which ensures that the clinical judgements of AMPs and mental health officers (MHOs) are subject to appropriate scrutiny.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Before an individual is diagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder, there are specific criteria laid down to enable such a diagnosis to be made. There are currently two established international classification systems for mental disorders - ICD.10 and DSM-IV.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Diagnosis is the expression of a clinical judgement and does not in itself have legal consequences in respect of the liberty of the individual. Where the powers of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 are invoked the law does provide for appropriate appeal rights.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Where an individual feels that they may have been misdiagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder of any sort they may ask for a second opinion or they may contact the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland to look into their complaint.</span></p>

In both of these cases there must be a significant risk to the health and safety of the patient or the safety of others. Thirdly, the Scottish Ministers can, by means of a direction under the act, transfer a prisoner to hospital for treatment on the basis of reports from two medical practitioners who confirm that the prisoner has a mental disorder, and again that there is significant risk to the health, safety or welfare of the prisoner or to the safety of any other person if medical treatment is not provided.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">In the cases of short term detention and any transfer to hospital for treatment of a prisoner, both the patient and their named person can apply to the Mental Health Tribunal for revocation of the power to detain and treat.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Deaths of people subject to mental health legislation are reported to the Mental Welfare Commission. The commission requests an account of the circumstances of death, which is then considered by a member of professional staff and any concerns followed up. Where the commission is satisfied that death was due to natural causes, it will not investigate further.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">72 deaths of people subject to mental health legislation were reported to the Commission during 2009. Most of these deaths were of individuals who were over the age of 60 and were due to natural causes. All of these deaths were reported to the Procurator Fiscal. The commission does not investigate suicides of people known to mental health services unless there is an allegation of deficiency of care. However, in all cases where there is an incident review, the commission requests a copy when it is complete. The commission will investigate if it is not satisfied that the local investigation has been performed with sufficient rigour.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">All deaths by suicide of psychiatric patients, formal or informal, in contact with psychiatric services are subject to a health board critical incident review and then become part of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness (NCISH). The recommendations at a service level from the NCISH are then fed back to health boards for implementation. We believe this has reduced the inpatient suicide numbers significantly in last five year report. The Scottish Government continues to fund this process through Manchester University in conjunction with the National Patient Safety Agency.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">NHS critical incident reviews are also independently quality assured through NHS Quality Improvement Scotland.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">The Cullen report <em>Review of Fatal Accident Inquiry Legislation</em> which was published on 3 November 2009 made a recommendation regarding deaths of people detained under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. The report&rsquo;s recommendations are currently being considered by the Scottish Government.</span></p>
