  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-832 by Peter Peacock on 23 June 2003, what proportion of the education budget for 2004-05 has been allocated to children with any form of special needs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-03-16.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80097" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0316.htm#1">

  <p>Funds are distributed to local authorities through Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE). In 2004-05, the GAE for Education is &#163;3,808 million. This figure includes &#163;256 million for provision for special educational needs. However, a number of Programmes within Education GAE also help support children with special educational needs. For example, &#163;25 million is being allocated through the Inclusion Programme to support pupils in mainstream schools. A further &#163;21 million is being provided for the Alternatives to Exclusion Programme and to implement the Discipline Task Group recommendations. The Integrated Community Schools Programme totals &#163;21.5 million to help promote social inclusion and the raising of educational standards.</p>

  <p>The GAE for Education does not represent a budget or spending target, but forms part of a more complex formula used to calculate the total revenue grant figure. It is for individual local authorities to determine how much they allocate to each service, including special educational needs, from their total unhypothecated revenue grant. Revenue grant will increase by 4.8% in 2004-05, with further above inflation increase planned for 2005-06.</p>

  <p>There are also a number of other Executive funding programmes for local authorities, which support, although not exclusively, children with special educational needs. For example, in 2004-05, the Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund totals &#163;60.5 million and will support better integration of services for children and young people.</p>

  <p>An additional &#163;12 million will also be made available in 2004-05 to support preparation for the implementation of the Additional Support for Learning Bill.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to <em>Forgotten Children, Addressing the Health Issues of Looked After Children and Young People</em> , what steps it will take to ensure that (a) comprehensive assessments are made of the physical, mental and developmental well-being of all young people and children at the earliest opportunity after entry into the care system, (b) background information and previous medical records on children are easily accessible, (c) written health records move with young people throughout their period in care together with a proactive healthcare plan and (d) a dedicated post is created for a health professional to access different health systems.</p>

  <p>The report, Forgotten Children, is an NHS Lothian report based on studies of looked after children in Edinburgh, East Lothian and Midlothian. Those authorities will find it a useful source of information on what is happening on the ground in their areas.</p>

  <p>In relation to action on the issues covered in this question, guidance issued by the Executive on The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 &#8211; volume 2, Children Looked After by Local Authorities states that care plans for looked after children should fully reflect health care needs. Local authorities are required to arrange for a medical examination to provide a comprehensive health profile of the child and to give a basis for monitoring the child&#8217;s development for the period they are looked after.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to <em>Forgotten Children, Addressing the Health Issues of Looked After Children and Young People</em> , what steps will be taken in respect of the recommendation that child and adolescent mental health services should develop dedicated practitioners or teams with an expertise in managing the mental health needs of looked after children.</p>

  <p>Volume 2 of the guidance on the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 states that the care plan should set out the educational and wider developmental needs of the child being looked after. Local authorities should provide educational and developmental opportunities and support and promote potential and achievement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently working with its expert advisory Child Health Support Group to secure improvement in children and young people&#8217;s mental health and in Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) services, through implementation of the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) <em>Report on Child and Adolescent Mental Health</em>, published last year. It is anticipated that this work will improve the capacity of specialist CAMH services to provide a more effective service for looked after children and young people. A key element is the development of a &quot;template&quot; which will describe the essential elements of a comprehensive CAMH service. It will include services for vulnerable children and young people, such as those who are looked after, and is expected to be published in the autumn of 2004. However, decisions about local health service provision are ultimately a matter for each NHS board.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive published a revised NHS Code of Practice on Protecting Patient Confidentiality in July 2003 and issued guidance in August on The Use of Personal Health Information in NHSScotland to Support Patient Care. Guidance on sharing information and confidentiality is also provided in Getting our Priorities Right, published in February 2003.</p>

  <p>Volume 2 of the guidance on the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, Children Looked After by Local Authorities states that children being looked after should have the same access to NHS provision and school health services as other children.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to <em>Forgotten Children, Addressing the Health Issues of Looked After Children and Young People</em> , what steps will be taken to introduce guidelines for good practice between care staff and GP surgeries to (a) create closer working links between residential care staff and staff at the local GP surgery, (b) ensure full registration of young people with the allied GP surgery by 12 weeks into placement, (c) guarantee closer working links between allied GP surgeries and the Practitioner Services Division&#160;for the central collation and fast tracking of GP notes and (d) create closer working links between allied GP surgeries and community child health departments, in particular with the nurse for looked after children.</p>

  <p>Volume 2 of the guidance on The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 states that children must be registered with a GP and dental practioner once they become looked after. As part of their care planning local authorities will want to ensure that they are closely involved with the GP surgery and that the health needs of the child are being met.</p>

  <p>The PARTNERS programme, which has been rolled out to virtually all GP practices in Scotland, allows faster and more accurate registration of patients with GP practices. Patient records are currently transferred between GP practices via the Common Services Agency and fast track arrangements are in place where records are required urgently. Work is ongoing to develop and implement programmes to link GP practices and the Practitioner Services Division electronically, in order to support the electronic exchange of records.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no current plans to introduce specific good practice guidance to create closer working links between allied GP surgeries and community health departments. However, draft statutory guidance was published on 8th March for consultation on the establishment of Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) under the NHS Reform (Scotland) Bill. NHS boards will be expected to discuss and agree with local authority and other stakeholders the services which each CHP will manage and/or co-ordinate. However, the draft statutory guidance states that CHPs should directly manage and provide, or have a lead role in co-ordinating, influencing or directing the delivery of services to support vulnerable groups of children and young children including those looked after by the local authority. The statutory guidance will be finalised once the NHS Reform (Scotland) Bill is enacted.</p>

  <p>Under the Executive&#39;s Carers Strategy, which was launched in November 1999, resources to local authorities to support carers have risen from &#163;5 million a year in 1999-2000 to &#163;21 million a year in 2003-04. The Carers Strategy specifically states that local authorities should consult local carers and key stakeholders on spending decisions for these resources. The strategy also goes on to state that in providing services authorities must take into account the needs and priorities of carers from black and minority ethnic groups, in accordance with their statutory obligations under the Race Relations Act 1976.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also funded the Minority Ethnic Carers of Older People Project, based in Edinburgh, to develop a culturally sensitive assessment instrument for users and carers. This instrument is now available and the Executive is currently funding the instrument&#8217;s promotion at a national level. Training of key staff in statutory agencies is already underway.</p>

  <p>Alison Bowes and Heather Wilkinson (Stirling University) received a grant from the Chief Scientist Office in 2002 to carry out a feasibility study to establish effective ways of ascertaining the views of older South Asian people with dementia, their families and carers, and to explore central issues of service support.</p>

  <p>The study concluded that South Asian communities lack knowledge and experience of dementia and access to appropriate services, especially at home and highlighted the need to develop responsive services, to address issues of diagnosis and to learn from existing expertise.</p>

  <p>The researchers suggested that future research could usefully cover dementia experiences and awareness in minority communities, and the identification and evaluation of good practice experience on a wider front.</p>

  <p>Benefits of the new methodology include:</p>

  <p>1. Annual weights are more up-to-date and therefore more relevant, reflecting changes in the structure of the economy when they happen.</p>

  <p>2. Rebasing revisions will occur to a much lesser extent than under the previous fixed base methodology which led to large revisions every five years.</p>

  <p>3. Annual chain-linking reduces the inaccuracies caused by the assumption of a stable relationship between gross value added and turnover.</p>

  <p>4. Under the previous fixed-base methodology where weights were updated every five years, the choice of year to link indices together was a subjective process and the optimum link year varied across indices. With chain-linking, every year is automatically a link year, so no subjective choice is required.</p>

  <p>A more detailed report on the new chain-linking methodology and its effects is included on the Scottish Executive GDP website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/gdp">www.scotland.gov.uk/gdp</a>.</p>

No changes in pack prices occurred during that period therefore it would appear that the increase in costs is attributable to greater use of the modified release preparation Concerta XL&#174;.</p>

  <p>In December 2002, we informed drugs services that the Lord Advocate had set new limits on the number of needles and syringes which could be issued to clients attending needle exchanges. The limits were increased to a maximum of 20 sets on first visit, and a maximum of 60 sets on subsequent visits, subject to return of used sets for safe disposal.</p>

  <p>It is for local services to purchase and distribute this equipment, based on local priorities and demand. Allocations of injecting equipment to individual clients will depend on the needs and circumstances in each case. The answer given to question S2W-6704 on 16 March 2004 describes the resources made available from the Executive which can be used to support local needle exchange facilities.</p>

  <p>The Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) pays a tuition fee contribution (&#163;1,125 in 2003-04) on behalf of all eligible Scottish domiciled and EU students undertaking full-time higher education courses in Scotland.

  <p>The European Commission&#8217;s Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion, published on 18 February, outlines their proposals for the Structural and Cohesion Funds in the next programming period from 2007-13.</p>

  <p>The Commission proposes that regions which would have qualified for Objective 1 had it not been for the statistical effect of enlargement would be eligible for compensation funding. Eligible regions would have an average GDP for 2001-03 of less than 75% of the EU15 average. The most recent data available (for 2001) shows the Highlands and Islands GDP as 72.4% of the EU15 average.</p>

  <p>The debate is at an early stage. The Commission is expected to publish formal regulation proposals in July for negotiation among member states. It is hoped that agreement on the proposals can be reached in the Council of Ministers by the end of 2005. As any future regime must be agreed by all member states, it is not yet possible to predict what structural funds support the Highlands and Islands or other Scottish regions may receive post 2006.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers acting through Communities Scotland now require East Lothian Council to take action to ensure that homeless people in its area receive adequate services. The council&#8217;s improvement plan, setting out how it will respond to the findings of the Pathfinder Inspection Report is due to be submitted on 17 March 2004.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland expects this to contain immediate, short term and longer term actions to progress improvements. The agency will then agree arrangements with the local authority for monitoring the implementation of the plan to ensure that the necessary improvements in the services for homeless people and those threatened with homelessness are achieved. Performance in this area will be reassessed within two years and a full re-inspection of the local authority will be carried out within five years.</p>

Before the Executive decides what action to take on the committee&#8217;s recommendations we will hold a period of open consultation - to obtain the views of those organisations and individuals with an involvement or interest in the criminal justice system. Views from members of the public will also be welcomed.</p>

  <p>We are today writing to all the key stakeholders (including the justice committees) with copies of the report, inviting their comments. I am also inviting comments from all those individuals and groups who responded to the committee&#8217;s earlier requests for views. The report will be available electronically on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s consultation website, and we are lodging copies in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre. Responses can be submitted by e-mail or post.</p>

  <p>We have received no representations from the Office of Fair Trading on the contents and effectiveness of the Master Insurance Policy of the Law Society of Scotland.</p>

  <p>As regards the provision of legal services, the Office of Fair Trading published a report in 2001 <em>Competition in Professions</em> which challenged anti-competitive restrictions in England and Wales. The report triggered a range of consultation by the former Lord Chancellor&#8217;s Department which led to the far-ranging independent review of the regulation of the legal services market in England and Wales, led by Sir David Clementi, of which competition in the provision of legal services is a significant element.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been in regular contact with the Office of Fair Trading about the implications of competition law for the provision of legal services in Scotland. Regulation and competition in the legal services market in Scotland is to be the subject of research steered by a working group chaired by the Justice Department and including representatives of consumer and professional interests, the Office of Fair Trading and the Scottish Legal Aid Board.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the unemployment rate, based on the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of unemployment, in Fife since 1999. Prior to 1999, unemployment rates were not available for Fife. 2002 is the latest year for which information is available.</p>

  <p>Table 1</p>

  <p>The data used in these figures is taken form the Labour Force Survey (LFS) which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics. For smaller geographical areas, the data becomes less reliable because there are less people sampled.</p>

  <p>The sample sizes over the last four years for those unemployed in Fife are not too different, but a slight drop in the numbers sampled in 2000 with a corresponding rise in the number of employed people sampled means that the unemployment rate appears to have dropped.</p>

  <p>The claimant count rate shown in Table 2 is based on administrative records and has not fluctuated as much. Therefore, the drop in the 2000 unemployment figure in Table 1 is more than likely due to sampling error rather than a real change.</p>

  <p>Table 2 shows the annual average residence-based claimant count rate for Fife in the last five years. 2003 is the latest year for which information is available.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently commissioning the Office for National Statistics to carry out a boost to the Labour Force Survey in Scotland with an aim of surveying 875 economical active people in each local authority area. (The target will be lower for some of the smaller local authorities). In Fife, this means that more economically active people will be sampled. This should improve the reliability of the Labour Force Survey at a local level. Results from the boost should be available in autumn 2004.</p>
