  <p>Yes. Amongst the measures which comprise good agricultural and environmental condition are several relating to a minimum level of maintenance. These include protecting rough grazings and other semi-natural areas, protecting field boundaries and designated historic features, and avoiding the deterioration of non-productive landscape features such as shelter belts, copses and ponds.</p>

  <p>I have asked Karen Watt, Chief Executive of the Scottish Housing Regulator to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The following table details the number of interim antisocial behaviour orders (ASBO) that have been applied for by registered social landlords (RSLs) and subsequently granted in each year by local authority area since 2006-07. Prior to 2006-07 this data was not collected as part of the annual performance statistical return submitted by RSLs to Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>The staffing levels at St Mary&rsquo;s Kenmure are agreed between the Care Commission and the board of managers of St Mary&rsquo;s Kenmure and are monitored as part of inspections. The Care Commission has statutory powers which can be deployed where necessary to deal with services that do not meet requirements.

  <p>All eligible full-time students can apply for tuition fee support for full-time further and higher education (HE) courses as well as a means tested loan and/or young students&rsquo; bursary for HE students and means tested grants for further education (FE) students.</p>

  <p>However the Scottish Government recognises that some students have additional financial barriers as a result of their personal circumstances.</p>

  <p>Therefore, an eligible full-time HE student can receive additional support from the Loan Parents Grant and Loan Parents Childcare Grant. For the current academic year, eligible students can claim Lone Parents Grant of &pound;1,270 per year and up to &pound;1,185 per year towards formal childcare costs.</p>

  <p>All students with dependants who are facing additional financial difficulty can also access the further or higher education childcare funds, which institutions administer as part of the discretionary funds. We have allocated &pound;4,562,639 to the higher education discretionary child care fund for the current academic year and child care costs can also be paid from the general discretionary fund if institutions consider it appropriate. The FE child care allocation for the current academic year is &pound;8.3 million and FE institutions can also use their bursary funds to supplement their child care fund once the child care fund has been fully committed.</p>

  <p>Following publication in November 2007 of the <em>Report of the Review of Community Penalties</em> work has been taken forward in partnership between the Scottish Government and local authorities to delivery improvements to the immediacy and speed of completion of community service orders.</p>

  <p>Local authority criminal justice social work teams operate against the framework of national standards, which are currently being reviewed. We seek to issue jointly agreed guidance by the end of the year to ensure that offenders do not leave court without being given a copy of their order and reporting instructions and that most work placements commence within seven days of imposition of the order.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) have a Customer Feedback Policy which has been in place for several years.</p>

  <p>This policy currently involves a three stage process. The first stage involves the complaint being handled speedily by a manager in the Procurator Fiscal office or division where the complaint originated. If the complainant is dissatisfied with the terms of the response to their complaint, they can ask the Area Procurator Fiscal or respective Division Head to review their case.</p>

  <p>The Area Procurator Fiscal or Division Head will review the case and provide a further response. If the complainant remains dissatisfied with the terms of this response, they can ask the Crown Agent, Head of COPFS for a further review.</p>

  <p>If the complainant remains dissatisfied then this matter can be taken up with the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman.</p>

  <p>The Ombudsman has a statutory remit which includes the power to investigate alleged maladministration. The Ombudsman has no role in relation to examining how and why legal decisions were taken, but does have a role in examining how COPFS handled a complaint. It is for the Ombudsman to decide whether the complaint has grounds that require to be investigated.</p>

  <p>The full policy can be found on the Crown Office website at:</p>

  <p>The funding of Scotland&rsquo;s colleges is the responsibility of the Scottish Funding Council (SFC). It is for the colleges themselves to determine the learning activity which is offered to students and potential students and which best meets the needs of local communities and businesses.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to encourage further and higher education institutions to offer flexible provision which responds to the needs of the learner while continuing to offer a high quality and relevant learning experience. We recognise that colleges are continuing to work towards becoming more inclusive for all students including those with complex needs.</p>

  <p>Institutions have a statutory duty under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended in 2005) to publish their disability equality schemes. Within many of these published schemes institutions have stated that they are aiming to provide inclusive learning environments and accessible curriculum for disabled students.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that there are additional barriers to accessing further education for people with complex needs which is why we and the SFC commissioned the BRITE Initiative to undertaking a survey of provision for these students in Scotland&rsquo;s colleges. Officials in the Scottish Government and the SFC are currently considering all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations for improving further education opportunities in Scotland for people with complex needs in consultation with all relevant parties including COSLA and Scotland&rsquo;s colleges.</p>

This comprehensive study considered the extent to which any problems identified are addressed by the existing legislation, including Part 6 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 which introduced new protections for park home residents from May 2007. We expect to establish a programme of work soon to address some of the important issues identified.

  <p>Decisions on the recruitment of police officers are matters for the Chief Constable and the Strathclyde Joint Police Board. The Scottish government is investing &pound;94 million to centrally the fund the recruitment of 1,000 extra police officers by 2011 and Strathclyde Police will receive its appropriate share of that funding.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the valuable social role of post offices, particularly in deprived and remote areas of Scotland, and although post offices and postal services are a matter wholly reserved to the UK Government, Scottish ministers therefore continue to play an active role in seeking the best outcomes within the current closure programme.</p>

  <p>Since the announcement of the post office network closure programme last May, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth has maintained an active discussion with Post Office Ltd to ensure that their restructuring programme promotes transparency and open discussion of the issues with key stakeholders. He has also encouraged all MSPs and local authorities to carefully examine Post Office Ltd&rsquo;s proposals to ensure that the interests of the public, particularly vulnerable groups, have been properly taken into account.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary has in addition met Royal Mail Group to promote awareness of potential business opportunities, providing a close fit with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s agenda to streamline and improve public services, as well as encouraging local authorities to consider opportunities to promote services alongside local post offices to aid their viability.</p>

  <p>Good progress has been made. Since May last year the Scottish Government has consented 13 large scale renewable energy projects. We are on course to meet our target of generating 31% of Scottish electricity demand from renewables by 2011.</p>

  <p>This target equates to around 5 GigaWatts of installed capacity. Currently, the capacity of projects operating and with consent is around 5.5 GigaWatts. Most of these consented projects will be operating by 2011, and there is still time for more to be consented and constructed before 2011.</p>

  <p>We are also confident of achieving our target of generating 50% of our electricity from renewables by 2020.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has discussed this report with COSLA as most of the recommendations were addressed to local authorities, or jointly to the Scottish Government and local authorities. We accept the recommendations of the report in full. A joint Scottish Government and COSLA working group, including representation from the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, has been established to consider how the actions recommended in the report should best be taken forward. Discussions regarding future policy, funding and delivery have already commenced, with the intention of publishing a new school estate strategy by spring 2009.</p>
