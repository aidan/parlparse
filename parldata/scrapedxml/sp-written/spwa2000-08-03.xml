  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what surveillance testing, based on serological, virological, microbiological or pathological findings, was conducted by it or other bodies and over what period, in terms of Article 13 of EC Directive 91/67/EEC, which enabled the United Kingdom to maintain that Scotland was free from Infectious Salmon Anaemia.</p>

  <p>Article 13 of Directive 91/67/EEC does not apply to Infectious Salmon Anaemia. However, in order to meet UK and EC legislative requirements, annual fish disease inspection and sampling programmes for all fish farms in Scotland have been carried out since 1993. Use of internationally approved detection and diagnostic methods for Infectious Salmon Anaemia provided no evidence of the disease until 1998.</p>

  <p>There are a number of bodies concerned with the protection of wild fish stocks: that with specific responsibility for wild salmon is the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO). One of the contracting parties to NASCO is the European Union whose delegate from the European Commission is supported by member states. The Scottish Executive is normally represented by the head of the relevant Division in the Rural Affairs Department and by the Inspector of Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries.</p>

  <p>NASCO meets normally once a year. Its next annual general meeting is due to be held in June 2001.</p>

  <p>I have requested specific advice on this issue from the Natural Environment Research Council as part of their advice on management of seal populations for this current year.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a range of individual research projects are currently underway to investigate different aspects of the interactions between seals and fish. These include investigations into seals and salmon on the River Conon and into the feeding habits and movements of seals in Lochs Shieldaig and Torridon in relation to the movements of salmonid fishes. Possible collaborative research between the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St. Andrews and SERAD Fisheries Research Services is under consideration.</p>

  <p>Updating earlier studies, the Scottish Salmon Strategy Task Force estimated that the net economic value of salmon board fisheries in Scotland in 1995 was &pound;350 million, with a range from &pound;270 million to &pound;430 million. Total expenditure by anglers was estimated at an additional &pound;70 million.</p>

  <p>A study commissioned by the Tweed Foundation in 1996 revealed that the Tweed Salmon Fisheries brought &pound;12.5 million a year to the Borders economy. A recent study by the Western Isles Fisheries Trust, in conjunction with Western Isles Enterprise and Western Isles Council, estimates that in 1999 angling contributed &pound;5.6 million to the local economy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently seeking to encourage boards to include greater economic data in their annual reports.</p>

  <p>The District Salmon Fishery Board Order 1999, which came into force on 3 May 1999, amended Schedule 2 of the Salmon Act 1986 governing the composition of District Salmon Fishery Boards. The aim of the 1999 Order was to give boards greater flexibility in determining optimum size and structure. Three Designation Orders (Lochaber, Conon and North and West) have since been made and a fourth application (Western Isles) is currently under consideration.</p>

  <p>Discussions between Salmon Fishery Boards and local Fishery Trusts, on which boards are represented, is a matter for the bodies concerned. However, the Scottish Executive is an active partner in the Scottish Fisheries Co-ordination Centre which brings together Trusts and boards across much of Scotland with the aim of providing a better understanding of the national fishery resources and of encouraging collaboration and co-ordination between them and other organisations with an interest in fishery matters. In addition the Scottish Executive, through the Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory, works closely with Trust and board biologists.</p>

This is one element of the process which it completes when undertaking its environmental impact assessment of a proposed release.

  <p>Our legal advice is that any trace amounts of material derived from the trial crop which might be found in honey and honey products do not require a marketing consent. Under the terms of the relevant Directive, some dispersal of GM material beyond the trial site is envisaged. The safety of that dispersed material is one of the factors given careful consideration by our independent expert advisers before a consent to grow is approved.</p>
