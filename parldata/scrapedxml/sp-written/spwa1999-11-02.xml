  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether under agricultural legislation, the following animal classes are classified as working animals and whether the construction of any housing for them is subject to dimensions for a permitted development: (a) Hunting Horses, (b) Clydesdale Horses, (c) Shire Horses, (d) Shetland Ponies, (e) Highland Ponies, (f) Eriskay Ponies, (g) agricultural animals working on the land or food production, (h) designated rare breeds close to extinction and (i) dogs used on the land for herding and hunting.</p>

  <p>Whilst working animals are not defined in agricultural legislation, the welfare requirements of livestock are protected under a range of legislation, including the Protection of Animals (Scotland) Act 1912. This enables the Scottish Executive to set standards for welfare and where appropriate space standards for individual animals of particular species. There are no statutory housing requirements for the animals which you have listed as working animals.</p>

  <p>Permitted development rights for agricultural buildings are contained in Part 6 of Schedule 1 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992. Part 6 specifies the conditions, including dimensions, for agricultural buildings benefiting from these rights. These conditions are drawn up with reference to likely effects of such a building on amenity and the physical environment, not the welfare needs of animals which may be housed in it.</p>

  <p>Basic information on each individual project grant aided by SNH can be obtained from SNH&#8217;s publication Facts and Figures (a companion publication to its Annual Report) which is laid before Parliament. The level of information requested could, however, only be obtained at disproportionate cost. Projects grant aided by SNH must be consistent with SNH&#8217;s aims and objectives and grant applications are subject to normal grant conditions. These include the setting of specific targets, where appropriate, and their performance monitoring.</p>

  <p>In addition, under section 60(2) of the 1980 Act, as amended, education authorities must establish which children belonging to their area, who are two years of age or over but under school leaving age, have pronounced, specific or complex special educational needs which require continuing review.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when the former Angus NHS Trust first discovered that 14 out of 16 hospital buildings had a high risk of legionella, whether staff and patients who were in areas of high legionella risk were made aware of this and, if not, why not.</p>

  <p>I understand that the former Angus NHS Trust initiated a risk assessment of the effectiveness of legionella control arrangements and received a detailed Audit and Risk Assessment Report in March 1996. The Report indicated there were no management systems in place to oversee and/or monitor the control of legionellosis. As a result, the Trust introduced robust management systems and an external audit system. The Trust&#8217;s management arrangements were subject to audit by The Health &amp; Safety Executive in March/April 1998 who were satisfied with the result.</p>

  <p>The risk assessment focused on management arrangements for overseeing and/or controlling legionellosis. Expert assessment concluded that operational management of the risk did not require the closure of any premises to which patients had access and therefore information was not generally made available to staff and patients.</p>

  <p>I understand there have been no instances of legionella in premises of the former Angus NHS Trust area.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to establish a national young offenders strategy. However, the Executive has signalled the importance it attaches to addressing the behaviour of young offenders in supporting a number of innovative projects to identify what works in tackling persistent offending and preventing future offending. Young offenders have been identified as a priority group within the National Planning Statement for Criminal Justice Social Work Services for the period 1999-2002 and in July this year new funding bids worth a total of &pound;183,000 from local authorities were approved.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service is reviewing its policy for the management of young offenders and hopes to consult on its proposals around the turn of the year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what is the length of time it takes to process a traffic regulation order to change the speed limit on A, B and C roads and what plans it has to reduce this period.</p>

  <p>The procedure for making traffic orders by local authorities relating to local roads, regardless of classification, is prescribed in The Local Authorities&#8217; Traffic Orders (Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 1999. The procedure for making traffic orders relating to trunk roads is prescribed in The Secretary of State&#8217;s Traffic Orders (Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 1987.</p>

  <p>The 1999 Regulations introduced a requirement for local authorities to complete the traffic order process within two years from the date on which the notice of proposals is first published. There is no corresponding requirement in the 1987 Regulations. There are no plans to amend either set of Regulations.</p>

  <p>Information is not available centrally on the time taken to process local authority traffic orders. Speed limit orders in respect of trunk roads are normally completed within 22 weeks. In both cases, the procedures are designed to ensure that the interests of all those likely to be affected by the proposals are properly taken into account. The period required to complete the procedure depends on the complexity of the proposals and the number of representations received.</p>
