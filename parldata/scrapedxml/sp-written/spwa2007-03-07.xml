  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many recipients of council tax benefit aged 60 or over there were in the Stirling local authority area in each of the last three years for which the information is available, also showing what percentage of the over-60 age group they represented.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-03-07.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80077" speakername="Mr Tom McCabe" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0307.htm#2">

  <p>The data relating to recipients of council tax benefit are presented in terms of benefit units, which are based on households in receipt of council tax benefit and as a result may contain two or more persons (possibly one of whom may also be aged under 60). These data are reported in the following table.</p>

  <p>Number of Benefit Units Containing One or More Persons Aged Over 60 Receiving Council Tax Benefit**</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td valign="middle"> Local Authority</td>
<td align="center" valign="top"> 2004</td>
<td align="center" valign="top"> 2005</td>
<td align="center" valign="top"> 2006</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"> Stirling</td>

<td align="right" valign="top"> 3,490</td>
<td align="right" valign="top"> 3,570</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>Note: **The data have been provided by the Department of Work and Pensions and relate to benefit units, not counts of persons. Figures include benefit units where there is a single person aged over 60, and benefit units containing two or more persons where at least one is aged over 60. Council tax benefit figures exclude any second adult rebate cases. The source is the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit Management Information System quarterly caseload.</p>

  <p>It is not appropriate to divide council tax benefit units by population figures for the over 60-age group, as these are on a different basis.</p>

  <p>Resources for the Sure Start Scotland programme are distributed through grant aided expenditure (GAE).

  <p>The estimates are based on a sample survey, and as such, are subject to some sampling error. Any changes in the estimates over time may not be statistically significant when sampling error is taken into account.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce the launch tomorrow of the final version of Scottish Historical Environmental Policy 1 &ndash; <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Historic Environment</em> - (SHEP 1) following public consultation. The series sets out what we believe are ambitious and robust policies to protect Scotland&rsquo;s rich historic environment. I am pleased by the backing the stakeholders have given me.

  <p>(a) NICE Technology Appraisal No. 32 entitled Beta interferons and glatiramer acetate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis published by NICE in February 2002.

  <p>Important sites across Scotland are run by a variety of public, private, and charitable organisations and help to make this country a great place to visit. Attractions such as Stirling Castle, which are run by Historic Scotland, attract many visitors, and lead them to a greater understanding of our rich heritage.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland holds information on sites in four categories of statutory and non-statutory designations for historic monuments, buildings and sites which fall within these designations. These are as follows:</p>

  <p>Listed buildings: there are almost 47,000 listed buildings of special architectural or historic interest given legal protection under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997. Eight percent of these are recognised for their national or international importance, 51% for their regional interest, and 41% for their local interest.</p>

  <p>Scheduled monuments: there are just under 8,000 scheduled sites in Scotland designated as ancient monuments of national importance and given legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.</p>

  <p>Designated Wreck Sites are nationally important wrecks; their locations are designated as protected areas under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 and the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. There are eight wrecks designated under Protection of Wrecks Act and seven scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act.</p>

  <p>Non-Statutory Designation &ndash; 342 Gardens and Designed Landscapes of national importance are identified in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland sponsored by Historic Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage.</p>

  <p>No. Guidance on use of discount rates is set out in HM Treasury's <em>Guidance on Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government</em> , known as <em>The Green Book</em> . At the time the Skye Bridge was being planned, <em>The Green Book</em> recommended the use of a discount rate of 6%.</p>

  <p>Orkney Islands Council and local MSP, Mr Jim Wallace QC, have made a number of representations to the Executive on matters connected with the local government funding settlement. Representations may also have been received from others from time to time. A full list of all such representations, and by whom they were made, is not maintained centrally.</p>

  <p>Mr Wallace and, from the Council, Councillor Stephen Hagan, Councillor Keith Johnson and Mr Harry Garland, the Director of Community Social Services, have made several recent representations about specific aspects of the settlement, in particular care services for the elderly.</p>

  <p>There have also been two recent meetings with representatives from the council and Mr Wallace to discuss a range of issues, including: elements of the settlement and the delivery of services for the elderly. The first of these meetings took place on 20 December 2006 with the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care and then there was a subsequent meeting with the Deputy Minister for Finance, Public Service Reform and Parliamentary Business on the 2 February 2007.</p>

  <p>The information requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. The only way in which the information sought could be established would be to trawl all of the divisions identified on the social inclusion and voluntary issues database and ask them to identify for each of the last four years which of their entries are specifically in respect of religious or faith groups. However, this database contains only general information and it is not possible to extract specific details of grants paid to faith and religious groups. This would take considerable time and effort and result in work that would cost well in excess of the disproportionate cost threshold of &pound;600.</p>

  <p>In collaboration with analytical services division, social inclusion and voluntary issues division is working on how to improve its database information collection procedures, with a view to better identification and recording of specific grant recipients and the purpose to which public funds are being put. Unfortunately, it will be some time before data collection and recording arrangements are able to isolate information of the type sought.</p>
