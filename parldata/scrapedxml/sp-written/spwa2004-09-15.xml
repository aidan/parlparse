  <p>Treatment for cancer can take place in either an out-patient or in-patient setting. Information is not held centrally on waiting times for treatment which starts in an out-patient setting &ndash; for example, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p>

  <p>Information on the time between a patient being placed on the in-patient and day case waiting list and their admission to hospital is collected centrally. However, this dataset would not provide an accurate picture of the longest waiting times for patients placed on the waiting list with a diagnosis of cancer, because it will include patients who were admitted for treatment for conditions other than cancer and whose cancer was discovered in the course of that admission.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently running the Scottish Crime and Victimisation Survey (SCVS), which is being carried out by computer assisted telephone interviewing. It was launched in June 2004 and will run continuously until March 2007. The SCVS was developed in response to a fundamental review of the Scottish Crime Survey, which was held every three to four years, to improve the reliability and usefulness of the data obtained. It asks questions about experiences and perceptions of crime to understand the true extent and nature of crime in Scotland. BMRB Social Research were awarded the contract for this work via competitive tender. Results of the survey will be published annually, with first results for interviews conducted in 2004-05 available in October 2005.</p>

  <p>The recently published <em>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland </em> (FEDS) and the <em>Background Analysis</em> to FEDS set out in detail the Executive&rsquo;s strategic approach and priorities for raising economic growth through increasing productivity and competitiveness.</p>

  <p>Specific steps to improve Scottish competitiveness include, among other things, the Efficient Government initiative, the consultation on the Green Jobs strategy, the Fresh Talent initiative and the consultations on the reform of the planning system and third-party right of appeal.</p>

  <p>(b) Gross Domestic Product is not available for Scotland on this basis. However, an approximation can be calculated by applying Scotland&rsquo;s ratio of UK GVA (Gross Value Added) per head to the figures published by WHO. This gives the following.</p>

  <p>The enterprise networks are working with individual projects to raise awareness of new funding sources. To date, 20 projects advise they have secured some level of funding beyond 2005. Many others are currently involved in discussions with potential funders. This activity is led by the projects themselves - it is not the role of the Advisory Management Group to recommend individual projects for continued funding. More detailed information on funding at project level is an operational matter for the enterprise networks.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the Wild Game Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995 enact in the UK, with regard to the export trade, EU Directive 92/45/EEC which sets out requirements relating to the killing of wild game and the placing on the market of wild game meat.</p>

  <p>Game processing premises must be licensed under these regulations before they can export wild game meat to other EU member states or to third countries.</p>

  <p>Suitably licensed wild game processors can then compete in export markets and gain income from EU member states and third countries. They may also supply wild game meat to the UK domestic market if they wish.</p>

  <p>In Scotland there are currently 15 licensed wild game plants that can export meat to member states and third countries.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that game processors currently exporting wild game meat to other EU member states, or to third countries, must be licensed under the Wild Game Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995. If game processors currently only produce wild game meat for the domestic market then they are subject to local authority supervision under the Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) Regulations 1995.</p>

  <p>On 1 January 2006, these regulations will be revoked, and replaced by horizontal food hygiene legislation. These new rules, which aim to consolidate and simplify existing food hygiene legislation, will apply across the EU. All game processors involved in wholesaling operations will then be subject to the same requirements, regardless of the market that they are supplying.</p>

  <p>Certain exemptions are made from the new legislation whereby member states are required to set national rules to cover the direct supply, by the producer of small quantities of wild game and wild game meat to the final consumer or to local retail establishments directly supplying the final consumer. These exemptions are made in recognition of the close relationships that can exist between producers and consumers. The EU legislation requires that national rules must be in place in relation to these exemptions to achieve the objectives of the EU regulations, and the FSA intends that the hygiene provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 will apply.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that there is currently no requirement for traceability in the hygiene legislation for the wild game sector, although game dealers must be licensed under the Game Acts and maintain certain records in accordance with the Deer Acts. However, new legislation to implement the EU General Food Law Regulation (EC 178/2002) that will apply from 1 January 2005 will require all food businesses, regardless of size, to implement traceability systems. Food businesses will be required to keep records of their suppliers and businesses they supply to, and make such records available to the competent authorities on demand. This legislation will apply to food businesses involved in the supply of wild game.</p>

  <p>Whilst not yet a legal requirement under hygiene legislation, many wild game processors currently have traceability systems in place that apply from the time that an animal is shot.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland&rsquo;s housing investment programme makes a significant contribution to restructuring the housing supply, as part of regeneration strategies. In 2004-05, we will invest over &pound;540 million in housing and regeneration. Housing investment will total &pound;284 million which will help to build or improve 5,350 homes and which is expected to generate nearly &pound;130 million of investment from the private sector. Local authorities have also prepared local housing strategies which set out how they will work with other agencies to address their housing needs and to ensure that the supply and quality of housing meets local requirements over the next five years.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the duties which the prosecution service owes to victims and witnesses, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has established a dedicated victim service &ndash; Victim Information and Advice (VIA) which will be rolled out across the whole of Scotland by the end of 2005. One of the aims of VIA is to keep victims and bereaved next of kin informed about the progress of the case that affects them. VIA officers provide information pro-actively in cases which fall within its referral categories.</p>

  <p>If the case is to be adjourned due to the ill health of the accused, it may not always be possible to provide specific information about the nature of the illness affecting the accused, but victims will be alerted to any proposed adjournment and provided with information about when the case will next call at court.</p>

  <p>Scottish domiciled students undertaking a full-time degree course in nursing, midwifery or one of the Allied Health Professions at a University in Wales or Northern Ireland can apply to the relevant funding body in those countries for support with tuition fee and living costs through the Department of Health Bursary Scheme. Welsh or Northern Irish students undertaking such courses in Scotland apply through the Student Awards Agency for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Students from any of the UK home nations are eligible to apply for assistance from the discretionary funds administered by universities in each country (Access to Learning Funds in England and Wales, Support Funds in Northern Ireland and Hardship Funds in Scotland).</p>

  <p>Victim Information and Advice (VIA) is part of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. The Director of VIA reports directly to the Crown Agent. As is the case of other divisions of the department VIA&rsquo;s performance is monitored by the senior management of the department.</p>
