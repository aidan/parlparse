  <p>Scottish Development International (SDI), the Executive&rsquo;s joint operation with Scottish Enterprise, leads on attracting inward investment and other international business to Scotland. SDI works with industry specialists in Scotland and uses its overseas sales force to uncover project opportunities and make proposals to target companies around the world. SDI is currently assessing the potential for biofuels investment. This will involve developing a better understanding of exactly what expertise and resources Scotland has to offer and what types of project would provide the maximum benefits to Scotland.</p>

  <p>The National Reference Group on Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse, which has been created to help implement the strategy for Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse, is made up of survivors, representatives from survivor agencies, a range of health and social care professionals working in this field, and officials from across the Scottish Executive. There are 27 members on the group, four of whom participate as survivors. The group first met on 6 September 2005 and is in the early stages of developing a working plan spanning 18 months to two years. The remit was drafted at this first meeting and will be finalised at the next one.</p>

  <p>The Schools (Safety and Supervision of Pupils) (Scotland) Regulations 1990 place a duty upon every education authority to take reasonable care for the safety of pupils when under their charge, and without prejudice to such supervision as is required to comply with that duty in any circumstance also require authorities to ensure adult supervision in a playground at break times, at all of their special schools and all primary schools with a roll of 50 or more pupils.</p>

  <p>A range of measures to help release land for affordable housing, including that for the Homestake scheme, is set out in the Executive&rsquo;s housing policy statement <em>Homes for Scotland&rsquo;s People</em> published in March this year. A copy is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 35778).</p>

  <p>Scottish Planning Policy 3 (SPP 3) requires planning authorities to take a long-term view of where needs for housing can best be met and provide in full the housing land requirement for each housing market area. In addition, Planning Advice Note 74 on Affordable Housing established a benchmark figure of 25% of all new housing developments to be affordable homes where justified by a housing needs assessment.</p>

  <p>Measures are also in place to release publicly owned land for affordable housing. Scottish Executive land that is deemed surplus to requirements is notified internally to Executive Departments. Communities Scotland is notified through this process, and given the opportunity to register an interest in the land on behalf of Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) who may wish to purchase the land for affordable housing. In addition, an agreement is in place with Forestry Commission Scotland who, in handling sales of surplus land, now provide a preferential opportunity for RSLs to acquire the land for affordable housing. We have also announced a willingness to release land for affordable housing from the Scottish ministers&rsquo; estate, almost all of which is crofting land.</p>

  <p>Information on purchases by first-time buyers is available from the Survey of Mortgage Lenders. The information requested is given for Scotland as a whole but not for each local authority area within Scotland (due to the nature of the sample used). The data can be found in the live tables published on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) website at <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.odpm.gov.uk</a> (Home &gt; Housing &gt; Housing statistics &gt; Housing statistics by topic &gt; Housing market and house prices, Table 503).</p>

  <p>The Survey of Mortgage Lenders is a monthly survey carried out by the ODPM in partnership with the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which collects house price information from about 50 mortgage lenders for properties that reached completion during the month and for which they provided the mortgage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not define what constitutes a &quot;modest&quot; income at a national level, as this varies across regions, cities, towns, villages and wider rural areas. The Scottish Executive offers a broad definition of affordable housing as &quot;housing of a reasonable quality which is available to people on modest incomes&quot;, in recognition of the fact that average incomes and housing costs vary widely across Scotland. It is for each local authority to establish the requirement for affordable housing need within their area through their local housing strategy.</p>

  <p>Following extensive discussions, the Scottish Law Commission (SLC) has agreed to review and report to ministers on the law of prescription in relation to personal injury claims. The SLC will conduct that review in parallel with its existing review of limitation, and the intention is that the discussion paper and final report to be produced by that review will now cover both subjects.</p>

  <p>The SLC had been aiming to publish a discussion paper on limitation by the end of this year for public consultation, and to report to ministers with recommendations by the end of 2006. In view of the extra work that will be required to carry out the additional review there may need to be some adjustment to that timescale, although the SLC has said that it will do all it can to minimise any delay. I am continuing to keep in touch with the SLC on this point.</p>

  <p>The data are supplied to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) by the electricity generating companies including autogenerators (those companies that consume the electricity that they themselves generate). Hydro pumped storage schemes are not included as renewable sources of electricity because it is non-renewable energy that is used to pump the water. Fluctuations in hydro output reflect in particular, the amount and distribution of rainfall and snow in Scotland across individual years. The amount of electricity generated is the total amount before taking account of any transmission losses or own use of electricity by the electricity generators.</p>
