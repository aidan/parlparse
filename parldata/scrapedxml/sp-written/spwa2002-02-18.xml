  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will seek payment of agrimonetary compensation for the sheep sector; whether it will make representations to Her Majesty's Government that such compensation should be made available, and how much agrimonetary compensation is estimated to be available on application by Her Majesty's Government.</p>

  <p>The European Commission have yet to confirm whether there is any agrimonetary compensation available to the sheep sector. Although this aid relates to the second and third stages of compensation paid last year, the EU agrimonetary rules provide for these later payments to be reduced or cancelled if the market prices and exchange rates have since moved in a direction which ameliorates the situation which led to the initial compensation. We will not know for some months what the commission assessment will be. When we do find out how much, if any, agrimonetary aid is available we will carefully consider the case for payment and make the appropriate representations to Her Majesty's Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive meets BAA on a regular basis to discuss a range of aviation matters including passenger numbers and air links serving Scotland. The Executive, in partnership with the Enterprise Networks, VisitScotland and the airport operators, will continue to encourage the development of more commercial and cost effective air services from Scotland for the benefit of the travelling public and the Scottish economy.</p>

  <p>The last meeting with local authority representatives to discuss this subject took place in September 2000. Policy in relation to problems caused by gulls is clear and well-established.</p>

  <p>Where a threat to public health or public safety exists, local authorities already have discretionary powers (under general licence SEGEN/10) to control herring gulls and greater and lesser black-backed gulls. In addition, action can be taken by local authorities to limit the availability of food in urban areas and to reduce the attractiveness of potential nesting and roosting sites.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive officials kept in close touch with the company throughout the recent industrial dispute on the Clyde with the objective of ensuring that adequate lifeline ferry services were maintained. We also funded connecting bus services to help foot passengers use the sailings that the company continued to provide to Arran and Bute.</p>

  <p>We also encouraged continued dialogue between the company and the union concerned to try to resolve the dispute as soon as possible, while recognising that responsibility for resolving disputes with staff lay with the board and management of Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. We have made clear our view that the company and trade unions should work together to seek ways in which this type of disruption can be avoided in future.</p>

  <p>Work placements for those sentenced to community service orders are designed to present a challenge to the offender and to enable the offender to make reparation to the community for the offence. Work undertaken can range from physically demanding outdoor environmental projects such as building countryside walkways or removing graffiti to placements providing assistance to the elderly or disabled. Selection of work placements for those subject to community service orders are governed by the National Objectives and Standards for Social Work Services in the Criminal Justice system. Whether it involves litter collection is a matter for the local authority to determine. In exercising their discretion in providing a range of placements local authorities are required to ensure that others are not deprived of paid employment.</p>

  <p>Implementation of the Scottish Law Commission&#146;s recommendations would not lead to any significant difference in the number of children dealt with by the children&#146;s hearings system. The recommendations would prevent prosecution of children aged eight to 11 inclusive in the criminal courts, but the Commission&#146;s report showed that there were only 11 such prosecutions between 1994 and 1999. There are no recommendations in the report to change the disposals available to the courts in dealing with offenders or the measures available to the children&#146;s hearings to deal with children referred on offence grounds.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Minister for Transport will attend a public meeting in Badenoch and Strathspey in order to explain why BEAR Scotland Ltd was appointed to be responsible for trunk road maintenance; whether it is satisfied with the performance of BEAR Scotland Ltd to date; what action it has taken to ensure that BEAR Scotland Ltd fulfils its contractual obligations, and whether the division of responsibility for trunk roads and non-trunk roads between BEAR Scotland Ltd and the relevant local authority is effective.</p>

  <p>Scottish minister were obliged to follow EU procurement rules in appointing trunk road maintenance operator, and to avoid contracts on the basis of the most economically advantageous tenders, subject to bidders being able to demonstrate a proven track record in road management and maintenance.</p>

  <p>BEAR Scotland Ltd was appointed trunk road operating company for the North East and North West Units following the tender competition where BEAR was assessed as submitting the most economically advantageous tenders for both Units. Prior to tender invitation the companies who make up BEAR Scotland Ltd were able to demonstrate that they have a proven track record of providing road management and maintenance services, including winter maintenance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive employs the Performance Audit Group (PAG) to audit and monitor the activities and performance of BEAR to ensure the standards required by the trunk road contract are achieved. To date there is no evidence to suggest that the level of service has dropped since BEAR took over the contract. The current trunk road maintenance contracts specify the same level of service as in previous years.</p>

  <p>The level of service provided on non-trunk roads is a matter for the relevant local authorities. I have received no invitation to attend a public meeting as described, nor do I have any plans to do so.</p>

  <p>The A701 trunk road runs from Dumfries to its junction with the A74(M). The A701 from the A74(M) junction to Moffat is a local road network.</p>

  <p>Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, responsibility for litter clearance from the A701 trunk road rests with the local council through whose area the trunk road passes, namely Dumfries and Galloway Council. However, the trunk road maintenance contracts contain a provision which requires the Operating Company to liaise with the local council to ensure that the council&#146;s policies meet with the requirements of the relevant sections of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 with respect to trunk roads.</p>
