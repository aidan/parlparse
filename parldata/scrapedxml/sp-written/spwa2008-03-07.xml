  <p>Information on current locally managed programmes is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>A new NHS &quot;HEAT&quot; target has been set by which NHS boards will be expected to deliver Scottish Government approved healthy weight intervention programmes to a specified proportion of children aged 7 to 13 years defined as overweight (includes obese) over the period 2008-11. NHS Health Scotland is currently drawing up guidance for health boards on the core requirements from these intervention programmes. This guidance and funding contributing to the delivery of these programmes will be made available to health boards at the start of the new financial year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government are currently delivering a wide range of initiatives contributing to children achieving and maintaining a healthy weight through the Scottish Diet Action Plan and our national Physical Activity Strategy. These are supported by the on-going implementation of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) Act.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-9255 on 19 February 2008. Health care professionals were informed about the advice from the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in the February 2008 edition of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Drug Safety Update bulletin. This information can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition, product information for rosiglitazone has been updated to include the new advice. Medicines should be prescribed by clinicians taking account of the approved advice provided in the Summary of Product Characteristics which provides full information about the product, including its side effects and its use.</p>

  <p>NHS boards can reinforce this advice through a variety of methods. These may include articles in prescribing newsletters and information included in local formularies.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that, after consultation with and the agreement of the Lord Advocate, I am instigating a review of the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976.</p>

  <p>The review will have the following remit:</p>

  <p>&quot;To review the operation of the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiries (Scotland) Act 1976, which governs the system of judicial investigation of sudden or unexpected deaths in Scotland, so as to ensure that Scotland has an effective and practical system of public inquiry into deaths which is fit for the 21st century.&quot;</p>

  <p>Ministers are delighted that Lord Cullen of Whitekirk has agreed to lead the review and the intention is that it will begin once detailed arrangements for support for Lord Cullen have been resolved. It is hoped that it will be possible to conclude the review in or around one year from finalisation of these detailed arrangements.</p>

  <p>A Protocol for Liaison on Work Related Deaths between the Health and Safety Executive, Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the British Transport Police and Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service was published in October 2006. It emphasises the need for a collaborative approach to the investigation of work-related deaths in Scotland, in order to ensure on-going high-standards of public safety and to assist in any possible prosecution.</p>

  <p>It is not the case that all work related deaths are treated as potential homicides. Rather, all work related deaths are treated as potential criminal offences. The protocol formalises the arrangements for the initial investigation of all work related deaths, allowing the Procurator Fiscal to decide whether a serious criminal offence, other than a health and safety offence, may have been committed and parties to agree whether the police, the HSE, or other enforcing authority should assume primacy for the investigation.</p>

  <p>The protocol is kept constantly under review. The operation of the protocol is considered by representatives from all signatories at an annual National Liaison Committee meeting and quarterly by a Joint Working Group.</p>

  <p>The issue of charging for non-personal domiciliary services is addressed in legislation. Under section 87 (1A) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 a local authority may charge for certain adult non-residential and domiciliary services it provides. It is for local authorities to decide their charging policies for these non-personal care services, in keeping with local accountability. However, the legislation requires that any charges levied must be reasonable and should not be more than appears to be reasonably practicable for the recipient to pay, taking account of his or her other financial commitments. Guidance issued by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in January 2006 recommends a consistent framework for charging and encourages councils to demonstrate that they are following best practice.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland&rsquo;s Fair For All programme aims to ensure that everyone in Scotland has access to the right health services: local services that are patient-focused and flexible. The <em>Better Health, Better Care Action Plan</em> consolidates this approach. Both are underpinned by legislation requiring us to monitor all policies for their impact on people of different racial groups.</p>

  <p>The National Resource Centre for Ethnic Minority Health (NRCEMH) leads on implementing the Fair For All programme in respect of Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) groups. We are funding NRCEMH&rsquo;s Race Equality and BME Communities in Scotland programme for 2008-11, which will work with partners to transform the design and delivery of mental health services for BME groups.</p>

  <p>As part of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s Anti-Stigma Partnership work, the national anti-stigma campaign See me published Mosaics of Meaning last year, which addressed stigma and discrimination surrounding mental ill-health in Glasgow&rsquo;s BME communities. See me are now working with community groups in Glasgow &ndash; including faith leaders &ndash; and partners such as NRCEMH, to raise awareness of mental health issues and to counter the stigma which can be associated with mental ill-health.</p>

  <p>We are currently consulting on the future of mental health improvement. The discussion paper <em>Towards a Mentally Flourishing Scotland</em> sets out proposed actions for discussion on what local authorities, health boards and other key stakeholders can do to support this agenda, with a particular focus on tackling inequalities: target groups could include people who may not be reached by traditional health care or health improvement approaches. The following organisations have been consulted as part of this process: Council of Ethnic Minority Voluntary Organisations; Black and Ethnic Minority Infrastructure in Scotland; National Resource for Ethnic Minority Health; Saheliya, and the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations &ndash; Race Equality Development Unit. The consultation will inform a mental health improvement action plan.</p>

  <p>While we do not gather this particular information centrally we are investing significant attention on child and adolescent mental health services and training toward improved performance, care and better outcomes for those in need.</p>

  <p>Our focus with partners includes investment in training for those new to child and adolescent mental health; a Leadership pilot initiative; &pound;100,000 of new investment each year over five years in psychotherapy training, which will cover attention on the important Family Therapy dimension, and we are supporting a Child and Adolescent Cognitive Behaviour Therapy training course.</p>

  <p>Combined with other on-going attention these initiatives are designed to equip clinicians and other staff better in the identification, treatment and recovery of young people with mental health problems.</p>

  <p>Our on-going visits and meetings with local partners includes attention on progress with developing improved child and adolescent mental health community services in order to implement our Framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care. Our recent focus has been on the infrastructure needed to support transitions of young people from hospital back to the community and importantly to prevent inappropriate admissions. The aim is to treat young people at home wherever possible.</p>

  <p>We continue to support all partners in providing services through change processes; addressing service standards; training, and by encouraging workforce and strategic planning.</p>

  <p>I understand from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform that an Appropriate Assessment was not undertaken for Block 17/7 before it was licensed in December 2005. The work programme for Block 17/7 was only to purchase existing seismic survey data.

  <p>The Department of Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform announced on 25 February 2008 that they are currently withholding all other blocks, including 17/3 in the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation from the 25th Offshore Licensing Round.</p>

  <p>The 2004 spending review covered the period 2005-08. During this period local authorities received the Supporting People allocations detailed below.</p>

  <p>The &quot;Pipeline&quot; funding referred to in the table was revenue funding for new capital projects originally scheduled for completion in 2003-04 where the completion date slipped so funding was rolled forward and added to the Supporting People grant allocations previously announced.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has allowed councils to carry forward any unspent Supporting People grant since 2003-04. Councils can also transfer any under spent Supporting People grant into 2008-09.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-5588 by Michael Russell on 31 October 2007, whether members of the public or MSPs can access the noise maps referred to and, if so, how this may be done.</p>

  <p>Yes. One of the requirements of the EC Environmental Noise Directive is that all noise maps produced must be made available to the public. The maps together with other related information can be found at <a href="http://www.scottishnoisemapping.org" target="_blank">www.scottishnoisemapping.org</a> .</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what further consideration it has given to extending the exemption from water charges for churches and other voluntary organisations beyond 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is consulting on the future of the small organisation water charges exemption scheme as part of its consultation on the wider Principles of Charging for 2010-14. This closes on 29 February 2008.</p>

  <p>We will consider in light of all responses to that consultation what future form if any the exemption scheme will take.</p>
