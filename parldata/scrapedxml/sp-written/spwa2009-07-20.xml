  <p>There are a number of barriers to be faced in tackling occupational segregation within the modern apprenticeship programme and a joint approach is needed to address this complex matter.</p>

  <p>The occupational segregation issue is not solely linked to modern apprenticeships. Labour market statistics demonstrate this is a wider issue.

  <p>Skills Development Scotland (SDS) will undertake an equality impact assessment on the modern apprenticeship programme in the coming year. Early discussions between SDS and the Equality and Human Rights Commission have indicated a willingness to work together on the focus of the occupational segregation aspect of the equality impact assessment.</p>

  <p>We recognise that there are barriers to overcome to balance gender participation in the modern apprenticeship programme. We also recognise that there is work to be done in changing industry perceptions and encouraging employers to recruit a diverse workforce. However, as the report found, this position is not simply as a result of the opportunities available to individuals. It is heavily influenced by peer pressure and parental expectation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to ensure adequate provision for child protection in each local authority area.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-07-20.S3W-25243.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80289" speakername="Keith Brown" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0720.htm#6">

  <p>The Scottish Government seeks to support local authorities in protecting children by overseeing that the system for protecting children in Scotland &ndash; its structures and its legislative and scrutiny regime &ndash; support local delivery of services which produce better outcomes for children at risk of neglect or abuse. The robust child protection inspection regime evaluates the provision of services in each local authority, and enables improvements.</p>

  <p>The <em>Early Years and Early Intervention Framework</em>, published in December 2008, and the Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) programme, provides the overall strategy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is taking vigorous action on several fronts:</p>

  <p>A review of the 1998 national child protection guidance, in line with GIRFEC, is being taken forward in close collaboration with multi-agency child protection committees and other stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Work is underway with the child protection practitioner community, through one of the workstreams of the 1998 review group, to ensure the GIRFEC risk assessment approach can be robustly and confidently used to support improved recognition of risks to vulnerable children and improved response to meeting their needs</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) are near the end of the first round of inspections of services to protect children in each local authority area in Scotland. As well as identifying excellent practice and enabling this to be shared, inspection has brought to light some areas where urgent action has been needed to improve child protection service provision. This has led to significant improvements, notably in Midlothian and more recently Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government instructed HMIE in March 2009 to commence planning to conduct a second round of more targeted child protection inspections, which will build on the findings of the first round, and help embed self-evaluation and continuous improvement through a more proportionate inspection model.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government facilitates quarterly national meetings of child protection committee chairs, allowing areas to come together to discuss priorities for child protection and share good practice.</p>

  <p>We have also established a multi-agency resource service (MARS), to advise and support partners in the handling of complex child protection cases.</p>

  <p>We are pressing ahead with the implementation of an efficient vetting and barring scheme to exclude from the relevant workforce those who would harm vulnerable groups.</p>

  <p><em>The Road to Recovery</em>, the national drugs strategy was launched last May, supported by <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol: A Framework for Action</em>. These outline the work being taken forward to support children affected by parental substance misuse.</p>

  <p>Scottish social work statistics published on 24 June show social work staffing levels have improved in recent years. Social workers vacancies, which stood at nearly 13% in 2003, are down to 7%. Numbers of local authority children&rsquo;s services staff stand at 7,398 (Whole-time Equivalent in 2008), up 4% from 2006. The full statistics are published at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/06/23092957/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/06/23092957/0</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government produces a quarterly update reporting detailed progress on SG projects and programmes which are relevant to protecting vulnerable children. The latest update is lodged with the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib. number 48575).</p>

  <p>The qualifications will be awarded on the basis of a portfolio of learner&rsquo;s work, collected across a number of curriculum areas and a range of contexts of learning, life and work. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and its partners will be working on the details of the new qualifications prior to their implementation from 2012-13.

  <p>The Scottish Government has been seeking to facilitate effective implementation of the Future Jobs Fund, to ensure that its potential is maximised in Scotland. This has involved arranging a workshop for local areas in conjunction with DWP colleagues, as well as creating a web link to allow potential bidders to share information about their proposals. There is also a Scottish steering group for the fund, involving the Scottish Government, Scotland Office and Jobcentre Plus, who are currently involved in the assessment of Scottish bids.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency&rsquo;s (SEPA&rsquo;s) Compliance Assessment Scheme (CAS) improves on the Operator Performance Assessment (OPA) scheme in a number of ways. While OPA only applies to a limited number of industrial sites, CAS will cover all regulatory regimes for which SEPA is responsible. CAS is based on continual assessment of a permit holder&rsquo;s performance, rather than the single snapshot approach under OPA. CAS is also designed to assess the operation of facilities more precisely by looking at both environmental performance and environmental management. In addition, CAS will enable SEPA to link the level of fees paid by an operator directly to performance, rewarding good performance and penalising poor performance.</p>

  <p>If a land manager does not restore such features voluntarily then the only option available at present is prosecution and, if the land manager is found guilty, for the courts to impose a restoration order. This can be a lengthy and uncertain process involving significant effort on the parts of the state prosecution service, the accused and their defence. It is also highly adversarial and likely to affect SNH&rsquo;s future working relationship with land managers in delivering the conservation of the natural features of SSSIs.</p>

  <p>If the proposal is progressed and receives parliamentary approval, the facility of issuing a restoration notice would be an intermediate enforcement option which could, in many cases, be a more appropriate means of securing the restoration of illegally damaged natural features when voluntary restoration was not forthcoming.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether implementation of the proposals on page 72 of its <em>Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill Consultation Document </em> would result in prosecution for intentionally or recklessly damaging a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) only where the person or persons committing the damage had not previously complied with the terms of a restoration notice issued by ministers.</p>

  <p>Should this proposal be progressed and receive Parliamentary approval, it is anticipated that procurators fiscal would still be able to bring prosecutions under section 19 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 without a restoration notice being issued beforehand, depending on the circumstances of each case. In addition, if a third party was responsible for the damage of a Site of Special Scientific Interest then, unless they were in a position to carry out restoration works, prosecution for intentional or reckless damage to the protected natural features would remain the only option available.</p>

  <p>Failure to comply with such a restoration notice would be a criminal offence for which the relevant person or persons could be prosecuted. In that scenario, it would be a matter for the procurator fiscal to decide whether to also prosecute for intentional or reckless damage of the SSSI&rsquo;s features, and it should be noted that a successful prosecution for this could result in the court issuing a Restoration Order under Section 40 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004.</p>

  <p>Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as amended by the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 now provides the full range of protection to all wild birds as is given by Areas of Special Protection (ASP) with the exception that an ASP Order can also restrict public access to an area. The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 established a right of responsible access to land and inland water throughout Scotland with certain limited exceptions. Scottish Natural Heritage is aware of no instances where public access is a cause for concern on Areas of Special Protection. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code gives additional advice on how to avoid damaging protected sites and disturbing wildlife. Damage would, in many cases, be a criminal offence and be dealt with under relevant legislation.</p>

  <p>NHS Ayrshire and Arran currently reports an improvement in their vacancy level with candidates appointed to five posts. NHS Highland and NHS Lanarkshire indicate that locum cover is in place with an active recruitment programme running to fill these posts on a substantive basis. NHS Lanarkshire also indicates that of the vacancies listed, one of these is a new post created to support the expansion of their eating disorder service.</p>

  <p>In response to feedback from NHS boards regarding shortages of staff in key medical specialties, the Scottish Government Health Workforce Directorate is supporting a new national programme to coordinate and manage international medical recruitment on behalf of NHSScotland. The overall objective is to facilitate a coordinated, NHSScotland branded international recruitment programme. This scheme will be based within, and administered, by NHS Lanarkshire. It will run for an 18-month period and will look to generate a pool of eligible candidates in required medical specialties which boards can recruit to current vacancies.</p>

The older adult psychiatry North Highland post has been created by innovative service redesign with the inclusion of additional sessions to incorporate one whole time equivalent post to make it more desirable to prospective candidates.

NHS Highland also indicate that they have potential candidates for both posts who will be in a position to apply for these consultant posts after August 2009, one completing their certificate of completion of training (CCT) and one going through the process to be included on the Specialist Register through the Article 14 route.

  <p>No formal guidance has been issued. Under the Schools General (Scotland) Regulations 1975, schools are required to be open for a minimum of 190 days per year. If there are exceptional circumstances which, in authorities&rsquo; consideration, make it unreasonable that the regulations should apply, they may seek ministers&rsquo; agreement, under the terms of Section 133(4) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 to a disapplication.</p>

  <p>In each case, the individual circumstances are carefully considered. Concerns which may lead to an application being rejected would usually focus around the potential loss of education to the pupils affected and the extent to which parents or parent organisations have been consulted about the proposed closure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to write to directors of education in this regard. Within the terms of the Concordat it is for local authorities to identify their own priorities and pursue their own approaches to tackling anti-sectarianism. Decisions on twinning arrangements will depend on local circumstances and are a matter for local authorities in consultation with their communities and church representatives.</p>
