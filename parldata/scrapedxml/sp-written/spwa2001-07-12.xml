  <p>It estimated that &#163;1.7 million has been made available to support former BARMAC employees, through ongoing support for the oil and gas industry. This includes funding from existing and new allocations for years 2000-02.</p>

  <p>This support includes training for general and specialist engineering skills, Health and Safety, Information Technology, and initiatives to promote employment such as the HIE-OPS database, the Reducing the Impact of Redundancy programme, and the Training for Work, Next Step, and Working Abroad schemes. These programmes have assisted ex-BARMAC employees and ex-subcontractors with some 2,671 job placements, with a number of individuals gaining more than one placement.</p>

  <p>In addition, Employment Service data shows that as at 2 March 2001, the total number of ex-BARMAC and ex-subcontractor employees registered as unemployed and claiming Jobseekers Allowance was 283, and that the cumulative number of job entries was 1,286.</p>
