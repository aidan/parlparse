  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the recent closure of the Chirnsyde community initiative, what urgent steps it has taken to ensure that a replacement leisure facility is available for young people in the Milton area of Glasgow and to ensure that future warnings about young people&rsquo;s safety being compromised by the actions of management committees are addressed effectively.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive understands that the Executive Committee of Glasgow City Council agreed to explore alternative arrangements for the delivery of community services by the Chirnsyde Initiative at their recent meeting on 8 December.</p>

  <p>The safety of all groups who use this, or any, community facility is of paramount importance. The Scottish Executive would expect the City Council to continue to consult with its community planning partners, including the police, to assess risk to any user on an on-going basis.</p>

  <p>Costs so far have been &pound;24,353, which was the cost of placing adverts in a number of newspapers and journals inviting applications for the post of chair of the joint board of the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen.</p>

  <p>No other costs have so far been incurred. I do expect, however, approximately &pound;10,000 of further expenditure in this financial year. This is the expected maximum cost of a study into future occupational pension arrangements for the staff of the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen. This work is to be undertaken by the Government actuarial department, and it may in the event cost less than this. I have no other confirmed plans at present for expenditure.</p>

  <p>We are today publishing findings from our work with independent consultants which examined the reach issue and potential solutions.</p>

  <p>We have implemented the largest UK broadband project of its kind with BT which has brought access to every Scottish community and 99% of households, putting us ahead of most of the world on coverage. We achieved this on time and also approximately &pound;1.5 million within the total budget of &pound;16.5 million. We will therefore now use this scope within our contract with BT to provide access to clusters which remain without coverage, where this is feasible. The first of these clusters will be announced by the end of March 2007.</p>

  <p>I am also announcing today an additional &pound;3.5 million for additional activity to deliver broadband to those without coverage, giving a total further spend of &pound;5 million. Delivery options are currently being developed and further details will be announced early in the new year. Implementation of solutions will follow during 2007-08.</p>

  <p>Copies of the reach report are available through the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41239).</p>

  <p>I am very pleased that the Audit Scotland report which issued on 19 December recognises the progress we have made in identifying costs and that the initiative is delivering efficiencies that would not otherwise have been achieved.</p>

  <p>I am also pleased that the report recognised that most projects have established robust baselines. As we have said before, developing better information systems is an on-going task on which we are working in conjunction with Audit Scotland and others.</p>

  <p>At 11 December 2006, the number of charges prosecuted under the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005 in Tayside was 25 and the number prosecuted in Grampian was 24.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. This information has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s case management database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency, the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Revised building regulations that will come into effect in May 2007 include enhanced requirements for energy efficiency that will reduce carbon emissions from new dwellings by at least 40%, compared with 2002. Along with other significant measures, there will be a return to the highest levels of thermal insulation and the introduction of the best low-energy lighting in the UK. The SBSA is starting a review of the standards for 2009. We share the ambition of zero carbon and are commissioning research concerning further progress towards zero carbon dwellings.</p>

  <p>The Executive has a range of policies in place to improve the energy efficiency of homes in Scotland, tackling fuel poverty and contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions and the achievement of our climate change targets.</p>

  <p>We are committed to bring all social rented houses up to the Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS) by 2015. The Standard includes the achievement of an energy efficiency rating of National Home Energy Rating (NHER) 5 or Standard Assessment Procedure 50 (SAP). All social landlords will be expected to show that they have adequate insulation and efficient central heating systems in their stock by this date.</p>

  <p>Our fuel poverty programmes are also having a positive effect on the energy efficiency of Scottish homes. We estimate that in 2004-05 the central heating and warm deal programmes achieved a combined reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 48,020 tonnes. The introduction of Energy Performance Certificates alongside the Single Survey will rate the energy performance of homes and include practical tips for simple cost-effective home improvement measures. We are working closely with the UK Government in relation to the Energy Efficiency Commitment which requires energy supply companies to meet targets for assisting householders to take up energy efficiency measures. The Executive also provides direct funding of around &pound;5 million to the Energy Saving Trust to promote energy efficiency in homes.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are required under the Home Energy Conservation Act (HECA) to devise strategies and targets to achieve significant improvements in the energy efficiency of their housing stock across all tenures. All local authorities are required to produce progress reports covering improvements in energy efficiency and CO<sub>2</sub> reductions. In 2007, the Executive will review and assess progress being made by local authorities towards meeting these targets.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The basic unit of analysis shown in the table is the number of patients. These are derived from linked records on discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals (SMR01) in Scotland.</p>

  <p>2. The same patient may have several admissions to hospital in the course of a year or number of years. They will be counted once in each financial year.</p>

  <p>3. Up to six diagnoses (one principal, five secondary) are recorded on SMR01 returns. All six positions diagnoses have been used to identify assault by sharp object. The following external cause code from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Other Health Related Problems, tenth revision (ICD10): X99 Assault by sharp object.</p>

  <p>4. Data for financial year 2005-06 are considered to be around 99 percent complete.</p>

  <p>This Government made a commitment to review knife crime law and enforcement. Arising from this review were proposals for changes to the law set out in First Minister&rsquo;s five point plan in November 2004. These have been taken forward through:</p>

  <p>Police etc. Act which came into force on 1 September and doubled the maximum sentence for carrying a knife to four years; increased to 18 the minimum age at which non-domestic knives may be bought, and removed current restrictions on police powers of arrest where a weapon is carried in public, and</p>

  <p>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons Bill introduced into Parliament on 3 October which restricts the sale of non-domestic knives through a licensing scheme and ban the general sale of swords (with the exemptions for legitimate religious, cultural and sporting purposes).</p>

  <p>The Executive has funded the roll-out across Scotland (from April 2006) of the Violence Reduction Unit to drive forward the Safer Scotland anti-violence campaign, including the knife amnesty. Enforcement on knife crime is a priority for the Violence Reduction Unit. The Executive provided the Violence Reduction Unit with &pound;100,000 to purchase 1000 hand held metal detectors (May 2006).</p>

  <p>Over 12,500 weapons were surrendered through the knife amnesty during June 2006 with a further 1,000 weapons subsequently taken off the streets through the enforcement phase (ran for a 5 week period immediately after the amnesty).</p>

  <p>An education phase of the Safer Scotland campaign was launched on 24 August 2006 which seeks to highlight to schoolchildren the dangers of carrying a weapon. Lord Advocate also announced new guidelines for prosecutors in May that mean those carrying and using a knife are more likely to receive a very severe punishment.</p>

  <p>1. The information in this table has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s case management database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency, the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>I apologise for the excessive delay in responding to this question. The information in the tables is complex and detailed. It covers the full range of overseas visits including routine official visits to Brussels back to 1999, covering a great number of people, many of whom are no longer in post. It has also been checked carefully for accuracy.</p>

  <p>It is important for ministers to travel overseas to engage with other parts of the world and to promote Scotland as a place to visit, to live, work and study as well as do business. Ministers only travel overseas after the First Minister has given his approval.</p>

  <p>I have placed tables showing the information requested from 1999 up to the end of financial year 2005-06 in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41207). The information is also being published on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>The cost given for each visit includes ministers&rsquo; flight, accommodation and other expenses.</p>

  <p>Engagements marked * were at zero cost to the Executive; the costs of members&rsquo; attendance at Committee of the Regions meetings are paid for by the Committee of the Regions.</p>

  <p>Before any overseas engagement is approved, it must represent good value for the Executive and the taxpayer.</p>

  <p>The total estimated cost of the current consultation exercise on proposals to establish Scotland&rsquo;s first Coastal and Marine National Park, which seeks views on a number of issues including ten candidate locations, is &pound;220,000. These estimated costs would be chargeable to the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department Programme budget.</p>

  <p>The estimated costs include around &pound;85,000 covering the design and production of a range of materials including the consultation document, summary leaflet, DVD, website material and other information as well as distribution costs to an extensive list of individuals and organisations. The remainder includes the estimated costs relating to the vehicle roadshows that visited all 10 candidate locations to offer communities more information about the proposals as well as a series of meetings with stakeholders to hear further views on the proposals and also includes the estimated costs of additional roadshow visits requested by members of the public and stakeholders.</p>

  <p>A breakdown showing time that civil servants and others have spent or will spend in supporting the consultation process is unavailable.</p>

  <p>No. Local authorities have powers under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to make, and vary, Traffic Regulation Orders specifying parking charges at designated parking places throughout their local authority area. The parking charge tariffs set by individual local authorities are therefore a matter for themselves in the context of traffic restraint measures within their wider transport policies and strategies.</p>

During 2005, members of the group provided indicative information on the numbers of requests received by their respective sectors.

  <p>Public Private Partnerships are an important part of the Executive&rsquo;s mixed economy approach to the modernisation and investment agenda to grow the Scottish economy and provide better public services.</p>

  <p>Payments by public bodies to private sector PPP consortia are for services provided over the length of the contract - these include capital construction, lifecycle maintenance and facilities management, and not just the upfront construction cost of the asset.

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured and which become known to the police. The returns do not cover &quot;damage only&quot; accidents or accidents of which the police are unaware because they were not reported by the public.</p>

  <p>The following table gives the numbers of road accidents which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on the A71 in 2004 and 2005 and the associated fatalities and serious casualties. The information is broken down by local authority area.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authorities would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>

  <p>A public announcement was made on 7 September 2001, confirming that no proceedings were to be taken against officers of the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) following allegations of criminal conduct which had been made against them. The officers in question were Hugh MacPherson, Fiona McBride, Charles Stewart and Anthony McKenna and the criminal allegations related to the fingerprint evidence in the Asbury and McKie cases.</p>

  <p>On that basis, the Crown could not now raise criminal proceedings against any of those officers if the proceedings related to the same subject matter.</p>

  <p>In September and October 2001, the legal representatives of SCRO officers were also informed of the decision either by letter or telephone, as were the Association of Chief Police Officers and the HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Legal representatives for two further SCRO employees, Mr McKenzie and Mr Dunbar, were also advised that no proceedings would be taken against their clients in relation to the fingerprint evidence in the Asbury and McKie cases.</p>

  <p>In 2003, inquiries were carried out into the fingerprint evidence provided by the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) in the case against Mark Sinclair, which arose in the Kilmarnock area. The Crown did not use the fingerprint evidence provided by SCRO on that occasion.</p>

  <p>In 2006, the fingerprint evidence provided by SCRO in the Sinclair case was passed to the Police Service of Northern Ireland for further consideration, and that process is on-going.</p>

  <p>I am not aware of any similar enquiries either on-going or having been carried out in the past 20 years in relation to any crime in the Kilmarnock area.</p>

  <p>All Executive funding for sport is routed through sportscotland who operate a number of funding programmes specifically for local community organisations. Decisions on which applications are successful are a matter for the board of sportscotland.</p>

  <p>Ten projects were allocated funding in response to their Stage 1 application. However, this is not a funding decision but an in principle allocation. A funding decision is made in response to a Local Authority&rsquo;s Stage 2 application and thus far two projects have been awarded funding at Stage 2: Glasgow City Council for their Toryglen project and Aberdeen City Council for their Chris Anderson Stadium project.</p>

  <p>Sportscotland has been working with each local authority allocated funding at Stage 1 to develop a Stage 2.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there are any European regulations that would prevent multiple interventions, such as both a public service obligation and aid of a social character, being applied on any one transport route.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-12-21.51.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80109" speakername="Tavish Scott" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa1221.htm#35">

  <p>There are no European Community Regulations preventing multiple interventions in respect of the same transport route, such as both a public service obligation which is funded and an aid of a social character. However, Article 87(2)(a) of the EC Treaty states that &quot;aid having a social character, granted to individual consumers, shall be compatible with the common market provided that such aid is granted without discrimination related to the origin of the products concerned&quot;.</p>

  <p>In the case of an air route on which a Public Service Obligation has been imposed, and which is receiving funding, only one airline has the right to provide a service. Therefore the policy and practice of the European Commission is not to permit the combining of these two types of public funding in respect of the same transport services.</p>
