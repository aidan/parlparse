  <p>The Scottish Executive has issued various codes of practice under section 13 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. There is one for local authorities exercising functions under the act and one for guardians and persons authorised under intervention orders.

  <p>In addition to the &#163;20 million for neighbourhood wardens &#163;10 million will also be available in 2004-06 for a range of other measures directed at tackling problems resulting from anti-social behaviour.

They could, however, include the creation of specialised anti-social behaviour teams within local authorities, intensive support projects for anti-social families and more extensive use of mediation services.</p>

  <p>Some research projects have linked sustained exposure to very high fluoride concentrations with bone disorders and fractures. Such outcomes have been detected in countries where fluoride is present in concentrations far above concentrations recommended for use in artificial fluoridation schemes.</p>

  <p>An expert scientific review, published in 2000, concluded that, aside from a possible increase in the prevalence of dental fluorosis of aesthetic concern, there is no evidence of other adverse effects on health, where fluoride is used at recommended doses.</p>

  <p>We last increased Mental Illness Specific Grant with effect from April 2001, when we increased it from &#163;18 million a year to &#163;19 million a year. We have just announced that we are increasing the grant by a further &#163;1 million, to &#163;20 million with effect from April 2003, as part of the outcome of the recent Spending Review.</p>

  <p>These increases reflect the priority we give to the grant in supporting around 400 small-scale projects in local communities throughout Scotland that assist people with mental health problems.</p>

  <p>No. The private sector model was based on the contract cost of privately-managed prisons and non-domestic rates are not a contractual cost. The net present value of non-domestic rates is estimated to be approximately &#163;3 million over 25 years. The public sector comparator included non-domestic rates to facilitate comparison with the new houseblock options. The total contractual cost plus non-domestic rates for the private sector model is &#163;209 million compared with the public sector comparator of &#163;429 million on the same basis.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The PricewaterhouseCoopers Financial Review calculated the total cost of a new 700-place private build private operate prison as being around &#163;206.2 million in net present value terms (around &#163;453.2 million in cash value real terms), compared to &#163;453.4 million in NPV terms (&#163;855.4 million in CVR terms) for the public sector comparator. The tendering and design costs will not be significantly different due to the costings for the design and service specification for any new prison in the Estates Review, for both the Private Build Private Operate option and the Public Sector Comparator, being based upon those for HM Prison Kilmarnock.</p>

  <p>Staff quarters would be designed, built, and maintained in accordance with Building Regulations and Health and Safety Legislation in force at the time.

  <p>It is not known whether any former staff quarters sold by the SPS contained asbestos. It is standard practice for purchasers to instruct their own survey of a property and any issues raised by their surveyor or their solicitors are dealt with as part of the conveyancing process.</p>

  <p>Because it would not have given a realistic result. The staffing levels proposed in <em>Constructing the Future</em> were based on scenarios specific to Low Moss&rsquo;s situation, and in particular the fact that it would only be housing remand and short term low-risk prisoners. To work out the operational costs of the public sector comparator for the Prison Estates Review three comparator prisons were used; Shotts, Perth and Edinburgh. These three establishments are core prisons and as such are more representative of what a fully flexible 700-place establishment would entail in terms of operational requirements such as prisoner mix, staffing regimes and prisoner escort requirements.</p>

  <p>As required by the contract, Kilmarnock Prison Services Limited (KPSL) gave the SPS advance notification of possibly being unable to meet the contractual insurance requirements but indicated that they would be negotiating with insurance providers. As a result of those negotiations, KPSL subsequently advised the SPS that appropriate insurance cover had been obtained.</p>

  <p>It is not part of <strong></strong> sportscotland&rsquo;s responsibilities to seek to establish international sporting federations. Shinty/hurling is not a single sport: the annual shinty/hurling fixture is a one-off hybrid event played under composite rules. So far as shinty is concerned, it would be for the Camanachd Association to seek to identify other countries where shinty is played and then explore with interested parties there the formation of an international governing body for the sport.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to continue funding for the Scottish Teacher Release Scheme should funding for that scheme expire and what its position is on the need to ensure that teachers who participate in the scheme can continue to be released from their duties in order to ensure that children are able to participate in their chosen sport.</p>

  <p>The Teacher Release Scheme operated by <strong></strong> sportscotland is in the final year of a three year funding commitment. <strong></strong> Sportscotland will be reviewing the scheme in consultation with interested parties over the next few months.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what consultation it has had with other European Union countries on fluoridation of the public water supply and what consideration it has given to the rejection of such fluoridation by Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Denmark, Holland and France.</a></p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not formally consulted widely outwith Scotland on how best to improve our children&rsquo;s oral health. The Executive will take account of the views expressed by the people of Scotland in response to the consultation document <em>Towards Better Oral Health in Children</em> , published on 24 September. Fluoridation of the public water supply is one of a number of possible measures described in that document.</p>

  <p>Fluoride toothpaste has widespread support in Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Denmark, Holland and France. In France, fluoridated salt has widespread support, and in many other countries such as Australia, Republic of Ireland and America there is support for water fluoridation. For example, in USA, at present, more than 150 million people receive fluoride daily in their water supply and this is increasing.</p>

  <p>International perspectives on fluoridation of the public water supply are mixed and therefore not compelling in isolation.</p>
