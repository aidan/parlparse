  <p>The Executive has no plans to consider changes to the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 to reduce from its present 100 years the exemption applying to access to census records relating to individuals. The provisions in the act reflect undertakings given to individuals responding to successive censuses that their individual details would remain confidential. The Executive recognises the interest among family historians in gaining access to the returns. However, it is also mindful of the concerns of those who respond to the census regarding confidentiality and of the need to address these concerns so as to ensure reliability and completeness of census coverage. The Executive&#146;s view is that the recent act reflects the most satisfactory balance of these interests.</p>

  <p>A reallocation of fishing opportunities between member states allowed for by the provisions of Article 23 Paragraph 4 of EU Council Regulation (EC) 2371/2002 can only be decided once the Commission has considered the likely impact of the reallocation on the interests of the member states involved and on the conservation of resources. Further, any decision must be taken by the Commission in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 4 and Article 7 of Decision (EC) 468/1999.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-32597 by Cathy Jamieson on 3 January 2003, how the statement that &quot;WTO members have the right to choose in which sectors and to what extent they want to make commitments&quot; is consistent with the answer to question S1W-32596 by Malcolm Chisholm on 3 January 2003 which indicated that no assessment had been made of the legal implications of the BetterCare Group Ltd ruling on the impact and operation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services.</p>

  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) keeps its charges under regular review, and has recently set up a user group consisting of customers of its ScotlandsPeople internet site and Scotland Online, the contractors who run the site on its behalf, to advise it on the future development of the site. Following discussion in the user group, GROS plans to seek the approval of the Parliament to extend the length of an online search session paid for on the site from the 24 hours laid down in the current Statutory Instrument to 48 hours. In the longer term, GROS plans a wider review of the site&#146;s charging structure with the aim of achieving discounted and less restricted access for heavy users of the site, or to allow institutions such as libraries to give access to the site through their facilities to users who may not have their own internet access or credit cards.</p>

  <p>It is expected that all sites will comply with the interim technical requirements.</p>

  <p>However, one of the requirements for interim compliance is the installation and commissioning of compliant washer disinfectors. The demand for washer disinfectors currently exceeds the supply available on a UK basis and as a result it is unlikely that all sites that require new equipment will have them installed and commissioned by 31 March 2003. The procurement of the equipment is being co-ordinated centrally by Scottish Health care Supplies. In the circumstances it is likely that an extension of up to two months to the March 2003 deadline will be given to those sites currently awaiting equipment.</p>

  <p>The Glennie framework looked at and built upon the best practice standards that exist for the decontamination of re-usable medical devices. As such no technical requirements have been set which stipulate the use of disposable clinical equipment.</p>

  <p>However, in a move to further reduce the theoretical risk of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease infection from hospital procedures, the department, at the beginning of 2001, introduced single use instruments for tonsillectomies.</p>

  <p>Improving Scotland&#146;s health is our most important challenge. Diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) are increasingly preventable by improvements in physical activity and diet and reductions in smoking. We are taking a comprehensive approach to health improvement that draws together activity across the whole range of the Executive&#146;s activity. Prevention is an integral part of our CHD and Stroke Strategy, and local cardiac services Managed Clinical Networks will be expected to develop prevention strategies which are in line with our health promotion framework.</p>

  <p>The additional &#163;40 million which is being made available over the next three financial years covers implementation of the whole of our coronary heart disease (CHD) and Stroke Strategy. NHS Greater Glasgow will receive support for its cardiac services Managed Clinical Network. It also has the opportunity to submit bids for initiatives which could be funded after meeting the costs of Managed Clinical Networks to support this strategy nationally and developing a national CHD database.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will give details of any changes to the rates of student support for further and higher education students that will apply for the academic year 2003-04.</p>

  <p>I am delighted to announce the new rates of support for students in further and higher education for academic year 2003-04. I am today placing in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre details of the rates of those loans, bursaries and grants, which will be available to eligible undergraduate and postgraduate students in full-time higher education (Bib. number 26394).</p>

  <p>A general uprating factor of 2.4%, in line with inflation, will be applied to the existing schemes of support in 2003-04, thus maintaining their value in real terms. We are also increasing by the same factor the standard rates of tuition fee payments made to institutions on behalf of eligible students by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland.</p>

  <p>This increase is consistent with that announced by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on 19 December 2002 for English and Welsh domiciled students.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) has also agreed to maintain the alignment between the further and higher education sectors by, where appropriate, uprating the support available to further education students by 2.4%.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-33166 by Ross Finnie on 27 January 2003, whether it expects the standard for lead set in the EC drinking water directive to be met by the target date of December 2003.</p>

  <p>The work being undertaken by Scottish Water, referred to in the answer given to question S1W-33166, is designed to ensure compliance with the Drinking Water Directive by 25 December 2003.</p>

  <p>Inevitably, there will still be occasional breaches of the lead standard. In the event of a lead failure, Scottish Water will be required to show that lead pipes in its own ownership did not cause the failure. Scottish Water will also be required to notify the occupier, and the owner, of the steps that they should take to avoid the contamination or minimise the risk.</p>

  <p>In the event of the failure being in a public building, such as a school, hospital or restaurant, new regulations will apply that will require the building owner to rectify the fault. The Executive will consult on the detail of the new regulations.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer <a name="QuestionText">what the installation cost was of each window in the MSP block west elevation of the new Parliament building at Holyrood under the (a) Flour City contract and (b) current contract.</a></p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide window installation costs only, as both contracts in question stipulated supply and installation. The Convener of the Holyrood Project Team has informed me that different models of bay windows are involved but, on average, the costs from the tender bids for supply and installation of bay windows on the west elevation of the MSP block were as follows:</p>

  <p>(a) Flour City: &#163;5,633 per window (excl VAT)</p>

  <p>(b) Current Contract: &#163;17,174 per window (excl VAT).</p>
