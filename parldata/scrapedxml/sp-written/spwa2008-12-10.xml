  <p>Police forces in Scotland have their own reporting systems and structures in place that they use to capture and record crimes and offences reported to them. The systems that each police force use are at their own discretion.</p>

  <p>In terms of the actual recording of crimes, the Scottish Crime Recording Standard (SCRS) was introduced throughout all Scottish police forces on 1 April 2004. The main aim of this was to provide a more victim orientated approach that ensures greater consistency and uniformity in crime recording standards throughout Scotland. Further to this, the list of crime codes used to record crimes is consistent across all police forces in Scotland, and allows Scotland-level statistics to be created. This ultimately ensures a greater degree of comparability between forces than there was previously.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Crime Registrars Group (SCRG), created to oversee change in all forces, has helped achieve a standardised approach to recording. The group consists of the eight police force crime registrars, as well as representatives from British Transport Police, the Ministry of Defence Police and the Justice Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government. The group meets every two months to review, maintain and improve the SCRS and its use and implementation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continually strives to improve the way in which crimes and offences are recorded in Scotland, and will work with all police forces across Scotland, the SCRG and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) to ensure that the rules in place ensure as much consistency and uniformity as possible.</p>

  <p>The detailed classification of crimes and offences used by the Scottish Government and the eight police forces across Scotland to collect criminal statistics records around 360 separate offences. This ensures consistency and uniformity in crime recording standards throughout Scotland. Below this level it is a matter for police forces to decide if more detailed classifications are required to support local operational requirements.</p>

  <p>A Scottish Crime Registrars Group Counting Rules Sub-Group has been set up and is presently working towards the introduction of additional markers on crime records to allow such information to be collected.</p>

  <p>And a copy has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47084)</p>

  <p>The Early Years Framework represents a radical approach to improving a range of health, education and wider social outcomes and tackling the inequalities of opportunity which have plagued Scotland for too long. It has been developed as a partnership between national and local government and we are jointly committed to continuing this partnership as we proceed with implementation.</p>

  <p>Scottish Screen has advised that the UK Film Council cannot provide the particular information requested. The UK Film Council provides funding both directly, through targeted funding schemes in areas such as development, production, distribution and exhibition, and indirectly via funded partners such as Skillset and the British Film Institute. In the current financial year, Skillset has awarded &pound;360,911.08 to date in grants to Scotland-based organisations and individuals. In the first nine months of the current financial year &pound;855,818.25 of targeted funding, which is application based, was awarded by the UK Film Council to Scotland.</p>

  <p>The UK Film Council announced last year that it had allocated &pound;1.88 million, over three years to 2010-11, to support the Edinburgh International Film Festival.</p>

  <p>Scottish Screen and the UK Film Council work together to support the film industry in Scotland, often supporting the same films and projects.</p>

  <p>The consultation closes on 27 January 2009. All responses will be carefully considered and will be taken into account as part of a wider options review being carried out by Forestry Commission Scotland.</p>

  <p>The consultation exercise and options review will help inform Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s deliberations on the level of monitoring required to assess the extent to which biodiversity, access, leisure and recreation were safeguarded under a lease.</p>

  <p>Under one option set out in the consultation paper, a not-for-profit trust could be given the task of holding in perpetuity the national forest estate land that had been leased. A trust could, however, also be given flexibility to sell any newly created woodland, which it had established using the proceeds of a lease, in order to generate funds to create more woodland. However no decision on that or any other actions possible for a trust have been made.</p>

  <p>Offering management leases and cutting rights, and transferring the proceeds to a not-for-profit trust for investment in woodland creation, are potential options for releasing capital from the national forest estate which could be used to fund woodland creation projects to help mitigate climate change.

  <p>It is therefore too early to say which geographical areas would be considered for leasing, but they are likely to be those parts of the national forest estate where timber production is the main objective, and where public benefits such as conservation, community engagement and recreation are relatively less significant.</p>

  <p>NHS Tayside did not end the out-of-hours GP service in Kinloch Rannoch. The then GP chose to opt out of the provision of out-of-hours services. This was contested by NHS Tayside and referred to an independent assessment panel. The panel upheld the case for opt out.

  <p>The Seed Marketing Regulations require that imports of over 2kgs of seed from Third countries, should be disclosed to Scottish ministers. In addition, the Scottish Government conducts a voluntary audit of companies importing seed directly into Scotland. Most imported seed (99%) sown in Scotland is imported into the UK through English ports. This seed is covered by a seed audit programme undertaken by the Central Science Laboratory in York.</p>

These revisits resulted in 15 double failures. Test purchasing is just one of many tools available to the police to crack down on underage drinking.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government expects any proposals to be considered according to the relevant procedures. Abstractions of water are regulated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) under the Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2005. SEPA fully assesses the risk to the water environment by the carrying on of a controlled activity before determining a licence application. Applicants must also advertise their proposals where SEPA considers the controlled activity may have a significant adverse impact on the water environment. SEPA considers written representations from objectors in response to such advertisements when determining an application, and notifies objectors of their right to ask Scottish ministers to call in the application for their own determination.</p>

  <p>Regulation 84B of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 (the 1994 Regulations) requires the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), as the competent authority, to consider Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 (CAR) consents under Regulation 48 and 49 of the 1994 Regulations where there is likely to be a significant effect on a European site. Should that be the case, SEPA must undertake an appropriate assessment in view of the site&rsquo;s conservation objectives and may only give consent having first ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the European site (subject to the provisions of regulation 49 which allow for the consideration of imperative reasons of overriding public interest in certain circumstances).</p>

  <p>Scottish Water has recently applied to SEPA for a new water abstraction licence for the Aviemore public water supply. In view of the designation of the River Spey as a Special Area of Conservation under the EC Habitats Directive, SEPA has advised that it has yet to complete an appropriate assessment for this application under the 1994 Regulations.</p>

  <p>Events of all kinds are a valuable way of driving sustainable economic growth, promoting Scotland and showcasing Scotland on a world stage. Events such as Edinburgh&rsquo;s Festivals, the Commonwealth Games, the Ryder Cup, Scotland&rsquo;s Winter Festivals, Homecoming Scotland, and pan-Scotland events to celebrate St Andrew&rsquo;s Day are all important parts of Scotland&rsquo;s current and future events calendar, but there is no single, agreed definition of what constitutes a &quot;major event.&quot; Our approach involves broadening and expanding Scotland&rsquo;s portfolio of events and taking new opportunities as they arise.</p>

  <p>Lead responsibility for individual events cuts across a number of ministerial portfolios, including in particular the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture, the Minister for Communities and Sport, and the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism. The Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture has oversight of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s overall strategy for events.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government works with a number of partners to maximise the impact of Scotland&rsquo;s portfolio of events. Our partners include EventScotland, which published its strategy for Scotland&rsquo;s events industry, <em>Scotland &ndash; the Perfect Stage</em>, on 2 December.

  <p>It is not the policy of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) that all serious sex offenders serve their sentence at a single specialist unit. Whilst the majority of those offenders who currently serve their sentence at HM Prison Peterhead are sex offenders, there are also significant numbers held at HM Prisons Edinburgh, Barlinnie and Dumfries and also HM Young Offenders Institution Polmont. Smaller numbers serving short sentences or in preparation for imminent release are also held at other establishments.</p>

  <p>SPS will continue to hold sex offenders at different sites with adequate numbers at each site to support the development of appropriate expertise to work effectively with them, support risk assessment processes and the delivery of Sex Offender Treatment Programmes.</p>

  <p>SPS have announced that the new prison for the north east, HM Prison Grampian, will be a community facing prison taking a range of tried and untried prisoners from the region.</p>
