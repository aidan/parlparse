  <p>The Youth Music Initiative (YMI) &quot;P6 target&quot; stated that, by 2006, all schoolchildren should have had access to a year&rsquo;s free music tuition by the time they reached P6. In addition, during the initial target period, funds have been made available to develop projects for age-groups other than those within the immediate P6 target group.</p>

  <p>YMI funding has been divided into three strands: &quot;formula&quot;, &quot;strategic development&quot;, and &quot;informal sector&quot;. The last two strands have been used to benefit projects aimed specifically at the early years (0 to five years) and teenagers (14 to 18 years). In 2005-06, &pound;1.9 million of YMI funding has been applied in this way. Details of the funding strands and a full list of these projects are available from the Scottish Arts Council.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is continuing to provide &pound;10 million per annum to help ensure that the &quot;P6 target&rsquo;&rsquo; is sustained by local authorities and that YMI funding is made available to develop youth music provision for the wider age-group.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body further to the answer to question S2O-8978 by Kenny MacAskill on 1 February 2006, why no specific mechanism exists to monitor the income, service levels, costs, level of subsidy and value for money of the Members&rsquo; Restaurant as distinct from other catering outlets at the Parliament and whether it will change its practice in this respect.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-02-22.12.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80063" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0222.htm#5">

  <p>The income from the Members&rsquo; Restaurant is recorded separately from the other catering outlets. As I indicated in the answer to question S2O-8978, some costs are generic. For example, some roles cover all areas: general manager, executive chef, accountant, kitchen porters and other roles such as food service assistants are often located by demand. It would be extremely difficult accurately to split costs amongst all catering outlets. We have no current plans to make major changes and subsidy is likely to continue to be presented as a total for all catering outlets.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body whether it will ensure that the Members&rsquo; Restaurant does not receive disproportionate subsidies relative to other catering outlets in the Parliament.</p>

  <p>Future subsidy will be determined by usage, service level and tariff policy. It is not possible to ensure that the catering outlets operate at the same subsidy level, as usage is one of the main factors and can vary from week to week. While the SPCB will keep the catering policy under review, we have no current plans to make major changes and the total subsidy level across all catering outlets will continue broadly at the same level.</p>

  <p>Access to the Members' Restaurant was re-considered by SPCB in November 2004, and it was agreed that the members and their guests only rule, on business days, would continue. It was also agreed that all pass holders could access the bar at any time. The SPCB has no current plans to change the access arrangements.</p>

  <p>As the Members' Restaurant is within the private part of the building, it would not be possible, within the current security arrangements, to give the public unescorted access. Members can of course invite guests into the Members&rsquo; Restaurant but non-pass holders must be accompanied by a pass holder at all times in the private area.</p>
