  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-16363 by Mr Andy Kerr on 18 May 2005, what the Operational Research Consultancy (ORCON) standards have been for the Scottish Ambulance Service in each year since 2002, broken down by local authority area.</p>

  <p>Between August 2002 and April 2004, the ORCON standards were phased out across mainland Scotland as the Scottish Ambulance Service adopted the priority-based dispatch system, which categorises calls based on the risk to the patient. The targets which are used to measure the ambulance service&rsquo;s performance under the new system are based partly (in relation to response times to non-life threatening calls) on the population density of each NHS board area. These were set out in the reply to the answer to question S2W-16363. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>ORCON standards are now used only to measure performance of the ambulance service in the areas of NHS Western Isles, NHS Shetland and NHS Orkney.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>The SBSA is presently considering several applications from organisations wishing to become scheme providers under the new system of certification.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>There are no barriers to the recognition of alternative scheme providers. Such applicants are assisted by the existence of an approved scheme framework within which they may develop proposals for providing that same scheme. The procedures for approval of schemes and providers are described in the Certification Handbook which is available on the SBSA website at <a href="http://www.sbsa.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.sbsa.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working in partnership with a range of organisations representing employers and employees to support the <em>Close the Gap</em> campaign which was launched in March 2001. The Executive has contributed &pound;150,000 to this campaign since 2001.</p>

  <p>In addition, measures to combat gender segregation in employment will contribute to reducing the gender pay gap as will the provision of flexible, affordable childcare. We are not yet in a position to quantify total spend in this very broad cross-cutting area. However, the Executive is developing guidance that will assist in assessing the gender equality impact of spending plans across its departments. Experience from other countries indicates that this is a long-term process and we are seeking to sustain progress each year.</p>

  <p>The area of the north east shoreline from Dundee to Aberdeen currently has no designations under either of the Shellfish Directives. Designations under the Shellfish Waters Directive (79/923/EEC) are made by the Scottish Executive, based upon production data collected by Fisheries Research Services to show that there is sustainable shellfish production which requires protection. No data has been forthcoming from this area to support such a designation. The Shellfish Hygiene Directive (91/492/EEC) is administered by the Food Standards Agency (Scotland). Designations are made on the basis of application by shellfish producers to the FSA(S). FSA(S) inform me that no such applications have been made in this area.</p>

  <p>Fresh Talent is a long-term initiative. Therefore, evaluating its overall success will take time. We will, however, be carrying out some more immediate evaluations of strands of activity which will give us some useful data. For example, we will know how many people successfully apply to live and work in Scotland under the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme, and we are currently developing, in conjunction with the Home Office, a robust and workable arrangement for monitoring and evaluating the scheme. We also know the number of people who are interested in living and working in Scotland, through enquiries to the Relocation Advisory Service and visits to our website. An evaluation of the Relocation Advisory Service, which is now underway, will also provide us with some useful information.</p>

  <p>According to the Report, Haemophilia Centre Directors believed that patients and parents were informed of the risk of hepatitis as part of general education on haemophilia and its treatments, including:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>use of educational material, including that produced by the UK Haemophilia Society;<br />
              education for patients and carers about home treatment with factor concentrates; <br />
              hepatitis warning signs and cross-infection precautions, in haemophilia centre treatment areas, and<br />

  <p>Prior to 1987, there were no effective anti-retroviral therapies for HIV and Hep C. Hep C was not identified until 1989. It was not until the mid-90&rsquo;s that a licensed antiviral therapy became available.</p>

  <p>For HIV, certain treatments for life-threatening conditions associated with HIV were available. Effective combination anti-retroviral therapy became available in the UK in 1996.</p>

  <p>Counselling for patients diagnosed with hepatitis C was not available prior to 1987 as hepatitis C was not discovered until 1989. Testing to diagnose the Hepatitis C Virus infection only became available in 1991.</p>

  <p>For HIV patients, testing for HIV infection became available in late 1985. Most of the cases seen were in injecting drug users though appreciable numbers where in men who have sex with men and haemophiliacs. Most cases were diagnosed in dedicated counselling clinics attached to the City Hospital in Edinburgh and Ruchill Hospital in Glasgow and in the genitor-urinary medicine clinics in these cities. Counsellors in these clinics, together with clinicians and other health care staff, social work staff and voluntary sector staff provided further support during this period.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) is the only existing whole-stock transfer organisation with plans for new-build housing.</p>
<p>A total of 6,000 new properties are planned to be completed by 2012-13 for GHA tenants whose homes will be demolished as part of GHA&rsquo;s regeneration plans. 2,800 units will be delivered directly by GHA with a further 3,000 properties built by other registered social landlords and 200 units from programmes already agreed by Glasgow City Council.</p>
<p>Last year the first phase of the new build programme totalling 600 homes to be delivered by other Registered Social Landlords began. So far, 119 new homes have been approved with funding of &pound;2.23 million. Further funding of &pound;2 million has been earmarked for the current year with another 376 homes expected to be approved by the end of March 2006.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>GHA&rsquo;s own contribution to the programme was deferred during 2004-05 pending consideration of its wider assessment of future stock requirements.</p>

  <p>In its statement of intent 2005-06, GHA has set three targets:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>by June 2005, to agree the first three year programme of its new build strategy within the context of a 10-year outline programme;<br />
              by March 2006, to reach agreement with GCC on 100 GHA new build units within GCC Regeneration Projects, and<br />
              by March 2006, to achieve site start for 100 units.</p>

  <p>The number of completions in an individual year is determined by the number of units approved for construction in previous years. Large or complex housing projects, especially when linked to a wider regeneration initiative, can often take some time to be formally completed. In addition, in some instances, there is a time-lag in the recording of this data and these figures are therefore subject to revision.</p>

  <p>There are five legal members of the Judicial Appointments Board: a judge, a sheriff principal, a sheriff, a solicitor and an advocate. The five lay members bring their own professional backgrounds to the board, with expertise for example in human resources and in education. One is also a professor of law. No training was therefore offered prior to appointment. After appointment, lay members have undertaken familiarisation with the courts. The board has met with the Lord President of the Court of Session and with the Director of the Judicial Studies Committee. It has also commissioned presentations on equal opportunities and on recruitment and selection processes.</p>

  <p>Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that Scottish ministers shall pay compensation in cases where a conviction is reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice. There may also be exceptional circumstances that justify compensation in other cases. The amount of compensation paid is determined on the advice and recommendation of an independent assessor, based on a memorandum prepared by the Justice Department, compiling information submitted by the applicant, other relevant papers and taking account of comments from the applicant. In considering claims, the assessor applies principles analogous to those on which claims for damages arising from civil wrongs are assessed. The assessor also has the power to recommend interim payments to applicants where they provide evidence of immediate need.</p>

  <p>The following information shows the number of applications at each stage in the process:</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="92%" valign="bottom"><p>Number of Applications:</p></td>
<td width="8%" valign="bottom"><p align="right">8</p></td>

<td width="8%" valign="bottom"><p align="right">3</p></td>

</table></p>

  <p>Generally we would expect to submit a successful claim for compensation to an assessor within three to four months of receipt of an application. Such a target can only be indicative however as the circumstances of each case vary greatly. The time taken for other stages also varies according to the complexity of the case and any delays which arise as a result of necessary background documentation being requested from the applicant or their agent.</p>

  <p>At all times, all clinically urgent calls are dealt with immediately by NHS 24 nurse advisers. During peak times, less clinically urgent calls are prioritised and receive a call back by a nurse adviser within a specific timescale. All callers who are categorised in this way are advised that should their condition deteriorate or they become concerned they should immediately contact the service again.</p>

  <p>In April 2005, NHS 24 answered 127,657 calls and dealt with 46,178 - 45% - of these by using call back procedures. NHS 24 aims to call back Priority 1 calls within one hour and Priority 2 calls within two hours. In April, the average time to call back Priority 1 calls was 19 minutes, and Priority 2 calls 56 minutes.</p>

  <p>The content of the training for NHS 24 call handlers forms an essential induction, as well as training process, for staff who are unlikely to have worked in either an NHS or a contact centre environment before.</p>

  <p>Induction training for call handlers runs over a three week period and covers a diverse range of areas including communication, health care governance, performance management, telephony skills, consultation review, medical terminology, call handler section decision support software, assessment and live experience and call handler processes and responsibilities. Call handlers are also trained to identify immediately life-threatening calls and can arrange for a call to be transferred to the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

  <p>Training is followed by a period, which will vary according to the needs of the individual, where call handlers are teamed up with experienced members of staff to ensure that they have achieved full competency prior to taking calls.</p>

  <p>Calls are recorded and are routinely monitored by front-line managers and further support training is provided where indicated.</p>

  <p>The length of time it takes to fill each consultancy vacancy within the health service in Scotland varies from post-to-post.</p>

  <p>The average time taken to fill such a post is six months assuming that there is no recruitment from other areas of the United Kingdom or from overseas. This is due to the particular recruitment process that has to be undertaken by each NHSScotland board employer when such a post becomes available in the health service and also taking into account each individual consultant&rsquo;s period of notice that has to be given to their own individual employer.</p>

  <p>However, the department is aware of the difficulties that some NHSScotland boards are experiencing in securing some specialist professional staff to undertake the various duties within the health service across the whole of Scotland. These workforce issues are being addressed rigorously and NHSScotland boards as employers are pursing several initiatives on behalf of the health service that will make the NHS in Scotland, as an exemplar employer, an attractive career option so to recruit and retain more staff.</p>

  <p>Also, to assist NHSScotland board employers meet local health needs, the department has set up a national workforce planning exercise to address these issues and the impact of staff shortages across the whole of the NHSScotland workforce.</p>

  <p>This activity is all taking place within a background of Scottish, United Kingdom and, indeed global, shortages in some specialties.</p>

  <p>I announced my proposals about NHS Argyll and Clyde to the Parliament on 19 May 2005. Subject to the planned public consultation and to implementation thereafter, including writing off the accumulated financial deficit incurred by NHS Argyll and Clyde, financial allocations to Highland and Greater Glasgow NHS Boards will be adjusted to reflect the addition to their areas of people currently resident in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area. This will ensure that the successor NHS boards are funded on the same basis and to the same level as all other parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Decisions about the allocation of resources within an NHS board area are matters for each board, subject to them meeting targets set by the Executive and complying with relevant standards. However, I would not expect residents in the existing area covered by NHS Highland to see a reduction in services as a result of the planned boundary changes.</p>

No decision has been taken by NHS Lanarkshire about the future of Wishaw and Hairmyres histopathology units.

  <p>No, this is about the classification and designation of beds. The reduction in the number of staffed beds attributed to A&amp;E across NHS Greater Glasgow over this period is based on the closure of Ward 29 at Glasgow Royal Infirmary in 2002. This ward closed when A&amp;E services transferred from the old hospital into the brand new Jubilee Building. From this time, patients have been treated in modern purpose-built accommodation, in new wards for head injuries patients, orthopaedics and medicine. These beds, however, are not classified as A&amp;E beds but counted within their host specialty.</p>

  <p>The official source for employment estimates by industry group is the Labour Force Survey (LFS). However, data are not available on employment in the renewable energy sector from the LFS. Industry groups are constructed using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes, which do not define the renewable energy sector specifically.</p>

  <p>A study into the renewable energy sector supply chain by Mott MacDonald, published in 2004, estimated that there were around 2,000<sup>1</sup> jobs in Scotland associated with the renewable energy sector.</p>

  <p>Source: Renewables Supply Chain, Gap Analysis.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The jobs estimate is expressed in full-time equivalents and includes induced jobs. Induced jobs are defined as jobs outside the renewable energy industry and its associated supply chain that are created because of activity in the renewable energy industry; e.g. additional jobs in retail arising from the increased economic activity.</p>

  <p>There are no formal appeals procedures, given that allocations are based on students&rsquo; own preferences.</p>

  <p>If a local authority agrees to release a probationer who is dissatisfied with their allocation, Scottish Executive officials will endeavour to re-allocate the probationer. However, this is dependent upon a vacancy being or becoming available elsewhere, which cannot be guaranteed. Probationers who seek release from the local authority to which they have been allocated must recognise that they run the risk of losing their place on the induction scheme.</p>

  <p>Such assessment is already provided by the Finance Committee, whose remit, under Rule 6.6 of Standing Orders is:</p>

  <p>To consider and report on:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>(a) any report or other document laid before the Parliament by members of the Scottish Executive containing proposals for, or budgets of, public expenditure or proposals for the making of a tax-varying resolution, taking into account any report or recommendations concerning such documents made to them by any other committee with power to consider such documents or any part of them;</p>
<p>(b) any report made by a committee setting out proposals concerning public expenditure;</p>
<p>(c) Budget Bills, and</p>
<p>(d) any other matter relating to or affecting the expenditure of the Scottish Administration or other expenditure payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund.</p>
