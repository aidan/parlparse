  <p>Scottish Opera has a responsibility to look at ways to make best use of its resources. How this is achieved is a matter for Scottish Opera&rsquo;s management and board, in full consultation with staff and unions. Protecting the world-class work of the company is a key objective for Scottish Opera in making these decisions. In accordance with the criteria set for all national performing companies, the Scottish Government will continue to take a close interest in how Scottish Opera delivers opera and its other activities to a high standard; with the best possible use of public subsidy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has regular discussions with UCAS about national qualifications including the Scottish Baccalaureates. In addition, the Scottish Government is represented on the UCAS Scottish Qualifications Progression Group which provides a forum for university admissions staff to discuss new national qualifications and the implications for university recruitment and admission policies.</p>

  <p>We are pleased that the value of the Baccalaureate has been recognised through the UCAS points tariff and inclusion in university prospectuses.</p>

  <p>Our approach is supported by an ambitious programme to put in place integrated care pathways for depression that meet the standards established by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland; the commitment to increase access to evidence-based psychological therapies in Scotland including the access target to be included in HEAT in 2011-12; screening for depression for those with coronary heart disease and diabetes and appropriate treatment; access to online and telephone based cognitive behavioural therapy and self-help for depression; promotion of physical activity as both a treatment for, and to reduce the risk of developing depression.</p>

  <p>The Institute of Rural Health also recognises, and is encouraged by, the service provided by Breathing Space, the free confidential out of hours telephone advice and signposting service for people experiencing low mood, depression or anxiety, particularly for the advice it can offer to those in rural and more isolated areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s public sector pay policy for senior appointments limits the maximum potential non-consolidated performance payment to 10%. However, 10 of the 36 chief executives covered by the pay policy do not benefit from any non-consolidated performance pay provision, and a number have a maximum potential non-consolidated performance payment of less than 10%. Only those chief executives performing at a demonstrably outstanding level, and who are eligible for consideration for a non-consolidated performance payment, can expect to be offered the full percentage award.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions ministers have had with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) regarding road issues at sites 5 and 6 at Almondbank, Perthshire, where the Scottish Government is a tenant of Defra.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government officials have had some discussion with Defra regarding a proposal by them to transfer the legal title and maintenance responsibilities for part of the road serving Site 6 Almondbank from Defra to Scottish Government. As the full implications of taking title and financial responsibilities for the road are extremely complex, these are having to be carefully considered and no decision will be taken until all the implications of ownership have been fully explored and quantified.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government owns Site 6 and is not a tenant of DEFRA who own Site 5.</p>

  <p>Figures in this table have been rounded to the nearest 5. 0, 1, 2 are rounded to 0.</p>

  <p>While there were students studying teaching courses intended for the further and higher education sectors in 2008-09, none of these led to qualified teacher status.</p>
