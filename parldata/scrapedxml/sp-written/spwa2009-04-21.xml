  <p>There is strong evidence that a minimum price per unit of alcohol can make a significant contribution to reducing excessive alcohol consumption and the harm caused by such consumption. Alcohol has become nearly 70% more affordable in Scotland since 1980 and consumption has increased by almost 19% over the same period.</p>

  <p>We are aware that some of those involved in offending behaviour may choose alcoholic drinks that are already likely to be above any minimum price we might set. But to target particular drinks would be likely to be both illegal and lead to the consumption of substitute products.</p>

  <p>Our <em>Framework for Action</em> <em>on Alcohol</em> (Bib. number 47805) makes clear a package of measures are required to change Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol. Actions which are specifically aimed at reducing and addressing alcohol-related antisocial behaviour and offending include: investment in diversionary activities for children and young people; tackling alcohol-related violence directly through the <em>Safer Streets</em> campaign, working with the Violence Reduction Unit to tackle gang-related violence in Glasgow, reviewing the identification and treatment of offenders with alcohol problems and research into the effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions for offenders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not yet seen the study to which the member refers and understands that it has not yet been published, so I am unable to comment on the specifics.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have primary responsibility for dealing with litter in their local area and their designated officers, along with the police, have powers to deal with those who litter.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Government recognises that alcohol and illegal drug use can contribute to antisocial behaviour, including littering, and that this in turn can undermine the safety and wellbeing of our communities. We are taking action on a number of fronts - including through our <em>Framework for Action on Alcohol</em>, our <em>Road to Recovery</em> drugs strategy and <em>Promoting Positive Outcomes: Working Together to Tackle Antisocial Behaviour in Scotland </em>&ndash; in order to address the underlying attitudes and behaviours which contribute to these problems.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission grades services on a six-point scale against four themes: quality of care and support, quality of environment, quality of staffing and quality of management and leadership. It does not award an overall grade for the care service.</p>

  <p>Any care service which receives a grade below 3 (adequate) in any theme will be subject to a formal requirement to improve. The timescale for this improvement will take into account practicalities such as refurbishment of premises, organising further training or engaging additional staff. Where improvement is essential to service users&rsquo; safety, requirements may be made to take immediate effect.</p>

  <p>This information is not held by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission&rsquo;s role is to regulate for improvement. Where a care service is not providing care which meets the requirements set out in the National Care Standards, the Care Commission works with the provider to ensure that improvements are made. Closure of any care service with the consequent disruption to service users is a last resort.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission&rsquo;s overarching aim is to regulate for improvement in the quality of care in Scotland. It therefore prefers to work with service providers to improve poor quality care services rather than to close them, with the consequent disruption to the lives of those who use the services.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission can provide information about care home registrations which have been cancelled. The contact details for the Care Commission are:</p>

  <p>All children&rsquo;s panel members are provided with high-quality pre-service and in-service training, which covers all aspects of the children&rsquo;s hearings system and their role within it. This is supplemented by a comprehensive training resource manual provided to all panel members. Good communication skills are essential for panel members and they are provided with advice on speech and language &ndash; stressing the importance of effective communication in hearings and discussing possible barriers to this.</p>

  <p>The training manual recognises that children at hearings, or adults who come with them, might have problems with communication and suggests ways to deal with such situations. Measures include obtaining as much information as possible beforehand about any communication difficulties and considering the use of speech and language therapists, or interpreters, at hearings where appropriate. Such issues are also dealt with in on-going training of panel members. Effective communication skills represent one of the core elements of the key competences required of panel members when sitting on children&rsquo;s hearings.</p>

  <p>Achieving efficiency and best practice asset management are the key drivers of the new policy and within that context there are undoubtedly opportunities to be realised to recognise the benefits that relocating can bring to different parts of the country.</p>

We encourage police involvement with the CashBack for Communities programme, which offers diversionary activities for young people.

  <p>In 2006-07, the latest year for which data is available, there were 8,838 instances of people under 18 who were convicted of crimes/offences in Scottish courts. As some people were convicted on more than one occasion in 2006-07, this equated to 5,153 individual people.</p>

  <p>Three thousand, one hundred and eighty-six of these individuals had not been convicted of any previous crime/offence in the period back to 1 April 1997, leaving 1,967 people who had committed at least one other crime/offence prior to their most recent one.

  <p>Estimates for numbers of children who may be affected by parental drug misuse published in the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs report <em>Hidden Harm</em> <em>(2003)</em> were based on work carried out by Glasgow University&rsquo;s Centre for Drug Misuse Research. This work used a number of data sources to calculate the estimate.</p>

  <p>Firstly, the number of problem drug users in the population was estimated using data from the Scottish Drug Misuse Database (SDMD), police and social enquiry reports; then the proportion of problem drug users with children was estimated based on Drug Outcomes Research in Scotland and SDMD data. This included numbers of children and whether they lived with individual respondents. Two separate figures were created (for both male and female problem drug users) and as these separate figures could not be added together due to a risk of double counting, an upper and lower estimate was created, resulting in the <em>Hidden Harm</em> figures.</p>

  <p>The NHS Information Services Division report <em>Estimating National and Local Prevalence of Problematic Drug Misuse</em> is due to be published in summer 2009; further work to determine the numbers of children affected by parental drug misuse will follow.</p>

  <p>Estimates for the numbers of children in Scotland who may be affected by parental drug misuse were published in the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs report <em>Hidden Harm</em> <em>(2003).</em></p>

  <p>The estimate for children who may be affected by parental alcohol misuse are derived using alcohol consumption prevalence data from the Scottish Health Survey 2003 and population estimates from the General Register Office for Scotland.</p>

  <p>&quot;Problematic drinking&quot; is defined as two or more positive responses on the CAGE questionnaire. The CAGE questionnaire is a validated screening tool commonly used to measure potential problematic drinking patterns, and refers to the initials of key words embedded in four questions around desire to <u>cut</u> down drinking, <u>annoyance</u> at criticism, <u>guilt</u> at levels of drinking and morning alcohol consumption as an <u>eye-opener</u>.</p>

  <p>The NHS Information Services Division report <em>Estimating National and Local Prevalence of Problematic Drug Misuse</em> is due to be published in summer 2009; further work to determine the numbers of children affected by parental drug misuse will follow. We are currently working on options to update figures for children affected by parental alcohol misuse.</p>

  <p>The City of Edinburgh Council has confirmed that it does not consider antisocial behaviour amongst tenants of holiday lets to be a widespread problem in the city and that it considers existing powers to tackle noise nuisance sufficient for dealing with disturbances caused by occupants of holiday lets.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Government is aware of the council&rsquo;s concerns that the definition of an HMO (house in multiple occupation) may not be sufficiently closely drawn and that in some cases landlords may be evading HMO licensing requirements by claiming that properties are being let on a short-term basis, and that residents have principal residences elsewhere.</p>

  <p>We will be considering the options for implementing the HMO provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 later this year. The issue of short-term lets and what types of accommodation require to be licensed under those provisions will be part of our discussions with stakeholders. However, the Scottish Government has no plans to extend HMO licensing to genuine holiday lets.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS) was introduced in 2004 to give Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) and Local Authorities a minimum standard to aim for in improving housing stock. All social landlords are expected to produce Standard Delivery Plans indicating how they will bring their properties up to the standard by 2015. From April 2008 the Scottish Housing Regulator is responsible, on behalf of the Scottish ministers, for monitoring landlords&rsquo; progress towards achieving the SHQS.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for enforcing standards in private rented accommodation lies with local authorities. Mandatory landlord registration and licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) set minimum standards for private rented housing and give local authorities a range of enforcement powers to tackle bad landlord practice. We would encourage all councils to use the full range of their powers to tackle the minority of landlords who can give the sector a poor reputation.</p>

  <p>From September 2007, the Housing Act (Scotland) 2006 gave tenants in most types of private rented accommodation the right to apply to the Private Rented Housing Panel (PRHP) where they feel that the landlord has not complied with the duty to ensure that the house meets the repairing standard. The PRHP has the power to make Repairing Standard Enforcement Orders, and ultimately rent relief orders, if mediation is not appropriate or fails. Under the 2006 Act councils also have powers to act earlier when a house is falling into poor condition.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government held a seminar on 1 April 2009, in partnership with the Scottish Throughcare and Aftercare Forum for local authorities to consider accommodation issues for care leavers. It is for local authorities to ensure that young people leaving care have appropriate accommodation as part of a package of support as they make the transition from care to adult living.</p>

  <p>Under Scottish housing legislation and guidance social landlords, including housing associations, are required to allocate their housing on an objective assessment of housing need. Within this legislative framework and existing guidance, landlords have discretion to develop their own allocation and letting policies in line with local priorities.</p>

  <p>Local authorities also have additional duties towards people leaving care under homelessness legislation. However, guidance makes clear that homelessness legislation should not be the main route for accessing accommodation for young people leaving care and emphasises the importance of relevant services working together with the young person to identify suitable housing.</p>

  <p>Following research into social housing allocations, the Scottish Government is undertaking a review of social housing allocations policy with the intention of providing new guidance to support social landlords to understand the requirements upon them and make use of the flexibility they have. To support the review, an advisory group made up of housing policy professionals, practitioners and tenant representatives has been established. Membership includes the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, Chartered Institute of Housing (Scotland), COSLA, Association of Local Authority Chief Housing Officers, Shelter Scotland, the Scottish Housing Regulator and representatives from the regional network of registered tenant organisations. In developing new guidance, we will consider including further advice to social landlords to support them to understand and appropriately respond to the housing needs of care leavers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the finding in <em>Alcohol and Violence among Young Male Offenders in Scotland (1979-2009)</em> , published in January 2009, that 43.4% of prisoners who admitted to drinking alcohol before their current offence and could remember what they had been drinking had consumed Buckfast tonic wine, what its assessment is of this finding and what action it intends to take.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-04-21.S3W-22243.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0421.htm#21">

  <p>Whilst a significant number of the young offenders surveyed in the Alcohol and Violence among Young Offenders report indicated they drank Buckfast, a similar percentage reported drinking spirits (42.0%) and a significant number reported drinking beer (31.0%). The study provides no indication of volume of each type of alcohol drunk or in what combination. More worryingly the report highlights how alcohol misuse among young offenders has increased over the last 20 years, with those reporting they get &quot;drunk daily&quot; up from 7.3% in 1979 to 40.1% in 2007.</p>

  <p>That is why Scottish Government considers that effort needs to focus on reducing the amount of alcohol consumed, particularly by offenders, and its consequences rather than on targeting specific drinks which is likely to be both illegal and lead to the consumption of substitute products.</p>

  <p>Our <em>Framework for Action</em> (Bib. number 47805) outlines a robust and comprehensive package of measures to tackle alcohol misuse, including actions which are specifically aimed at reducing and addressing alcohol-related antisocial behaviour and offending. These include: investment in diversionary activities for children and young people; tackling alcohol-related violence directly through the <em>Safer Streets</em> campaign; working with the Violence Reduction Unit to tackle gang-related violence in Glasgow; reviewing the identification and treatment of offenders with alcohol problems, and research into the effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions for offenders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is fully committed to reducing gang violence across Scotland and is taking direct action to tackle the problem. Last December, we announced a &pound;1.6 million funding package to support the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) project, which is targeting 55 gangs and up to 700 young men in the east end of Glasgow. This groundbreaking project is delivering a mix of tough enforcement and intensive services to turn around young lives. We are also supporting a Scotland-wide initiative that is delivering a range of programmes and activities to up to 500 young men in an attempt to challenge their attitudes towards gang membership and change their behaviour. This work is being supported by visible and sustained police enforcement which is being co-ordinated by the national Violence Reduction Unit through its on-going anti-violence campaign, the latest phase of which has been targeting gang violence.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold individualised data on any crimes or offences recorded by the eight police forces in Scotland, and as such does not hold information on the nature of the crime or the circumstances that led to the crime being committed. As such it is not possible to identify how many incidents were recorded in the last year where a glass bottle was used as a weapon.</p>

  <p>All violence, with or without a weapon, is unacceptable and that is why the Scottish Government is working in partnership with local authorities and the national Violence Reduction Unit to support initiatives &ndash; both in licensed premises and in the community - to tackle the problem. The new Licensing Act which will come fully into force on 1 September will give licensing boards more flexibility to introduce specific conditions on licensed premises, such as requiring the use of polycarbonate glass in premises with a history of disorder, and, in our communities, visible and sustained police enforcement continues to be coordinated by the national Violence Reduction Unit through its on-going anti-violence campaign, with much of the focus being on the prevention and detection of weapon carrying. More generally, it is crucial that we begin to educate young people about the dangers of carrying a weapon and that is exactly what our groundbreaking initiatives such as <em>Medics Against Violence</em> and <em>No Knives Better Lives</em> will begin to do.</p>

  <p>Information for 31 March 2009 is not yet available.</p>

  <p>Under the prudential code temporary breaches of the operational boundary are considered unlikely to be significant unless they are regular or sustained. The code requires that breaches of the authorised limit should be referred to the decision making body within the council to determine whether it would be prudent to raise the limit or alternatively instigate procedures to ensure that the current limit is not breached.</p>

  <p>The Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) programme was a UK-wide initiative and was subject to an independent inquiry led by Professor Sir John Tooke in 2007. The inquiry report can be found at <a href="http://www.mmcinquiry.org.uk" target="_blank"><u>www.mmcinquiry.org.uk</u></a> .</p>

  <p>Although many of the report&rsquo;s recommendations were specifically directed at the UK Government and its handling of both UK-wide and England specific governance of MMC, the Scottish Government consulted on Sir John&rsquo;s report in January 2008 and we sent a formal response on 27 June 2008. We agreed with Sir John&rsquo;s recommendations about the governance of MMC and about developing a clearer understanding of the roles of doctors in contemporary healthcare teams. The issues behind those recommendations were being taken forward in Scotland before Sir John&rsquo;s report was published and we already had robust and inclusive governance arrangements in place for both policy development and delivery in Scotland. We had also already launched a fundamental review of the shape of the medical workforce in Scotland, which is continuing. Any issues arising from MMC in Scotland are therefore being assessed and considered within the context of those governance mechanisms and of the on-going medical workforce review.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) has been published and recommends significant investment in rail throughout Scotland, including the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP), rail enhancements between Inverclyde/Ayrshire and Glasgow and the West of Scotland Strategic Rail Enhancements.</p>

  <p>Together, these recommendations will provide significant benefits to rail travellers across Scotland, including a &quot;step change&quot; in cross Glasgow connectivity and will relieve the capacity constraints in central Glasgow to allow for continued growth in rail usage.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland, Network Rail, First ScotRail, Glasgow City Council and Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) are currently working together to develop a delivery plan for the rail enhancements package of interventions highlighted in the STPR. This work is designed to share the detailed analysis of studies produced for the STPR proposal, to explore the interactions of the Glasgow Crossrail project and the potential for a new programme of wider strategic enhancements. This will include looking at the details of the proposal such as the use of the city Union line. A Steering Group has been established to progress this work.</p>
