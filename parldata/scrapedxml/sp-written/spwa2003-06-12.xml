  <p>The Executive sets the overall direction for community care policies. Local authorities must implement these, having regard to their statutory duties and to meeting the needs of their local residents. Central and local government work together to monitor the success of policy implementation through a variety of mechanisms and agencies. These include the collection of statistical information on inputs and outcomes; the establishment of Local Outcome Agreements for specific services; the Joint Performance Information and Assessment Framework, used to evaluate the implementation of the joint delivery of community care services by local authority/NHS Partnerships under the Joint Future Agenda; regulation and inspection of services against National Care Standards by the Care Commission; performance audits undertaken by Audit Scotland to ensure value for money, and assessment and review of services by the Social Work Services Inspectorate, either through the Chief Inspector&#8217;s Annual Report or, where necessary, through a review of a particular local authority or service.</p>

  <p>The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 places obligations on providers of goods and services to ensure that when they provide goods and services a disabled person is not treated less favourably by being refused a service, having it provided on worse terms or to a lower standard. It is also unlawful for a service provider to discriminate against a disabled person by failing to change a policy, procedure or practice, or to provide an auxiliary aid or service where the result is that it would be impossible or unreasonably difficult for a disabled person to use the service. Providing information about medicines would be regarded as an auxiliary service.</p>

  <p>To be a provider of goods and services covered by the act, a provider must provide either goods or services direct to the public. The manufacturers of medicines are therefore not covered and are not obliged to produce information in alternative formats.</p>

  <p>Title V of Council Directive 2001/83/EEC, which covers the information which is required to be provided with all medicines, permits the use of formats other than written text to be used. The UK Government encourages medicines manufacturers to make available large print, audio and Braille versions of patient information leaflets to those patients who request them. In addition, many companies run telephone helplines and other support services for users of their products which may increase the accessibility of information to visually impaired patients.</p>

  <p>During our first term of Government we established the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency (SDEA) which, together with Scottish police forces and other law enforcement partners, is tackling drug-related crime across Scotland. In our second Programme for Government we have committed to expand the SDEA to enable it to build on its achievements.</p>

  <p>Drug dealers' assets have been targeted through the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, which is designed to strengthen and extend powers to investigate, trace and recover the proceeds of crime.</p>

  <p>To reduce drug crime, we have also introduced Drug Treatment and Testing Orders and, more recently, pilot drugs courts provide the courts with an intensive and demanding community sentence for drug misusing offenders who might otherwise receive a custodial sentence. The aim is to reduce both the drug misuse itself and, in turn, the associated acquisitive crime.</p>

  <p>Arrest Referral Schemes which, while not a part of the criminal justice process, will also provide access to support and treatment services for drug misusing offenders. Research shows entry into and retention in treatment can be effective in reducing offending.</p>

  <p>A patient record IT database accessible 24 hours a day for use by the ambulance and out of hours services is one the key benefits we expect from our eHealth plans to create Integrated Care Records. Records of care delivered currently stay within the organisation delivering the care. Over the coming three years we intend to bring together from these separate systems the key patient information needed by professional health care workers, including those working in the caring emergency services. In the meantime, we are supporting useful pilot work such as enabling out-of-hours GPs to dial in to their practice patient record IT database.</p>

  <p>Like all NHS boards, NHS Highland has to manage carefully the way it implements the introduction of new drugs. That includes assessing the cost implications and budgeting for them accordingly. But it does not alter the fact that clinical need, not finance, should determine whether or not a patient receives the drugs in question.</p>

  <p>Ministers recognise that it is important to visit all parts of Scotland in the course of their ministerial duties. Records of ministerial engagements remain accessible during the parliamentary session. These are not collated by constituency visited and there are no plans to do so in future.

  <p>This is an operational matter for Scottish Water. The Chief Executive&#8217;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>During the weekend of 18 to 21 April 2003, Scottish Water experienced difficulties with a faulty valve which restricted flows to the Carrbridge area and, combined with higher than normal demand for water supplies, the reduced flow rate was not enough water to supply the village. The valve has been repaired and Scottish Water has put in place further preventative and early-warning measures, including booster pump capacity at the water tank so pressure is maintained during times of high demand and a remote monitoring system to ensure any future problems are detected quickly and efficiently. Scottish Water also plans to invest &#163;2.25 million to replace water mains which are supplying the area and over &#163;3.5 million for improvements at the reservoir and treatment works.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is continuing to work with NHS Health Scotland on a communication strategy to raise public awareness of the risks associated with passive smoking. Passive smoking is being addressed in a broader tobacco control context which includes activity in the home, the workplace and in public places. Work to date has included a variety of public awareness techniques, including TV, radio and press campaigns. Work is currently under way to further develop and advance this work through more mass media advertising and support materials. These new campaigns are expected to be launched later this year.</p>

  <p>The Partnership Agreement commits the Scottish Executive to consult on an action plan to achieve considerably more smoke free restaurants and pubs.</p>

  <p>Ventilation systems can improve the comfort and welfare of the public and employees. The best systems can, provided they are properly operated and maintained, protect non-smokers from exposure to carcinogens. However, without being able to guarantee that such equipment is properly operated and maintained, the Scottish Executive does not endorse it as being as effective in reducing the health risks associated with passive smoking as smoke-free areas.</p>

  <p>The effectiveness of designated non-smoking areas is dependent on a number of factors such as the lay-out of the premises concerned and airflow. However, while completely smoke-free are clearly the most effective way to reduce the health risks associated with passive smoking, the Scottish Executive welcomes any effort which is made to reduce exposure to second-hand for non-smokers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and COSLA school estate strategy, <em>Building Our Future: Scotland&#8217;s School Estate</em> , sets out our vision and objectives to achieve improvements in the school estate over the long term.
