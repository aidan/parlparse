  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within the NHS in Scotland. The CSO is largely a response mode funder and this role is well advertised throughout the health care and academic community. The CSO has not funded any research projects in the recent past into a cure for myeloma and has no future expenditure commitments in this area. However, cancer is a research priority and the CSO would be pleased to consider proposals for research on myeloma which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>There are no proven methods of screening for myeloma. The cancer strategy <em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change</em> recognises that patients should have clinically effective treatment which is delivered safely. Qualitative assessment of tumour-specific cancer services is underway within some of the multi-disciplinary cancer networks and others are in development.</p>

  <p>Referral guidelines are also in place to help identify those patients requiring urgent investigation to confirm a diagnosis of cancer.</p>

  <p><em>Cancer in Scotland</em> includes a commitment that by 2005 the maximum wait from urgent referral to treatment for all cancers will be two months.</p>

  <p>Data on the incidence of, and mortality from, multiple myeloma and malignant plasma cell neoplasms, broken down by age, sex, year of diagnosis/death, and geographic area are published on the website of NHS National Services Scotland, Information Services (ISD) at:</p>

  <p>www.isdscotland.org.</p>

  <p>Scottish Cancer Registry data indicate that 161 men and 129 women were diagnosed with multiple myeloma in Scotland in the year 2001 (total 290; 56% men, 44% women).</p>

  <p>The terms &quot;myeloma&quot; and &quot;multiple myeloma&quot; are generally regarded as synonymous. Solitary tumours of plasma cells can occur, but much less commonly than multiple myeloma. In the context of the International Classification of Diseases, both conditions come under the general heading of &quot;Multiple myeloma and malignant plasma cell neoplasms&quot;.</p>

  <p>The number of persons diagnosed with multiple myeloma in Scotland for selected years were as follows:</p>

  <p>In 2001, less than 1% of patients with multiple myeloma were aged less than 30 years at diagnosis. Less than 1% were aged less than 40 years. Only 2.1% were aged less than 50 years.</p>

  <p>During the period 1997-2001, the incidence of multiple myeloma and malignant plasma cell neoplasms combined in men did not differ in a statistically significant sense between the 15 Scottish NHS board areas of residence compared to Scotland as a whole. In women, however, compared to Scotland as a whole, incidence was statistically significantly higher in the Grampian and Western Isles Health Board areas, and significantly lower in the Greater Glasgow and Tayside Health Board areas.</p>

  <p>We will not be introducing an exact maritime equivalent of the Company Neutral Revenue Support Grant scheme although we will be introducing the Waterborne Freight Grant scheme later in the year. This revenue grant scheme will be aimed at encouraging the development of new water freight routes which take lorries off roads by assisting with operating costs during the first three years of operation. This will be open to all freight traffic which is switching from road to water including inter-modal units.</p>

  <p>All freight facilities grant funded projects are monitored on an annual basis. This involves companies operating grant aided facilities providing details of all freight carried each year. This data is then cross-checked against the records of third parties such as rail freight operating companies and navigation authorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that everyone has the chance to learn regardless of their background or current personal circumstances.</p>

  <p>In support of our policy of widening participation in further and higher education, the Scottish Further Education Funding Council and the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council have put in place a range of measures designed to maximise participation. These include, help with fees for part-time students, child care funding, extra funding to colleges and higher education institutions to support students with learning difficulties or disabilities, extra funding for further education colleges who operate in remote or island areas of Scotland and a social inclusion premium to help colleges and higher education institutions attract and retain students from the most disadvantaged areas.</p>

  <p>In addition the Scottish Executive in 2000 introduced free tuition for eligible Scottish domiciled students studying in Scotland and since 2001-02 have provided bursaries to young students from low income families to reduce the amount of debt they accrue during their studies.</p>

  <p>Information on the full range of wider access grants can be found in the respective main grant letters to the HE and FE sectors. These are available at:</p>

  <p>http://www.sfefc.ac.uk/library/fe1604 and http://www.shefc.ac.uk/library/he1004.</p>

  <p>The councils are undertaking a root and branch review of widening access to both further and higher education which will report by the end of the year. This is being chaired by Professor Jim McGoldrick, a member of SHEFC. This group has membership from the HE sector, the FE sector, the NUS, Scottish Enterprise, and a local authority director of education.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises the need to see further improvements in levels of retention in further and higher education institutions. Scotland&#8217;s retention rates for higher education compare well with other countries, with a completion rate of 83% compared to the OECD average of 77%. In relation to further education, the overall retention rate is 85%.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council currently monitors access and retention strategies through consideration of institutions&#8217; strategic plans and reports on progress through a circular letter. It also discusses progress with higher education institutions through a programme of institutional visits. Both Further and Higher Education Funding Councils also monitor the annual performance figures on retention rates for colleges and higher education institutes and actively engage with institutions which appear to be underperforming in this area.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also active in developing better collaboration between schools, colleges, Scottish Enterprise and careers guidance with a view to reducing the possibility of learners entering colleges and universities with misplaced aspirations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council and the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council recognise the additional cost of teaching students from non-traditional backgrounds and provide additional funding to support retention and completion from these groups.</p>

  <p>As I said in my earlier reply the reconfiguration proposals from NHS Greater Glasgow are subject to my approval.

  <p>The National Objectives and Standards for Social Work Services require supervising officers to investigate and take appropriate action in respect of any apparent failure on the part of a released prisoner to comply with licence conditions. Information about issues dealt with at a local level is not available centrally. Where non-compliance constitutes a risk to public safety, the supervising officer must report the matter to the Justice Department. The Justice Department can refer these cases to the Parole Board to consider possible grounds for recall. The number of non-parole licence cases of failure to comply with licence conditions referred and the number of those that were recalled in each of the last five years is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not recommend funding levels for local roads maintenance, it provides local authorities with Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocations. GAEs allocations are not funding as such. They form part of a more complex formula used to calculate a single Revenue Support Grant figure for each local authority which covers all grant-aided local authority services. It is for each local authority to decide on its spending on individual services based on local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>Trunk road maintenance funding levels are shown in tables 11.1 and 11.2 of <em>Scottish Transport Statistics,</em> No 22, 2003 Edition, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 29044). Table 11.1 shows expenditure for all Scotland and table 11.2 shows expenditure by Operating Company. Expenditure is not allocated or gathered by local authority area.</p>
