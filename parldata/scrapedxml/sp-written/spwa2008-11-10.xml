  <p>Information on the number of repeat discharges is currently unavailable for the calendar year 2007. Table 1 provides the percentages of repeat discharges with an alcohol-related diagnosis from general acute hospitals in the financial years 2005-06 and 2006-07. Information is based on discharge records rather than admissions.</p>

  <p>Notes</p>

  <p>1. A repeat discharge is defined as a discharge with an alcohol-related diagnosis for a patient who has previously been discharged from hospital with such a diagnosis earlier in the same year. The total includes multiple repeat discharges for patients with more than two discharges in one year.</p>

  <p>2. Caution is necessary when interpreting these figures. The recording of alcohol misuse may vary from hospital to hospital. Where alcohol misuse is suspected but unconfirmed it may not be recorded by the hospital.</p>

  <p>3. Excludes psychiatric hospitals and maternity hospitals. Transfers are also excluded. Includes Scottish residents only.</p>

  <p>A consultation seeking views and evidence on the use of electronic training aids was issued last year and the responses showed that the arguments were finely balanced but inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence at this stage to support a ban. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have commissioned research by the Companion Animal Welfare Council and the Universities of Lincoln and Bristol, both due to report in 2010. Therefore, we shall defer a decision on whether to impose a ban until the results of this research are available as that will allow us to reach a decision informed on sound scientific evidence.</p>

  <p>We are currently supporting a pilot campaign with Age Concern Scotland to encourage older people to take up the financial support, including benefits, tax credits, and other awards, such as help with heating costs, to which they are entitled. This is the first campaign specifically targeted at older people or the low paid which we have supported. Local government supports a wide range of services, through which older people and the low paid can access help, though these do not necessarily focus specifically on those groups. These include welfare rights services and money advice agencies. Some third sector organisations such as housing associations also provide support to access financial support alongside their other activities.</p>

  <p>Ministers receive as a matter or course, a wealth of representations relating to denominational schools in the public and private sectors, expressing a range of opinions. Ultimately, under the terms of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, the responsibility for the provision of publicly funded schools is for local authorities. It is for them to determine the type of schools they provide which should reflect local circumstances and demand.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not believe that targeted fisheries on vulnerable elasmobranches should be allowed. Equally the Scottish Government does not support measures that will inevitably lead to discarding. Therefore, the Scottish Government is looking for measures which will allow small unavoidable bycatches to be landed whilst preventing any targeted fishing from occurring.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government agrees with the ICES advice that there should be no directed fisheries on these species. However, a zero total allowable catch in a mixed fishery in which elasmobranches are an unavoidable bycatch will inevitably lead to discards. Therefore the Scottish Government supports the development of measures which will prevent the targeted fishing of these stocks from occurring whilst allowing small unavoidable bycatches to be landed.</p>

  <p>The arrangements for Scottish patients requiring access to specialised medical treatment which is only available in England are managed on behalf of NHSScotland by National Services Division (NSD). Specialised services provided in England are funded through two distinct funding streams:</p>

  <p>For a designated UK national specialist service, NSD commissions the service through the National Commissioning Group in England to ensure that Scottish residents have the same access as those from England. These arrangement cover services for very rare conditions which are only available at a few sites in the UK.</p>

  <p>A national financial risk sharing scheme is in place for ad hoc referrals to other specialised services in England which are not nationally designated. Currently, 35 services are included in the specialised services definitions set. These services are not commissioned by NSD, rather funded through NSD on behalf of NHS boards. Referrals to specialist services in England are made by secondary or tertiary hospital specialists in appropriate disciplines. It is the responsibility of the Director of Public Health of the NHS board of the patient&rsquo;s residence to approve all such referrals.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government places great importance on Scotland&rsquo;s relationships in Europe, and engages on an ongoing basis with Ireland, Iceland and Norway, along with a range of European partners, across a variety of areas, including those relating to the economy. At the 11th summit of the British Irish Council in September 2008, for example, the First Minister, the Taoiseach and other participants discussed the global economic crisis amongst other issues. The outcome of these discussions is recorded in the communiqu&eacute; of the summit which was placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 46719). On 12 October 2008 the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism visited Norway for talks on energy matters.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to doing everything within its power to encourage investment in and development of the Scottish economy and help businesses and individuals. We are taking forward an extensive package of measures through the Scottish Economic Recovery plan, and will continue to review our actions and spending in light of this plan.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to decide on the best way to deliver their efficiencies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with the public sector, including local government, NHS boards, and executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies to take forward a shared services agenda. Shared services should be about simplifying, standardising and then sharing. Across the public sector there are examples of significant work being undertaken to simplify and standardise which should identify the opportunities to share effectively. The Scottish Government is supporting the public sector in identifying those opportunities based on evidence of efficiency and effectiveness to ensure the solutions supported can deliver real benefits to organisations and the public. This extends to both back office and front line service delivery. The Efficiency Outturn Report for 2007-08 published on 31 October 2008 gives information on efficiency savings delivered to date:</p>

  <p>Implementation of Agenda for Change is on-going in Scotland and no NHS board has fully implemented all aspects of the new system. However, all boards are working to a timetable of having all substantive staff assimilated to the new pay system by the end of this year. At the same time boards are also conducting reviews for those staff who have requested a review of their banding. In addition, boards are focussing on the Knowledge and Skills Framework (KSF) ensuring that all staff have a job outline and Personal Development Plan in place which will form the basis of their annual development review.

I understand the board anticipate commencing the reviews for this staff group in February 2009.

  <p>As at September 2008 the number of substantive NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde staff awaiting assimilation was 381, which represents 0.8 % of the substantive staff workforce covered by Agenda for Change. This particular group of staff are those people who have moved post a number of times and are therefore more difficult and complex cases which take longer to conclude. In addition, there are 6,293 bank staff who will move across to the new system once substantive staff have been assimilated. In total, this represents 14% of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s workforce which is covered by Agenda for Change.</p>

  <p>No specific assessment has been made of the effectiveness of the cross-border transfer of organs for transplantation. This is because the allocation of organs is based on a UK-wide system which does not take specific account of the boundaries between countries. The arrangements are based on the principle of finding the best possible match for patients in order to achieve the optimal clinical outcome.</p>

  <p>Note: &quot;Instances of Assistance&quot; have been rounded up or down to the nearest five, &quot;Amounts Issued&quot; have been rounded to the nearest thousand.</p>

  <p>Individual identifying student details of payments from these funds are not held centrally and therefore there is a degree of overlap in the student numbers: students can receive help from both the Childcare and the Discretionary Fund in the same academic year; students are also able to receive help more than once from the same fund; student can receive discretionary funds and also receive the loans and awards reported in the first paragraph. The overlap does not affect amounts.</p>

  <p>Academic year 2006-07 is the latest for which data on students supported by SAAS and through the Discretionary and Childcare Funds is available.</p>

  <p>The safety of medicines available on the UK market is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA report that between 14 April 2008 and 5 November 2008 there have been 83 suspected Adverse Drug/Vaccine Reaction (ADR) reports received for Cervarix vaccine from Scotland. This is in line with what we would expect to see for a mass vaccination programme. The information is given on a national basis in order not to disclose information that may relate to an individual patient.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of suspected adverse reactions reported to MHRA in association with Cervarix vaccine have related either to the signs and symptoms of recognised side effects listed in the product information or were due to the injection process and not the vaccine itself. For the isolated cases of other medical conditions reported, the available evidence does not suggest the vaccine caused the condition.</p>
