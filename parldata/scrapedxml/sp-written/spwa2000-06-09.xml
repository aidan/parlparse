  <p>The number of staff employed in the Scottish Ambulance Service meets demand. Over the past five years the level of vacancies against establishment within the service has remained consistently low at between 1% and 1.5%. During the same period the numbers of front-line ambulance personnel have increased by over 140. On completion of training later this year, a further 20 emergency ambulance staff will be deployed into Glasgow as part of a range of initiatives being taken to improve performance in the city.</p>

  <p>There is no general statutory definition of the term &quot;emergency service&quot;. However, the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 made under the Road Traffic Act 1988 specify those vehicles designated as &quot;emergency vehicles&quot; which are empowered to be fitted with a blue warning beacon. In this regard, in addition to fire, ambulance and police vehicles, the regulations also cover specified vehicles used by the Forestry Commission, the Ministry of Defence, HM Coastguard, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Coal Authority, and the Blood Transfusion Service.</p>

  <p>The report of the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland provides a robust evidence base for the management and delivery of infertility services in Scotland. Implementation of the report&#8217;s recommendations will bring about equity of access to services and treatment. The report has been issued to all health boards and NHS Trusts in Scotland who have been asked to work towards implementation of the report as resources permit. At the same time health boards and NHS Trusts have been asked to bear in mind their existing clinical priorities which are cancer, coronary heart disease/stroke and mental health.</p>

  <p>I intend to review progress towards implementation early in 2001.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-5066 by Susan Deacon on 21 March 2000, why it considers it unnecessary to hold information on measures to detect osteoporosis centrally and whether it will arrange for details of any measures taken to detect osteoporosis at a local level to be held centrally.</p>

  <p>Strategies for the care of patients with a wide variety of conditions, including osteoporosis, are the responsibility of health boards and their associated NHS Trusts, who are best suited to assess local needs. If the Scottish Executive required detailed reports on every aspect of patient care for every condition from boards and Trusts it would be a very time-consuming and therefore costly exercise. I am not convinced that this would be a good use of NHS funds.</p>

  <p>Guidance to help health boards devise their strategies was issued by the Health Department in 1997, in the form of a Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) on osteoporosis. This gave the conclusions of a group of experts drawn from within the NHS on the current situation in Scotland, a review of recent research, and options for the prevention, detection and management of osteoporosis.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to develop a national strategy for osteoporosis. It is for local health boards to determine the services which are required to meet the needs of their local population within available resources. Guidance to help health boards devise their strategies was issued by the Health Department in 1997, in the form of a Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) report on osteoporosis. This gave the conclusions of a group of experts drawn from within the NHS on the current situation in Scotland, a review of recent research, and options for the prevention, detection and management of osteoporosis.</p>

  <p>This SNAP report concluded that the only measures known to prevent the development of osteoporosis are weight-bearing exercise, the reduction of alcohol consumption to moderate levels, the reduction of tobacco consumption and a balanced diet with a higher consumption of calcium and vitamin D and lowered consumption of sodium, protein and caffeine. These are measures which are actively promoted by the Executive, because they reduce the risks of developing many other conditions as well as osteoporosis.</p>

  <p>The Department of Health issued a statement on 1 July 1999 providing guidance on the action to be taken in cases of complaint of organophosphate poisoning. A copy of this statement was sent to health boards, NHS Trusts and general practitioners in Scotland on 1 July 1999 under cover of a letter from the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland. The statement suggested that where a patient presented with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, doctors might refer to a consultant neurologist or discuss the case with the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS).

  <p>In accordance with their respective responsibilities, Grampian Health Board and Aberdeenshire Council have been investigating the outbreak of infection among young people who attended the Cub and Scout Camp at the New Deer Agricultural Showground over 26 and 27 May 2000.</p>

  <p>The circumstances are that Grampian Health Board were notified, on the morning of Sunday 4 June, of a cluster of three cases of severe diarrhoea admitted to hospitals in Aberdeen over that weekend. One of the cases had been diagnosed as suffering from E.coli 0157 infection. All had attended the camp.</p>

  <p>Immediate investigation, and contact with parents, established that a wider group of children, who had attended the camp, were suffering from gastro-enteritis and, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Scottish Executive in July 1999 on the investigation and control of outbreaks of foodborne disease, an Outbreak Control Team was set up, consisting of specialists in public health, environmental health, microbiology, infectious disease medicine and paediatrics. The Executive were also informed on that day of the developing situation.</p>

  <p>At its first meeting on 4 June, the team set in train extensive investigations to detect the cause of the outbreak. The Procurator Fiscal has been informed in the normal way. Steps were also taken to provide advice on health and hygiene to parents of the young people attending the camp and to seek further information from them about symptoms and risk factors such as food consumption. The owners of the showground agreed to close it to campers until further notice.</p>

  <p>Fifty-two cases have so far been identified with symptoms which consist principally of diarrhoea and/or vomiting. On the basis of microbiological results, there are now 18 confirmed cases of E.coli 0157 infection, of whom one is in hospital receiving dialysis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been keeping in close touch with the investigation. The Food Standards Agency is also maintaining contact with the local Outbreak Control Team and will publicise any food safety or other advice required, when the full facts are known. The Outbreak Control Team will ensure that the public, media and local MSPs are kept in touch with developments.</p>

It should also cover the responsibility for repairs and maintenance and internal decoration and any conditions or restrictions on the use of the property.

  <p>All fingerprint identifications at the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) have quality assurance checks built in. Following identification of a scene of crime mark, a further two fingerprint experts independently examine the fingerprint impressions in order to confirm the identification. All the negative and eliminated marks, paperwork and procedures are also checked in an identified case. A Quality Assurance Officer examines the paperwork and procedures of all fingerprint identifications and any identification being submitted as evidence is subject to a further quality assurance check by Principal Fingerprint Officers.</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Constabulary is currently conducting an inspection review of the fingerprint section at SCRO. The inspection will include quality assurance aspects and recommendations will be made on any matters where there were shortcomings or scope for improvement.</p>

  <p>Following the McIntosh report, the Executive has consulted on a number of issues including the timing of elections and the eligibility of local government employees. We are presently considering the responses to these issues. It also established the Renewing Local Democracy Working Group to consider, among other issues, the electoral system for local government: that group is expected to report shortly. The Executive will review the administrative arrangements for local government elections, including polling hours, in the light of the post-McIntosh consultation and the report of the Renewing Local Democracy Working Group.</p>

  <p>The Executive has provided national guidance to Trusts and boards about the disposal of surplus land. The underlying principle is that patient care should benefit from this resource. Specific information about a health board&#8217;s disposals can be obtained direct from the health board. The detailed information requested can be obtained from Greater Glasgow Health Board.</p>

  <p>Following the abolition of Crown Exemption from non-domestic rates from 1 April 2000 police forces are liable to pay non-domestic rates for police properties. The Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) settlement for 2000-01 was increased to recompense in full the costs associated with the payment of rates. The effect of Crown Exemption on the police is therefore cost neutral and has no bearing on officer recruitment.</p>

  <p>The additional &pound;8.9 million invested in the Scottish police will enable the recruitment of more than 300 extra police officers. Decisions on recruitment and deployment of staff are, however, matters for individual chief constables. After allocating &pound;1 million to the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan for the training of the additional recruits, the funds were distributed as shown in the table below. Also shown is the notional number of additional officers that could be recruited from the extra money available.</p>

  <p>The Social Justice report <i>Social Justice: A Scotland Where Everyone Matters</i> published in November 1999, sets out the 29 social justice milestones which will be reported upon annually, as the framework for assessing progress in tackling poverty and deprivation throughout Scotland. In addition, assessments of deprivation are carried out for specific purposes including the allocation of local authority grants. The indicators of deprivation used within the grant distribution system are described in detail in the annual Grant Aided Expenditure 2000 <i>Green Book</i> . Copies of both these documents are available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>

  <p>There is no obligation to notify the Executive of local farmers&#8217; markets. I am aware of nine farmers&#8217; markets up and running in Scotland. These are located in Perth, Elgin, Ayr, Inverness, Skye, Tain, Aviemore, Forfar and Glasgow.</p>

  <p>It is clearly not possible to sign every tourist attraction which may be put forward for signposting at the junction of the A74(M) and A75 at Gretna. However, the Solway Coast Heritage Trail is signed at Gretna to direct traffic to tourist attractions along the Solway Coast. I believe that the best way forward is for Wigtown to be advertised in the promotional literature which is produced to support the tourist trail.</p>
