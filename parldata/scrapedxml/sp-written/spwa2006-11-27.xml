  <p>The Integrated Community Schools project has developed since its launch in 1998 and the concept is now mainstreamed into the wider integrated children&rsquo;s services agenda. In this context it is no longer appropriate to think of integrated community schools as a separate school-based initiative.</p>

  <p>&pound;25.8 million is made available each year to local authorities, through the National Priorities Action Fund, to help support this broader framework for delivering integrated children&rsquo;s services at school and neighbourhood level.</p>

  <p>The pesticide residues monitoring programme is UK-wide and it is not possible to determine origin within the UK from the information available. Of the 65 incidents in 2005 where pesticide residues exceeded the maximum residue level, seven involved produce labelled as UK origin.</p>

  <p>Enforcement action has been initiated in respect of one incident. The enforcement process identified that the produce in question did not originate in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Pesticide Residues Committee publish quarterly reports that contain brand names and details of produce that exceed the maximum residue levels and any follow up action taken.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-11-27.7.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80022" speakername="Ms Margaret Curran" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa1127.htm#6">

  <p>During the October recess I visited Wellington, Dunedin and Auckland at the invitation of the New Zealand Government. The primary focus of the visit was to witness the operation of a parliamentary and government system with strong parallels with Scotland, and to compare and contrast that system with the Scottish system. I undertook a series of engagements aimed at promoting Scotland on the international stage with particular emphasis on governance, tourism and the business economy.</p>

  <p>In Wellington I met with a range of Parliamentarians from across the political spectrum. I was welcomed onto the floor of the House by the Prime Minister Helen Clark and had discussions with the Speaker, the Leader of the House, and the Whips about how the New Zealand Parliament manages its business and legislative programme. I was also able to explore with the Ombudsman what lessons might be drawn from the way that New Zealand has developed a mature and pragmatic approach to Freedom of Information in the 25 years since their legislation was introduced. I also met with representatives of the Immigration Services to discuss areas of mutual interest in attracting talent to our respective countries &ndash; particular interest was expressed in our relocation advisory service.</p>

  <p>I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge and interest in modern Scotland and its political system. I took the opportunity to highlight what devolution has delivered for the people of Scotland &ndash; culturally, economically and through legislative change &ndash; in a speech that I made at the Scottish Studies Institute, at Victoria University. In Dunedin I visited the medical faculty at Otago University which has strong links with Edinburgh. I met a number of academics, including the Hon Dr Clive Matthewson, who is about to announce the establishment of a Centre for Scottish Studies at Otago University. The purpose of the centre will be to pursue research and teaching into aspects of Scottish history, culture and society that will illuminate its influence on the formation of New Zealand identity and assess its contribution to New Zealand&rsquo;s economic, social and cultural development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish diaspora is strong in New Zealand, with 50% of New Zealanders claiming Scottish heritage The interest in how devolution is working in Scotland was striking and the enthusiasm to develop practical links was strong. There are potential business and academic advantages in building on this shared heritage. In Dunedin, I undertook a number of engagements including a visit to the Settlers Museum and a visit to New Zealand Natural History, a local business that produces HD natural history films which are distributed worldwide - demonstrating that remoteness does not prevent both businesses and universities from being leaders in their field.</p>

  <p>In Auckland I hosted a lunch for New Zealand based Globalscots and senior business representatives who either have already invested in Scotland, or are considering doing so. This was the first opportunity for these interests to be brought together since the appointment of our SDI representative in Australasia. A number of potentially interesting developments are likely to be taken forward as a result of these discussions. In addition, I had the honour of being received by the Governor General, Judge Anand Satyanand, with whom I had a very productive discussion on issues of interest to Scotland and New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Throughout my visit I was accompanied by the British High Commissioner, George Fergusson, who himself has strong links with Scotland. The High Commissioner was an invaluable guide drawing on his family&rsquo;s long association with New Zealand.</p>

  <p>All local authorities in Scotland operate an inclusive policy that includes a mainstreaming presumption, however it is a presumption, not an inflexible rule. Pupils with additional support needs will be supported by their respective local authorities irrespective of the language medium of instruction in which their education is delivered. There is no differentiation between the level of support provided to Gaelic-medium pupils and other pupils.</p>

  <p>Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, Education Authorities must make arrangements, as they consider appropriate, for identifying from amongst the children and young people for whom they are responsible, those who have additional support needs. They must then make adequate and efficient provision for the additional support required for each child or young person so identified. These duties apply to a child at the pre school stage who is in pre school provision managed by the education authority. The education authority must also take action at various transition points in a child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s school career to establish the additional support needs of the children or young persons. Under these procedures the education authority is then under a duty to ensure that the identified provision is then in place.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that there are few Gaelic speaking additional support needs teachers and auxiliaries available to support the needs of Gaelic-medium pupils with additional support needs. On the recommendation of the Gaelic-Medium Teachers&rsquo; Action Group, the Executive is addressing this staffing issue and has provided funding for B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig to appoint a Gaelic Teacher Recruitment Officer. The recruitment officer, in collaboration with the B&ograve;rd&rsquo;s Education Manager, is responsible for promoting Gaelic education opportunities among school pupils and university under-graduates, liaising with universities and Teacher Education Institutions on Gaelic-medium courses and working in partnership with local authorities to provide appropriate opportunities for continuous professional development for Gaelic medium teachers and support staff.</p>

We will then be able to consider what further action might be taken to increase public awareness.</p>

  <p>The Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 places a duty on NHS boards to provide or secure primary medical services for their populations. The <em>Act</em> provides the legal framework for NHS boards to discharge this duty by providing primary medical services directly (i.e. salaried services) or by making arrangements through contracts or agreements with a range of primary medical service providers, including for-profit businesses and voluntary or not-for-profit organisations.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the vast majority of primary medical services are provided by general practitioners under contract with NHS boards. These general practitioners are not employees of health boards, but independent, self-employed practitioners that own and run GP practices as businesses for profit. This has been the case since the NHS was set up in 1948.</p>

  <p>How NHS boards discharge their duty to provide or secure primary medical services is a matter for each NHS board taking into account the needs of the local population and local circumstances. So long as the traditional model of contracting for primary medical services continues to work for the benefit of local patients and communities, we see no reason why this would change.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. For this analysis, the total value of sales was converted to 2005 prices using the UK GDP deflator. The GDP deflator is a measure of inflation across the whole domestic economy.</p>

  <p>2. Local government reorganisation replaced the 56 old district councils and five new towns with 32 local authorities on the 1 April 1996. This reorganisation means that it is not possible to present the total value of sales from 1979 in one table.</p>

  <p>3. The dataset upon which the analysis is based records sales to individuals only. It excludes any block transfers of council houses to housing association ownership.</p>

  <p>4. Figures for Dumfries and Galloway, Glasgow and the Scottish Borders are excluded from April 2003 following the transfer of stock to housing association ownership. The total value of sales recorded in these areas from 2003 quarter 2 is &pound;93.3 million, in 2005 prices.</p>

  <p>5. Scotland totals may not equal the sum of the districts or local authorities because of rounding.</p>

  <p>Life expectancy figures are not available for local authority wards because their population is too small to allow accurate estimates to be made.</p>

  <p>Currently, life expectancy at birth is calculated at local authority and NHS board area.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why users of Glasgow hospitals, who are not residents of Glasgow city, are not able to access the recently launched evening visitor scheme and when this situation will be rectified.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-11-27.25.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa1127.htm#15">

  <p>The evening visitor scheme was launched last month by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) in partnership with Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Partnership for Transport and Community Transport Glasgow (CTG). Using CTG minibuses, it provides free evening transport to hospitals to residents of Glasgow City.</p>

  <p>NHSGGC is working with each of its Local Authority partners to improve access to health and healthcare facilities. Developments are underway in Glasgow City, South Lanarkshire, Inverclyde and Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, West Dunbartonshire and East Dunbartonshire. Each of these projects differs depending on need within each area and the availability of capacity to provide transport within partner agencies.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are already significantly involved in transport issues as they endeavour to improve access to health facilities. Their representation on their local Regional Transport Partnerships provides a real opportunity to develop a coherent and strategic approach to transport in their area, and to develop innovative solutions to providing access to health facilities. This representation also offers the opportunity of developing a strong strategic relationship between the RTPs and NHS boards, but this needs to be based on a better understanding of their shared responsibility for the provision of transport to health services, and of the potential of the private and voluntary sectors in provision of that transport.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Prisoners undergo a health care assessment on admission to identify any health care needs. If a prisoner reports that they have a drug or alcohol problem this will be noted for further assessment by a doctor, within 24 hours of admission. Following consultation clinical support will be prescribed if this is appropriate. This may include medication for detoxification, stabilisation or maintenance.</p>

  <p>All prisoners serving over 31 days can access the Enhanced Addictions Casework Service. They are referred to this service via a core screening process within 72 hours of admission; a self-referral route is also available. This service comprises a Harm Reduction Session, comprehensive, specialist assessment and a range of one-to-one and group interventions. All admissions into prison attend the Harm Reduction Session within five days as part of the National Prisoner Induction Programme.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>When the 25 year contract for HM Prison Addiewell ends, ownership of the prison assets will transfer to the Scottish Prison Service. No cost will be incurred in respect of this ownership change at the end of the contract period.</p>

  <p>Consideration of the most appropriate method of operating the prison at Addiewell beyond the expiry of the 25 year contract will take place towards the end of the contract period. The outcome of this exercise, and any related procurement process, will determine the cost of continuing to operate the prison.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides information on procurement policy and general guidance for the Scottish public sector.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s guidance to education authorities on provision of school transport includes advice on contracting with bus providers.

  <p>It is for authorities themselves to negotiate with local transport providers on the terms and conditions of school transport contracts. Ministers cannot intervene in the detail of those negotiations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to pilot a new tendering system.</p>

  <p>The Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament require all bills on introduction to be accompanied by a Financial Memorandum which sets out the best estimates of the administrative, compliance and other costs to which the provisions of the bill would give rise, best estimates of the timescales over which such costs would be expected to arise, and an indication of the margins of uncertainty in such estimates. The Financial Memorandum must distinguish separately such costs as would fall upon (a) the Scottish Administration, (b) local authorities and (c) other bodies, individuals and businesses. These memoranda are freely available on the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s website.</p>

  <p>The only costs identified in the Financial Memorandum to the Scottish Qualifications Authority Bill relate to the remuneration of members of the Board of the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and the running of the Advisory Council. Information on the actual remuneration of board members is contained in the SQA&rsquo;s annual accounts for 2005-06 which are publicly available from the SQA by request and will shortly be posted on the SQA&rsquo;s website. By way of comparable information on the costs relating to the Advisory Council in 2005-06, these are estimated at &pound;12,000.</p>
