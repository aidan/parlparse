  <p>The new traffic management arrangements at the Forth Road Bridge came into effect on 26 May 2008, and major works are continuing at the Tay Road Bridge which restrict traffic flows southbound. It is therefore too early to make any realistic assessment of the traffic and other impacts of the abolition of tolls. We will work with the bridge boards and neighbouring local authorities to monitor the situation and to see how any impacts arising directly from the abolition of tolls might be addressed.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-06-18.S3W-13874.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0618.htm">

  <p>The principal greenhouse gas emitted by traffic using trunk roads and motorways is carbon dioxide. An assessment of the emissions of carbon dioxide from traffic predicted to use new trunk road projects is usually undertaken as part of the environmental impact assessment of the road proposals. These assessments are based on traffic modelling for the schemes which predict changes in traffic flows, and report emissions as a change in the quantity of carbon dioxide compared with the predicted conditions without the new or improved road in place. The findings of these assessments are presented in the environmental statement (ES) for each project which is a public document.</p>

  <p>Information on carbon dioxide emissions is not available for all projects in the motorway and trunk road programme. A number of smaller road improvement schemes do not significantly change traffic flows and have a negligible effect on emissions. Also, several schemes are still in preparation and have not yet reached the ES stage. A summary of information for the projects in the programme on which information is available from the relevant ES is presented in the following table.</p>

  <p>In the National Transport Strategy, there is a commitment to continue to promote cycling and walking as sustainable forms of transport especially for short journeys. This Scottish Government will honour that commitment through continued funding support for local authorities and other key stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently working in partnership with Cycling Scotland and other stakeholders in developing a Cycling Action Plan for Scotland which will aim to get more people cycling more often. The action plan will be published by March 2009.</p>

  <p>Allocations for cycling projects from the sustainable and active budget line have been made for 2008-09 only. This year &pound;6.58 million will be allocated to cycling projects. In addition, &pound;9 million will be awarded to local authorities for cycling, walking and safer streets projects. It is up to local authorities to spend accordingly on local priorities.</p>

  <p>Direct funding as part of the trunk road network cycling policy and developing the National Cycle Network within trunk road corridors is around &pound;2 million this year. Also, cycling infrastructure forms an integral part of many road improvements which is not separately costed. Also, funding for the general refurbishment on 25x class 158 trains based at Inverness has been made available and will include cycle storage for on board carriage.</p>

  <p>Within the sustainable active travel budget, up to &pound;15 million will be available to local authorities over the spending review period for the smarter choices smarter places project. Participating local authorities will use this funding to implement intense activity on sustainable travel and related physical activity interventions, including walking and cycling.</p>

  <p>The national physical activity strategy will invest a further &pound;12 million over the next three years for physical activity initiatives in schools, workplaces, homes and across communities. This will include projects that promote cycling.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the number of involved successes that Scottish Development International (SDI) has reported in each of the last five years. Involved successes are those inward investment projects that SDI has played a significant role in attracting to Scotland. As companies are not required to notify SDI when investing in Scotland, it is not possible to identify all projects.</p>

  <p>*The value of each project is not available as, unless they receive public funding, companies are not obliged to release details of their investment.</p>

  <p>**High value jobs are jobs with salaries at least 20% above the Scottish average and/or those in research, design and development.</p>

  <p>Table 2 shows data from Ernst &amp; Young&rsquo;s European Investment Monitor (EIM), which tracks cross-border investment projects and trends throughout Europe. Although the EIM is the most comprehensive source of this information, it cannot capture every project. Note that the EIM data includes both involved and non-involved successes but excludes intra-UK movement and certain categories of investment project, such as extraction activities, for example. SDI records in its figures projects that come to Scotland from other parts of the UK but excludes non-involved successes.</p>

  <p>At present, there are no official estimates of GDP at market prices for Scotland. However, it is possible to produce an approximate measure by calculating the difference between Gross Value Added and GDP for the UK and applying the ratio to the published Gross Value Added estimates for Scotland.

  <p>The strategy session heard detailed evidence on matters related to concerns about health with Dr W Bailey speaking for the applicants and Professors DL Henshaw and MJ O&rsquo;Carroll giving evidence for the objectors, Stirling Before Pylons. Mrs C Paterson, a member of Stirling Before Pylons and a lay member of the Stakeholder Advisory Group on Electric and Magnetic Fields (SAGE) also gave evidence on health for the objectors.</p>

  <p>Three reports concerning health and electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) were published during the course of the inquiry: the SAGE report, the BioInitiative report, and a cross-party report in Childhood Leukaemia and Extremely Low Frequency EMFs. Parties were given the opportunity to make written submissions on these reports.</p>

  <p>Compliance by local authorities with the European Convention on Human Rights is a matter for authorities themselves as independent corporate bodies. The European Convention on Human Rights was incorporated into domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998.

  <p>Under the terms of the ferry contracts between Scottish ministers and CalMac Ferries Ltd and NorthLink Ferries Ltd, the Scottish Government is required to pay additional grant by way of fuel supplement to cover any increase in fuel cost above the agreed levels set out in the contracts. Fuel prices have more than doubled since the contracts were first agreed and additional grant being paid to the ferry operators reflects this significant increase.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with the ferry companies to consider a range of measures to reduce fuel costs without affecting services or increasing fares.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold information about the extent to which receipts from right-to-buy sales have contributed to debt repayment for the entirety of the period. Prior to 1996, there were no constraints on the use of such receipts. Between 1996 and 2004, local authorities were required to set aside a proportion of receipts for repayment of debt, 25% in 1996, rising to 75% in 1997. From 2004 onward, local authorities have had complete discretion over use of receipts. Information on the extent to which receipts have been used for other purposes is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>A key feature in the non-profit distributing model is the lack of equity capital as it has a 100% debt funded structure. This means that the returns to the private sector are capped and that any surpluses generated are retained and used for the benefit of the public interest.</p>

  <p>Of the seven school building projects which we have signed off since May 2007, two were procured using the non-profit distributing model (Falkirk and Aberdeen City), our preferred method of procurement if private capital at risk is deployed.

  <p>Railway safety is a matter which is reserved to the UK Government.</p>

  <p>There is no significant difference in the safety of either a passenger or freight railway as both come under the same safety approvals process and both modes run on a shared infrastructure throughout the vast majority of the network.</p>

  <p>There are a few lines which are designated freight only and whilst the level of safety will be similar to the rest of the network, there may be some variance on technical specification. This variance reflects the different operational requirements required on a freight only line. For example passenger routes are designed to accommodate a higher density of traffic and higher speeds than a freight only line where there is usually a lesser requirement for either traffic density or speed.</p>

  <p>Similarly passenger trains and freight trains have similar standards of safety but are built to the most appropriate technical standards that reflect their operational requirements.

  <p>The Scottish Government has substantially increased the funding available for microgeneration and community renewables, allowing us to direct more funding towards projects using a wide range of technologies, including biomass. For the first time, businesses will now be eligible for interest free loans to install microgeneration, which includes biomass.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish rural development programme offers a number of options that provide support towards the purchase and installation of equipment to enable the development of small scale renewable energy capacity, including biomass.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering future support for biomass projects outwith these categories, and will take into account the potential to increase support for biomass under the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) as well as the progress made by projects supported under the Scottish Biomass Support Scheme.</p>

  <p>Yes. The cost of changing the ICT systems were estimated to be at least &pound;1 million. The decision which was taken to change the means-test arrangements for all students (not simply new students) was based on a range of factors. It was primarily taken on the basis of the impact two separate regimes would have on students and their parents, as well factors such as the operational and financial issues and risk in running two separate systems.</p>
