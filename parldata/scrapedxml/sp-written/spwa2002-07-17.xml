  <p>Police authorities and joint police boards, in consultation with chief constables, set budgets for individual forces. It is then a matter for chief constables to determine how they use the funds made available to them in this way to meet local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>In addition, Drug and Alcohol Action Teams, of which police forces are members, may bid for resources from national communications budgets to support local campaigns. For example, a total of &#163;1.5 million is available for the Executive's anti-binge drinking campaign &quot;How much is too much?&quot; and &#163;6.3 million, in total over three years, for the Executive's drugs communications strategy &quot;Know the Score&quot;. In 2001, the Executive provided &#163;150,000 to support communications aspects of the police Safer Scotland drugs campaign, also called &quot;Know the Score&quot;.</p>

  <p>The ScotXed (Scottish Exchange of Educational Data) project is a partnership of the Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED) with local authorities, schools, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), HM Inspectorate of Education and Learning and Teaching Scotland to promote the electronic exchange of educational information to common standards. The project will provide better quality information and link-ups between education partners in Scotland and will encourage the good use of management information by schools and education authorities.</p>

  <p>Each ScotXed partner will have access to different levels of information. Schools and the local authority will have access to all information which they require to carry out their administrative and management functions. The SQA will have access to limited personalised information required to carry out the functions associated with administering the examination process. SEED will have access to the information collected through ScotXed for its statistical surveys.</p>

The organisations represented on the advisory panel are the Food Standards Agency Scotland, the National Farmers Union of Scotland, Quality Meat Scotland, the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers, the Scottish Consumer Council, Scottish Enterprise, Scottish Environment LINK and the Scottish Food Qualifications and Certification board. The organisations were chosen following internal discussion and consultation with various external stakeholders. The organisations were chosen to represent a broad range of producer and consumer interests rather than to represent particular modes of production. The Executive recognises the importance of organic food and organic food production and the advisory panel will cover these interests. Organic food and farming will be one aspect of food production addressed in the survey.</p>
