  <p>Reducing the risk of Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) is very important for the well-being of patients and staff, and is one of NHS Scotland&#39;s national priorities.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (now NHS Quality Improvement Scotland) published standards on HAI Infection Control in December 2001. Members of the public were involved in agreeing the standards. NHS boards&#39; performance against the standards has been reviewed by NHSQIS teams which included representatives of the public; reports were published in January 2003.</p>

  <p>The HAI Task Force, chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, is undertaking a programme of work to support the NHS in tackling HAI more effectively; for example, the task force has published for consultation an NHS Scotland Code of Practice on Infection Control and a <em>National Cleaning Services Specification.</em> The consultation process invites suggestions for enhanced public involvement in monitoring compliance with the code of practice and the <em>National Cleaning Services Specification</em>.</p>

  <p>A national mandatory hospital infection surveillance system was introduced in 2001 to monitor MRSA blood infections. Since then, monitoring has been extended to include surgical site infections, with particular reference to neurosurgery and orthopaedics. The results of the MRSA monitoring work are analysed by the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) and are published quarterly.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland has issued standards on Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Infection Control and on Cleaning Services for NHSScotland. Audit Scotland has also undertaken work on the performance of NHS cleaning services. Reviews of performance against these standards have been undertaken, and the results published - most recently in January 2003. A further round of reviews will be undertaken by NHSQIS and reports published, in 2004.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-24583 on 28 March 2002, I undertook to continue to report quarterly on the numbers of letters received by ministers and our performance in answering them.</p>

  <p>Previous figures included information on invitations which, by their nature, may not always require to be considered in the same time scale as other items of correspondence. With that in mind and to give a clearer picture of the Executive&#39;s performance in dealing with letters to ministers, I have decided that invitations will no longer be counted in the total, however, monitoring and tracking of replies to invitations continues. This is therefore the first quarter in which I am reporting performance on letters only and not invitations.</p>

  <p>In the quarter April to June 2003, 1,994 letters were received for ministerial reply, of which 74% received a reply within 17 working days and 90% received a reply within 25 working days. In the same period ministers received 561 invitations.</p>

  <p>A short-life working group was set up in December 2002 by the Executive following the publication of <em>Working for Health - the Workforce Development Action Plan</em> . The outcome from this group&#39;s work was a mapping exercise of careers, recruitment and retention across all staff groups and the development of an additional support team called Careers for Health which is currently being established within the department.</p>

  <p>Currently, the responsibility for reviewing advertising and recruitment of staff in the NHS, having regard to any relevant EU directives, is addressed by our professional human resource colleagues in NHS boards. However, the Careers for Health team will consider undertaking as part of its first year projects a review of advertising and recruitment of staff in the NHS, having regard to any relevant EU directives, to establish what benefits there could be from the co-ordination of this activity on a national basis.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many safety camera sites in the Scottish Borders comply with the conditions of the safety camera scheme; whether the conditions of the scheme are mandatory, and what variation of these conditions it will make so that speed cameras can be sited on the entry to, and egress from, Borders towns and villages where local people indicate that this would resolve their concerns over speeding by through traffic.</p>

  <p>The rules of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme require safety camera partnerships to identify the areas where cameras are to be located by identifying road casualty clusters and then surveying these sites to investigate if the problem is related to speed. The programme requires that the majority of sites conform to statistical criteria on accidents although the rules do permit limited flexibility. In principle, that flexibility could allow a camera to be erected where it would not be otherwise justified by the number of accidents, but that should only be after other road calming options have been considered. The overarching aim of the programme is to reduce road casualties and that is why it is so closely tied to those sites with the greatest history of speed-related accidents.</p>

  <p>There are currently 33 fixed and 18 mobile safety camera partnership sites within the Scottish Borders Council area. The mobile sites all conform to the criteria for the programme. The fixed cameras were all established prior to the programme being launched and not all of these meet the standard criteria. However, they have been retained within the programme on the basis of the permitted partnership flexibility.</p>

  <p>The agreement <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> does not prescribe levels of staffing. Within the framework provided by the agreement, it is for local authorities to decide what levels of staffing best suits their local needs.</p>

  <p>This programme is funded by the New Opportunities Fund, one of the national lottery distribution bodies, and led by Forward Scotland. Given that the programme is funded by the national lottery, it is not appropriate for the Scottish Executive to comment about detailed issues on eligibility for funding.</p>

  <p>As Transforming Waste Scotland is a national lottery programme, funded by the New Opportunities Fund, it is for the New Opportunities Fund and their agents to consider what guidelines and criteria should be provided to applicants.</p>
