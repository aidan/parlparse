  <p>Phase One of the tolled bridges review included an examination of the impact of the then existing tolling structures, and the way in which potential changes to tolls could help achieve the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s environmental and economic objectives of reducing pollution and congestion. Phase Two included an examination of the broader issues relating to the management, operation and maintenance of the tolled bridges. Ministers&rsquo; decisions to end tolling at both Skye and Erskine bridges followed the principles established in the review, and the outcomes of those examinations.</p>

  <p>This information requested is not available. Child poverty is tackled in a cross-cutting manner through investment across a range of portfolios. Information on expenditure under these programmes is not available at a ward area level and official information on levels of child poverty is taken from UK datasets which do not provide breakdowns at local authority level.</p>

  <p>Across Scotland as a whole, since 1996-97 we have lifted 130,000 children out of relative low income (370,000 to 240,000 &ndash; after housing costs) and nearly two thirds of children from absolute low income (from 370,000 to 130,000 after housing costs).</p>

  <p>The official source of low income data for Scotland is the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) dataset available from 1994-95. This is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The sample size of the FRS in Scotland is relatively small and can only be used to provide information for Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>A debtor eligible for the Debt Arrangement Scheme must apply for a debt payment programme through an approved money adviser.</p>

  <p>A lower than expected number of money advisers have become approved. In order to increase take up by debtors it will be necessary to first increase the number of approved advisers.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, the Executive reviewed the Debt Arrangement Scheme between December 2005 and February 2006. As a result of that review the Executive announced on 24 May 2005 that the Scheme would be amended to allow for a payment programme to include debt relief.</p>

  <p>This reform is expected to lead to an increase in the number of approved money advisers, and thereby enable more debtors to be included in the scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no powers to direct Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges of further and higher education. However, we issued guidance in May 2005 to advise that colleges should not place staff without an enhanced disclosure in a position of trust for school pupils or students under 18 or vulnerable adults. It is recommended best practice that all college staff should be actively encouraged to undergo voluntary standard or enhanced disclosure, and that this should be renewed every three years, reflecting the general practice of other public service bodies.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive is working collaboratively with Scotland&rsquo;s colleges and other partners to enhance systems of protection for those under 18. This work includes the production of a best practice guide; specialised staff development opportunities provided by the Scottish Further Education Unit; updated professional standards for college lecturers which refer explicitly to the protection and welfare of children, young people and vulnerable learners, and improving the disclosure system itself.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland and the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) are discussing the introduction of track access charges for freight operators using the Alloa-Kincardine section of the new rail line. Current charges are based on the network assessment at October 2001. The new route represents an addition to the network. The intention is that the charge set by ORR should reflect both the public benefits of freeing up capacity for passenger services and the private benefits in reduced costs to the energy supply chain. We anticipate that both public and private sectors will be financially better off once the new rail line is open and in use.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area and can be contacted for more information, if required.</p>

  <p>I wrote to Sir John Ward on 11 May confirming that Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s resource budget for 2006-07 will be &pound;550 million. A copy of this letter has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number. 39557).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that the policy that no financial support for starting up a business is provided through Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s Business Gateway to anyone over 30 could constitute discrimination on the basis of age.</p>

  <p>The business start-up grant for those aged 18 to 30 is only one form of financial assistance which can be accessed by individuals looking to set up in business. Business Gateway staff can advise on a range of financial support that may be available, for example in the form of grant, equity or loans.</p>

  <p>Funding has been provided to <strong></strong> sportscotland to support the implementation of the National and Regional Sports Facilities Strategy and the development of facilities through the Lottery supported Building for Sport (BfS) programme. Under the Facilities Strategy &pound;3 million has been allocated to each of the five indoor football facilities developments, which will include all-weather pitches. The BfS programme is a competitive programme and each application is assessed on its own merits against set criteria.

  <p>This information is not collected centrally. Only those voluntary organisations seeking charitable status have been required to register their establishment.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, voluntary organisations include unincorporated community and voluntary groups, registered charities, friendly societies and a growing number of social economy organisations. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations estimates there to be around 50,000 voluntary organisations in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of charities registered between 1999 and 2005 can be obtained from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs. The number of new organisations granted charitable status from April 2006 onwards will be available from the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR), recently established under the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and Communities Scotland encourage community action and engagement through a range of policies which benefit a range of community groups and individuals, including church and faith groups. In particular, the Scottish Executive Volunteering Strategy works to support groups that use volunteers in their work by dismantling barriers to volunteering and improving the volunteering experience. In practical terms, work to support community groups is taken forward by partners such as Volunteer Development Scotland, and the network of Volunteer Centres. In addition, the Minister for Communities has agreed to attend a conference in September which will promote the role that faith communities play in community regeneration.</p>
