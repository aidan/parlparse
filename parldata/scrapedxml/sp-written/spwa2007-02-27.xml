  <p>One of Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s (FCS) key responsibilities is to protect Scotland&rsquo;s trees, woods and forests. This is mainly administered through felling permissions, long-term forest plans and direct grant-aid for forest establishment and management through grant incentives such as the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme.</p>

  <p>Heritage trees within woodlands can be supported and protected as part of an FCS grant scheme or through regulatory permissions. Individual trees of particularly high amenity value can also be protected by Tree Preservation Orders which are issued by local planning authorities. There are also local initiatives supported by FCS, which promote the importance of high value heritage trees. For example, the FCS inventory of Scotland&rsquo;s heritage trees led to the publication <em>Heritage Trees of</em> <em>Scotland</em>, which features both the Fortingall Yew and the Meikleour Beech Hedge. The &quot;Perthshire Big Tree Country&quot; initiative - a &pound;1.8 million project delivered via Perth and Kinross Countryside Trust to which FCS has contributed around &pound;600,000 through the Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme &ndash; is helping to safeguard the future of heritage trees in Perthshire.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether Coproxamol will continue to be obtainable on prescription in Scotland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-02-27.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0227.htm#4">

  <p>Licensing of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.</p>

  <p>The agency has advised that Coproxamol is being phased out of the market gradually to give patients time to discuss their treatment with their doctor and change to a suitable alternative. Continued provision of Coproxamol through normal prescribing may continue until the cancellation of the licences at the end of 2007. Following cancellation of the licences there will be scope for the prescription of unlicensed Coproxamol. There is clear provision in legislation which gives the right to the prescriber to prescribe off-label or unlicensed medicines when this is judged to be in the best interests of the patient.</p>

  <p>So where there is a clear clinical need, it will still be possible to prescribe Coproxamol but in a way that is more targeted, with a stronger focus on the risk:benefit judgment for the particular patient, and involvement of the patient in the decision.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action is being taken to protect Ardoch Roman Fort.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-02-27.7.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80030" speakername="Patricia Ferguson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0227.htm#5">

  <p>The Ardoch Fort complex is currently being rescheduled to extend the protected area to the north and west in order to protect all Roman remains visible as crop marks on aerial photographs.</p>

  <p>Whilst on-going management of the site is the responsibility of the owner, the 1979 act does not impose any obligation on the owner of a monument to maintain it. Historic Scotland can and does offer grants to owners for works that benefit a monument. Recently, several grants have been given to support the better management of the site, and to allow it to be appreciated as a single entity.</p>

  <p>The current greatest single problem is a recurrence of rabbit infestation. Between August 2005 and March 2006, rabbit proof fencing was erected around the site, jointly funded by a Rural Stewardship Scheme application and a Historic Scotland grant. It is hoped that this barrier, combined with a program of night shooting, will reduce the number of rabbits in the fort in coming years. Historic Scotland officials continue to be closely involved in this case and visit the site regularly.</p>

  <p>An erosion survey of the fort is currently being undertaken. This will complement the erosion survey which took place in 1997, and provide information on the stability of the monument over a 10 year period.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have a good working relationship with their UK counterparts and will continue to engage constructively with them to maximise the benefits of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games for Scotland and to minimise the impact of any reduction in lottery funding for sport and the other good causes.</p>

  <p>We have already secured the agreement of the UK Government that Scotland&rsquo;s share of the &pound;340 million Lottery Sports Fund contribution towards the games funding package will be retained and spent in Scotland on Scotland&rsquo;s elite athletes.</p>
