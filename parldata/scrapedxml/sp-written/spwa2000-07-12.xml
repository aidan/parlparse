  <p>For this financial year we have allocated &pound;14.4 million to the National Museums of Scotland, which are mainly located in Edinburgh. Ministers have a statutory responsibility for these museums.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not provide direct financial support to other museums in Edinburgh or Glasgow, or in any other local authority area. Funding of these museums is the responsibility of those who own and operate them. However, local authority museums are funded from the Grant Aided Expenditure provided by the Executive. GAE for leisure and recreation in Glasgow is &pound;45 million and Edinburgh is &pound;29.3 million.</p>

  <p>All our policies for schools are directed to ensuring that children benefit from education of the highest quality, and this objective is as important in rural areas as in other parts of Scotland. It is encouraging to note the report&#8217;s findings that 91% of parents were satisfied with the primary school attended by their child and 88% were satisfied in the case of secondary schools. Since the data were collected, we have achieved universal provision of pre-school education for four-year-olds and provision for three-year-olds in rural areas is growing rapidly.</p>

  <p>The annual costs to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, including overheads, in the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000, from authorising, overseeing and monitoring of radioactive discharges into the environment were:</p>

  <p>&pound;280,000 in respect of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority;</p>

  <p>&pound;61,000 in respect of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd;</p>

  <p>&pound;61,000 in respect of British Energy, and</p>

  <p>&pound;31,000 in respect of other operations of plants discharging significant quantities of radioactive matter into the environment.</p>

  <p>Following a comprehensive review of costs by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, a revised charging rate will be implemented on 1 September 2000. This is expected to achieve full cost recovery from April 2001.</p>

  <p>The programme of monitoring for radioactivity in the environment undertaken on behalf of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) includes the sampling and measurement of radioactivity in various environmental media and foodstuffs from locations throughout Scotland. A significant proportion of the monitoring programme relates to samples taken around nuclear sites. The strategy behind the sampling and measurement programme has the following objectives:</p>

  <p>the monitoring of radioactive isotopes which are significant in terms of the discharges authorised under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 from individual sites;</p>

  <p>the monitoring of radioactive isotopes which indicate plant performance at individual sites; and</p>

  <p>the monitoring of environmental media and foodstuffs which may represent a significant pathway to man.</p>

  <p>A further purpose of the monitoring programme is to act as an additional check for compliance with conditions in authorisations for the discharge of waste and to provide a baseline dataset from which to judge the importance of accidental releases of radioactivity, should they occur.</p>

  <p>The sample locations, frequency of measurements and the radioactive isotopes monitored are published annually by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and SEPA in the <i>Radioactivity in Food and the Environment</i> (RIFE) report. A copy of the most recent report (RIFE-4), for 1998, is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. no. 1985).</p>

  <p>Service provision is of key importance for rural communities. The Executive has recently asked the Scottish National Rural Partnership to bring together service providers to look at how services might be provided in innovative and imaginative ways in rural areas, as well as identifying ways of helping local communities to assess their realistic service needs and to work with providers to achieve these.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also commissioned an evaluation of the effectiveness of the rural transport fund which is due to report in October 2000. This will inform decisions on future support for rural transport in this autumn&#8217;s Scottish Spending Review. The Executive is working in close partnership with the UK Government to maintain the rural post office network. It welcomes the announcement made by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 28 June that the current size of that network will be maintained until 2006, except where it is impossible to find replacements for departing sub-postmasters.</p>

  <p>The eligibility criteria for student support are the same as for all other students studying full-time higher education.

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s scrutiny of transfer of council housing stock will be broadly in line with that which has been adopted for previous transfers of public sector houses, particularly Scottish Homes&#8217; stock. This will call for an assessment of each proposal to determine whether it represents value for money to the taxpayer and to assess the wider benefits of transfer for tenants and others.</p>

  <p>The best price reasonably obtained in the circumstances of the sale must be sought, and councils will therefore be required to commission an independent valuation of their stock. This will take the form of a tenanted market value, that is a valuation based on the assumption that the stock will remain available for letting to tenants with low incomes. The net present value of future rents and costs, based on this assumption, establishes a guide price against which a prospective purchaser&#8217;s offer can be judged. In addition, the department&#8217;s scrutiny will include a comparison of the costs to the taxpayer of councils retaining their stock against transferring it. This assessment will look at the viability of a transfer option and wider aspects such as the Housing Benefit consequences.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-07-12.S1W-8666.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0712.htm#8666">

  <p>The report on the proposed superquarry at Lingerbay raised a range of complex issues. My consideration of one issue in particular has been complicated by recent policy developments, in the light of which it has become necessary for me to seek further information before I can make a substantive decision on this planning application. I have come to the view that I cannot make a decision without clarifying the position, with the advice of Scottish Natural Heritage and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, as to whether or not any part of the proposed development area should be proposed as a Special Area of Conservation under the EC Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).</p>

  <p>A planning application by Redland Aggregates Limited (now Redland Lafarge) was submitted to the then Western Isles Island Council on 25 March 1991. On 24 June 1993, the Islands Council informed the then Secretary of State that they were minded to grant planning permission and, on 6 January 1994, a Direction, calling in the application for the Secretary of State&#8217;s determination, was issued. A public local inquiry was conducted by the former Chief Reporter between 11 October 1994 and 6 June 1995. The Reporter submitted her report and recommendations to the Secretary of State on 29 April 1999.</p>

  <p>The report comprises four volumes totalling about 800 pages and is extremely complicated. It has therefore been necessary for my officials to consider it in some detail. They must ensure that, when I come to take a decision, I am properly informed on all the relevant matters. Only then can I reach a proper decision.</p>

  <p>Planning decisions must be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Ministers are, therefore, required by law to consider the statutory development plan for an area and all material considerations. An important material consideration is the nature conservation interest in the site. In Part 1 of her report, the Reporter recognised that there were botanical interests of national and international importance on the site, but she was unclear on whether the site merited designation as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).</p>

  <p>The requirement to designate SACs derives from the EC Habitats Directive. This establishes a system for the selection of sites containing certain species and habitats. This involves national Governments proposing sites to the European Commission as candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs).</p>

  <p>Following the proposal of cSACs to the European Commission by member states, the Commission conducts a &quot;moderation process&quot; to determine which sites are to be designated as SACs. The first stage of this process took place between September and November 1999. The Commission decided that, in common with other member states, the UK had proposed an insufficient number and range of sites as cSACs. The UK was therefore invited to propose further cSACs. Moreover, the alleged insufficiency of the UK&#8217;s list of cSACs has, since January 2000, been the subject of reference by the Commission to the European Court of Justice. The Commission intends to consider proposals for further sites at a second moderation seminar in early 2001. To meet its international obligations in relation to nature conservation, the UK Government therefore intends to propose additional cSACs.</p>

  <p>In the light of the European Commission&#8217;s judgment that the UK had proposed insufficient cSACs, I commissioned scientific advice from Scottish Natural Heritage and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee about what further sites should be selected. I published, on 14 June, a list of sites which had been recommended to me as cSACs (<i>Official Report</i>,<i> </i>14 June 2000,<i> </i>S1W-7913)<i>.</i> That list did not include any site within the Lingerbay application area.</p>

  <p>There is, however, a question arising from evidence in the report of the public local inquiry, which has not been resolved by the advice referred to above, about whether part of the application area may merit selection as a SAC. The report indicates that the site at Lingerbay hosts several natural habitat types for which the EC Habitats Directive requires the selection of cSACs and for which the UK has been found by the Commission to have proposed too few sites. These include North Atlantic wet heaths (whose conservation interest is increased by the presence of internationally important bryophyte communities noted in the report), European dry heaths, Alpine and boreal heaths, siliceous Alpine and boreal grasslands, and blanket bog.</p>

  <p>The evidence in the report raises the question of whether the area merits selection as a cSAC, but does not provide sufficient material which would allow me conclusively to reach a view on that without expert advice. As the nature conservation status of the site is a material consideration in determining the planning application, I need to be clear about that matter. To take a decision on the planning application, taking into account, among other factors, partial or out of date information on the site&#8217;s status for nature conservation purposes would, I believe, be wrong. I am aware that further delay in reaching a substantive decision on this planning application will cause considerable disappointment among both proponents of the proposal and objectors.</p>

  <p>A decision as to whether or not to propose an area as a cSAC must be properly informed. The Scottish Executive relies on Scottish Natural Heritage and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee for advice on nature conservation. I have therefore instructed SNH and JNCC to consider whether the site at Lingerbay should be proposed to the European Commission as a cSAC. I have asked SNH and JNCC to let me have their views as quickly as is consistent with the integrity of the detailed consideration they will now need to undertake.</p>

  <p>I have asked my officials to write to the parties to the original inquiry to inform them that this is being done. We will also inform them when we receive the scientific advice which I am commissioning. One issue which may, of course, fall to be considered when we have this advice is whether or not the inquiry should be re-opened. That issue, and related issues about the remit of any such re-opened inquiry and how best to expedite its proceedings will, of course, have to be determined by reference to the advice received from SNH and JNCC and the circumstances obtaining at that time. However, should it prove necessary to re-open the inquiry we would take care to ensure that the remit of the re-opened inquiry is no wider than is necessary to enable me to reach a properly informed decision. There would be no question of simply rehearsing all of the matters which the Reporter has already carefully considered.</p>

  <p>In view of the quasi-judicial function which I must exercise in reaching a final decision on this application, I cannot go further in this response lest this be interpreted as prejudicing my consideration of the case. I do, however, give a commitment that, subject to ensuring that I have all the necessary information, and that I in no way compromise the fundamental planning system principles of openness, fairness and impartiality, the determination of this application will be expedited as quickly as possible following receipt of the scientific advice I am commissioning.</p>

  <p>The circumstances of this case are by any standards exceptional. However, I am determined to ensure that we learn from the process which has been followed on this application and that we adapt our procedures to reduce the possibility of substantial delays in the future.</p>

  <p>*Destinations unknown.</p>

  <p>To date the Executive has offered a range of New Deal jobs; i.e. administration, secretarial, support, security and craft, in a range of locations; i.e. Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Stirling, Peterhead and Dumfries. It is in regular contact with the Employment Service (ES) in an effort to attract as many applicants as possible for its New Deal positions. The Executive has given a general commitment to ES to interview <i>all</i> New Deal applicants that they consider suitable for its places and it has also informed ES that it is willing to consider applicants from all elements of the New Deal. It currently has employees in the 18-24, 25+ and Lone Parent elements of the programme.</p>

  <p>Whilst I recognise the Executive&#8217;s efforts to date, I am keen to see an increase in the number of New Deal staff employed in this important programme. I have, therefore, asked officials to consider how the Executive might increase further its participation. To that end, officials are in discussion with ES about further candidates for the Executive&#8217;s places in Edinburgh and Glasgow. It will also seek to identify opportunities in other locations where the Executive has a presence.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is responsible for the protection of the quality of the River Clyde. It routinely monitors chemical, biological and hydrological parameters to gauge the health of various sectors of the river. Water authorities and industry require consents from SEPA, which are regularly reviewed, under the Control of Pollution Act 1974, to discharge effluent to the water environment. SEPA uses the information gained through its monitoring programme to set appropriate conditions for these consents. Enforcement action is taken where discharges breach these consents.</p>

  <p>SEPA may also take enforcement action through various regulations to ensure that storage facilities, farming practices and waste disposal are properly controlled.</p>

  <p>Services such as a 24-hour hotline to report pollution incidents and the production of guidance leaflets and other publicly available materials are used to encourage better practice to protect the environment. In particular, SEPA West Region has recently produced an information pack, which includes a CD ROM, to provide information about the West of Scotland&#8217;s water environment. A copy of this pack has been placed in the SPICe (Bib. no. 6765).</p>

  <p>SEPA published a report, <i>Improving Scotland&#8217;s Water Environment</i> outlining measures undertaken to minimise water pollution, and the targets towards which it is working. A copy is available in SPICe (Bib. no. 2964).</p>

  <p>The West of Scotland Water Authority also plays an important role in maintaining and improving the quality of the water in the river. The authority discharges effluent into the river and its tributaries from several water supply and wastewater treatment works along its banks and from storm-water overflows from the sewerage network. The existing treatment works are operated so as to optimise the quality of the effluent discharged and minimise their impact on the river. The authority has invested, and will continue to invest, very significant sums in the modernisation and replacement of works along the riverbank.</p>

  <p>On the freshwater section of the Clyde notable works are:</p>

  <p>the provision of tertiary treatment to the wastewater treatment works at Daldowie to ensure that the quality of effluent discharged into the river is improved, and</p>

  <p>the improvement of storm-water overflows known to operate in an unsatisfactory manner so as to reduce the number and duration of discharges of storm-water into the adjacent watercourse so that impact of these water courses on the river will be minimised.</p>

  <p>Information about the estuarial and coastal sections of the Clyde may be found in the information pack referred to above.</p>

  <p>The New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 requires a utility company proposing to execute road works to give advance notice of the road works to the relevant road authority. In practice, this is done by the utility company giving notice to the Scottish Road Works Register. The road authority may then impose requirements as to the provision of information and other procedural steps necessary for the purpose of co-ordinating the proposed works with other works of any description proposed to be executed in the road.</p>

  <p>Failure to comply with these duties is an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 (&pound;1,000) on the standard scale.</p>

  <p>The Executive is considering the recommendations of the report <i>The Quality of Services in Rural Scotland</i> published on 26 June which included the provision of benchmarking. The Executive is committed to ensuring that rural communities are able to access a wide range of services. That is why I recently tasked the Scottish National Rural Partnership to bring together service providers to look at how services might be provided in innovative and imaginative ways in rural areas, as well as identifying ways of helping local communities to identify their realistic service needs and to work with providers to achieve these. I look forward to receiving the group&#8217;s recommendations at the end of November.</p>

  <p>There is no national requirement for uniforms to be worn. That is a matter for headteachers, usually in negotiation with parents, parent representative bodies and pupils. However, the Executive believes that the positive effects of school uniform are such that it should be encouraged wherever possible by schools and authorities.</p>

  <p>As the school uniform system operates in state schools in Scotland it is difficult to envisage any circumstances where it might infringe any rights under the ECHR.</p>
