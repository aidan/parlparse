  <p>The Executive's policy is to implement EU legislation in a way which minimises the burdens on Scottish agriculture consistent with the requirements of proper financial control and compliance with the law. As to interpretations by commercial consultants, the Executive has no specific locus on this issue or information on such interpretations.</p>

  <p>The responsibility to commission non-emergency ambulance transport lies with medical practitioners, practicing midwives or dentists who determine when there is a clinical need for ambulance transport. The Scottish Ambulance Service Non-Emergency Service will endeavour to meet all such requests.</p>

  <p>The NHS boards received guidance on patients' entitlement to financial help in meeting reasonable travelling and related costs incurred in attending hospitals and clinics on 21 August 1996 in Management Executive Letter (1996) 70. The boards are known to use a number of alternative transport options such as taxis, hospitals' own car services and voluntary organisations to provide other means of transport for their patients where this is appropriate. The cost of these services will vary across the country as some may be subsidised. Information on the actual costs incurred by NHS boards is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Annual estimates of the cash value of GDP for Scotland and other regions of the UK are produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as part of Regional Accounts. It is these estimates which would be directly affected by any consumption changes. These are based on a different methodology from that used in the UK and Scottish quarterly GDP indices. Chainlinking methodology is only applicable to estimating volume growth, and as Regional Accounts are produced in current price values, the methodology is not relevant.</p>

  <p>Police officers receive training throughout their careers. The overall cost of such training will vary from officer to officer depending on their career path. Officers receive training at the Scottish Police College, within their own force and, on occasion, at facilities outside Scotland. While comprehensive information on the costs of such training is not held centrally, an exercise undertaken by the Scottish Police College in 2002-03 gave an estimate of the costs to the college of delivering probationer training to be around &pound;4,250 per probationer.</p>

  <p>Population levels are the result of birth rates, death rates and patterns of migration. Birth rates reflect decisions which are for individuals rather than government. Where people do decide to have children the Scottish Executive is providing support through the increased resources being made available for childcare and school education, while the UK Government also has a range of measures to help families with children through the tax and benefit system. As a result of better health care, many more people now survive into adulthood and later life. Managed migration can play an important role in ensuring that we have a vibrant and diverse population, which aids economic growth. The initiative on fresh talent promotes such migration.</p>

  <p>Section 22 of the National Assistance Act 1948 requires local authorities to set the fees for local authority care home places at an amount equivalent to the full cost to the authority of providing them. Under section 26 of that act, payments for independent sector care home places are simply the contract rates agreed between the local authority and the provider. The Executive has no plans to amend this legislation.</p>

  <p>All 32 local authorities in Scotland operate care homes. In addition, they place clients in care homes operated by independent sector providers.</p>

  <p>At September 2003, local authorities in Scotland provided 272 care homes. This amounts to 17 per cent of the 1,576 care homes; and 16 per cent of the 43,125 care home places. However, local authorities account for around 38% of short-stay and respite care admissions to care homes.

  <p>The remit of the fundamental look at social work which I intend to call &quot;21st Century Social Work&quot;, is to define the role for social work and social workers for the 21st century; to explore how to improve quality assurance mechanisms and embed a culture of continuous improvement, strengthen the leadership and management of the profession to ensure more consistently effective delivery of services, to improve the capacity and the confidence of the professionals who deliver services, to deliver services in the diverse landscape of modern service provision, and to consider whether the legislative framework, including the Social work (Scotland) Act 1968, remains fit for purpose. The role of the Chief Social Work Officer will be specifically addressed in this context.</p>

  <p>The scope will cover the full range of client groups including children, young people and families, vulnerable adults and offenders. It will focus primarily on qualified social workers, but will also include the services provided by social care workers and the work will have implications for our partner agencies including health, education and the police.</p>

  <p>21st century social work will be led by an independent group with the right blend of experience, knowledge and skills. The members of the group sit in a personal capacity, they do not represent any particular organisation or interest.</p>

  <p>The following individuals have agreed to serve on the group:</p>

  <p>Douglas Bulloch - Chair, Scottish Children's Reporter Administration</p>

  <p>Alan Campbell - Chief Executive, Aberdeenshire Council</p>

  <p>Stephen Ebbitt - Chief Executive, Glasgow Simon Community</p>

  <p>Alexis Jay - Director of Social Work, West Dunbartonshire Council, and President ADSW</p>

  <p>Anne-Marie Rafferty - Area Services Manager, East, Glasgow Social Work Department</p>

  <p>Deirdre Watson - Director, Who Cares? Scotland.</p>

  <p>The group will have a professional advisor - Carole Wilkinson, Chief Executive, Scottish Social Services Council.</p>

  <p>In addition, I expect a head teacher from an integrated community school, a senior academic and a leading representative from the private sector to join the group.</p>

  <p>The group will be chaired by William Roe, who has extensive experience of social policy in Scotland and more widely and on strategic change and innovation in major public service organisations in Scotland, the UK and abroad.</p>

  <p>21st Century Social Work is an important opportunity for all concerned to have their say in shaping future social work services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Student Awards Agency for Scotland can pay tuition fees on behalf of higher education students for repeated or extended study where there are medical or strong compassionate reasons such as the death or serious illness of a close relative.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) allocates funding for teaching to higher education institutions in the form of a block grant. Allocations are based on the number of funded places in each of 13 funding subject groups and the unit resource cost attributed to each group. Institutions are not, however, required to allocate the funding internally using the same formula. The proportion of the cost of providing a particular HND course which is attributable to SHEFC funding will, therefore, depend partly upon decisions made by individual institutions.</p>

  <p>From academic year 2004-05 the fact that a student has previously taken up a place on a SHEFC funded course will be disregarded by SAAS when assessing a student's eligibility for tuition fee support.</p>
