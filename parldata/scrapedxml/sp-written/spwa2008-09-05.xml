  <p>The Scottish Government has high ambitions for Scotland which show our confidence in the potential of all of Scotland&rsquo;s people, articulated across our strategic frameworks, including Curriculum for Excellence and Skills for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Curriculum for Excellence aims to provide a coherent, more flexible and enriched curriculum from three to 18 and will play a key role in preparing our young people to take their place in a modern society and economy. It provides a framework for all young people in Scotland to gain the knowledge and skills for learning, life and work that they need to flourish.</p>

  <p>This supports the aims of <em>Skills for Scotland</em>, our lifelong skills strategy, which sets out a new agenda for skills and learning in Scotland and builds on the inclusive approach to lifelong learning that was first set out in the strategy document, Life through Learning; Learning through Life, published on 2003. Skills for Scotland seeks to build a learning system that works for people of all ages and all walks of life, so that they can access the education and training opportunities that they need to improve their skills and achieve their full potential.</p>

  <p>Both strategic frameworks will contribute to success demonstrated against the National Outcomes and Performance Indicators, where we outline our ambition for a Scotland in which:</p>

  <p>We are better educated, more skilled and more successful, renowned for our research and innovation.</p>

  <p>Our young people are successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens.</p>

  <p>Our children have the best start in life and are ready to succeed.</p>

  <p>We live longer, healthier lives.</p>

  <p>We have tackled the significant inequalities in Scottish society.</p>

  <p>We recognise that education is a process that takes place throughout people&rsquo;s lives. Our policies to support peoples&rsquo; engagement with education &ndash; at any stage - do not exist in isolation but act as a continuum for the development of Scotland&rsquo;s people.</p>

  <p>The national response time target for category A calls (life threatening) across mainland Scotland is that, by March 2009, 75% of all incidents should be reached within eight minutes.</p>

  <p>The national response time target for category B calls (serious but not life threatening) across mainland Scotland is that, by March 2009, 95% of all incidents should be reached within 14, 19 or 21 minutes depending on population density. For the locations requested, the target is 21 minutes.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ambulance Service clinicians are expected to carry out a thorough assessment of the circumstances for every individual patient. This assessment takes into account the clinical condition of the patient but also includes consideration of a number of other factors such as the social and family situation, potential risks to the patient, the home environment and the geographic location of the patient.</p>

  <p>It is part of the crew&rsquo;s role to outline and make as clear as possible to the patient the implications of any decision made. For example, if a patient refuses to travel to hospital then the crew will very clearly outline the risks that this poses to the patient and make sure that he or she understands the implications of these decisions.</p>

  <p>No. We re-issued <em>Additional Guidance on Local Authority Proposals for the School Estate, including School Closures</em> on 11 October 2007. A copy is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43920). The primary purpose of the guidance is to set out the roles and responsibilities of those involved in considering proposals that may lead to changes in the school estate including the closure of schools. The guidance already makes clear our expectation that, in formulating such proposals, authorities should indeed take account of all factors, in each case.</p>

  <p>NHS Forth Valley have advised that the stolen laptop contained names, addresses and audiology details of 89 patients and that the details were held on the laptop for home visit purposes only. The laptop was kept in a locked cupboard behind locked doors and was double password-protected, though not encrypted.</p>

  <p>NHS Forth Valley worked closely with Central Scotland Police and undertook a full internal investigation however the laptop has not been recovered. The board has undertaken an information governance overview of patient details to ensure controls are in place and storage, as far as possible, is on the network service.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government are developing an updated mobile data protection standard in conjunction with all NHS boards to improve the security of electronic patient information. When implemented, it will provide increased confidence of the secure storage of patient information including that on USB memory sticks and laptops. Also being developed are NHS Scotland standards for the encryption of mobile devices, including laptops.</p>

  <p>Following an initial scoping seminar held in Edinburgh, the Scottish Government has held four regional consultation seminars in Paisley, Galashiels, Fort William and Aberdeen. A Scottish Government online consultation exercise has been launched and will run until 8 September 2008. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations is running a parallel consultation exercise on its website over the same period, which will complement the Scottish Government process.</p>

  <p>A report on the findings of the consultation will form the basis of a draft order which will be debated in the Parliament early in 2009.</p>

  <p>The SIGN Guidelines on both adult and childhood epilepsy highlight the requirement for appropriate advice and information on epilepsy to be made available to people with epilepsy and their carers. NHS boards are expected to implement the guidelines through local protocols.</p>

  <p>In conjunction with Epilepsy Scotland, the Scottish Government has encouraged the development of epilepsy Managed Clinical Networks (MCNs), and the provision of information for patients and carers is one of the key functions of the MCNs. The Scottish Paediatric Epilepsy Network and the Epilepsy Networks in the West of Scotland and Tayside and the North of Scotland have developed protocols and made information available for people with epilepsy which includes advice on emergencies.</p>

  <p>From financial year 2006-07, the Scottish Government has provided Epilepsy Scotland with a grant of &pound;15,000 a year for three years, to support the provision of a range of literature to inform and educate people with epilepsy, which includes advice for emergencies where appropriate.

  <p>Scottish ministers do have powers to instigate an inquiry where particular events have caused public concern. However, the Lord Advocate has asked the Area Procurator Fiscal for Argyll and Clyde to make urgent enquires into the circumstances of the deaths at the Vale of Leven and report his findings to Crown Counsel. It will then be a matter for Crown Counsel to consider what further action is required in light of the circumstances which have emerged. Any decision on whether a public inquiry should take place, and the nature of any such inquiry, can only properly be reached once the Procurator Fiscal has had the opportunity to complete his enquiries and report to Crown Counsel.</p>

  <p>The review report was referred to the Lord Advocate because she is responsible for the investigation of deaths in Scotland. The Procurator Fiscal has a duty, on behalf of the Lord Advocate, to investigate all sudden, suspicious, accidental, unexplained and unexpected deaths, as well as deaths which give rise to serious public concern.</p>

  <p>The majority of these deaths were not reported to the Procurator Fiscal at the time but when the full extent of the situation at the Vale of Leven Hospital became known, I ordered a review. In the circumstances, it was appropriate for the Procurator Fiscal to await the outcome of the independent review before considering what further action was necessary. However, the number of deaths at the Vale of Leven hospital has clearly given cause for concern within the community and it is therefore appropriate for the area Procurator Fiscal to conduct an independent inquiry into the circumstances of those deaths in the first instance.</p>

  <p>If a medical practitioner knows the cause of death he/she can complete a death certificate. If not, the case should be discussed with the Procurator Fiscal who may decide there is enough information available to sanction the completion of a death certificate, or alternatively instruct further enquiry, which may include a postmortem. The NHS undertakes hospital postmortems with proper authorisation from the deceased person&rsquo;s relatives, if a clinician wishes to learn more about the cause(s) of death. Postmortems very often reveal that a patient has more than one medical condition, some of which may not have been evident in life. Equally, the cause of death is still on occasion unknown, even following a postmortem. There is no legal requirement for a postmortem in cases of Clostridium difficile, and this condition is diagnosed by microbiological tests on stool samples in life.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). COPFS has issued guidance to doctors on the categories of death that must be reported to the Procurator Fiscal.

  <p>We currently have no plans to change the length of time a Short Scottish secure tenancy (SSST) can be used before it converts into a full Scottish secure tenancy.</p>

  <p>We consider 12 months a reasonable period of time to establish whether there is an improvement in behaviour, and during which the landlord must provide support to enable the tenancy to convert to a full Scottish secure tenancy.</p>

  <p>If antisocial behaviour recurs after the 12 month period, social landlords can access the full range of powers at their disposal to address antisocial behaviour by any secure tenant. Other forms of SSST, for example the SSST for persons requiring housing support services, can be appropriate for new tenants who need support and these have no automatic conversion to a full Scottish secure tenancy.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has almost &pound;1.5 million of capital funds committed in 2008-09 for the Vale of Leven Hospital. This includes a general provision of &pound;1 million which will be used specifically to fund capital schemes aimed at strengthening the hospital&rsquo;s capacity to control the spread of hospital acquired infection. The remaining &pound;500,000 is earmarked for minor capital schemes of a more routine nature, which are carried out on a year-to-year basis.</p>

  <p>Beyond 2008-09, the capital plan includes provision for ongoing investment in minor schemes on a year to year basis. There are proposals for Alexandra Health Centre to be re-provided on the Vale of Leven campus in the next five years, and there is an expectation that a firm timescale for the project would emerge subject to forthcoming public consultation on the wider future of the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>

  <p>The provisional estimate of capital expenditure required in relation to Alexandra Health Centre re-provision is &pound;17 million but the NHS board have still to complete a detailed business case following public consultation which will consider the costs and delivery arrangements for the project.</p>

  <p>Standard subsistence rates are specified within NHS staff&rsquo;s terms and conditions. Employers do have discretion in certain circumstances to reimburse beyond these rates where there are genuine business reasons to do so, i.e. where a meal within the specified rate was not available. However, any general increase to subsistence rates would need to be discussed in partnership between health service trades unions and staff representative groups, NHS employers and UK health departments through the relevant negotiating machinery.</p>

  <p>Agenda for Change, the terms and conditions package which covers most non-medical staff, does allow NHS employers to negotiate and agree subsistence arrangements locally and in partnership where such arrangements are more appropriate to local operational circumstances. However, any NHS employer wishing to diverge from the rates agreed at UK level would need to be able to justify why introducing this element of inconsistency was appropriate.</p>

  <p>The estimated figure given in the reply to S3W-13235 is based on an analysis of the family resources survey data combined with information from various other sources. The estimate assumes that 40% of Scottish adults (1.54 million) live in families with gross annual income below &pound;16,000 and that approximately 40% of people in that group, approximately 600,000, are not exempt from prescription charges on age, medical or income grounds and therefore will benefit from the abolition of prescription charges.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not allocate funding for specific schools. Midlothian Council has statutory responsibility for the provision and maintenance of school buildings in its area. Questions regarding investment priorities for individual schools are for the council.</p>

  <p>The amount of support available to students varies depending on individual circumstances. To establish what support is available I refer the member to the information on student loan amounts available from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland for Scottish students ( <a href="http://www.saas.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.saas.gov.uk</a> ), Student Finance Direct for English students (www.studentfinancedirect.co.uk) and Student Finance Wales for Welsh students ( <a href="http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk" target="_blank">www.studentfinancewales.co.uk</a> ).</p>

  <p>Between 2003 and 2007, the following numbers of suicides were recorded for the City of Edinburgh and for Scotland (see table 1). Suicide numbers were higher in 2007 than in 2006, both in Edinburgh and in Scotland. However, numbers fluctuate from year to year, both locally and nationally, as can be seen from the following table.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>Suicide definition: Deaths caused by intentional self harm and events of undetermined intent.</p>

  <p>We encourage using a standardised mortality ratio (SMR) to compare and interpret local suicide rates (such as in Edinburgh) with the Scottish rate. The five-year SMR is more robust than yearly numbers.</p>

  <p>If the SMR is greater than 1.00 the suicide rate is greater than for Scotland. If the SMR is less than 1.00 then the suicide rate is less than for Scotland.</p>

  <p>This data was obtained from the Scottish Public Health Observatory website, and we also encourage using this site to access information on Scottish suicide numbers and national trends:</p>
