  <p>The change in the base area arrangements under the Arable Area Payments Scheme which will lead to the specialist cereal growers in the Scottish non-Less Favoured Area receiving an additional &pound;2.5 million was first announced on 26 August 1999. There were no further announcements until that made on 30 March 2000 when the assistance to specialist cereal growers was publicised along with the other measures.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the proposed Dairy Products (Hygiene) (Scotland) Regulations 2000 have recently been communicated to the European Commission for clearance in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 98/34/EC laying down procedures for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations. Since one aspect of the regulations goes beyond the scope of Directive 92/46/EEC, which these regulations implement, the European Commission has three months in which to respond.</p>

  <p>It will, therefore, be at least July before these regulations will be laid before the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the effect will be of physiotherapy contracts in Lothian being required to be with the NHS rather than with the private sector at the choice of general practitioners and how this proposal will affect waiting lists, waiting times and treatment lists.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-05-05.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0505.htm#5567">

  <p>Lothian Primary Care NHS Trust has undertaken a review of its physiotherapy services with a view to improving services to patients and bringing private physiotherapy contracts into the NHS. Completion of this process is likely to take some time as it is dependent on the recruitment of suitably trained physiotherapists. Consequently, a phased programme of change is being undertaken to ensure that patient waiting times are not compromised.</p>

  <p>By Thursday 4 May, a total of 88 responses had been received. A number of individuals and organisations have asked for further time to prepare their responses and accordingly I have decided to extend the deadline until 31 May to allow as many people as possible to contribute to the debate.</p>

  <p>I have been encouraged by the considerable thought and effort which has gone into the responses received thus far. It is clear that the public appointments system is an area of genuine interest to many people and they welcome to opportunity to make their views known.</p>

  <p>Public bodies play a vital part in the governance of Scotland and I would urge as many people as possible &#8211; including members of the Parliament &#8211; to submit their views on how we can modernise the public appointments system.</p>
