  <p>Data on training and education for refugees and asylum seekers is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, data is available on the number of people attending further education colleges on a part-time English as a Second or Other Language (ESOL) course or another part-time non-advanced course whose fee was waived under certain asylum seeker programmes. Table 1 shows the number of fees waived by local authority area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recently produced a research report called <em>Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Scotland: A Skills and Aspirations Audit</em> which aimed to audit the skills and aspirations of refugees and asylum seekers living in Scotland.

  <p>As part of the Public Health Institute of Scotland (PHIS) Needs Assessment Report on Audiology Services in Scotland research was conducted into services for people with tinnitus and balance disorders. The report recommended that: &quot;NHS Boards should establish specialist centres or managed clinical networks to ensure the critical mass of expertise required for the development and delivery of specialist services such as aspects of paediatric audiology, the assessment and treatment of tinnitus and balance disorders, and bone-anchored hearing aids. Such arrangements may require consortia of NHS Boards to deliver effective services.&quot;</p>

  <p>The impact and importance to the modernisation of audiology services were identified for all recommendations. The Audiology Modernisation Project Board and the Audiology Services Advisory Group will consider all the recommendations made in this report and will include the recommendation made in relation to improving the service for people with tinnitus.</p>

  <p>Forestry has a significant role to play in delivering the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy, building on the substantial achievements it has made in recent years. Indeed there are a wide range of forestry related measures in the strategy, as is demonstrated by the strategy implementation plans which were published last month on the Executive&rsquo;s biodiversity website ( <a href="http://www.biodiversityscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.biodiversityscotland.org.uk</a> ).</p>

  <p>In leading the review of our Scottish Forestry Strategy, Forestry Commission Scotland will ensure that all relevant aspects of the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy are taken into account.</p>

The criteria included social as well as clinical criteria. They include a criterion that there should be &quot;no child living with the couple in their home&quot; <em>. </em> The consensus view of EAGISS (as supported by patient representatives) was that couples who already have a child in the home should be ineligible for NHS funded assisted conception treatment in order that a childless couple may have this opportunity. The criterion was re-considered at a consensus conference of EAGISS in 2003 when it was agreed it should continue to stand.</p>

  <p>There are no reliable estimates of the tonnage of illegally landed fish.</p>

  <p>However the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency (SFPA) makes an on-going assessment of the quantity of fish which may have been landed illegally through a systematic analysis of the available data including returns completed by fishermen and the results of surveillance activity on the quayside and beyond the point of landing. That information is used to guide enforcement activity on an on-going basis. However, it cannot be relied upon as statistically accurate or suitable for evidential purposes, nor does it provide a reliable estimate of tonnage.</p>

  <p>The SFPA are able to estimate the amount of fish landed that might otherwise have gone unrecorded had a boarding at sea or an inspection at the point of landing not been carried out. Had the catch not been inspected it might be reasonable to assume that some or all of the quota sensitive species retained on board may not have been declared in returns made to fisheries departments. As reported in the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency&rsquo;s Annual Report 2003-04 it is estimated that this amounts to between 500-700 tonnes per month for the demersal species.</p>

  <p>Commercial confidentiality is a subject which has a wide range of application. The nature and source of advice on that subject will depend on the context in which it is required. There are a number of guidance documents which cover commercial confidentiality. These include procurement guidance, internal freedom of information guidance, the Code of Practice under section 60 of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 and briefings from the Office of the Scottish Information Commissioner. These are all available to the Executive and its agencies and to non-departmental public bodies.</p>

  <p>The Executive commissioned a review of race equality last year to consider, among other things, priorities in communities, Executive funding, and the infrastructure required to deliver effective race equality and community cohesion. As part of the evidence gathering process, a mapping exercise of race equality activity in the public sector was undertaken which used bodies&rsquo; Race Equality Schemes. The purpose of this mapping exercise report was to contribute to the body of knowledge informing the review. It was not to evaluate whether and to what extent Scottish public bodies are fulfilling their legal duties related to race relations. The report of the mapping exercise is available on the Executive&rsquo;s One Scotland website, <a href="http://www.infoscotland.com" target="_blank">www.infoscotland.com</a> .</p>

  <p>The Commission for Racial Equality has statutory powers to enforce compliance with the statutory duty to promote race equality. The commission keeps ministers informed of Scottish public authorities&rsquo; progress towards meeting the duty. For further information about this matter, you may wish to contact:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will be publishing a report and action plan in the coming months following the Executive&rsquo;s review of race equality. The review was commissioned by ministers last year given the changing context in which race equality work is being conducted. Among other things, the review considered priorities for communities, Executive funding, and the infrastructure required to deliver effective race equality and community cohesion.</p>

  <p>The report and action plan, which will be published on the Executive&rsquo;s website, will form the basis of the Scottish response to the Home Office Strategy and will be set within the British framework.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-14392 by Rhona Brankin on 4 March 2005, what provision there is for elderly people currently in residential homes whose conditions merit nursing intervention.</p>

  <p>Care homes can be registered with the Care Commission to provide personal care, personal support or nursing care. The type of care a care home service is registered to provide is determined by what is set out in its statement of aims and objectives provided as part of the registration process.</p>

  <p>In care homes providing personal support or personal care or both, any short term nursing care needs of a resident can be provided by NHS community nursing services and, where appropriate, by transfer to hospital. Any on-going nursing care needs of a resident could be provided by transfer to NHS continuing care where this is appropriate or by transfer to a care home which is registered to provide nursing care.</p>

  <p>A care home registered to provide a particular form of care has the option of applying to the Care Commission for a variation of its conditions of registration, for instance to have the provision of nursing care to the resident concerned included in its registration.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what aspects of the UK Road Safety Bill will impact on devolved matters; what discussions it has had with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government regarding the bill; what impact the bill will have on the ability to prosecute and detain foreign-registered vehicles for road traffic and other vehicular offences; whether the powers under the bill will apply in the same way in Scotland as in the rest of the United Kingdom, and how they will be applied, with specific reference to the detention of foreign-registered vehicles and the prosecution of their owners.</p>

  <p>Most road traffic law is reserved to the Westminster Parliament and there were no specific implications for devolved matters contained in the Road Safety Bill. The greater part of the bill proposed to amend existing legislation, particularly the Road Traffic Act and the Road Traffic Offenders Act, and extended throughout Great Britain. However, the bill fell with the dissolution of Parliament.</p>

  <p>Where any case involving a foreign national is reported by the police to the Procurator Fiscal, a prosecution will be raised if there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to do so.</p>

  <p>The report published by the Office of Fair Trading on 22 March is not yet the final advice to ministers. The OFT is seeking further hard evidence from suppliers about breaches of the Supermarket Code of Practice. We shall take careful stock of the final report which OFT makes to ministers and we shall have an input into the response. When I meet the major retailers I shall continue to emphasise how seriously the Executive views the importance of maintaining a sustainable food chain with healthy trading relationships between suppliers and retailers.</p>
