  <p>Disabled access to Scotland&rsquo;s railway is a matter reserved to Westminster as it sits within disability and equality legislation that is the responsibility of the UK Government.</p>

  <p>There are 346 railway stations in Scotland. At present 201 are fully accessible to wheelchair users.</p>

  <p>Work should be complete on eight stations that will be made step free by April 2009 through the first phase of the Access For All programme, which was launched in 2006 and is funded by the Department for Transport until 2015.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has identified a further five Scottish stations that should be given priority for investment and I have recommended these stations for approval by the Secretary of State for Transport. Work would begin on these stations after April 2009.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated that all 13 stations will be fully accessible to wheelchair users by 2011, bringing the total number of fully accessible stations in Scotland to 214.</p>

  <p>Stations to be made step free between 2011 and 2015 through the Access For All programme will be announced next year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government set out its new relocation policy on 29 January 2008. Relocation of specific bodies will be considered where it can be shown that there are operational benefits from doing so, that the costs of relocation can be afforded and that it will result in efficiencies. Where those conditions are satisfied a transparent process will be undertaken to identify potential location options. Where possible, we will seek to accommodate organisations within the Scottish Government&rsquo;s estate. If no such opportunity exists we will discuss with our public sector partners, including local authorities, alternative accommodation options.</p>

  <p>New contractual arrangements for the provision of NHS dental services have been introduced in England and Wales. Following a consultation in 2003, a decision was taken by the previous administration to retain item of service fees in Scotland, ie a fee for each item of treatment undertaken. The differences in the arrangements for NHS dental services in England and Wales and those in Scotland have resulted in the different patient charging systems which now exist and the disparity in the maximum patient charge. There are no current plans to review the maximum patient charge for a single course of NHS dental treatment in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The procedures for dealing with variations in fuel costs are set out in the public service contracts between the Scottish Ministers and CalMac Ferries Ltd covering the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services and NorthLink Ferries Ltd for the Northern Isles ferry services. Under the terms of those contracts, an annual budget against which subsidy is payable is agreed based on estimated fuel prices and the volume of fuel required to operate the contracted services. If the price of fuel increases beyond the budgeted price set, then the Scottish Government is required to cover the cost of the difference by making supplementary grant payments. If the volume of the actual fuel required is above the budgeted volume set, the operator bears the full cost of the volume increase.</p>

  <p>Full consideration of these issues will be assessed within the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget for 2008-2009.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government funds Road Safety Scotland for the development of key road safety education initiatives and publicity messages. Streetsense, crashmagnets and A2bsafely are educational road safety websites developed by Road Safety Scotland.

  <p>Assessment of the websites is carried out by Road Safety Scotland using feedback provided by its Education sub-committee, short-term working groups and a wide network of road safety professionals who track the usage of all Road Safety Scotland education resources within their police or local authority road safety units. In addition, Streetsense was fully evaluated in 2006 and can be found at <a href="http://www.roadsafetyscotland.org.uk/research/completed/streetsense_evaluation.asp" target="_blank">http://www.roadsafetyscotland.org.uk/research/completed/streetsense_evaluation.asp</a></p>

  <p>Precise estimates on the economic benefit to Scotland of wildlife tourism; tourism dependent on wild places and unspoilt landscapes; and tourism based on the natural and cultural heritage of Scotland are not available, although research into the economic impact of wildlife tourism for Scotland is planned by the Government for the near future.</p>

  <p>However, tourism is one of Scotland&rsquo;s most important industries, worth well over &pound;4 billion in revenues to the economy. The scenery is the most important factor among those choosing to holiday in Scotland, with 92% rating it important or very important to them in making their choice, while nature and wildlife comes third, with 73% of visitors rating it important or very important. Satisfaction levels with these aspects of their holiday in Scotland is very high, with 97% being satisfied or very satisfied with the scenery, and 86% satisfied or very satisfied with nature and wildlife.</p>

  <p>All Regional Transport Partnership capital funding was incorporated into the local government settlement. In the case of SPT, these funds have been ring-fenced.

  <p>Under the concordat between Scottish Ministers and COSLA, since 1 April 2008, Local Authorities became fully responsible for the provision of necessary Community Transport services in their areas. Local authorities were required to honour the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ongoing funding commitments to Rural Community Transport Initiative (RCTI) projects following the scheme&rsquo;s closure on 31 March 2008. The RCTI budget was transferred to local authorities as part of the local government finance settlement for 2008-11.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding is being provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>
