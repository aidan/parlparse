  <p>We expect to announce specific funding for the implementation of local alcohol action plans in the first week in March. The release of funding is conditional on alcohol action teams having agreed outcome expectations and systems in place to measure key indicators. We will be monitoring the use of the new resources through alcohol and drug action team annual reporting arrangements.</p>

  <p>Funding for services addressing alcohol problems is provided within resources allocated to NHS boards and local authorities, but is not specifically identified by the Executive.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for assessing local service needs and for providing services to meet them, within the framework of national priorities and resources. I therefore look to boards, working together where appropriate, to determine the pattern of eating disorder services (including in-patient facilities) necessary to meet the needs of the areas they serve. This responsibility includes deciding how to make best use of services in the independent sector.</p>

  <p>The <em>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland, </em>published in 1997, sets out general guidance on eating disorder services and encourages boards to consider a range of approaches, including regional models, for providing access to in-patient care. The <em>Framework </em>does not impose a specific structure or level of service on boards. It is for the boards themselves to determine what is most appropriate in accordance with their assessment of local and regional needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>Since 1997, the number of consultant dermatologists has increased by 16%. At 1.9%, the consultant dermatologist vacancy rate is below the national average consultant vacancy rate in Scotland of 5.6%.</p>

  <p>The number of specialist registrar training posts within this specialty has been increased from 14 in 2001 to 17 in 2003.

  <p>The Open University is an autonomous institution and, as such, sets its course fee levels independently. However, I understand that the Open University has increased its course fees in line with inflation in the current year. Funding from the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council represents only one of the streams of funding available to the Open University.</p>

  <p>The death of Stewart Williams on 30 January 2004 is being investigated by the Procurator Fiscal at Kilmarnock. In terms of section 1(1)(a)(ii) of the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry Act 1976 a fatal accident inquiry is mandatory. Investigation of the cause of death is still at an early stage and it is therefore not possible to set a date for the inquiry.

  <p>We have put the reform of the criminal justice system at the heart of our policies. The people of Scotland deserve strong, safe communities. To deliver this we must address the unacceptably high rate of re-offending we see in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Today I am launching <em>Re:duce, Re:habilitate, Re:form &#8211; A Consultation on Reducing Reoffending in Scotland</em>. This meets our partnership agreement commitment to consult on the establishment of a single agency to deliver custodial and non-custodial sentences.</p>

  <p>Over the next 12 weeks, officials from the Scottish Executive Justice Department and secondees from the Scottish Prison Service, local authorities and voluntary sector, will be undertaking a series of meetings, workshops and discussion groups to listen to the views of those with an interest in the criminal justice system. In particular, we will meet those who provide criminal justice services, victims of crime, offenders and their families, as well as representatives from communities which have been blighted by persistent offending. Written submissions will also be welcome.</p>

  <p>Copies of the consultation pack have been place in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number: 31194). The pack is also available on the Scottish Executive website at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the cost has been of each investigation carried out by the NHS Fraud Investigation Unit since its inception and what the annual cost is of maintaining the unit and its helpline.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-03-02.14.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0302.htm#8">

  <p>The current running costs of NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services (CFS) are &#163;550,000 per annum. The costs of the Fraud Hotline for the period April 2003 to date are &#163;80. For that period, there were approximately 230 calls. This volume of calls can be dealt with by CFS staff as part of their normal duties.</p>

  <p>The CFS team is split into approximately 50% contractor investigations and 50% patient claims checking. To date, the CFS have carried out 56,000 patient exemption claims checks and 79 contractor investigations. Eleven have been referred to Procurators Fiscal, seven of which are still current. An investigation into contractor fraud may take between three and nine months depending on the complexity of the case (including the nature and scale of the fraud perpetrated, its location and the method/means used to carry it out) and on whether it is likely to be taken to court criminally or civilly or be subject to disciplinary procedures of the NHS or the professional regulatory bodies. The primary role of the CFS is deterrence and therefore, with the agreement of the NHS body, it may be decided that the most suitable action is not criminal prosecution but recovery of funds and/or discipline.</p>

  <p>A full exercise to cost all investigations carried out since the establishment of the CFS has not been undertaken. Resources would need to be diverted from investigative/prevention work in order to do so. Records are kept, however, of investigator time spent on every case. One case has been fully costed for investigators&#8217; time and expenses resulting in a cost of &#163;24,400. In this case, the practitioner pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of &#163;6,000 fraud and has offered to make a further substantial repayment. Additionally, subsequent to the execution of the search warrant on the practitioner&#8217;s premises, his payment claims to the NHS fell by &#163;5,000 per month or a saving to the NHS of &#163;60,000 per year.</p>

  <p>Some cases do not result in substantial recoveries but impact on NHS clinical governance. If the CFS were to be judged solely on financial returns then cases involving clinical practice would not be taken on by them. This would be unacceptable.</p>

  <p>Under the new GMS contract GPs have the option to transfer responsibility for delivering out-of-hours primary medical services to their NHS boards. NHS boards have until 31 December 2004 to plan for reprovision of out-of-hours service, by which time they should have alternative arrangements in place for these services.</p>

  <p>Boards&#8217; plans are not yet sufficiently developed to provide precise cost estimates at this stage, although a national out-of-hours working group is working with boards to take this work forward.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are already receiving record increases in their allocations (an extra 7.7% in 2004-05 in real terms) to ensure that the highest standards of service provision can be maintained and improved upon in all areas.</p>

  <p>NHS Board allocations have increased in real terms by 15.8% since 1999-2000. This compares with the real terms increase in measurable unit costs, mainly in the acute sector, of 23% over the same period.</p>

  <p>The unit cost figure should be treated with caution as they do not fully reflect changes in patterns of activity or improvements in quality and quantity of care as a result of changing clinical practice. New data collection processes are being developed to improve the way in which activity and costs are recorded in the future, and some of this is brought out in the new acute data due to be published on 26 February 2004. This includes statistics on nurse-led clinics, out-patient operations/procedure etc. More information can be found on this link: http://www.isdscotland.org.</p>

  <p>Funding of &#163;1.1 million to support the expanded remit of NHSScotland (CFS) will be made available in the next financial year. In November, I approved the recommended option of a Short Life Working Group set up to prepare an options paper in respect of the extension of the CFS&#8217;s counter fraud role from family health services to the whole of the NHS in Scotland. That option was the provision of a full counter fraud service to NHSScotland, to include more extensive pro-active deterrence activities, through a centrally based, professionally qualified team of counter fraud specialists dedicated only to counter fraud work. The CFS is currently considering the practical aspects of expanding its remit, including office accommodation needs and recruitment, induction and training of additional staff, working with NHS boards to agree co-operative arrangements. For this purpose, it has set up an extended role project team composed of existing staff. Once arrangements are completed, the CFS will focus on its extended role. I should emphasise that there will be a concentration on deterrence and prevention activities to reduce fraud in the NHS to an absolute minimum alongside investigative activity. In the interim period, the CFS will continue with its work of countering fraud in the family health services.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for planning services in their areas and for securing the staff needed to deliver them.</p>

  <p>The Executive remains committed to building the workforce capacity of NHSScotland and in order to assist NHS employers meet local health needs, we have invested record sums in health.</p>

  <p>We are aware of the capacity issues for some specialist staff, and the department is working closely with NHSScotland to identify and increase the numbers of specialist nurses in palliative care.</p>
