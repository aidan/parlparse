  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to objective 3, target 4 of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning chapter of its Draft Budget 2004-05, whether increasing the number of modern apprenticeships (MAs) to over 25,000 by 2006 represents a change of policy from its target of 30,000; if so, why the target has been reduced, and whether the reduction has been announced to the Parliament.</p>

  <p>The statement in the Draft Budget 2004-05, concerning the increase in the number of MAs to 25,000 by 2006, was an outcome of the 2002 spending review and was reported in <em>Building a Better Scotland</em> . This target was subsequently revised when the partnership agreement was drawn up, to over 30,000 MAs by 2006.</p>

  <p>The reference to the earlier target of 25,000 was a transcription error and does not represent a change in policy or reduction in the partnership agreement target. We are committed to increasing the apprenticeship programme to 30,000 places by 2006.</p>

  <p>A small proportion of the Learning Disability Change Funds (&pound;16 million) provided to local authorities to implement <em>The same as you?</em> may be used in this way. However, information provided by local authorities to the Executive does not identify funding used for this purpose.</p>

  <p>The Changing Children's Services Fund supports better integration across services for children and young people, including at key transition stages. Specific allocations from the fund are agreed locally, but include services that will benefit young people affected by autism.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Executive provides funding to Careers Scotland (&pound;5.8 million per annum) to provide key worker support. The role of the key worker is to help people with additional support needs (which might include people with autism) make the transition to post-school.</p>

  <p>There are currently two statutory schemes which allow full or partial reimbursement of travelling expenses of patients and, where medically necessary, their escorts, which are necessarily incurred when attending a hospital for the purpose of patients availing themselves of services provided under the care of a hospital consultant, namely:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>(a) A means tested scheme covering the whole of the country, and</p>
<p>(b) The Highlands and Islands scheme which provides for the reimbursement of travelling expenses in excess of &pound;8 without test of means. To qualify the patient must be resident or work in the former Highlands and Islands Development Board area. The distance travelled from the patient&rsquo;s home must be 30 miles or more or involve a journey by sea of more than five miles.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>If it is considered medically necessary for the patient to be accompanied, then travel expenses incurred by an escort would be eligible for reimbursement.</p>

Any decision taken about these needs should be based on a detailed assessment of the individual&rsquo;s needs and take into account their wishes.

  <p>A range and capacity review of key community care services for older people in Scotland is currently being carried out. The outcomes of the review will include projections of the numbers of community care service users, along with the associated workforce and costs, at national level for each year up to 2018. Balance of care arrangements are a complex issue, and services are provided in different ways in different parts of Scotland. A number of scenarios are being looked at, one of which considers the dependency levels of older people in NHS long stay beds and care homes. A reference group comprising a number of independent experts has been formed to help advise and take forward the review, and a final report is due to be completed by April 2004.</p>

  <p>In line with the recommendations in the <em>For</em> <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Children</em> report, we are working with agencies to ensure better co-ordination across all services for children and young people, in particular for those who are vulnerable or disadvantaged, such as young people leaving care.</p>

  <p>The new cabinet delivery group on Children and Young People has identified key cross-cutting priorities to carry forward this work &ndash; on issues such as information-sharing and assessment, inspection and quality assurance, planning and delivery and workforce.</p>

  <p>The three-year Child Protection Reform Programme is developing a range of measures to help ensure effective and coherent support and protection for children who are at risk of neglect or abuse, including a Children&rsquo;s Charter and national standards for child protection, which will apply across all agencies and individuals working with children, and monitoring through a joint inspection system.</p>

  <p>The ministers for Justice, Health and Community Care and myself wrote to the leaders and chief executives of local authorities, health boards and chief inspectors of police on 11 November asking them to provide a statement of assurance that they have reviewed current child protection operations, singly and collectively; they are satisfied with the performance of services, or, if not, have put plans in place to address weaknesses, and have robust quality assurance procedures in place.</p>

  <p>In addition we will accelerate the development or the introduction of multi-agency inspection.</p>

  <p>Buprenorphine (brand name Subutex) is already licensed for the treatment of opioid dependence. <em>The Drug Misuse and Dependence &ndash; Guidelines on Clinical Management</em> issued by UK Health Departments recommend that this treatment should be initiated by specialist practitioners, with supervised consumption. We are aware that buprenorphine is prescribed by some specialist addiction clinics in Scotland, but information of the extent of its use is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>There is evidence to show that buprenorphine is an effective alternative to methadone for some patients, and a study is already under way to test the feasibility of pharmacy-based, supervised buprenorphine consumption from the perspectives of patients, pharmacists and economic factors. This study is being supported by the Executive, and should report by the end of February 2004.</p>

  <p>There are a range of partnership commitments that focus on helping young people to realise their potential. These include:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>increasing teacher numbers targeted at reducing class sizes in S1 and S2 in maths and English;</p>
<p>reviewing the curriculum to increase pupil choice;</p>
<p>promoting assessment methods that promote teaching and learning; </p>
<p>developing enterprise education;</p>
<p>taking forward legislation to improve provision with young people with additional support needs;</p>
<p>ensuring that gifted children have the opportunity to fulfil their talents, and</p>
<p>providing opportunities for those who wish to pursue vocational qualifications, and promoting enterprise education.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>We recognise that the barriers that stop young people from fulfilling their potential can be based in their home environment so we also have partnership commitments to: provide financial support for all 16- to 19-year-olds from low income families to allow them to continue their education; provision of breakfast clubs and study support outwith the school day, and helping parents, where necessary, to develop the skills to support their child&rsquo;s education. Overall these policies are linked through the National Priorities in Education, and the School Improvement Framework. These are the vehicles through which we can work with education authorities and schools to help ensure that all our young people realise their potential.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill is to modernise and strengthen the system for supporting the additional support needs for learning of children and young people. It aims to ensure that the needs of children and young people who have difficulties, for whatever reason, in accessing and progressing in learning are identified and addressed. The bill proposes a system that will be less bureaucratic, will be more outcome focussed, will promote integration of services, encourage partnerships with parents and will provide extra safeguards for those with the most extensive needs.</p>

  <p>The Dee District Salmon Fishery Board has reported that approximately 180 dead salmon and sea trout were removed from the River Dee during the period of low flows and high water temperatures in the summer of 2003. Other dead fish were reported which could not be recovered, but no record of numbers is available. Responsibility for the protection of salmon and salmon fisheries in Scotland is devolved to the District Salmon Fishery Boards.</p>

  <p>The Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 will give Scottish ministers the power to regulate all activities that can negatively impact on the health of Scotland's water. We are currently developing new regulations for the control of pollution, water abstractions and impoundments, and building and engineering works in the vicinity of the water environment.</p>

  <p>This will include registration with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for all those who abstract water. SEPA will then determine whether that activity needs to be controlled in order to satisfy the environmental objectives for the relevant body of water. Where necessary, SEPA will be able to review the licence in order to protect the water environment as circumstances change.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-12-15.S2W-4668.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa1215.htm#11">

  <p>The strategic review of inshore fisheries is being carried out through the Scottish Inshore Fisheries Advisory Group (SIFAG), the Executive&rsquo;s main source of stakeholder advice on inshore fisheries matters.</p>

  <p>There are three key strands to the strategic review:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>review of the effectiveness of inshore fisheries management to date;</p>
<p>development of a strategy and management framework for inshore fisheries, and</p>
<p>development of a plan to move from the existing system to any future system.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The first strand focuses primarily on the general use of prohibitions under the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984. Twenty-four responses were received to a consultation on the use of the act, and the conclusions of that consultation will feed into the development of a strategy. We will also be having parallel discussions with regulating order grantees and applicants. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage commissioned a report on environmental integration in inshore fisheries management, which will act as the main environmental consideration of the review. That report was published on 3 December 2003, and the project&rsquo;s steering group will make recommendations to SIFAG.</p>

  <p>On the second strand, sub-groups of SIFAG have been convening on a regular basis, supported by SEERAD, to develop a draft strategy and options for local management structures. SIFAG will consider drafts of both at the group&rsquo;s next full meeting, which I expect to be in January or February.</p>

  <p>Following SIFAG consideration of a draft strategy and management framework, there will be a consultation with a wide range of inshore fisheries stakeholders. The extent and timing of any legislation will depend on the conclusions reached by SIFAG. There have been no significant delays in progress, and given the emphasis on stakeholder participation, the timing of the review is flexible to accommodate industry priorities and responsibilities.</p>

  <p>The Executive is today issuing a consultation paper on Care Commission fee levels for 2004-05. It is being sent to a large number of interested parties, including local authorities and care providers.</p>

  <p>The financial memorandum to the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Bill set out a policy of introducing fees at full cost recovery levels in 2004-05, except for childminding and day care of children, which would continue to be subsidised. The Executive has reviewed that policy. In recognition of the difficulties which would be presented to providers and users by a move to full cost recovery in one step, the consultation paper proposes spreading that move over three years. The subsidy for childminding and day care of children will continue. The paper proposes the continuation of the current policy of setting fees for services whose regulation commenced after 1 April 2002 at full direct cost recovery levels from the outset.</p>

  <p>Comments are invited on the paper by 6 February 2004 in order to enable new fee levels to come into operation on 1 April 2004.</p>

  <p>The guidelines for sex education are contained within the Health Education 5&ndash;14 National Guidelines. These guidelines offer a framework within which education authorities and schools should develop their programmes and do not stipulate either the amount of time which should be allocated or whether there should be separate classes. These are decisions for education authorities. This is because in Scotland there is no statutory curriculum and the responsibility for its management and delivery lies with education authorities.</p>

  <p>We have introduced a number of measures to complement the action plan instigated last year. These include a fast-track scheme for 120 graduates to train as social workers within 15-18 months, an incentive scheme for eligible social work graduates to work in priority areas, grants to relevant employers towards the cost of student practice placements, a new Framework for Social Work Education, including a new four-year honours degree, a leadership training initiative for 200 first line and middle managers, specific grant to local authorities for training in the current year and an additional &pound;9 million over the next three years for the same purpose. We have also provided &pound;1.22 million to create the Institute for Excellence in Social Work Education, developing new approaches to learning and ensuring that training in the new degree equips new workers to be confident in their knowledge and skills and to work effectively with other professionals.</p>

  <p>As well as our on-going recruitment and awareness campaign, we are campaigning specifically to encourage school-leavers to take advantage of the new degree. In addition, I am chairing a national workforce group to develop a workforce action plan that will be supported by three working groups. One will be responsible for producing a national education, training and development strategy, the second for improving workforce information and intelligence and the third will support recruitment and retention, human resource management and organisational development across the sector. These groups will have substantial impact on helping this valuable workforce achieve the improvements we all seek.</p>

  <p>The operators of 3G mobile phone systems are subject to the same planning controls already in place for the roll-out of the GSM network. That is to say work constituting &quot;development&quot;, as defined in planning legislation, requires planning permission. As with other electronic communication code operators, 3G operators benefit from permitted developments rights (PDR), which grant a general planning permission across Scotland for some of their &quot;development&quot;. Legislation introduced in July 2001 restricted these PDRs and meant that, for example, a specific grant of planning permission will be required for new ground-based masts. Planning authorities may also seek to control telecommunications developments through local plan policies and their policies on the use of council owned land and buildings.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the legislation is contained in National Planning Policy Guideline 19 and advice on siting and design can be found in Planning Advice Note 62, both entitled Radio Telecommunications. Both of these documents can be accessed at the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Planning website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/planning" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/planning</a>.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland work with Edinburgh and Lothians Tourist Board on the promotion of Edinburgh as a leading tourist destination, and they undertook a joint programme at the time of the MTV Awards to promote Scotland and Edinburgh. This included a programme for the 700 journalists attending the MTV awards to ensure both excellent reporting of Scotland and Edinburgh in their coverage of the awards and, in the longer term, increased profile for Edinburgh and Scotland amongst international journalists. It also included collecting photographs and celebrity quotes to be used in further marketing campaigns and promotional opportunities.</p>

  <p>EventScotland is using the success of the MTV awards to increase the reputation of Scotland and Edinburgh as an events destination.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will respond to the points raised by Jim and Margaret Cuthbert in their letter in <em>The Scotsman</em> on 25 November 2003; how much borrowing the water and sewerage industry could have undertaken under the system of financial control in 2001; whether the industry could have borrowed up to around &pound;260 million in 2003-04 without breaching its resource accounting limit, and whether there were mistakes in the commissioning letter.</p>

  <p>I have already responded to the points made by Jim and Margaret Cuthbert in the <em>The Scotsman</em> prior to the 25 November. I do not believe their letter of 25 November raises any significant new points.</p>

  <p>In 2001-02, in accordance with the rules governing public expenditure, limits were applied to the capital and resource budgets, not borrowing. For 2003-04, following a change in the rules, public expenditure for public corporations now scores net new borrowing and grants. &pound;250.7 million is, therefore, available.</p>

  <p>No mistakes were made in the commissioning letter for the strategic review of charges 2002-06.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, <a name="QuestionText"> further to the answer to questions S1W-22912 and S2W-22913 by Ross Finnie on 22 February 2002, what steps are being taken to address any continuing risks to the Glasgow drinking water supply from cryptosporidium and, in light of any such risks, what justification there is for any delays in the construction works commencing.</a></p>

  <p>Scottish Water has made considerable effort to reduce the risk of cryptosporidium in the Glasgow drinking water supply, including improving drainage; improving surface water and area watercourses above the aqueduct which pose the greatest risk; installing kerbs and ramps to prevent surface water running off the road into Mugdock reservoir; cleaning outlets, drains, and culverts, and improving the distribution network. Scottish Water is also having on-going discussions with Mugdock Country Park, Scottish Natural Heritage and local residents about drainage matters, as well as continuing work to deal with those watercourses and parts of the distribution network identified as being lower risk.</p>

  <p>Since planning permission was granted, Scottish Water has been working closely with the council to finalise the conditions of the application. This has taken time because of the number of these conditions. Parallel to this, Scottish Water has been progressing land acquisition matters for the treatment works, including promotion of a compulsory purchase order (CPO).</p>

  <p>Seventeen objections, including one statutory objection, to the CPO have been lodged with Scottish ministers. If the statutory objection is maintained, a public local inquiry must be held to recommend whether ministers should, or should not, confirm the order.</p>
