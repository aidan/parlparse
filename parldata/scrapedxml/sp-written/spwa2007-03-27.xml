  <p>The only ambulances reserved for hospital to hospital transfers are Medic 1 in Edinburgh, Medic 2 in Glasgow and four neonatal ambulances. Other hospital to hospital transfers are undertaken by any available ambulances, whether accident and emergency or patient transport service, depending on the needs of the patient. The Scottish Ambulance Service does not reserve ambulances for hospital transfers. Accident and emergency ambulances are tactically deployed using predicted demand and satellite tracking systems.</p>

  <p>As a result of the extensive range of skills which can now be carried out by ambulance crews, in the majority of cases the emergency is over once a member of the Scottish Ambulance Service arrives at the patient. Only on very rare occasions would an ambulance with a patient on board travel to the hospital under blue lights and sirens.</p>

  <p>In 2005-06 and 2006-07 (to date), the number of patients treated at scene who did not need to go to hospital compared against the number of patients responded to is set out in this table:</p>

  <p>The priority based dispatch system provides for the dispatcher in the emergency medical dispatch centre to deploy the most appropriate resource to an emergency call. If that resource is a single crewed rapid response unit, then the dispatcher immediately deploys a second resource.</p>

  <p>There are many other occasions where more than one ambulance could be deployed, for example road traffic accidents with multiple casualties. The policy of the Scottish Ambulance Service is to encourage ambulance crews to seek back up if they consider that it is required.</p>

  <p>The number of additional emergency responses to emergency incidents in each of the last five years is listed in the following table:</p>

  <p>The policy provides for an accident and emergency ambulance to be double crewed and to have a paramedic on board. However, there may be circumstances when it is not possible to achieve this and the choice is to crew an ambulance with two technicians or to run a shift with a single-manned ambulance which in certain circumstances might then require a back-up response.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service operates through six divisions and three emergency medical dispatch centres and uses satellite location systems to determine the nearest available resource to the request for an ambulance. The service does not deploy according to NHS board areas but deploys according to demand patterns. The services aim is to mobilise the nearest available resource no matter which area it is in. This is compatible with best practice and is a system operated by all UK ambulance services.</p>

  <p>There is no precise response to this question as by the very nature of mechanical vehicles this is unpredictable. Crews are trained to check the ambulance and equipment at the start of each shift since they are responsible for it.</p>

  <p>A modern accident and emergency ambulance is a complex and sophisticated vehicle with many different types of equipment. The non-use of an ambulance would depend on the particular item of equipment which the crew consider to be faulty. If this happens, a spare vehicle would be used. The Scottish Ambulance Service has 30% spare accident and emergency vehicles which are used to cover shift over-runs, additional shifts, vehicle breakdowns and maintenance.</p>

  <p>The ambulance service currently operates its youngest fleet of vehicles ever, with the average age of an accident and emergency vehicle being two and a half years, and the average age of a patient transport vehicle of three and a half years.</p>

A significant package of measures that will make a real difference to the children of asylum seekers in Scotland was agreed last March.</p>

  <p>It is for GPs, as independent practitioners, to identify their own personal learning needs related to the health needs of their own patients, facilitated by annual appraisal system, and seek training in specific areas accordingly. The General Medical Services contract incentivises GP practices to undertake family planning activities through enhanced services.</p>

  <p>Following a recommendation within Respect and Responsibility, NHS boards are seeking to identify if there are gaps in sexual health training and put in place plans to take appropriate action to address them.</p>

  <p>In addition, the faculty of Family Planning and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, specifies the training requirements for contraceptive services, with specifications including the requirements for trainers.</p>

  <p>The National Sexual Health Advisory Committee, which I chair, has a sub-group specifically considering training for health care professionals who provide sexual health and well-being services within NHSScotland. That sub-group is due to report later this year.</p>

  <p>The right to fish for salmon is a private, heritable title, so all fisheries are in private ownership. Some fisheries may be operated by tenants.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Health Networks (ScotPHNs) remit is to facilitate joint working between all organisations involved in health improvement and health services by providing a means of communication and through specific projects in areas of national importance.</p>

  <p>The objectives of the network are to:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>undertake prioritised national pieces of work where there is a clearly identified need, which will impact on planning and decision making at both national and local level. This will be facilitated by using the skills, knowledge and expertise, which are spread widely across Scotland, in addressing public health issues, and<br />
              to create effective communication amongst professionals and the public to allow efficient co-ordination of public health activity. To share information effectively so that duplication of effort is avoided.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The network has a steering group which is chaired by a Director of Public Health. Its membership is drawn from key individuals from relevant organisations. It agrees and guides the ScotPHN work programme.</p>

  <p>Governance of the ScotPHN is undertaken by a stakeholder group including broad representation from organisations responsible for delivering health improvement and health services. The ScotPHN is facilitated and monitored by a lead clinician with the support of a project manager. The ScotPHN is hosted by NHS Health Scotland.</p>

  <p>ScotPHN is open to everyone in Scotland who has a professional interest and significant involvement in the wider health improvement agenda including staff from the NHS, local authorities, academia and others. The ScotPHN work programme is still under development as it has been fully functioning for less than six months.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many operations were carried out in hospitals in NHS Forth Valley in each year since 2000.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the successful implementation of Delivering for Health (launched in October 2005) is already bringing about a fundamental shift in the balance of care. This, quite appropriately, places a greater emphasis on anticipatory care so that those at risk of ill health receive the services they need. In effect, the NHS in Scotland is no longer waiting for people to become ill, then sending them to hospital for urgent treatment. Instead, the Executive and NHS is doing more than ever before to encourage people to lead healthy lives, and spotting and dealing with poor health before it can develop into something more serious. When people do need treatment, the Executive and NHS are committed to delivering more of it closer to home in local communities.</p>

  <p>Operations are carried out within NHSScotland in a wide range of settings dependent on a number of factors including the complexity of the operation and the clinical and personal needs of the patient.</p>

  <p>The number of operations and procedures undertaken as in-patients or day cases is published on the ISD Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/files/Annual_trends_in_surgical_procedures_hbt_February2007.xls" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/files/Annual_trends_in_surgical_procedures_hbt_February2007.xls</a>.</p>

  <p>All procedures undertaken in NHS Forth Valley can be selected using the procedure and NHS board of treatment menus within the file. From April 2003, NHS Forth Valley reclassified some minor procedures and endoscopies previously coded as day case procedures to out-patient procedures.</p>

  <p>Operations can also be performed in an out-patient setting. From April 2003, the national reporting of surgical activity in out-patients has been required and ISD Scotland has been working with NHS boards to develop full compliance nationally. At this stage only a proportion of boards have achieved extensive coverage and further work will be necessary before a complete account of all out-patient surgical activity can be made. Emerging findings from the data collection for out-patient procedures are published in the data development section of the ISD Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/4454.html" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/4454.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Females aged under 20.</p>

  <p>2. Percentage of all pregnancies in each postcode sector.</p>

  <p>3. Where the number of teenage pregnancies were between one and four the data have been barnardised. This involves some of the non-zero cells being randomly modified by the addition or subtraction of one.</p>

  <p>4. Due to the wide variation of size of postcode sectors and the number of pregnancies within each area confidence intervals have been given. This is to reflect the high degree of chance variation due to small numbers. The 95% confidence interval suggests that there is a 95% probability that the true underlying rate lies somewhere between the upper and lower confidence interval.</p>

  <p>Operations are carried out within NHSScotland in a wide range of settings dependent on a number of factors including the complexity of the operation and the clinical and personal needs of the patient.</p>

  <p>The number of operations and procedures undertaken as in-patients or day cases is published on the ISD Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/files/Annual_trends_in_surgical_procedures_hbt_February2007.xls" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/files/Annual_trends_in_surgical_procedures_hbt_February2007.xls</a>.</p>

  <p>Knee replacement and cataract operations in NHS Forth Valley can be selected using the Procedure and NHS Board of Treatment menus within the file.</p>

  <p>Cataract operations can also be performed in an out-patient setting. From April 2003 the national reporting of surgical activity in out-patients has been required and ISD Scotland has been working with NHS boards to develop full compliance nationally. Emerging findings from the data collection for out-patient procedures are published in the data development section of the ISD Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/4454.html" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/4454.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether to co-operate with partners on a particular development is considered on a case-by-case basis. The potential to reduce cost is one of the benefits of co-operation that would be considered in reaching a decision. While the cost of any development, co-operative or otherwise, is closely monitored any additional cost of not sharing in a development is not held centrally. In the cases highlighted in the answer to question S2W-31794 on 28 February 2007, not working closely with other public health services would have incurred substantial additional costs or other disadvantages to the provision of health services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>No decision has been taken on the procurement route for Glasgow&rsquo;s new children&rsquo;s hospital. This will be determined through an auditable business case process based on value for money. The underlying principle in determining the funding route to be followed in any procurement is value for money for the taxpayer. Therefore a PPP/PFI procurement approach must demonstrate better value for money, through an auditable appraisal process, than an equivalent publicly funded approach before its use is approved.</p>

  <p>1. The figures are presented in the same groupings as for previous years and the details for employees who have been assimilated to Agenda for Change have been &quot;mapped back&quot; as far as possible to the coding used under Whitley to ensure consistency in trend data.</p>

  <p>2. During the preview period for the release of national statistics, NHS 24 identified a discrepancy with the 2006 data which ISD are investigating further, therefore 2006 figures for NHS 24 are not shown.</p>

  <p>Selection and recruitment to Specialty Training at both UK and Scottish levels has been the subject of review by a group chaired by Professor Neil Douglas, President Royal College of Physicians Edinburgh and including representatives from the four UK Health Departments and the Academy of medical Royal Colleges. The group reported on 26 March 2007 and we are now considering their recommendations. A range of options are being discussed but I am confident that we can agree a way forward which is seen as being fair to all doctors who have applied to Scotland.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>The recording of Availability Status Codes (ASCs) on in-patient/day case discharge data is not mandatory and consistency of recording will vary across NHSScotland. It is not possible therefore to establish exactly how many patients had an ASC applied and to distinguish precisely between those patients eligible for waiting times standards and those that are ineligible. For this reason, routinely published waiting times figures are based on all in-patients/day cases regardless of whether they have an ASC code.</p>

  <p>Census data, provided by NHS boards to ISD Scotland and published each quarter, shows the number of patients waiting over specified periods as at the census date. This census data does identify all patients with an Availability Status Code and it is therefore possible to report on the number of patients with a guarantee and an Availability Status Code waiting over specified periods on that particular census date.</p>

  <p>Availability Status Codes will be abolished at the end of this year and replaced by a new system of defining and measuring waiting which will be clearer, more consistent and fairer to patients. The new approach will balance the responsibility of the NHS to provide care and treatment quickly with patients responsibility to make sure they attend appointments and do not change appointments once agreed.</p>

The scheme criteria require that an assessment be made of viability, need for support and economic benefit.

  <p>RSA is payable in instalments only after jobs and capital expenditure targets are met. Payment of grant depends on the progress of each project and is outwith the departments control, as such we do not maintain records of the average time from date of application to receipt of funding. We have a target to authorise 95% of claims within five working days of the company providing the full documentation required to process the claim. If the claim is not fully documented when received we have a further target of 10 days to contact the applicant to detail what information is required to process the claim. These targets have been met in full for the same period as above (November 2002 to October 2006).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Licensing of Skin Piercing and Tattooing Working Group was established in June 2006, in response to the introduction of the licensing of skin piercing and tattooing in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The core membership of the working group was based on the existing Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland group who have professional responsibility for this area. Additional members were invited from Health Protection Scotland, Scottish Executive and the 32 local authorities in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Morag Sangster and Mark Perry from the Tattooing and Piercing Industry Union (TPI); Julian Ball from Prestige Medical Ltd and John Manolakis from the Ear Piercing Manufacturers of Europe Ltd participated in an advisory role.</p>

  <p>The membership of the group is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Mr Graham Robertson (Chair), Executive Council Member, REHIS</p>
<p>Dr Carole McRae, Epidemiologist, Health Protection Scotland </p>
<p>Mrs Kerry Chalmers, Public Health Team, Scottish Executive</p>
<p>Mr Simon Brownlee, East Dunbarton Council, West of Scotland Liaison Group </p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to working to meet the European Union&rsquo;s target to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010. The Scottish Executive achieves this by setting the policy framework and by funding implementation action directly and through other bodies. The public, private and voluntary sectors also undertake a wide variety of action to conserve and enhance biodiversity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Biodiversity Strategy sets out a framework for action for all public bodies to integrate biodiversity actions into their core business.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive&rsquo;s direct support for land managers through agri-environment and other funding mechanisms is important in delivering benefits for biodiversity.</p>

  <p>Conserving biodiversity is a central element of much of the work of Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), both directly through its own activities, and through supporting others through grants. Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) also contribute significantly to biodiversity, through grant payments to private woodland owners and through expenditure on the National Forest Estate.</p>

  <p>In the 2007-08 financial year SNH have committed an extra 1 million for implementing the Species Framework through targeted action for a number of biodiversity priority species that are still declining (such as black grouse, great yellow bumble bee and also the red squirrel). SNH will also continue to support effort on a number of species which are doing better such as corncrake, through SNH Natural Care Schemes until the land management contracts come on line.</p>

  <p>Action under the UKBAP is taken forward by a wide partnership of organisations who collectively allocate resources of all kinds to achieve their objectives. A recent draft consultants report on biodiversity-related spend provides the following figures for the current spending by key players in Scotland:</p>

  <p>Note: *(2005-06 prices).</p>

  <p>Other organisations, including Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund also provide funding for biodiversity action.</p>

  <p>The European Commission&rsquo;s LIFE-Nature fund also provides funds for biodiversity projects relating to Natura 2000 sites.</p>

  <p>In addition, public bodies across Scotland are actively engaged in furthering biodiversity conservation, as required by the biodiversity duty in the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004.</p>

  <p>The Executive and Scottish Natural Heritage, along with other Government departments, are currently considering the revised UKBAP targets and their implications for future delivery of biodiversity action.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which priority species, identified in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, are declining in Scotland and what action is proposed to address their conservation needs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-03-27.S2W-32382.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80010" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0327.htm#22">

  <p>The most recent overview of implementation of the actions required to conserve and enhance the priority species and habitats listed under the UK Biodiversity Action plan comes from an analysis of 2005 data. This data shows that 60 species are either stable or increasing in Scotland whilst 29 species are declining. Thirteen (13) priority habitats are stable or increasing with 13 priority habitats in decline. In some instances the rate of decline has slowed since the previous reporting periods of 1999 and 2002 which helps demonstrate that much of the action taken to date is having a positive effect. For a significant number of species (65) and habitats (14) the survey information is not readily available to determine how these are faring. Only by gaining a better assessment of trends for these species and habitats will we be able to assess how effective Scotland&rsquo;s contribution to meeting the 2010 target will be. Survey effort will therefore be concentrated in these areas over the coming years.</p>

  <p>The information from the 2005 data shows that some of the most significant factors likely to be contributing to decline of species and habitats are habitat loss through agriculture, development encroachment and the effects of pollution. Climate change is an added pressure although the extent of its impact needs to be fully assessed. Action to address these issues will continue to involve a number of measures including further research to understand the causes of change and active management of certain habitats which will be supported through land management contracts. Examples of such measures are inclusion of an action to manage species-rich hedgerows, the joint-working programme for management of deer, and direct action for some species such as those identified in Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s Species Action Framework which will target an additional 1 million of resources in financial year 2007-08. Effective implementation of the duty arising from the Nature Conservation Scotland Act (2004) on public bodies to further conservation of biodiversity is also an important support to delivery.</p>
