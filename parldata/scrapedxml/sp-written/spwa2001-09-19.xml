  <p>Research on genetically modified vaccines for animals is required to be notified to the Scottish Executive and the Health and Safety Executive under the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000. No such activities covered by these regulations have been notified for Scotland. However, some research is being undertaken on immune systems that could eventually lead to the development of such vaccines.</p>

  <p>Activities involving genetically modified micro-organisms are prohibited unless they comply with the Contained Use Regulations 2000 and relevant sections of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Applications must satisfy the regulatory authorities that the activity can be undertaken in conditions which are safe for humans and the environment.</p>

  <p>The prescribed conditions include the provision of risk assessments in relation to human health and safety and environmental protection; the establishment of a local safety committee to advise on risk assessments; classification of all activities into one of four categories related to the degree of risk; notification to the competent authority of an intention to use premises for genetic modification for the first time; notification to the competent authority of individual activities other than those defined as of no or negligible risk, and the preparation of an emergency plan for any reasonably foreseeable accident.</p>

  <p>Enforcement of the contained use regulations is the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive. Their inspectors have extensive powers to enter premises and to require the production of relevant documentation.</p>

  <p>This information is not currently available in the form requested. The Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education is currently working with ISD Scotland to map the characteristics and supply dynamics for the dental workforce in Scotland. This is a particularly complex task, and involves detailed analysis of data for those undertaking dental vocational training in Scotland. It is expected that the project will report in the next three to six months.</p>

  <p>In 1999, Strathclyde police were involved in trials of drug recognition techniques and field impairment testing. An evaluation found that the techniques helped police in identifying those whose driving might be impaired through drugs. The research findings on the evaluation are published on the DTLR website at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive agrees with the European Committee&#8217;s proposal that zonal management committees should be set up under a reformed common fisheries policy. The committee&#8217;s report recommends delegated decision-making powers only after an appropriate transition period. The Executive envisages zonal committees initially having an advisory role but that their scope and function should be subject to periodic review.</p>

  <p>Assuming the question refers to EU fisheries-related meetings, the Council of Ministers holds regular meetings at both working group and COREPER levels.

  <p>Factor VIII concentrates issued by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Services SNBTS since December 1984 have been heat-treated. Initially this heat treatment was to 68&#186;C but SNBTS subsequently developed a new product able to withstand a more severe heat treatment to 80&#176; C.</p>

  <p>This new product first became available for routine use in late April 1987 but in order to establish patient tolerability it was phased into use carefully over a number of weeks. I understand that all haemophilia A patients in Scotland who were being treated with SNBTS Factor VIII were receiving the new product by early August 1987, by which time any residual use of the SNBTS 68&#176; C treated product had ceased.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is hosting a campaign called &quot;Make <i> </i> it <i> </i> in <i> </i> Scotland&quot; <i>, </i> which will challenge young people&#8217;s perceptions of the manufacturing industry and better inform career choices. At the core of the campaign is a series of local roadshows for S2 pupils.</p>

  <p>Roadshows will involve young people from local and national companies running hands-on activities that will challenge perceptions of manufacturing. A website aimed at the pupils themselves, a teaching pack for schools and a branding initiative are also supporting the campaign.</p>

  <p>We are building on the successful pilot work undertaken in East Ayrshire in January-March 2001. In the 2001-02 session there will be an opportunity for S2 pupils in Ayrshire, Glasgow and Angus to attend a local roadshow. We plan to rollout the campaign nationwide for all S2 pupils in Scotland in the 2002-03 academic year.</p>

  <p>Chief constables are responsible for recruiting and training police surgeons in their areas. A range of training is employed by Scottish forces. This includes study towards the diploma in forensic medicine and the diploma in medical jurisprudence, undertaking forensic medical examiners course, attending the Edinburgh coloscopy course and the Newcastle child abuse facility, induction training with paediatric staff, development and advanced training on sexual assaults and child abuse and attendance at conferences of the Association of Police Surgeons.</p>

  <p>I am aware of the potential impact on the Glasgow underground of the Commission&#8217;s proposal for an EU regulation on public service requirements and the award of public service contracts in passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterways. I highlighted the Glasgow situation when I addressed the EU transport council in Luxembourg in June as part of the UK delegation. The draft regulation has a long way to go through the EU process and the Executive will ensure that Scotland&#8217;s interests are reflected through the UK stance throughout these negotiations.</p>

  <p>Predators of red squirrels include domestic dogs and cats, some members of the weasel and stoat family and some birds of prey. The main threats to red squirrels come from competition from grey squirrels and from habitat loss and fragmentation. Predation is not significant in the context of efforts to conserve the red squirrel. No action is therefore planned against red squirrel predators.</p>

  <p>Licences to kill or take red squirrels can be issued in terms of section 16(3) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). In each of the last 10 years the following licences have been issued:</p>
