  <p>As a tax measure, the Climate Change Levy is a matter reserved to the UK Parliament. However, Scottish companies are expected to benefit from reductions in Employers National Insurance contributions funded from CCL revenue, and from a share of the &pound;100 million to be allocated each year from the CCL to provide Enhanced Capital Allowances to businesses making a range of approved energy efficient investments.</p>

  <p>In addition, &pound;50 million each year from the CCL will be used for the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy measures across the UK. The Scottish Executive will receive a share of that money to be spent on such measures. Negotiations on the precise amount will proceed as part of the 2000 spending review.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for authorities themselves to ensure that adequate provision is being made towards local authorities&#8217; pension funds. The cost of pension funds are met from current expenditure and do not have any implications for local authority capital budgets.

  <p>Existing indicators within the grant distribution system measure relative levels of deprivation across all council areas. As I announced to the Scottish Parliament on 8 December, we have agreed with CoSLA that the joint review we are undertaking of the impact of deprivation and poverty on council costs will consider both rural and urban areas in grant distribution. The review is due to report later this year in time to be implemented within the 2001-02 local government finance settlement.</p>

  <p>In line with our shared priorities, we agreed with CoSLA that the special deprivation payments for 2000-01 should be targeted at those councils facing higher levels of deprivation, as measured by above average numbers of Income Support recipients as a proportion of their total populations. This is in line with existing indicators of deprivation and poverty within the distribution system. The allocations to individual councils arise from this objective measure of relative deprivation.</p>

  <p>Payment arrangements are a matter between local authorities and individual suppliers. As noted in my response to question S1O-332, I spoke to Councillor Norman Murray, President of CoSLA, asking him to draw to the attention of councils the requirements of the Late Payment of Commercial Debt (Interest) Act 1998 and the importance of paying their bills on time. CoSLA wrote to all local authorities advising them of this on 1 October.</p>

  <p>The latest available information on the performance of councils in paying invoices within 30 days was published in the recent Accounts Commission pamphlet <i>Benefits, Finance and Housing 1998-99</i>. It reported that 19 councils had improved in terms of the percentage of invoices which they had paid on time during 1998-99, compared to the previous year.</p>

  <p>The Code of Management Practice for owner-occupied sheltered and retirement housing was prepared by a working group chaired by the Scottish Executive and comprising representatives of a wide range of interested parties. Its remit was to prepare a voluntary code. The code provides guidance on a wide range of detailed technical matters which are not appropriate for legislation.</p>

  <p>Although the code itself is voluntary, our proposals for the reform of property law in Scotland should make it much easier than at present for owners within a development to change their management company if they so wish. When this legislation is enacted, it should therefore be possible for owners to ensure that the management company for their development acts in accordance with the code. Prospective purchasers of owner-occupied and retirement houses will also be able to check, before purchasing, that the management company agrees to comply with the code.</p>

  <p>We have provided funding to Age Concern to establish an advice and information service in Scotland on owner-occupied sheltered and retirement housing. This service will be able to provide advice on the code to existing owners, prospective owners and management companies.</p>

  <p>Officials of the then Scottish Office were part of the Utilities Review team set up by the Government to look at the regulation of utilities, and have since worked closely with the Department of Trade and Industry in preparing the Bill. As in England and Wales, the Bill, once enacted, will make changes to the structure of the electricity supply industry which are expected to lead to reductions in electricity bills. The Bill also makes provision for a separate renewables obligation in Scotland, and for the continuation of the arrangements that ensure electricity consumers in the North and West do not pay more for their electricity solely because of their geographical location.</p>
