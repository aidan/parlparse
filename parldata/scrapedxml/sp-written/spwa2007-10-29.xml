  <p>The Scottish Arts Council, Scottish Screen and the National Collections, like other public bodies, are under a legal duty to promote disability equality and, following a duty placed on them by the Scottish Government in December 2005, all have published disability equality schemes setting out how they are meeting this duty.</p>

  <p>We have asked the Scottish Arts Council, Scottish Screen and the National Collections to commit to providing full and equal access for disabled people to the range of cultural events which they support. Their day-to-day practices generally reflect this commitment and are consistent with the disability equality schemes which they now have in place.</p>

  <p>In a patient-centred NHS we would expect people diagnosed with a physical disability to receive services tailored to their individual needs and to receive information about their condition and the health and social care services available to them which is accessible and appropriate.</p>

  <p><em>Achieving Fair Access,</em> our national guidance on improving access and removing the barriers which disabled people experience when they use NHS services, was published by <em>Fair for All </em>&ndash; Disability in April. It brings together good advice from a wide range of sources and gives details of publications and useful organisations which staff can follow up when they need to provide patients with more detailed information. The guidance will continue to be developed to reflect the growing practical experience of staff and when new policies are introduced.

  <p>The delivery of a successful modern apprenticeship programme will be the responsibility of the new skills body and it will be for them to establish effective mechanisms to help the retention of individuals undertaking a modern apprenticeship.

  <p>The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) will be embedded in all modern apprentices programmes so that apprentices can gain credit for the skills gained which can then be transferred to further study or training.</p>

  <p>The SCQF provides a framework for both learners and training providers to understand the range of Scottish qualifications and how they compare to each other and through the transfer of credit allows learners greater flexibility to move from one sector of learning to another. This will help to support progression for apprentices to other qualifications.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are responsible for co-ordinating the assessment of the care needs of people living in their own homes and ensuring, with their local partners, that appropriate provision is made to meet those needs.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission regulates agencies which provide care to people in their own homes, taking account of the National Care Standards for Care at Home.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Social Work Inspection Agency (SWIA) has a programme for inspecting social work services delivered by local authorities across Scotland by early 2009. These inspections will include consideration of the quality and provision of care at home services.</p>

  <p>Twenty sets of regulations and orders have already been made under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005. The final Commencement Order for the act was made on 18 October. Following recent consultations, further regulations on fees and defining relevant offences will be made shortly in good time to ensure the successful operation of the act once the transition period starts on 1 February 2008.

  <p>I understand that West Lothian Council works in collaboration with NHS Lothian to provide a range of social care services for people with mental health problems and also their carers. Social Work and Mental Health Services provide support for named persons, parents, primary carers, partners and children of women with mental health problems on an &quot;as required&quot; basis, meeting statutory and legislative requirements.</p>

  <p>NHS Lothian have told me that women in West Lothian with mental health problems have access to a range of general psychiatry in-patient and out-patient facilities. Women with mental health and offending mental health behaviour problems have access to assertive outreach, community day and out-patient care services across West Lothian. I understand that there are no specialist mental health beds in West Lothian for women who have offended or are at risk of offending. Depending on the individual risk assessments, patients may be admitted to an intensive psychiatric care unit or to a general psychiatry ward. Where appropriate, women offenders can be referred to the Forensic Psychiatry Service at the Orchard Clinic in the Royal Edinburgh Hospital which provides acute psychiatric and mental health services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has allocated funding to support the appointment of rehabilitation co-ordinators, for each health board area, for a period of two years. These posts are likely to be introduced later in the year and &pound;10,000 per NHS board has been allocated this year for this purpose. Subsequent funding will be subject to the current Spending Review.</p>

  <p>No specific funding was allocated towards the costs of implementing the falls prevention aspects of HDL (2007) 13. Research identified by the Falls Working Group indicated that up to 30% of falls amongst older people living in the community could be prevented through appropriate multidisciplinary assessment, with associated cost savings for local health services.</p>

  <p>Health department letter HDL (2007) 13 asks all health boards to take the lead in developing a combined falls prevention and bone health strategy by the end of 2007-08, under which Community Health Partnerships can establish operational implementation strategies to be led by a falls prevention lead or co-ordinator. The letter acknowledged that actual timescales would depend on current falls prevention activity within each area. The Scottish Government will monitor progress towards the end of 2007-08.</p>

  <p>No financial estimates have been made for the costs of preparing falls prevention strategies or appointing falls prevention leads or co-ordinators. This is a matter for local health boards and Community Health Partnerships. A reduction in preventable falls should provide cost savings for health services.</p>

  <p>Information on the cost of treating specific clinical conditions is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>Total running costs for the acute surgical specialty of orthopaedics (where much of the hospital-based treatment for fractures takes place) are published in the Scottish Health Service Costs (Costs Book) at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/costs-book-detailed-tables.jsp?pContentID=3583." target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/costs-book-detailed-tables.jsp?pContentID=3583.</a></p>

  <p>Only a proportion of the work undertaken within the orthopaedic specialty will be related to fractures.</p>

  <p>The information requested is given in table number 1, which shows the total number of fractures and osteoporotic fractures, and the percentage of all fractures that are osteoporotic for each NHS board since 1999, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43898).</p>

  <p>Schools are working towards achieving two hours PE. The Scottish Government is clear that learning through quality physical education and physical activity makes an important contribution to young people&rsquo;s development, both in promoting their health and wellbeing and enabling sporting success. Physical education will be an important element of the outcomes for health and wellbeing which are being drafted as part of the work on Curriculum for Excellence. However, the curriculum is not based on statute and it will be up to local authorities and schools to decide how they take forward the outcomes.</p>

  <p>Funding is made available to local authorities through a range of sources. This includes the block grant to each local authority and the National Priorities Action Fund which provides &pound;12 million in total for funding of out of school learning (which can include provision of sport). Local authorities will make their own decisions on allocations across primary and secondary schools based on their priorities and needs. Due to the nature of the funding and the range of activities it is not possible to provide the breakdown that is sought.</p>
