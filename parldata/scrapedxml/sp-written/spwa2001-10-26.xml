  <p>It is for the Scottish Ambulance Service to consult on proposals for operational changes.

This will include proposals for the implementation of priority-based dispatch, including arrangements for any further consultation which the service proposes to undertake.</p>

  <p>The guidance on the Central Heating Programme includes performance specifications for gas, oil and coal-fired wet central heating and electric storage heating systems. The specifications demand that all relevant legislation, regulatory requirements and manufacturers&#8217; instructions are met. The specifications also set out design principles and methods of installation that are fully in accordance with recognised good practice standards. The technical standards put in place by Glasgow City Council must at least match these requirements.</p>

  <p>The Central Heating Programme provides that local authorities will receive grant of up to &#163;2,500 per dwelling to install the heating and insulation package. Glasgow City Council have not advised us that they will have to add &#163;700 of their own money to meet the cost in every case. They are free to do so if they wish. Eaga, the Managing Agent for the private sector, can install the heating and insulation package at an average cost of &#163;2,500 per dwelling across all sectors of the stock.</p>

  <p>The Executive included considerable detail on safety in the performance specification for gas central heating. The specification states that all gas central heating systems must be installed in accordance with all relevant health and safety legislation. It also states that landlords are wholly responsible for ensuring that health and safety legislation and regulations are complied with. Further advice is given on the need for landlords to ensure that all subcontractors, agents, operatives and other representatives adhere strictly to health and safety regulation and that all personnel involved in the scheme are suitably qualified. Local authorities and housing associations are required to install carbon monoxide detectors (except where the heating system is electric) fire detectors and cold alarms as a condition of receiving grant under the Central Heating Programme. Eaga must install these alarms in the private sector.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether Glasgow City Council, as part of its Glasgow Action for Warm Homes policy, has specified the installation of condensing boilers for almost 10 years in order to achieve affordable fuel cost targets and whether the Scottish Executive will support the installation of condensing boilers as part of its central heating installation programme.</p>

  <p>It is for Glasgow City Council to answer questions about its central heating policy. The specification for the Executive&#8217;s Central Heating Programme does not prevent the council from continuing to specify condensing boilers in future improvement works, providing they come within the &#163;2,500 grant or the council pays the balance itself.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether not installing condensing boilers under its central heating installation programme will result in higher running costs for tenants and lower savings in energy and CO <sub>2</sub> emissions in the future than would be the case if they were installed.</p>

  <p>It need not have this effect. The industry standard is the Seasonal Efficiency of Domestic Boilers in the UK database which categorises central heating systems by bands. Band D contains high efficiency non-condensing boilers with modulating burners which operate at efficiencies equal to some condensing boilers. The similar performance of some condensing and non-condensing boilers was influential in deciding to specify a minimum annual seasonal efficiency of 78 per cent for gas fired boilers in the performance specifications for the Central Heating Programme.</p>

  <p>We are taking forward the recommendation to create an ombudsman to investigate complaints against the enterprise networks as part of our wider exercise to establish modern arrangements for public sector ombudsmen in Scotland. In July we published a paper, <i>A Modern Complaints System</i> , which set out detailed proposals, including the proposal that the External Complaints Adjudicators of Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be wound-up and that the Enterprise Networks would fall within the remit of the proposed Scottish Public Sector Ombudsman. The main function of the new ombudsman will be to investigate claims of injustice resulting from maladministration.</p>

  <p>In his statement to Parliament last month the First Minister confirmed our intention to introduce the Scottish Public Sector Ombudsman Bill later this year.</p>

  <p>The Homelessness Task Force, which I chair, is considering, amongst other things, the need for improved housing provision, advice and support for the resettlement of people leaving institutions and other vulnerable groups.</p>

  <p>The Code of Guidance on Homelessness also identifies people with mental illness as potentially vulnerable, and therefore in priority need. In addition, action through the Rough Sleepers Initiative is targeted on people with complex needs, including those with mental health problems. I also refer the member to the answer given to question S1F-1252 on 20 September 2001, in relation to health, including mental health, and homelessness issues.</p>

The policy of the Executive is, as a general rule, not to disclose that legal advice has been obtained on any particular matter, or to disclose the content or source of any such legal advice.

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) has made at Polmont significant investment to enhance the capabilities of the various workshops by the introduction of new machinery. Additionally, a paint finishing plant is being installed. This investment should provide further workplaces and training opportunities, as well as making work more interesting. Polmont has also introduced two further training areas, an Information Technology and Business Centre and Vocational Training Painting and Decorating. Both these areas will deliver quality and certificated training.</p>

  <p>As a result of the new staff attendance work patterns SPS introduced at Polmont on 1 October 2001, and if more contract work can be sourced, we hope to introduce a workshop efficiency scheme similar to those already established in some other SPS establishments, but without restricting numbers or insisting on full attendance throughout the working week. This would ensure that time for education programmes and PE is maintained. Production through each workshop is monitored on a weekly basis and used to compile annual report statistics on value of production. Polmont also intend to carry out daily monitoring of workshop attendance records.</p>

  <p>I announced in November 1999 that five schemes, including the A1, will proceed to construction over the next three years. I had envisaged that, subject to satisfactory progress on the completion of the necessary statutory procedures, construction could begin in 2001. However, that process has taken slightly longer than envisaged in 1999, due to a combination of objections which required to be considered fully and the impact of foot-and-mouth disease, which delayed ground construction work and topographical surveys.</p>

  <p>The necessary procedures were completed in August 2001 and tenders were promptly invited for the construction work. I hope to see that work start in summer 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not undertaken an environmental impact assessment of the slip roads at East Linton.

  <p>Guidance on the curriculum recommends one hour&#8217;s physical exercise per week for all pupils up to the age of 16. The Scottish Executive has encouraged schools to promote physical exercise in recent years through a range of <strong></strong> sportscotland initiatives which include: the TOPS programmes (resources for schools and training for teachers), the Active Primary Schools programme (being piloted in a number of education authorities) and the School Sport Co-ordinator programme.</p>

  <p>Funding of &#163;143,900 has been provided for school sport co-ordinators who cover 13 schools in South Lanarkshire, in which Clydesdale is located. Awards of &#163;12,500 each have also been made to two independent schools in the area. South Lanarkshire has also benefitted from TOPS programme funding of &#163;173,910, which will I&#8217;m sure help support the council&#8217;s policy of encouraging physical activity in its schools.</p>

  <p>The eligibility issue cannot be dealt with by either <strong></strong> sportscotland or the Scottish Sports Association as the jurisdiction in all cases is with separate international federations whose members are individual national governing bodies of sport.

  <p>The idea of incorporating the area of the Royal Park comprising the site of the former Royal High School playing fields as landscaping around Holyrood dates back to Enric Miralles&#8217; earliest concept for the Parliament project. The Parliament is the client for these works and the finalised scheme design was approved by the Corporate Body earlier this year.</p>

  <p>The land in question was owned by Scottish ministers and under the jurisdiction of Historic Scotland. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body has concluded that this was not a satisfactory long-term arrangement, considering in particular the issue of responsibility for maintenance of the landscaped area. For this reason, we have agreed with Scottish ministers that the Parliament will buy this portion of land. The District Valuer has valued the land at &#163;20,000 and this sum will be transferred to Historic Scotland from the Holyrood Capital Budget. The budget assigned to the landscape scheme will be transferred by the Scottish Executive to the Parliament. The transfer of the land and budget will take effect from 17th October 2001. In all other respects the work will proceed as planned.</p>
