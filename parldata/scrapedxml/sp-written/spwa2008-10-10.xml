  <p>The Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) collects this data, but only for the years 2002, 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 of the last five years.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. All figures shown exclude managing agent fees and VAT, at 5% for grant measures.</p>

  <p>2. The information includes all the insulation costs associated with each central heating installation.</p>

  <p>3. The information provided for 2008-09 is to the end of August. As the central heating programme is a demand led scheme no accurate figure is available for the projected spend on oil systems until the end of 2008.</p>

  <p>4. The managing agent contract transferred from Eaga Partnership to Scottish Gas during 2006-07, so the figure for 2006-07 includes installations undertaken by both.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Housing Association Grant is now calculated on the basis that rents are assumed to rise at RPI +1% - this is the rate which associations tell us they have in their plans. There is no reason why our bringing our assumption into line with those plans should result in rents rising any further or in general issues of affordability.</p>

  <p>Costs will be determined by the market. In 2003, the Housing Improvement Task Force estimated the cost of a Single Survey at around &pound;440 for an average Scottish house. The Regulatory Impact Assessment, published in December 2007, allowed for price inflation and employed a 20% confidence interval to reflect varying market conditions on the cost estimate, giving a cost range of &pound;360 to &pound;520 for a single survey for an average house. These figures do not include VAT and do not include the costs of the Energy Report (An EU requirement from 4 January 2009) (estimated at &pound;100).</p>

  <p>The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has estimated that the likely fee for the Single Survey and Energy Report, which are to be prepared by a Chartered Surveyor, will be in the order of &pound;500-700 excluding VAT, for an average house in average condition. The property questionnaire is prepared by the seller of the house, so costs are likely to be minimal or nil.</p>

  <p>A &quot;scheme 2 Homebuyer&rsquo;s Survey and Valuation&quot;, which is a more detailed condition survey and is akin to the survey provided within the Home Report Package, currently costs on average between &pound;400 and &pound;600. A Mortgage Valuation Report, which contains very little information on the condition of a house and is described by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors as an inspection and not a survey has an average fee of around &pound;150. As with all survey products, the fee for this varies according to the size and condition of the house in question.</p>

  <p>The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have confirmed that the aspects of the home report which are carried out by a Chartered Surveyors will cost between &pound;500-700 for an average property in average condition. The cost reflects the additional information in the survey that a surveyor will produce, which includes an Energy Performance Certificate that is required by EU law from 4 January and would otherwise cost in the region of &pound;100. It also reflects the surveyor&rsquo;s additional formal liability to the buyer as well as the seller. We understand that the current cost of a Scheme 2 Homebuyer&rsquo;s Survey and Valuation is between &pound;400-600.</p>

  <p>As the Single Survey and the Energy Report with and Energy Performance Certificate are prepared by a Chartered Surveyor, the seller will be charged one fee. The property questionnaire is prepared by the seller of the house, so costs are likely to be minimal or nil.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper, <em>A Fairer Local Tax for Scotland</em> , highlighted our view that collection by HM Revenue and Customs is the most efficient way of delivering a local income tax. Discussions with the UK Government are ongoing to this effect.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government ministers base their use of the Government Car Service on clear guidance which has applied to all administrations since devolution. They are assiduous in doing so.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-16372 by Stewart Stevenson on 1 October 2008, why it was unable to provide a substantive answer to question S3W-15925 when it was originally due for answer, given that the question sought confirmation of whether Transport Scotland had delivered to ministers its findings from the strategic transport projects review.</p>

  <p>Due to an administrative error, the answer to question S3W-15925 was not sent to the Parliament by the due date. The answer the member received on the 16 September 2008, &quot;I shall reply to the member as soon as possible&quot;, is the standard reply issued in cases where a full response to a parliamentary question has not been provided by the due date.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that the cost of a roundabout on the A92 trunk road at Monkstown would be in the region of &pound;1.5 million (excluding Statutory Undertaker costs). A staggered junction improvement at Cairnfield junction is estimated to cost in the region of &pound;750,000 (excluding Statutory Undertaker costs). Estimated costs for new lighting at Cairnfield junction, upgrading of Redhouse roundabout and Preston to Balfarg dualling are not available as feasibility studies would require to be carried out to determine estimated costs.</p>
