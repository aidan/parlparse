  <p>On 28 September 2009, the Scottish Government and COSLA issued to local authorities joint guidance on National Standard Eligibility Criteria and Waiting Times for the Personal and Nursing Care of Older People. The guidance states that there will be, from 1 December, a national standard maximum waiting time, for people assessed as being at critical or substantial risk, of six weeks from confirmation of need to delivery of assessed personal and/or nursing care services. Arrangements for monitoring of the national standard will be implemented shortly.</p>

  <p>The guidance also makes it clear that it is not appropriate for delays with assessment processes to be used to manage access to or demand for social care services. However, in partnership with COSLA, we will keep under review the information we are asking councils to provide from April 2010 on the actual timescales between first referral and confirmation of need and consider what appropriate standard or standards might be applied in future.</p>

  <p>The information has never been held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, as amended by the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 (&quot;the 2002 Act&quot;), gives substantial and regular carers the right to request an assessment of their ability to care. The Children (Scotland) Act 1995, as amended by the 2002 Act, gives substantial and regular carers of a child with disabilities the right to request an assessment of their ability to care.</p>

  <p>Our framework of outcomes for carers and service users, Talking Points, focuses on the outcomes that carers wish to achieve from the assessment process. Our National Minimum Information Standards reiterate this position.</p>

  <p>We are working with partners so that they better understand the importance of the carer&rsquo;s assessment, to increase uptake and to advance this as a means of ensuring better outcomes for unpaid carers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Carers Strategy for Scotland, to be published in the first half of this year, will highlight good practice in the carrying out of carers and young carers&rsquo; assessments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s recent consultation on an Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Scotland, which closed on 5 January 2010, welcomed views on any energy saving scheme, including potential incentives to replace inefficient boilers. We will now analyse responses to the consultation and develop the final action plan, which will be published in the spring.</p>

  <p>Our &pound;2 million Energy Saving Scotland Home Loans pathfinder initiative is already providing interest-free loans to help Scottish householders upgrade to a more energy efficient boiler. We are also providing free or discounted boilers to thousands of households through the Energy Assistance Package, aimed at tackling the causes of fuel poverty and backed by &pound;60 million this financial year.</p>

  <p>COSLA has issued guidance on charging for non-residential social care services. The aim of that guidance is to achieve consistency across local authorities. The guidance is not intended to produce uniformity but to provide discretion to councils to establish their own charging policies in order to align with local priorities and local needs.</p>

  <p>COSLA have assured the Scottish Government that they will respond to public concern on charging for home care by ensuring that local authorities are better sighted on the charging regimes in place across Scotland. They are also exploring the possibility of a web-based resource for councils to ensure that individual charging policies could be effectively bench-marked.</p>

  <p>The issue of community optometrists&rsquo; involvement in the Diabetic Retinopathy Screening (DRS) Programme was raised in the consultation on the revision of the 2006 Diabetes Action Plan. Further thinking on the subject will be set out in the revised action plan, which we expect the Scottish Diabetes Group to submit later this year. This will draw on the assessment of a pilot project in NHS Highland and NHS Borders, under which community optometrists have captured retinal images for the DRS Programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Race Equality Statement, published in December 2008, highlights the needs of Gypsies/Travellers as a priority in race equality work.</p>

  <p>We are working to make sure that the policies we develop and the activities we undertake can be of benefit across all our communities.

  <p>I have asked Michael Cameron, Acting Chief Executive of the Scottish Housing Regulator to respond.</p>

  <p>His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Some registered social landlords set up subsidiaries to run their factoring services. These subsidiaries are not subject to our full financial analysis. However, from the information submitted to us by registered social landlords operating in Glasgow and the West of Scotland we know that in 2008-09 they received income of around &pound;10.6 million for providing services to owners of around 58,000 properties. This equates to an average annual charge of &pound;183 per property or &pound;45 per quarter. We have however included Glasgow Housing Association&rsquo;s subsidiary in that &pound;10.6 million figure due to its material effect on the sector.</p>

  <p>It is likely that the figure of &pound;10.6 million above covers administrative charges and the costs of routine factoring services but not all the costs of major capital works recharged to owners.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 established assured and short assured tenancies. In these tenancies, unlike regulated tenancies, private landlords can set rents at market rates. Deregulation allowed the market to regulate the balance between demand and supply in the private rented sector.</p>

  <p>However, there are protections for private tenants. Under sections 24 and 25 of the 1988 act, a tenant with an assured tenancy can apply to the Private Rented Housing Panel if the landlord proposes to increase the rent and the tenant does not agree that the proposed level is reasonable. A Private Rented Housing Committee will then determine a market rent for the property. Under section 34, a tenant with a short assured tenancy can ask a Private Rented Housing Committee to set a reasonable rent, which it will do if the rent being charged is significantly higher than that level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not consider that it would be appropriate for it to intervene in the setting of rent levels for assured and short assured tenancies, which could discourage landlords from making properties available to let and lead to an increase in homelessness. As our Review of the Private Rented Sector made clear, we are committed to encouraging the development of the private rented sector so that it can play a full part in providing good quality accommodation to meet a range of housing needs.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The number of cases dealt with in a year does not match the number of accused &ndash; a case may contain more than one accused.</p>

  <p>2. The information for this question has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>3. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>In November 2008, I announced that, with immediate effect, all new build hospital projects should provide 100% provision of single room accommodation, and that there should be a move to a minimum of 50% provision in future refurbishment projects. This policy was implemented with immediate effect to schemes in excess of board&rsquo;s delegated limits that had not yet submitted outline business cases.

  <p>Neuromodulation surgery can be undertaken in an outpatient setting or as inpatient or day case treatment. The current 15 weeks waiting times standard for outpatients only relates to first outpatient consultation following referral and does not cover subsequent treatment undertaken in outpatients. Neuromodulation surgery undertaken as either inpatient or day case is covered by the current 15 weeks maximum waiting time standard.</p>

  <p>Neuromodulation surgery undertaken in an outpatient setting will however be covered by the 18 weeks referral to treatment target which is due to be delivered by the end of 2011. NHS boards are now working to reduce long waits in services previously excluded from waiting time standards to ensure delivery of the 18 weeks referral to treatment target.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire have established a range of measures along with their local authority partners to ensure no patients are delayed in hospital for longer than necessary, but it is the &quot;whole system&quot; approach by the partnership which includes good communication between agencies and the use of flexible and responsive support services which collectively deliver good outcomes.</p>

  <p>The partnership in Lanarkshire has been successful in recording no patients delayed for longer than the agreed six week discharge period from April 2008 until October 2009. Unfortunately, due to an unexpected increase in hospital activity, eight patients were delayed at October in Lanarkshire hospitals. I understand the partnership has now recovered the position.</p>

  <p>NHS boards and local authorities are expected to work within their combined resources to manage delayed discharge. &pound;29 million previously earmarked for delayed discharge, was added to the overall local government settlement in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>The Lanarkshire partnership has been very successful in tackling delayed discharges. They have identified up to &pound;500,000 to enhance routine services over the winter period to ensure that success continues.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and trunk road operators have their own contracts with salt suppliers and government quite rightly cannot interfere with these. However, the Scottish Government is doing everything possible to support councils and operators in keeping disruption to a minimum during this difficult weather.</p>

  <p>Following discussion with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives on 28 December 2009, Scottish Resilience officials first e-mailed Scotland&rsquo;s 32 local authorities on 29 December requesting information on salt/grit supplies. Returns were collated on 30 December and this data has been updated daily since 1 January 2010. To ensure that operators and suppliers work together to agree the most effective distribution and use of available salt supplies in order to minimise the risk to public safety, this information has been shared at a pan-Scotland level with COSLA, SOLACE, Transport Scotland and with regional resilience contacts. Information has also been collated at a UK level and shared with the three main UK salt suppliers, for their customers only, to inform their delivery schedules.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government has also established a Scottish Salt Cell, to support and advise councils and operators in managing the current supply and demand for salt and to explore options for securing alternative supplies.</p>

The committee has been chaired by the First Minister and attendance has included a number of cabinet secretaries and ministers depending on how events have impacted across their portfolio responsibilities. Ministers are also supported in these meetings by a wide range of officials.</p>

  <p>In addition to meetings of the Cabinet Sub-Committee, the Scottish Government Resilience Room has supported a range of activity and further stakeholder discussions to support and advise Scotland&rsquo;s public sector organisations during the recent period of severe winter weather.</p>
