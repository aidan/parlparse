  <p>The decision to merge the North East and North and West operating divisions of the Scottish Ambulance Service was taken by its Chief Executive on 30 January 2008. This was an operational decision and it was not put to ministers for approval. There was no prior public consultation, nor was there a requirement to do so. Partnership Information Network guidelines are being followed as the general manager of the merged north division takes forward a programme of consultation and engagement around any administrative redesign.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS boards to manage the process by which they make operational decisions, including any decisions to merge operating divisions. The Scottish Ambulance Service has not discussed proposals or plans to merge any of its operating divisions with ministers or officials. The Scottish Ambulance Service has confirmed that it has no plans to merge any other operating divisions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not consider that a merger of operating divisions of the Scottish Ambulance Service constitutes a plan or proposal to reconfigure the delivery of health services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) continues to provide safe, efficient and effective services to patients across Scotland, including those in remote and rural areas. It is also important that patients have confidence in the ambulance service&rsquo;s ability to respond to emergencies.</p>

  <p>While this presents particular challenges in remote and rural locations, the service seeks to improve performance for all patients and remains keen to seek local solutions that meet the needs of those communities. In addition, the Scottish Ambulance Service has appointed a first responder co-ordinator in this area to develop and support first responder schemes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Islamic Foundation was one of 53 different organisations which received a total of &pound;3.4 million during the 2007-08 financial year from resources administered by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Equality Unit for projects and initiatives relating to race, religion and refugee integration. All three of the individual funding payments to the Scottish Islamic Foundation for &pound;10,152; &pound;5,600 and &pound;200,000 came from this source which gave grants to individual organisations ranging from &pound;3,250 to &pound;605,000.</p>

  <p>Ministers in the previous government, considered proposals for an Islam fest and, in March 2007, agreed in principle that such an event be developed and financially supported. The Scottish Government has taken this forward by providing &pound;200,000 to the Scottish Islamic Foundation to develop IslamFest for Scotland. This event will be open to, and welcoming of, all of Scotland&rsquo;s diverse communities and aims to inform about the different strands of Islamic culture and promote constructive dialogue between Muslim and non-Muslim communities, as well as develop trade and investment opportunities for Scotland. The Scottish Government applies grant conditions which ensure that government funding cannot be used for political propaganda and that grantees comply with legislation which includes the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended 2000) to eliminate racial discrimination; promote equality of opportunity and promote good relations between people of different racial groups.</p>

  <p>The income assessment being used for the national programme of EMAs in Scotland is based on that used by HM Revenue and Customs in their Tax Credit Awards. The household income assessment takes account of the income of those adults who have a caring responsibility for the children in their family household. This approach is consistent with the rest of the UK and is considered to be a fair measure of the financial resources each household has to meet its needs.</p>

  <p>It is clear that there is support for a new ferry service between Lochboisdale and Mallaig serving South Uist from the communities of South Uist, what is not clear is the level of support for such a service also serving Barra from the Barra communities. That is why Comhairle nan Eilean Siar are taking forward a consultative process to ascertain the views of all the communities in Barra and South Uist. The Scottish Government supports this initiative.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*The Scottish Ambulance Service IT systems record data under the previous structure of 15 geographic health boards.</p>

  <p>**A cancellation is defined as the cancellation of a pre-booked appointment on the previous day. It is counted as a cancellation while the ambulance service has control over the process, and prior to completion of the planning process for the next day. Any journey which is cancelled on the same day as it was due to take place is counted as an aborted journey. Where the SAS has not been notified of a cancellation and proceeds to pick up the patient, which is counted as an abort and the return journey is also counted as an abort rather than a cancellation.</p>

  <p>***Cancellations are not included in total PTS journeys but aborts are included as these remain on the vehicle run schedule for the day.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to review the operation of the Patient Transport Service (PTS). However, the PTS will be discussed as part of the public annual review of the Scottish Ambulance Service on 24 September. In addition, the Scottish Ambulance Service is currently in the process of revising its Patient Transport Service Strategy. As part of that process, the results of an extensive survey of service users and strategic stakeholder views on aspects of the service is currently being analysed for consideration by the SAS board.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how the Healthcare Associated Infection Task Force has fulfilled its remit to monitor levels of hospital-acquired infection and the efficacy of measures taken in general and specifically in relation to Clostridium difficile.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-09-03.S3W-15576.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0903.htm#14">

  <p>The principal measurements of the levels of healthcare associated infection (HAI) in Scotland have been the long-standing national mandatory and voluntary HAI surveillance schemes, most recently mandated by HDL(2006)38 and the National HAI Point Prevalence Survey carried out by Health Protection Scotland. The mandatory elements of surveillance currently include MRSA bacteraemias, Clostridium difficile and selected surgical site infections. I am pleased to note that MRSA bacteraemias in Scotland have shown a significant decrease since April 2006, and that orthopaedic surgery (hip and knee replacement) and caesarean section infection rates have also declined &ndash; see <a href="http://www.documents.hps.scot.nhs.uk/hai/sshaip/publications/ssi/ssi-2007.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.documents.hps.scot.nhs.uk/hai/sshaip/publications/ssi/ssi-2007.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>On 11 July 2007, I announced the publication of the Scottish Point Prevalence Survey which, for the first time, provides us with a comprehensive picture of the rate of HAI in every acute Scottish hospital and in a representative sample of community hospitals. The publication of the survey led to the preparation of a three year HAI Task Force Delivery Plan, which came into affect on 1 April 2008. The Delivery Plan is being backed with &pound;54 million of Scottish Government funding over the next three years and a second Point Prevalence Survey is scheduled for 2011. The delivery plan is available from <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/03/07110818/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/03/07110818/0</a>.</p>

  <p>Mandatory reporting on compliance with hand hygiene and cleaning performance are regularly monitored and reviewed by the HAI Task Force so they remain fit for purpose. I am pleased to note that both these schemes have shown substantial improvements in hand hygiene and cleaning since their implementation, and these are both key areas in the prevention of Clostridium difficile as well as other HAIs.</p>

  <p>Another key document relevant to Clostridium difficile is the Scottish Management of Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan (ScotMARAP), which I launched in March. ScotMARAP outlines the national programme for Scotland in tackling antimicrobial resistance and prudent prescribing over the next five years. The expert Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group (SAPG) has been established to take this forward, and is now starting a programme of work which all the evidence suggests will have a significant effect in prevention of Clostridium difficile infections.</p>

  <p>The HAI Task Force has also commissioned extensive staff training resources from NHS Education for Scotland, notably the Cleanliness Champions programme. This programme continues to expand, and has been used in postgraduate and undergraduate training for health professionals here and in other UK countries. In addition, The recently revised NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) HAI Standards is a key document against which all NHS boards are assessed, both in terms of their organisational structures and practical compliance with HAI policies.</p>

  <p>In relation to Clostridium difficile specifically, I refer the member to the announcement I made on 7 August about the publication of both our new National HAI Action Plan and the HAI Action Plan specific to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Both Action Plans are available from the HAI Task Force website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/NHS-Scotland/19529/2005/actionplans" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/NHS-Scotland/19529/2005/actionplans</a>.</p>

  <p>These additional plans will be fully integrated into our existing national HAI Task Force programme.</p>

  <p>We are always willing to learn from other countries, and the Scottish Government has done so for many years. Our key stakeholders on the HAI Task Force are in regular contact with their counterparts around the world &ndash; including the Department of Health &ndash; so both they and we can learn from each other on the most effective approaches that are being taken towards tackling Clostridium difficile and other Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs). It is also the case that both the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health Directorate and the Scottish Infection Research Network (SIRN) at Glasgow University encourage and support innovative research and projects into HAI to ensure that our approach continues to evolve.</p>

  <p>Sections 15 to 17 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 would place a duty on local authorities to ensure that the political balance on council committees reflects the political balance on the council itself. These sections have not been fully brought into force in Scotland, primarily because successive administrations have wished the issue to be addressed on a voluntary basis rather than by the imposition of a statutory duty on councils.</p>

  <p><em>Skills for Scotland,</em> our skills strategy published in September 2007, clearly signalled that we fully supported the all age nature of the modern apprenticeship (MA) programme, but we recognised the need for us to prioritise our resources, therefore we committed to look at the structures and funding mechanisms needed to support the MA programme.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the MA programme carried out by Cambridge Policy Consultants in November 2006 gathered the views of trainees, employers and other key stakeholders and this, alongside the views expressed during the last administration&rsquo;s consultation, <em>Improving Modern Apprenticeships</em>, which was carried out in 2006, informed our thinking when considering refocusing our national training programmes.</p>

  <p>Data for 2006 is unavailable due to the non-direct match between Whitley Council grades and new Agenda for Change grades.

  <p>This would be a matter for traffic authorities to consider.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have considerable powers and flexibility with regard to the introduction of 20mph speed limits. They have power to introduce mandatory 20mph zones, where engineering measures are a standard feature to ensure that the zones are self-enforcing, and mandatory 20mph speed limits, with or without traffic calming measures, and mandatory part-time 20mph limits. They can also introduce advisory 20mph speed limits at suitable locations, with the aim of making roads safer. Many 20mph speed limit schemes already exist across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that these lower speed limits can contribute to road safety by making drivers aware of the appropriate speed for the area.</p>

  <p>Currently, there are nine special advisers of whom one is a part-time unpaid appointment. The most recent special adviser, Stuart Nicolson, was appointed on 18 August 2008 to advise on communications issues. Duncan Hamilton, political adviser to the First Minister, took up his part-time post last year on the basis that he would serve for approximately one year, and therefore demitted his position with effect from 31 August 2008. His responsibilities are now being undertaken by Jennifer Dempsie.</p>
