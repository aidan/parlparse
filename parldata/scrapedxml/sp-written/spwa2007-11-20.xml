  <p>This government is committed not only to ensuring that the games in 2014 are the best sporting event that this country has ever seen, but also that the games are used as a catalyst for social change. We have an unrivalled opportunity to really use the power of sport to inspire people of all ages, but particularly our children to lead active and healthy lives.</p>

  <p>We will be developing an outline plan over the next 100 days on how we intend to secure that as part of a lasting legacy for everyone in Scotland from these games.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-4657 by Michael Russell on 24 October 2007, when it expects to reach a final conclusion on the action to be taken to address the implications for single farm payments of Scottish Natural Heritage management agreements and when farmers and crofters whose single farm payments have been affected by such agreements will be informed of the effect of the conclusion on their payments.</p>

  <p>Following extensive consideration it is now clear that the terms of the Financial Guidelines for management agreements do not provide Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) with any basis on which to make payments that compensate for loss of subsidies not linked to production such as single farm payments. The concessionary payments sought by land managers would not secure specific additional public benefit. On that basis, expenditure of public money for the purpose of making such concessionary payments could not be justified. SNH will inform land managers who have raised concerns about this issue with them as soon as possible. They will also be willing to advise on Rural Development Contract options under the Scotland Rural Development Programme.</p>

  <p>The national foster and kinship care strategy will be published by the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>I share the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care&rsquo;s (SIRCC) vision of residential child care as a positive option for some children and young people. The Scottish Government intends to identify, with SIRCC and other relevant organisations, proposals to support the residential child care sector to improve its contribution to the lives of and improved outcomes for vulnerable children.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s forthcoming National Foster and Kinship Care Strategy will recognise the need for more foster carers and it will set out ways of working with COSLA, local authorities and independent foster carer providers to identify more effective approaches to the local recruitment and retention of foster carers.</p>

  <p>The first annual inspection of fostering services by the Care Commission was published on 14 November and stated there were 527 children who are not in a foster placement of choice.</p>

  <p>The Social Work Inspection Agency&rsquo;s performance management inspection of each local authority&rsquo;s social work functions will record the number of places available in the local provision of foster and residential care and, where necessary, make recommendations for improvement.</p>

  <p>Each local authority is required by statute to prepare and publish, in consultation with partners in health and other agencies, a plan for the provision of relevant services for children in their area. This plan should cover services for children in need, including those in residential care.</p>

  <p>We are working with all partners on early diagnosis. Through this we would expect to see a more positive impact on the person and their diagnosis as the earliest possible intervention and support of the right services at the right time will have a much greater effect.</p>

  <p>The soon to be published NHS Quality Improvement Scotland standards for Integrated Care Pathways for mental health will underline that carefully considered assessment and early intervention provide the basis for successful care planning and delivery.</p>

  <p>Attention on the mental health needs of children and young people underlines another linked aspect, that of early age identification of needs. The work we are taking forward with NHS Education for Scotland focuses on training and developing child psychotherapists and at opportunities for wider education and reach including family therapy training. We are investing &pound;500,000 over the coming years towards this agenda.</p>

  <p>Our national and local public health and anti stigma campaigns also play a part in encouraging more to come forward sooner for help and advice.</p>

  <p>The following groups have been set up by the Scottish Government since 16 May 2007. For the avoidance of doubt, these are not formally constituted organisations. Most of the groups are short-life in nature and have been set up to provide external expertise and advice to support the government in the delivery of its commitments. I have included running costs where applicable for this financial year.</p>

  <p>Following the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review, over the next three years &pound;16 million of additional funds (&pound;4 million in 2008-09, &pound;6 million in 2009-10 and &pound;6 million in 2010-11) will be allocated to modernise and redesign NHS wheelchair and seating services.</p>

  <p>However, the additional resources will only be released following the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approval of robust, fully costed, business cases from each of the five wheelchair centres in Scotland, and taking into account the action plan on the implementation of those recommendations flowing from the independent review that will be of most benefit to all those who access the services.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-4584 on 18 October 2007.

  <p>The term &quot;routine condition&quot; is used to describe planned acute hospital admissions, in contrast to urgent or emergency admissions. Patients assessed by clinicians as requiring urgent or emergency admission will continue to be dealt with immediately, and consequently maximum waiting times targets are not relevant to them. Currently more than 55% of hospital patients are treated immediately and never go on to a waiting list.</p>

  <p>As already announced, the abolition of Availability Status Codes from 31 December 2007 will mean that thousands of patients previously excluded from waiting time targets will be included. I have already indicated that patients using audiology services will also be included in the 18 week GP referral to treatment target.</p>

  <p>The Young Persons Railcard is a Great Britain-wide discounted ticketing scheme operated by the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) on behalf of all train operating companies. The product is one of a series of discount schemes provided by the previous nationalised rail industry that was protected at the time of privatisation. First ScotRail is obliged by the terms of its franchise agreement to make the product available to passengers. The terms and conditions of the scheme are controlled through ATOC by a council drawing representation from all passenger train operating companies.

  <p>Latest estimates for the following projects:</p>

  <p>(i) Stirling/Alloa/Kincardine Rail Line</p>

  <p>The cost for the construction of the Stirling &ndash; Alloa &ndash; Kincardine project is currently estimated to be up to &pound;85 million and the project remains on target to commission in March 2008 with operational services forecast to commence in May 2008.</p>

  <p>(ii) Borders Rail Line</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland is continuing a due-diligence review of the Borders railway as it prepares to take on the role of Authorised Undertaker for the railway, a role that it is assuming at the behest of the previous Administration. Therefore, until this exercise is complete, it is not prudent to speculate what the final cost and date of completion of the project is likely to be.</p>

  <p>(iii) Airdrie to Bathgate Rail Line</p>

  <p>The estimated cost of the Airdrie to Bathgate rail line is an outturn of up to &pound;375 million, with a delivery date of December 2010.</p>

  <p>(iv) Glasgow Airport Rail Link</p>

  <p>As announced in Parliament on 27 June 2007, Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) and Network Rail (NR) are working together to combine the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) with NR&rsquo;s Paisley Corridor Renewal (PCR) project, with the consequence that GARL services would be introduced around a year later than previously advised.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland, SPT and NR have, over the Parliament&rsquo;s summer recess, worked to develop the detailed schedule, cost and risk models for the integrated projects and we will provide the Parliament with an update as soon as is possible.</p>

  <p>The integration of these two projects will minimise the disruption on what is one of Scotland&rsquo;s busiest rail corridors.</p>

  <p>(v) M74 Completion</p>

  <p>The current cost estimate is &pound;375 million to &pound;500 million. The project is currently being tendered and the final cost and delivery date will not be known until this process is concluded.</p>

  <p>(vi) Upgrade of the M80 Stepps to Haggs</p>

  <p>The current cost estimate is in the range &pound;130 million - &pound;150 million. The project is currently being tendered and the final cost will not be known until this process is concluded. We anticipate construction completion 2010-11</p>

  <p>(vii) M8 Baillieston to Newhouse Project</p>

  <p>The current cost estimate is in the range &pound;170 million - &pound;210 million, based on the risks as currently identified, but we will continue to monitor both in light of prevailing tender prices for roads contracts. We anticipate construction completion 2012-13.</p>

  <p>(viii) A90 Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route</p>

  <p>The current cost estimate is in the range &pound;295 million - &pound;395 million, based on the risks as currently identified, but we will continue to monitor both in light of prevailing tender prices for roads contracts. We anticipate construction completion by the end of 2012.</p>
