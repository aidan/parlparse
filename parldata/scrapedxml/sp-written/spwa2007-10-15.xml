  <p>Adoption &quot;at birth&quot; is impossible, because an adoption order can only be granted by a court after a complex assessment process, and the mother&rsquo;s agreement to offer a child for adoption is not valid if given less than six weeks after the child&rsquo;s birth. It is rare nowadays for an infant to be offered for adoption shortly after birth. The following table shows, for each year since 1987, the number of children aged under six months registered for adoption. The table also gives the total number of births registered each year. Because of the small numbers of adoptions involved, percentages have not been presented.</p>

  <p>The main costs will consist of the remuneration to panel members and their secretariat support. Panel members&rsquo; expenses will be reimbursed, and remuneration will be offered at a rate of &pound;400 a day, which is consistent with the current rate for members of the Mental Health Tribunal and other similar bodies. This panel is expected to devote 15 working days per person to undertaking its task in relation to the revised accident and emergency service proposals from NHS Ayrshire and Arran, at a total estimated cost (including expenses) of &pound;26,000.</p>

  <p>This panel&rsquo;s full-time secretariat consists of a secretariat manager, panel facilitator and secretariat officer. The secretariat also provides full-time support to the panel that is considering the NHS service proposals for the Clyde area, chaired by Professor Angus Mackay. Both panels commenced their work in September 2007 with Professor Mackay&rsquo;s panel scheduled to publish its report in late November. The panel chaired by Dr Andrew Walker that is considering the revised accident and emergency service proposals from NHS Ayrshire and Arran and NHS Lanarkshire is expected to produce its final report in early January 2008. The total estimated staffing cost for the secretariat for the period September 2007 to January 2008 is &pound;45,313.</p>

  <p>These are preliminary, estimated costs - I will publish the full, final costs in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre when the work of the two Independent Scrutiny Panels is complete. The cost of both panels is being met within existing Health Directorates budgets.</p>

  <p>Our action plan will include a new and ambitious target for NHS waiting times: a new whole journey waiting time target of 18 weeks from general practitioner referral to treatment. The action plan will set out how we intend to meet the target by December 2011, and the range of services to which it will apply.</p>

  <p>The registers of births, deaths and marriages, from which birth, death and marriage certificates (formally called &quot;extracts&quot;) are drawn, are public documents. The Registrar General, and local registrars, have a statutory duty, under the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965, to provide public access to and issue extracts from any Scottish register on payment of the statutory fee. However, in the interests of privacy, the act limits access to the registers by means of an index of surnames only, to prevent browsing through the records. A person wishing to acquire an extract would need to provide to the Registrar General or a local registrar sufficient information about a specific event to be able to identify it in the index.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-5415 on 15 October 2007 which set out the current number of special advisers and their responsibilities. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search" target="_self">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>The routine security, health and reference checks, where required, have been obtained for all these appointments, except for the most recent full-time appointee.</p>

  <p>The estimate of the annual salary cost now takes into account changes to special adviser appointments and pension contributions. The salary cost over a full 12 month period, based on the special adviser complement at 1 November 2007, is estimated at &pound;568,021. This figure includes ERNIC and employer pension contributions except for one special adviser in each instance.</p>
