  <p>The new provisions on antisocial behaviour strategies, antisocial behaviour orders, dispersal of groups, closure of premises and new environmental powers come into force today. The other measures will commence over the coming months. The timetable for this is set out in a <em>Guide to the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004</em> , which has been published today. Copies of the guide and statutory guidance on the measures coming into force this autumn are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 34110 to 34118).</p>

  <p>Promotion of the Union Canal is primarily an operational matter for British Waterways Scotland whose activities are largely funded by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland, however, are also involved in a number of initiatives aimed at raising awareness of all Scotland&rsquo;s canals as tourist destinations. These include the production of promotional material and the creation of SeaScotland 2005 to celebrate our maritime heritage including our canal network. In addition, the Union Canal is featured in the Edinburgh and Lothians Tourist Board leaflet Discover West Lothian. SailScotland also provides information on our canals in association with VisitScotland.</p>

  <p>The promotion of the canal will also benefit from the establishment in the coming months of the Lowlands Canals Steering Group which will determine future priorities for development.</p>

  <p>We have received a number of representations on this issue and have carefully considered the arguments for and against extending eligibility.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the EMA programme is to provide an incentive to young people when they reach their official school leaving date and have to make the decision whether or not to stay on at school. The current eligibility criteria support that policy intention and funding is being provided on that basis.</p>

  <p>Although extending eligibility would benefit a small group of students this year, it would immediately create further costs and anomalies in the staged rollout which would be difficult to justify.</p>

  <p>It is inevitable when any new scheme is rolled out, that some will fall on the wrong side of the qualifying date. While I recognise their disappointment, we considered it fairer to adhere to eligibility criteria for which there is a rational basis in terms of the policy objective of this scheme.</p>

  <p>I have to conclude, therefore, that there is insufficient reason to change the eligibility criteria.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise to ensure at a national level adequate numbers of newly qualified teachers are trained for when they are required in publicly funded schools. This takes into account factors such as the age profile of the profession; changing pupil numbers; numbers of new entrants to the profession and those leaving due to resignation, retirement etc.</p>

  <p>As part of the exercise subject specialisms are prioritised, with universities having flexibility to adjust recruitment levels to subjects in order to accommodate localised demand. Factors which are considered in the prioritisation exercise include vacancy levels reported by local authorities (LAs) and the demand from LAs for probationer teachers in each sector/subject.</p>

  <p>In recent years vacancy levels in history have been low, at between 1 and 2%. This suggests low turnover of staff and/or reasonable availability of replacement teachers. That judgement has tended to be confirmed by the position in the probationer scheme, where the supply of teacher graduates has greatly exceeded the demand from local authorities for probationer teachers (although it is not a direct relationship between vacancy levels and places offered under the Induction scheme, in general there are similar subject patterns). These factors resulted in a low prioritisation for history places in last year&rsquo;s guidance to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) in setting intakes to initial teacher education (ITE) courses. Latest information suggests continuing low vacancy rates, but a better balance between demand and supply of probationer teachers.</p>

  <p>The 2004 workforce planning exercise will be examining updated information so that up to date advice can be offered to SHEFC at the turn of the year, in time for recruitment to ITE courses in August 2005.</p>

  <p>The Executive has commissioned the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to give advice on the radiological significance of levels of radon in Scotland. To do that the NRPB is completing its mapping of the levels of the naturally occurring radioactive gas, radon, in housing across Scotland. The survey aims to bring the extent of radon mapping in Scotland into line with that for the rest of the UK, with radon maps similar to those published for England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>Despite some signs of potential improvement, cod remains well outside safe biological limits and continues to require careful stewardship. The Scottish Executive is committed to the effective implementation of the EU&rsquo;s Cod Recovery Plan as a means of promoting the long-term sustainability of the stock while enabling the Scottish fleet to continue to pursue carefully managed fishing opportunities in the North Sea. The Executive considers that a complete closure of the fishery would be disproportionate.</p>

  <p>In August 2003, we announced a review of the long-term role of Scotland&rsquo;s national forest estate. This land, owned by Scottish ministers and managed by Forestry Commission Scotland, represents 8.5% of Scotland&rsquo;s land area. Staff from the Forestry Commission, Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department, Scottish Natural Heritage and an external assessor from the forest industry carried out the review, under the guidance of the Forestry Commission&rsquo;s National Committee for Scotland. We asked for recommendations about changes that would improve the ability of the estate to deliver the priorities set out in the Scottish Forestry Strategy, together with other Executive policies.</p>

  <p>The review group reported to ministers in May 2004. They based their report on an extensive consultation exercise, as well as an economic analysis of the estate, carried out by independent consultants. In addition to receiving over 400 written responses to the consultation paper, the review group organised seven consultation meetings across Scotland. We are most grateful to everyone who participated in this consultation exercise.</p>

  <p>We have now concluded our deliberations on the report and have accepted all 30 of its recommendations; endorsing the vision that &quot;Scotland's national forests will benefit everyone in Scotland, promoting vibrant and healthy communities; enriching natural environments and our cultural heritage, and creating wide-ranging opportunities for economic development&quot;.</p>

  <p>Copies of the report are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34224) and on the Forestry Commission&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/scotland" target="_blank">www.forestry.gov.uk/scotland</a>.</p>

  <p>The review group is now in place, under the chairmanship of William Roe. It has met three times. The group&rsquo;s initial discussions have included the values of social work, the current social work task, social work developments in the context of wider policy changes and visioning of the future environment.</p>

  <p>The review group is setting up sub-groups to take forward its work. Sandy Cameron, Director of Social Work at South Lanarkshire and Bernadette Docherty, Director of Social Work Services at North Ayrshire have agreed to chair groups on performance improvement and the role of the social worker respectively. These will be the first priority work areas for the group. The other sub groups to be set up are users and carer panel, stakeholders, communications and management and leadership.</p>

  <p>The review group will be very outward focused and will be consulting very widely, particularly with frontline staff and service users. It has invited Lisa Curtice, Director, Scottish Consortium for People with Learning Disabilities to set up a user and carer panel which will adopt a citizens&rsquo; jury approach, inviting evidence from users and carers on specific issues of interest to the review group. Arrangements are in hand to consult with front-line staff over the course of the next three months.</p>

  <p>Individual members of the review group are taking an early opportunity to visit local authority and voluntary sector service provision. All members of the review group will take part in in-depth visits to local authority and voluntary sector providers of social care services.</p>
