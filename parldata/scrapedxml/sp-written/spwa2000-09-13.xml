  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service, as part of its &quot;Beyond 2000&quot; initiative, is reviewing the deployment and operation of the Accident &amp; Emergency service across Scotland. Many islands such as Lismore will be dependent upon the first response to medical emergencies being provided by a general practitioner or community nurse. Where there is an urgent need for Ambulance Service support and transfer to hospital, then the Air Ambulance Service, including the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service, may be used. The Scottish Executive has invested significant additional resources in the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service in the past few years, extending the flying hours and the clinical capability of the aircraft.</p>

  <p>Police forces across Scotland worked closely with local authorities and other agencies to prepare for the possibility of incoming refugees from Kosovo in 1999. Key efforts by the police included the identification of suitable interpreters and the production of literature explaining the role of police officers in Scotland and the service they provide. While such activity was scaled down when the Kosovan Refugee Programme in Scotland focused on the Strathclyde area, plans remain in readiness across Scotland.</p>

  <p>All forces currently have in place Race Relations Policies designed to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of the people and communities they serve, including refugees and asylum seekers. Moreover, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) published <i>A Racial Diversity Guidance Manual</i> on 1 August for Scottish police forces to use in the fight against all forms of racism. This guidance manual complements the ACPOS Racial Diversity Strategy and sets out broad principles for the police to tackle racism, including instructions for officers on reporting, recording and investigating racist crime.</p>

  <p>I am arranging for copies of both documents to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware that Angus Council as the local roads authority is currently planning for a replacement of the Montrose bridge. The Executive has not received engineering reports on the structural condition of the existing bridge.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make publicly available all relevant information on the safety of the genetically modified oil seed rape to be grown on trial at New Craig Farm, Daviot, and whether it can guarantee that there is no possibility of cross-pollination with wild or cultivated plants within a 20-mile radius of the farm.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-09-13.S1W-8845.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0913.htm#8845">

  <p>The Scottish Executive granted consent for the application to plant a crop of genetically modified winter-grown oilseed rape at the Daviot site based on the advice of the statutory Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) that the crop did not pose a threat to public health or environmental safety. It is normal practice for ACRE&#8217;s advice to be published.</p>

  <p>It is recognised that there will be pollen dispersal from a crop which is grown in the open and this is why the environmental risk assessment to which all applications are subjected considers carefully the safety implications of cross-pollination and the impact of foraging insects. ACRE have concluded that there are no safety issues from cross-pollination &#8211; to either human or animal health, or to the environment.</p>

  <p>There are many aspects of child healthcare which lend themselves to the Managed Clinical Network approach. There are no Managed Clinical Networks in any paediatric service at the moment, although the national Managed Clinical Network in cleft lip and palate has a strong children&#8217;s component. The Scottish Executive would always be interested in considering proposals from clinicians for the development of such networks.</p>

  <p>Details of the number of trainees who will become fully trained and will be awarded a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) for the years requested is given in Table 2, Annex B of NHS MEL (2000) 24, published on 28 April 2000. A copy of this is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 7379).</p>

  <p>The numbers of consultants employed by the NHS in Scotland in the specialties referred to in questions asked by Mary Scanlon on 25 July 2000 are shown in attached Table 1. The information is as at 30 September 1999 and has been obtained from the Medical and Dental Manpower Census, General Medical Practitioner Database, ISD Scotland. The number of fully trained consultants employed in these specialties in 2000-01 and 2001-02 cannot be predicted with accuracy because it is affected by individual decisions to retire, but the whole time equivalent (WTE) number rose by 28% between 1994 and 1999, and increases are expected to continue.</p>

  <p>Information on breast surgeons is not shown or collected as a separate data item in either the NHS MEL or the census referred to above. Such surgeons are recorded within one of the surgical specialties detailed in the MEL and the table.</p>

  <p>Under section 51 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, education authorities have a duty to make such arrangements as they consider necessary for the provision of free transport, or for provision of other transport facilities as may be arranged, or for paying all or part of reasonable transport expenses for school pupils belonging to their area and attending designated schools. The details of any arrangements made are for each education authority to determine in the light of local circumstances. In general, they make such arrangements for pupils who live outwith the statutory walking distance, defined in section 42(4) of the 1980 Act as being two miles for any pupil under eight years of age and three miles for any other pupil.</p>

  <p>Consideration of proposals for new hospital developments are for local councils in the first instance. National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 17, <i>Planning and Transport,</i> emphasises the importance of such developments being well served by public transport, walking and cycling networks. Additionally, Scottish local authorities are being encouraged by the Scottish Executive to address, through the adoption of Local Transport Strategies, specific needs including public transport access to facilities such as hospitals. Planning approval for the Wishaw Western General Hospital pre-dated the NPPG.</p>

  <p>The City of Edinburgh Council submitted its detailed bid for the City of Edinburgh Rapid Transit scheme to the Transport Challenge Fund competition in June 1996. That bid contained estimated costs of and a projected timescale for development. The then Government gave the council permission to incur expenditure of up to &pound;15 million under section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, with this award timetabled as follows:</p>

  <p>At the council&#8217;s request, the award was subsequently reprofiled to accommodate slippage caused by the parliamentary Order and the development of the Private Finance Initiative package. Further reprofiling of the award may be necessary.</p>
