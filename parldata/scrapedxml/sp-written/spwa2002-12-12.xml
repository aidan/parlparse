  <p>Our policies and initiatives on broadband are outlined in the broadband strategy update, which I published last week.</p>

  <p>You will see that there are specific initiatives in the more rural areas, which should help to speed up broadband provision there. These include the Pathfinder initiatives to aggregate public sector demand for broadband in the Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland. It is hoped that this major public investment will help to stimulate supply of and demand for broadband within these areas. Work on the Pathfinder initiative is well in hand.</p>

  <p>There are also projects funded by the Scottish programme under the UK broadband fund, encouraging uptake of broadband and exploring alternative delivery mechanisms, which could help roll-out in rural areas. These include awareness raising measures through the Broadband for Business demonstration project in the Highlands and Islands and technology trials of Powerline Carrier and Wireless technology, which aim to determine the potential of these technologies for delivering broadband in rural communities.</p>

  <p>I also announced a new initiative last week, worth up to &#163;24 million, aimed at accelerating and widening broadband provision in Scotland. Rural areas should benefit from this initiative as will the rest of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Last week, I published an update to our broadband strategy, which details all the actions we are taking to increase the availability of broadband throughout Scotland. I also announced a new initiative, worth up to &#163;24 million, aimed at accelerating and extending the reach of broadband across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Moreover, under the DTI&#146;s Broadband Fund, the Executive is taking forward a suite of projects, many of which include trials of innovative ways of delivering broadband to communities. Under the Executive&#146;s Pathfinder project, communities in both the pilot areas, the Highlands and Islands and the South of Scotland, will hopefully benefit from the additional telecoms investment that could be stimulated by the aggregation of public sector demand for broadband services.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Spark project aims to deliver a broadband interconnect to every education authority across Scotland. In the longer term, the project also aims to make its facilities available to community learning and lifelong learning interests.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-31500 by Iain Gray on 26 November 2002, why it does not hold centrally accurate and complete information about the (a) level of foreign disinvestment and company closures, (b) number of associated job losses and (c) level of public financial support provided to each company involved; what action it will take to ensure that it holds such information centrally in the future, and whether holding such information centrally would be beneficial to identifying the number of jobs available, assessing the health of the economy and calculating how much public financial support to make available to companies.</p>

  <p>As indicated in response to question S1W-31500, there are limitations to the readily available information sources. For example, we may not be made aware of job losses if intended redundancies are below the threshold of 20 in any one month at which the Department of Trade and Industry needs to be informed under the Trade Union and Labour Relation (Consolidation) Act 1992.</p>

  <p>The main form of financial support provided to inward investors is under the Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) scheme, though other forms of assistance are provided by the Enterprise Networks. For those companies in receipt of RSA, the Executive maintains records from the point at which grant has been offered to the point at which the company has discharged all its contractual obligations in respect of RSA.</p>

  <p>We assess the health of the economy in a number of ways and recognise the importance of robust economic statistics in monitoring economic progress and in underpinning economic policy development.</p>

  <p>The Executive also commissioned an analysis of the economic impact of toxin fishery closures up to 2002 and this was published recently. The analysis will be considered by the Scottish Scallop Advisory Committee.</p>

  <p>The primary responsibility for dealing with flooding and for taking flood prevention measures lies with the individual property owner. Local authorities have powers to prevent or mitigate the flooding of non-agricultural land in their area. Where they assess that the carrying out of maintenance works on a watercourse or connected works would substantially reduce the likelihood of flooding on non-agricultural land in their area they have, in particular circumstances, a duty to carry out that maintenance.</p>

  <p>I have been advised by the Food Standards Agency that the EC Directive 2002/46/EC ensures a high level of protection for consumers as products on the market will comply with agreed safety levels and will bear adequate and appropriate labelling. Implementation of the directive will not immediately outlaw any products already on the UK market. The impact of the directive on the future continued availability of products will depend upon future developments on lists of permitted nutrients and on maximum limits.</p>

  <p>There are currently no specific limits in UK law on the level or range of vitamins and minerals contained in food supplements. Food supplements are regulated in other member states by differing national rules that may impede their free movement, create unequal conditions for competition and consumers. It is therefore necessary to adopt Community rules on those products marketed as foodstuffs.</p>

  <p>The directive deals only with the composition of vitamin and mineral supplements and will have no impact on the consumers of herbal remedies. Traditional herbal medicines are a reserved matter, dealt with by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the UK Medicines Regulatory Authority.</p>

  <p>(a)(i) Following publication of the White Paper &quot;Smoking Kills&quot; in 1998 the Scottish Executive allocated &#163;1 million pounds per year to health boards across Scotland to provide smoking cessation support to priority groups. Additional Health Improvement Funding has also been available for smoking cessation services since 2001. Greater Glasgow NHS Board has allocated funding to two local health care co-operatives in the East Dunbartonshire area at Anniesland, Bearsden and Milngavie and Strathkelvin to establish intensive group support within the community. In Anniesland, Bearsden and Milngavie approximately 140 people have been successful in quitting smoking as a result of attending the service between 2001-03. In Strathkelvin 114 clients have been referred to the service since it commenced in January 2003.</p>

  <p>In addition to GP&#146;s, practice nurses and the intensive group support service, smoking cessation assistance is also offered at four pharmacies in the East Dunbartonshire area (two in Bishopbriggs and two in Kirkintilloch). Attendance rates are not currently available.</p>

  <p>Zyban has been available on prescription since June 2000 and nicotine replacement therapy since April 2001.</p>

  <p>(ii) The Executive's <i>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</i>, published in January, sets out a range of national and local measures to reduce alcohol-related harm in Scotland. The plan requires Alcohol Action Teams, including the team covering East Dunbartonshire, to assess needs in their areas and produce local prevention, education and support and treatment strategies to address these by April 2003.</p>

  <p>(iii) In East Dunbartonshire work is on-going to ensure healthy options are available in primary schools as part of the school lunch. Starter packs have been produced for parents of primary 1 children which give information on healthy eating and a guide to healthy choices available in school. Greater Glasgow NHS Board has also given financial support to three breakfast clubs in the area.</p>

  <p>A wide range of factors affect the supply of housing in rural areas. Overall, it is for local authorities to analyse housing needs in their areas and make plans to meet those needs. Central government funding is available through a number of schemes to provide new and improved homes in rural areas. In particular, Communities Scotland&#146;s Rural Development Programme has been increased from &#163;36 million in 1998-99 to &#163;48 million in 2002-03, providing over 6,600 new and improved homes during that period.</p>

  <p>At present, local authorities receive a single capital allocation for borrowing consents relating to capital expenditure on all areas except their own housing stock. It is for each local authority to decide how much of the single capital allocation is spent for private housing sector purposes. For the current year, the forecast for local authorities&#146; total expenditure for these purposes is approximately &#163;45 million.</p>

  <p>Schools are at the heart of preparing young people to live in a multi-cultural and inclusive society. We have funded the Centre for Education for Racial Equality in Scotland (CERES) since 1991. CERES aims to promote education for racial equality within educational services in Scotland. CERES liaises with education authorities and schools to assist with formulating, developing and refining policies for multi-cultural and anti-racist education.</p>

  <p>We commissioned CERES, working in partnership with LTS, and the City of Edinburgh Council, to produce a resource to provide staff in pre-school, special schools, primary and secondary schools with materials to support a more effective delivery of anti-racism education. The CD-Rom <i>Educating for Race Equality &#150; A Toolkit for Scottish Teachers</i> was launched on 3 December, and will be available to all schools in the New Year.</p>

  <p>In addition, to enable the implementation of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 across the school and pre-school sectors we set up a Delivery Group. The group&#146;s remit was to ensure that education authorities and schools/centres are aware of their new duties under the act and to support smooth implementation. As part of this, the group has produced an information leaflet for school staff which will be issued before Christmas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is supporting the establishment of Safety Camera Partnerships, led by local authorities and police forces. To date three such partnerships have been approved and are operational: in Strathclyde, Fife, and Grampian. Each Safety Camera Partnership is responsible for continually assessing the effectiveness of its speed cameras in reducing traffic accidents and casualties.</p>

  <p>Where safety cameras have been installed, the number of crashes has fallen significantly. For example, at the 28 City of Glasgow locations where fixed safety cameras have been in place over the past two years, the number of crashes involving personal injury at those locations fell by 64%.</p>

  <p>On 2 December 2002, the Scottish Executive launched <i>Choose Life: A National Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide in Scotland</i> , which aims to tackle the rising rate of suicides in Scotland. It includes a particular focus on a range of vulnerable groups, including young people (especially young men), people with mental health problems, substance misusers and persons in prison. The strategy outlines clear objectives for concerted national and local action. The strategy and action plan are supported by a new investment of &#163;12 million over three years, to be used to help promote improved, co-ordinated planning and the development and implementation of action by local agencies; to support local innovation and training and to encourage the development of interventions and services by local voluntary, community and self-help groups, and for work at national level and the establishment of a national implementation support team.</p>

  <p>We are aware that a 1999 RNIB survey indicated a prevalence rate for visually impaired children in the UK in 1997 of 2.3 per thousand. This is higher than the number of school pupils with a Record of Needs in Scotland whose main learning difficulty arises from visual impairment. This is because recording rates vary considerably across local authorities, not all school pupils with a visual impairment will require a Record of Needs, and many pre-school children do not have a record.</p>

  <p>My letter of 5 December 2002, to the Convener of the Finance Committee, reported that a list of individual contractors or contracts, where performance bonds have, or have not, been requested, cannot be provided for reasons of commercial confidentiality. I am, therefore, unable to provide the information requested.</p>
