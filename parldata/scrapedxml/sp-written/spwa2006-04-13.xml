  <p>Mark Y7 is on the Scottish Fingerprint Service Latents Database (which is the database of unsolved crime scene marks). This database is checked regularly against fingerprints taken from arrested persons. Because the mark was taken from the scene of a serious crime it will remain on the database until it is identified.</p>

  <p>In February 1997, 12 SCRO fingerprint officers were invited to examine the mark Y7 that was found at the scene of Marion Ross&rsquo; murder. Ten officers were satisfied that mark Y7 could be eliminated from the inquiry into the murder because it was the left thumb print of Shirley McKie. Two officers did not reach a conclusion either way: one of those officers preferred to examine the print under a magnifying glass before giving a view and the other preferred to examine it in daylight. Neither completed the comparison. None of the officers who examined Y7 and who reached a conclusion on it disagreed with the elimination identification.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it (a) has always been and (b) is currently the policy of the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) that any disagreements within it in relation to the identification of a fingerprint have to be reported to (i) the police and (ii) the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service; what disciplinary procedures exist for failure by SCRO officers to adhere to this policy; how many instances there have been since January 1997 where the policy has not been followed; how many officers have been disciplined for failing to follow the procedure or implement the policy properly; whether the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service can bring charges against any SCRO officer who breaches this policy; whether this policy has always been implemented and, if not, what the reasons are for the position on the matter and in what cases it has not been implemented; in how many cases since January 1997 a prosecution has proceeded where there has been such a disagreement and whether it will list all such cases; how many cases have not been prosecuted because of such a disagreement, and in how many cases there was a conviction.</p>

  <p>The policy, which has been in place since before January 1997, is that if a disagreement arises between fingerprint officers during the identification or verification process then the Scottish Fingerprint Service (SFS) would not declare that an identification had been made.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of instances in which the policy has not been followed and so disciplinary procedures have not been invoked. The staff in the SFS are employed by the Joint Police Board of the area where they work, (Grampian, Lothian and Borders, Strathclyde and Tayside) and as such they are subject to the disciplinary policies of their employers.</p>

  <p>If an employer believes that an employee is involved in criminal behaviour the matter should be referred to the police for investigation.</p>

  <p>There have not been any cases since January 1997 where a disagreement has occurred and a prosecution has proceeded, nor have there been any cases in which prosecution did not proceed because of a disagreement within SCRO.</p>

  <p>The Justice Department provided advice to ministers having taken full account of the Memorandum to Accountable Officers from the Principal Accountable Officer and the Scottish Public Finance Manual <i>.</i></p>

  <p>At all times ministers have been mindful of the need for any settlement to be defensible in terms of the public purse and advice to ministers took account of value for money issues including the cost of proceeding to a five week proof and the prospects of recovering any award of expenses that might have been made against Ms McKie. At one point, Ms McKie was seeking a settlement of &pound;1.2 million with backdated interest on top. The &pound;750,000 settlement which includes interest is considerably less than that figure.</p>

  <p>Lord Hodge accepted in his opinion on 30 March that there was conflicting evidence from independent experts over the match between fingerprint Y7 and Ms McKie&rsquo;s print and in those circumstances it was reasonable for Scottish ministers to maintain that the identification by SCRO officers had been made in good faith and was not malicious.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not readily available in the form requested. The circumstances mentioned in the question would normally be classified by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) as &quot;disclosure of evidence&quot; or &quot;new evidence&quot;, but these classifications would also include other reasons for referral. Of the 14 successful appeals against conviction, the reason for referral was recorded as &quot;disclosure of evidence&quot; in respect of one case and as &quot;new evidence&quot; in respect of nine cases.</p>

  <p>Once a case has been referred by the SCCRC, it is for the appellant to frame the grounds of appeal. These may not reflect the original grounds of referral. It cannot therefore be assumed that any appeal is granted on the ground upon which it is referred.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many people have been detained by the police under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 since the act came into force, broken down by police force; with what offences they were charged; what average length of time they were held under the act, and how many were held in (a) prison, (b) hospital and (c) other secure accommodation.</p>

  <p>The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 came into effect on 5 October 2005. Police do not have the power to detain people under this legislation and, where persons are charged and receive a mental health disposal they will not end up in prison. The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, which has a duty to monitor the operation of the 2003 act, is notified of all orders made under the act and may be able to provide further information.</p>

  <p>Officials have discussed with UK Government Departments the allegations that Scottish airports have been used for the transportation of US prisoners to countries where they might be subjected to torture (so-called &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot;). The position remains as set out in my response to question S2W-20910, answered on 7 December 2005. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>Since then, the Foreign Secretary set out the UK Government&rsquo;s position in detail in a Written Ministerial Statement on 20 January 2006, including that:</p>

  <p>The UK Government found no evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or Overseas Territories since 11 September 2001.</p>

  <p>It found no evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or Overseas Territories since 1997 where there were substantial grounds to believe there was a real risk of torture.</p>

  <p>There were four cases in 1998 where the US requested permission to render one or more detainees through the UK or Overseas Territories. Records show the Government granted the US request in two of these cases, and refused the request in the other two.</p>

  <p>The Government is clear that the US would not render a detainee through UK territory or airspace (including Overseas Territories) without the UK Government&rsquo;s permission.</p>

  <p>In one of the two 1998 cases, in June 1998, a flight carrying Mohammed Rashid landed at Prestwick en route to the United States, where he was due to stand trial. He was charged for bombing a Pan Am aircraft in August 1982. He pleaded guilty to murder in December 2002 and is due to be sentenced shortly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has a strong record in contributing to the UK Government&rsquo;s response to routine and ad hoc inquiries by international bodies on a variety of subjects, including torture. We also seek actively to develop our relationship with international human rights bodies independently of any inquiries.</p>

  <p>The current European inquiries about extraordinary rendition are focused on matters that are reserved to the UK Government. For this reason, in the case of Senator Marty&rsquo;s questions, the UK Government in formulating its answers did not require any contribution from the Executive. Should Senator Marty, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe or the European Parliament&rsquo;s temporary committee request information about devolved policies or practice, the Executive will be very happy to provide it.</p>
