  <p>The future of the Common Agricultural Policy has been raised in recent weeks in the context of EU management over the medium to long-term and the 2007-13 financial perspective. No formal renegotiation is imminent but if any discussions do take place we shall ensure Scottish interests are represented.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports a range of initiatives aimed at educating the public about climate change outwith the formal education system. For example, we sponsor the Carbon Trust and the Energy Saving Trust to inform businesses and householders of action they can take to help tackle climate change; we work closely with the UK Climate Impacts Programme to assist organisations assess their vulnerability to climate change and we aim to inform the public through our environmental and travel awareness campaigns.</p>

  <p>It is not generally possible to specify the costs of the response to the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak to a particular area of Scotland as many of the resources used were mobile or formed part of the wider British disease control response. The National Audit Office report, <em>The 2001 Outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (HC 939) </em> estimated the Central Government costs of the outbreak in Scotland to be &pound;334 million.</p>

  <p>I announced on 15 June the outline of a new Scottish strategy for the long-term sustainability of Scotland&rsquo;s marine and coastal environments, including work to identify Scotland&rsquo;s first coastal and marine national park.</p>

  <p>A copy of my letter of 14 June to the Convener of the Environment and Rural Development Committee, setting out the main elements of that strategy, is available at the Parliament&rsquo;s website: <a href="../../../business/committees/environment/papers-05/rap05-20.pdf" target="_blank">www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/committees/environment/papers-05/rap05-20.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>I expect to publish more detail of the strategy within the next two months.</p>

  <p>The three yearly actuarial review of the Local Government Pension Scheme in Scotland is currently underway and it will therefore be later this year before information on any surplus or deficit is known. In the reply to S2W-16075, answered on 27 April 2005, it was explained that it is for each local authority fund to use the resources at its disposal over time to cover any shortfalls.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-16075 by Mr Tom McCabe on 27 April 2005, what resources are available to local authorities to cover any shortfalls in their pension funds.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answers given to questions S2W-16075, answered on 27 April 2005 and S2W-17667 answered on 27 July 2005.</p>

  <p>It is for each local authority to use the resources at its disposal, over time, to cover any shortfalls. Pension scheme deficits do not have to be cleared at the time of a valuation, rather the deficit will be addressed over many years by a range of methods such as increasing the contributions, reviewing the scheme benefits and considering the investment strategy.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-16075 by Mr Tom McCabe on 27 April 2005, what the safeguards are in the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 relating to how local authorities should account for any surplus or deficit in pension funds.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-07-27.9.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80062" speakername="George Lyon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0727.htm#5">

  <p>I refer the member to the answers to question S2W-17667 and S2W-17668 on 27 July 2005.</p>

  <p>It is for each local authority to address a surplus or deficit in the pension fund and this will be done over a long period taking into account actuarial recommendations on the employer contribution rate, investment strategy and information on demographics.</p>

  <p>The Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 does not give specific safeguards for the control of local authority finances, rather it provides Scottish ministers with the power to intervene and exercise control:</p>

  <p>The act provides:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>a duty to secure best value in local government service provision;</p>
<p>an extension of the Accounts Commission for Scotland's powers to hold hearings and publish findings so that they cover issues relating to best value and community planning;</p>
<p>the provision of a ministerial intervention power for continued or extraordinary statutory failure in Best Value or a significant misuse of the power of well being;</p>
<p>amendments to constraints on local authority trading activity, with the repeal of all existing legislation relating to compulsory competitive tendering;</p>
<p>a statutory basis for public performance reporting and arrangements to improve accountability;</p>
<p>a statutory basis for community planning to ensure long-term commitment to effective partnership working with communities and between local authorities and other key bodies and organisations;</p>
<p>a power of well-being to enable local authorities to work in a more innovative and creative way in responding to the needs of their communities, and</p>
<p>a vehicle to progress a number of miscellaneous provisions which relate to local government matters.</p>
