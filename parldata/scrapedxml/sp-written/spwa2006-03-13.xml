  <p>There are a number of schemes currently in place by which the Scottish Executive provides subsidised travel on public transport.</p>

  <p>There is an existing concessionary fares scheme which offers free local bus travel for pensioners and disabled people for journeys outwith the morning peak.</p>

  <p>We provide subsidies for air routes under Public Service Obligations (PSOs) from Glasgow International Airport to Campbeltown, Tiree and Barra.</p>

  <p>There is also a variety of local authority funded concessionary travel schemes for rail passengers, and First ScotRail is required by the terms of the rail passenger franchise to participate in these schemes.</p>

  <p>There are three concessionary travel schemes in place for ferry passengers on foot in the Clyde and Western Isles, arranged with Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority (SPTA), Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.</p>

  <p>There are three schemes in place for ferry passengers in the Northern Isles, arranged with Orkney Council, Shetland Islands Council and Northlink.</p>

  <p>A new national concessionary travel scheme administered by Transport Scotland will begin on 1 April 2006, and will provide Scotland-wide free bus travel for older and disabled people, as well as two free return journeys for all eligible Scottish island residents. Where existing local concessionary travel schemes also include additional modes, such as rail or ferry, these will continue to be managed locally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also committed to introducing a scheme of national bus, rail and ferry concessionary travel for young people, initially for those in full-time education and training.</p>

  <p>I announced recently the introduction of a new scheme, which will provide lower air fares for those living in the Highlands and Islands. Residents of Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles, Islay and Jura and the Caithness area will be eligible for an estimated 40% discount on trips to Inverness, Glasgow International, Edinburgh and Aberdeen Airports and one other airport within the eligible geographic area.</p>

  <p>Highland Council receives additional support of &pound;4.755 million in 2005-06 as a result of a redistribution of the Primary School Teaching Staff Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocation which is based on the 18% of Highland pupils who are educated in small schools i.e. where the pupil roll is 70 or less. In 2006-07 and 2007-08, this redistribution reallocates &pound;5.442 million and &pound;5.555 million respectively, based on a percentage of 17.2%. Any current or future changes to this percentage will not now be made until the next Spending Review, currently scheduled for 2007.</p>

  <p>These GAE allocations are neither budgets nor spending targets. They are a component of the more complex local government funding formula which is used to calculate a single revenue grant figure for each council. It is then a matter for each individual council to decide how best to deploy these resources based on local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive&rsquo;s Gaelic Specific Grant and an element of the National Priorities Action Fund relating to the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to having 53,000 additional teachers by 2007 may have some bearing on financial support of rural schools.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the Scottish Funding Council are committed to promoting entrepreneurial education and encouraging higher education institutions to provide opportunities for students to obtain work experience and business skills However, institutions are autonomous bodies and are individually responsible for the content and nature of the courses they offer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Institute for Enterprise (SIE), core funded by the Scottish Funding Council, has led on developing enterprise courses in Scotland&rsquo;s universities since 1999. In recent years its has greatly expanded the range of courses and increased the number of students who can benefit from them, to cover all Scotland&rsquo;s universities. These courses help students and researchers to develop management and business skills such as team-building, problem-solving, presentation skills and teamwork. The institute is currently working with the UK Science Enterprise Centres and the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship to develop an Enterprise Educators training and Masterclass programme. The SIE has assisted in the drive for all higher education institutions to establish their own commercialisation offices, with links to the national SIE network of support.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to promoting science communication education. Whilst institutions are individually responsible for the content and nature of courses on offer, there is evidence that progress is being made by a range of different training providers, developing a number of options, including modules provided within science degrees; degrees focusing on science communication, and other communication opportunities provided by bodies actively involved in complementary science education, including the Science Centres. The Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh and the Edinburgh International Science Festival provide training opportunities which include modules within degrees and hands-on training placements. Information on the numbers of students enrolled on such courses is not held centrally. Further details can be found in <em>A Science Strategy for Scotland</em> <em>2001:Progress Report</em> , published February 2006, a copy of which is available on the web at: <br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/science/16607/5910" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/science/16607/5910</a> .</p>

  <p>Careers Scotland supports the career planning needs of individuals across Scotland. Professional Careers Advisers offer impartial guidance and support to young people and are trained to recognise the diversity of opportunities and to challenge stereotyping.</p>

  <p>Careers Scotland&rsquo;s &quot;Career Box&quot; careers education tool was launched in 2004 and provides access to materials which develop research skills whereby young people can use ICT careers information relating to science opportunities. This information is detailed enough to give direct guidance to young people in science and engineering. The resource is flexible, interactive and supported by video clips and case studies which highlight role models who have chosen a STEM related career pathway. In addition, the Careers Scotland website has a section containing useful information on STEM related industries.</p>

  <p>Education and careers opportunities in science have been promoted through a range of public science initiatives, further details of which are in published in <em>A Science</em> <em>Strategy for Scotland, 2001: Progress Report</em>, available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/science/16607/5910" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/science/16607/5910</a>.</p>

  <p>The report highlights the &quot;Small Grants for Science&quot; scheme launched by the Scottish Executive in 2003 to support the transition from primary to secondary school science, and the Careers Scotland Science and Technology Matters initiative, announced in November 2005. &quot;Science Matters&quot; supports hands on STEM activity for pupils to engage with science, with the twin aims of encouraging more young people into these subject areas, and improving rates of progression into science careers. There are also a number of national projects delivered in partnership with industry including the Careers Scotland Space School for S4 &ndash;S5 pupils, launched in 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Science Centres Network Strategy, published in December 2005, commits the science centres to strengthening their existing links with key organisations to demonstrate more fully the links between science and employment, complementing the work of Careers Scotland and others in this field.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will set out the steps it is taking in co-operation with the Northern Ireland administration to attract an operator to run a ferry service between Campbeltown and Ballycastle.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-03-13.S2W-24090.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80109" speakername="Tavish Scott" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0313.htm#13">

  <p>The Scottish Executive in co-operation with the Northern Ireland administration initiated a tendering exercise in 2005 for a subsidised public service contract to operate a passenger and vehicle ferry service between Campbeltown in Argyll and Ballycastle in Antrim, Northern Ireland. Following a pre-qualification exercise, an Invitation to Tender was issued to four companies on 20 September, requesting submission of tenders by 10 January 2006. The Executive was disappointed that no tenders were submitted.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has reviewed the reasons for this outcome and has also investigated whether there are any options available which would allow reinstatement of the service within the terms of the 2005-06 tender. The main terms of the tender were a five year contract offering a service for 11 months of the year with a maximum annual grant of &pound;1 million per year for a passenger and vehicle ferry service between the two ports.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of the strong support for the reinstatement of the service voiced in both Kintyre and Antrim and of the local disappointment at the outcome of the tendering process. The Executive has therefore agreed with the Northern Ireland administration that a final effort should be made to identify any potential ferry operator interested in submitting a tender to provide the service under a negotiated procedure. The procurement rules permit this provided that the operator meets the original qualification criteria for the competition and that the tender complies fully with the original terms of the Invitation to Tender issued for this exercise.</p>

  <p>These investigations will require time to pursue and it is not possible to place a precise timescale on them in advance, but every effort will be made to establish the position as soon as practicable.</p>

  <p>It is not appropriate to discuss details of procedures followed in a criminal investigation, for operational reasons. However, I can confirm that the fingerprint evidence found at the scene of Marion Ross&rsquo; murder was compared with the fingerprints of particular individuals where this proved to be appropriate.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-21936 on 23 January 2006. It is Executive policy not to disclose the amount of compensation paid to individual applicants without the express permission of the applicant. Accordingly, because the number of cases is small, providing the requested information on an annual basis could lead to the identification of individual claimants.</p>

  <p>In determining the amount of compensation due to a claimant, the assessor will take into account any expenses, legal or otherwise, incurred by the claimant in reversing his conviction, or pursuing the claim for compensation to enable these to be included in the final assessment. The Executive has incurred no additional cost for legal expenses in relation to these settlements beyond payments of appropriate fees of &pound;815.46 to the assessors for their work.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much land has been taken into community ownership under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 and what percentage of total land in Scotland this represents.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-03-13.S2W-23187.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80011" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0313.htm#17">

  <p>The Community Right to Buy in Part 2 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 provides real rights to purchase land when it comes to be sold. The Crofting Community Right to Buy in part 3 of the act provides a right to buy at any time. Both rights came into force on 14 June 2004.</p>

  <p>The Register of Community Interests in Land, which is available publicly through the Scottish Executive and Registers of Scotland websites, presently contains 32 applications to register community interests in land under part 2 of the act. These applications cover a total of 25,297 hectares (62,484 acres) of land, equating to 0.32% of the 7.9 million hectares in the whole of Scotland. Registrable land forms 98.6% of all land in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Of the 32 applications so far submitted to the department, 15 have secured a registered interest, nine have been rejected, four were withdrawn and four await a decision of the Scottish ministers. Nine cases have proceeded to the right to buy stage, five of which have concluded the transfer of ownership to the local community. This has resulted in 19,827 hectares (48,973 acres) of land being transferred to community ownership under part 2 of the legislation. One case is presently proceeding through the right to buy process and a further five registered community interests have been approved and are awaiting notification from the landowner of the intention to sell the land. This provides the opportunity for a further 43.5 hectares (107 acres) of land to be transferred to local community ownership when it comes to be sold.</p>

  <p>Part 3 of the act has also resulted in two applications so far, involving a further 28,140 hectares (69,505 acres) of land. These cases are presently being considered.</p>

  <p>The legislative approach, whilst providing a right to purchase land (in the case of part 2, when it comes to be sold), is not the only way for communities to purchase land, but its very existence may, in some cases, inspire a negotiated sale to a local community. This is already the case at South Uist and Galson. The Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s National Forest Land Scheme, launched on 20 June 2005, also provides an opportunity for communities to purchase forestry land. Two community based applications, totalling 861 hectares (2,127 acres) have been received, and can be viewed on their website at <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/nfls" target="_blank">www.forestry.gov.uk/nfls</a>. Three further communities are at the pre-application phase of the NFLS and a further five communities are presently considering their options. Also, voluntary discussion between a willing seller and willing buyer may provide an easier option for communities wishing to acquire land.</p>

  <p>More generally, latest statistics from highlands and islands enterprise suggest that over 87,400 hectares (216,000 acres) - just over 1% - of land in Scotland is currently under community ownership. In addition, over 13,000 hectares (over 32,700 acres) of land is being leased to, or managed by, communities. This provides over 100,700 hectares (almost one quarter of a million acres) under community control in Scotland. Furthermore, over 130,400 hectares (over 322,000 acres) of land is presently subject to aspiring community land initiatives, which may result in community ownership or communities leasing land in the future.</p>

  <p>There has been a high level of interest in the right to buy legislation and the Scottish Executive is continuing to encourage rural communities to consider all available options to assist with delivering benefits to local communities. It is for communities to determine for themselves whether land ownership is the preferred option in each case. Local benefit may be delivered through other options, such as leasing land. Scottish Executive officials are available to discuss options with any individual or community representative on the Land Reform Helpdesk on 0131 244 6003, and we would encourage prospective community bodies to make contact with officials at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>The current message, which precedes any call from a prisoner, advises recipients that the call is coming from a prison. The SPS believes that the message provides the public, for example victims or vulnerable witnesses with some safeguard against unwanted calls. The SPS also considers that the message is necessary and legal. In his most recent report, the Prison Complaints Commissioner noted that SPS had &quot;taken legal advice on this matter and concluded that any interference that the pre-recorded message caused to a prisoner&rsquo;s privacy rights was justifiable and thus permissible under Article 8 of the Convention.</p>

  <p>Extradition arrangements between the UK and Italy are now governed by the EU Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002, which is in force for both the UK and Italy. Requests from Italy for extradition are made under the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) procedure which was introduced in that Decision. This procedure was implemented for the UK by the Extradition Act 2003. If the Scottish authorities receive an EAW from Italy, they may certify it, and it is thereafter sent to the police for execution. The matter would then proceed before the Scottish Courts.</p>

  <p>Professor Alan Alexander resigned as Chair of Scottish Water because he disagreed with the view of the Scottish Executive that Scottish Water&rsquo;s 2006-10 delivery plan did not provide a clear and convincing basis upon which Scottish Water would, as a minimum, achieve in full the Executive&rsquo;s objectives for Scottish Water in the period, including those in relation to development constraints, within the limits set by the Water Industry Commission for Scotland&rsquo;s determination of charges for 2006-10.</p>

  <p>The Executive considered in general that Scottish Water&rsquo;s delivery plan for 2006-10 was too provisional in nature and identified potential obstacles to Scottish Water being able to achieve the Executive&rsquo;s objectives for it without identifying how such obstacles might be overcome. It considered in particular that the plan envisaged a significant delay in taking forward a number of important strategic issues, including the alleviation of development constraints, that it did not provide for Scottish Water to out-perform the Water Industry Commission&rsquo;s determination of water charges, and that it lacked a clear means by which the Executive could measure Scottish Water&rsquo;s progress towards achievement of the objectives.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s &pound;12 million per annum contribution towards the funding of Active Schools is a core element of our grant in aid to <strong></strong> sportscotland for the period of our spending proposals to 2007-08. While we cannot pre-empt the outcome of the 2007 Spending Review, Active Schools will be a priority for continued funding and a ring fenced element of <strong></strong> sportscotland&rsquo;s grant.</p>
