  <p>When horses are exported from the UK their export health certificates are recorded on the TRACES (Trade Control and Expert System) database. TRACES is an integrated web-based system maintained by the European Commission which assists in the management of intra and extra Community trade of live animals and animal products.</p>

  <p>The UK, Ireland and France have a tripartite agreement which allows the free movement of registered horses without export certificates. In these instances the movements will not be recorded.</p>

Data for other times during the year are not collected centrally. The sharing of a head teacher by two schools is seen by some local authorities as preferable to having a teaching head teacher.</p>

  <p>All young people should have access to a broad general education that provides flexibility, breadth and depth across all curriculum areas. The expressive arts are an integral part of the new curriculum and can strengthen learning across the curriculum, allowing teachers to use their creativity and initiative. Curriculum for Excellence will also provide opportunities for cultural organisations to work more closely and collaboratively with the education sector.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council runs and supports a number of positive educational activities within schools. These include the Youth Music Initiative, with an annual budget of &pound;10 million, 80% of which is channelled through local authorities for work within schools, supports over 300 projects covering all musical genres, age groups and teaching methods. Amongst its key achievements are that children now have access to one year&rsquo;s free music tuition by the time they reach primary 6.</p>

  <p>In December 2008 the Scottish Government published <em>Culture Delivers</em>, a resource for promoting cultural activities in communities and educational establishments across Scotland.</p>

  <p>There is no definitive answer as the evidence required to secure a conviction will depend on the exact circumstances of each individual case. As a generality, however, to establish that a vessel master has fished in contravention of a prohibition on fishing with scallop dredges in a particular area will require sufficient corroborated evidence of the act of fishing with scallop dredges at the locus. Similar evidence would be required in circumstances where fishing for scallops is permitted but with certain limitations or restrictions on the gear used, along with evidence that the fishing gear used does not comply with the relevant restriction or limitations.</p>

  <p>As at January 2008, there were 57 pre-school centres who provided pre-school education through the medium of Gaelic. Within these 57 pre-school centres, there were 1,140 children registered for pre-school places funded by the local authority. However, we do not know whether all these children were being taught pre-school education in the Gaelic medium.

From the national data currently collected, it is possible to extract some information on the Healthcare Sciences staff group and the situation being reported by boards as at 30 April 2009 is presented in the following table.</p>

  <p>I have regular bilateral contact with representatives of European nations. On 11 May 2009, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning hosted a successful cultural reception in Brussels which promoted the Year of Homecoming. On 12 May 2009, I led the UK delegation at a meeting of the Education, Youth and Culture Council in Brussels, which had a particular resonance because of its focus on the creative industries.</p>

  <p>We have no firm data on the number of private rented properties that are not registered.</p>

  <p>However, based on statistics from the Scottish Household Survey, we estimate that approximately 85% of private rented sector properties are covered by applications for registration.</p>

  <p>There are about 233,000 households in the private rented sector. Taking the number of properties included in landlord applications &ndash; 198,476 as of April 2009 &ndash; as a proxy for households gives an estimated coverage of 85% of private rented sector households.</p>

  <p>However, these figures are an estimate only. We do not know how many of the 233,000 private rented households would require registration. Some are likely to be exempt because they do not fall within the scope of the legislation, for example, because the let is to family members or because the landlord is resident in the let property. Some households in the sector may also share a property (for example, tenants who live in an HMO). In other words, we cannot directly compare households with the number of properties requiring registration.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a range of powers available to them to enforce registration including taking action to identify unregistered landlords and to ensure compliance with the registration requirement.</p>

  <p>The Low-cost Initiative for First-Time Buyers (LIFT) brings together a range of Scottish Government initiatives to help households get onto the housing ladder.</p>

  <p>This includes the New Supply Shared Equity scheme and Open Market Shared Equity Pilot scheme; shared ownership; Rural Home Ownership Grants (RHOGs), and GRO grants for owner occupation (grants to private developers to build low cost housing for sale).</p>

  <p>The annual fund for LIFT, published on 12 May 2009, is &pound;97.396 million and from this budget we hope to be able to help over 2,055 first time buyers.

  <p>The only waiting list information held centrally for LIFT relates to the Open Market Shared Equity Pilot scheme. Waiting lists for New Supply Shared Equity and shared ownership are held locally by RSLs. There are no waiting lists for RHOGs.</p>

  <p>With regard to the Open Market Shared Equity Pilot scheme, as at 15 May 2009 there were 77 potential applicants on a reserve list in the following three local authority areas:</p>

</table></p>

  <p>There are no reserve lists being held in any other local authority areas.</p>

  <p>In order to ease demand for the scheme in the Grampian and Highland Open Market Shared Equity Pilot scheme administrative areas, a further &pound;1.2 million has been allocated to each of these areas. This should allow a further potential 30 purchasers to benefit from the scheme in each area. The scheme will continue to be monitored closely in relation to applications and sales levels across the country.</p>

  <p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) make recommendations on those groups of people who are at risk from seasonal flu who should receive the free flu vaccination. At present there is limited evidence of any increased risk for pregnant women other than those in at-risk categories, and accordingly, no recommendation has been made by the JCVI. The committee does regularly review the at-risk groups to take account of the latest evidence.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow&rsquo;s 1999 <em>Modernising Mental Health</em> strategy proposed the development of 117 acute short-stay beds in the new mental health hospital at Gartnavel Hospital. The profile of these beds is detailed in the table below.</p>

  <p>The relevant planning assumptions as set out in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s <em>Vision for the Vale</em> document assumed a total of 60 acute adult mental health beds at Gartnavel Hospital: 48 beds for the Greater Glasgow area, and 12 beds for the Clyde area (although the board&rsquo;s proposals for adult mental health in the <em>Vision for the Vale</em> have not yet received Ministerial approval).</p>

  <p>As confirmed in the answer to question S3W-23876 on 21 May 2009, NHS Greater Glasgow&rsquo;s 1999 mental health strategy proposed that there should be a total of 60 acute adult mental health beds at Gartnavel Hospital. As I would expect, the board has revised its planning assumptions in line with national policy and operating experience since 1999. The development of appropriate crisis and assertive outreach services throughout the country over the last 10 years has seen a significant shift in the balance of care from management of adult acute mental health problems in inpatient settings to the management of a proportion of such problems through community-based crisis teams. This has seen comparable bed levels in England reduce by 10-20% over that period. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has confirmed that the average relevant bed use throughout 2008 at Gartnavel Hospital was 49 beds. As such, Gartnavel Hospital is already operating close to the revised 48-bed plan and can be expected to appropriately reduce its bed use level as community-based services are further consolidated.</p>

  <p>In terms of the planning assumptions for the remaining categories of mental health beds at Gartnavel Hospital, the board have confirmed that the number of Intensive Psychiatric Care Unit beds are to remain at 12: 10 for the Greater Glasgow area and two for the Clyde area. As with adult acute mental health services, the board&rsquo;s assumptions are based on historically low occupancy levels, meaning the Clyde area activity can be absorbed without constraining current levels of Greater Glasgow activity.</p>

  <p>There are no changes in the assumptions around the older people&rsquo;s contingent of 45 beds at Gartnavel as the <em>Vision for the Vale</em> proposes that the relevant patients from the Clyde area should be treated at the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS boards as employers to take forward Agenda for Change Reviews. However, I understand that following the start of the review process in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, it has been necessary to revise the projected timelines. This has been taken forward in partnership between the board and the staff side and under the revised plan the review process for Healthcare Sciences is now due to commence on 29 May. Staff will have eight weeks to submit paperwork and it is expected, therefore, that the reviews will commence at the end of July 2009.</p>

  <p>General Ophthalmic Services (GOS) is a demand led primary care service. The (GOS) budget is non-discretionary and NHS boards are funded to the level of their expenditure in meeting the costs in their area of providing the NHS eye examinations, optical vouchers issued and the fees for domiciliary visits. The GOS budget for 2008-09 was &pound;83.9 million and is &pound;87.4 million for 2009-10.</p>

  <p>An additional &pound;8 million of capital funding was made available to optical practices through NHS boards over the financial years 2007-08 and 2008-09, primarily for the provision of digital fundus cameras to further support the development of the NHS eye examinations.</p>

  <p>NHS boards also received a further &pound;2.6 million of pump priming funding over the financial years 2007-08 and 2008-09 to help implement the recommendations of the Review of Community Eyecare Services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The distinction between nursing homes and residential care homes was removed in the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001. All services providing accommodation together with nursing, personal care or personal support are registered with the Care Commission as care homes. The arrangements for monitoring the quality of care in care homes through inspection and complaints investigation are an operational matter for the Care Commission.</p>

  <p>As part of its commitment to ensuring good quality care, the Care Commission introduced in April 2008 a grading scheme for care services, including care homes. This was in response to what service users, their family and carers want, and was piloted in the 2007-08 inspection year. The grading system provides clear information to everyone about the quality of each care service across different aspects of that service.</p>

  <p>Further information about how the commission inspects care homes and its grading system is available from its chief executive. Her contact details are:</p>

  <p>We have not run out of funding for the Rural Priorities scheme for 2009.</p>

  <p>Rural Priorities is successfully investing in rural Scotland, and in four rounds we have approved &pound;124 million for 1,800 projects in rural Scotland. SRDP has a huge role to play in Scotland&rsquo;s economic recovery and the funding delivered so far demonstrates the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural Scotland.</p>

  <p>By making &pound;10 million available for the next round we are giving rural businesses &ndash; large and small &ndash; the chance to start even more projects which will create sustainable rural communities for future generations.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, we will hold two further funding rounds in this calendar year; one in August for 2009 funding, and one in November, which will concentrate on opening up the 2010 budget. The closing date for the August round will be June 22.</p>

  <p>I can also confirm that in the future we intend to hold three funding rounds per calendar year which will give potential applicants a clear timetable for the remainder of the scheme.</p>

  <p>The high number of applications so far shows that Rural Priorities has captured the imagination of rural Scotland and their increasing quality demonstrates that its objectives are increasingly understood, although we recognise the need for improving certain elements.</p>

  <p>The decision on the future of the Scottish Qualifications Authority&rsquo;s (SQA) Dalkeith accommodation must deliver the best possible balance between value for money and the effective delivery of services to the public of Scotland at a time of increasing economic and public sector pressures. One of the considerations which is to be taken into account is the travel to work area of the SQA&rsquo;s staff. The Scottish Public Finance Manual (SPFM) requires a wide range of options to be considered. Therefore, options both within and outwith Midlothian have been included.</p>

  <p>The registration of septic tanks with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has been a requirement since 2006 under the Water Environment (Controlled Activities)(Scotland) Regulations 2005. The register ensures SEPA has current information on the location of discharges, the water bodies to which they discharge together with the risk of pollution. This information helps the development of long term strategies for protecting Scotland&rsquo;s environment.</p>

  <p>Septic tank registrations are recorded and maintained as part of SEPA&rsquo;s existing registry functions. There is no identifiable additional cost to SEPA of processing septic tank registrations and no additional staff are employed for this purpose.</p>
