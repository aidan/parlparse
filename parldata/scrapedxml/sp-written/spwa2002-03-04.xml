  <p>A report entitled <i>Putting the Pieces in Place</i> has been compiled in conjunction with NHS boards. I am placing copies in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 19606).</p>

  <p>The report summarises the impressive range of work that is under way and planned as a direct result of the Health Improvement Fund. It also indicates that NHS boards and local partners, including local authorities and community organisations, are building effective co-operative working relationships. We intend to review the experience to date, in consultation with national partners, as a means of identifying and disseminating best practice.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executivehow it intends to respond to the report on the Management Review of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p>

  <p>I received the report of the Management Review, led by Jonathan Pryce, on 28 February. I welcome the report which analyses the pressures that the service is under and identifies the need for significant managerial, structural and cultural changes in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. I believe the report provides a sound basis on which to further modernise the organisation to ensure that it commands public confidence, provides an excellent service to all, deals with business in a timely and efficient manner and offers a satisfying and challenging career for staff with effective team-working between legal and non-legal staff.</p>

  <p>I have agreed with the First Minister that the necessary investment will be made to make the changes we decide to implement.</p>

  <p>I am accepting one of the reports main recommendations by appointing Robert Gordon as Chief Executive of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service from today. Andrew Normand, currently Crown Agent, is moving today to undertake a special project for the Deputy First Minister and I on the integration of objectives of the various elements of the criminal justice system. Norman McFadyen, currently Regional Procurator Fiscal for Lothian and Borders has today become Crown Agent Designate and has assumed the legal and prosecution policy responsibilities of the Crown Agent. He will become Crown Agent in the new management structure in due course.</p>

  <p>The Chief Executive and Crown Agent Designate will start work immediately on implementing the recommendations of the review. They will ensure that there is further consultation on the detail and implementation of the report. A copy of the full report is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>
