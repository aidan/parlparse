  <p>The &#163;44.8 million spent on restoration work in Scotland&#8217;s canals in 2000-01 included funding for the restoration of the Millennium Link. The Millennium Link was a major project which involved the building of bridges, tunnels, new sections of canals, and the Falkirk Wheel.</p>

  <p>Details of the funding allocated by the Scottish Executive to British Waterways this year can be found in the answer given to question S2W-2803 on 30 September 2003.

  <p>The regulation of international trade is a reserved matter. However, Scottish Executive officials maintain regular contact with officials in the Department of Trade and Industry and other Government departments regarding trade issues, including those relating to the WTO, and how these may impact on the Executive&#8217;s responsibilities. The Cancun conference agreed a new deadline of 15 December 2003 to try and resolve the issues that could not be resolved at Cancun. Scottish Executive officials will continue to liase with UK Government departments on these and the other on-going negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-10-10.10.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa1010.htm#8">

  <p>VAT is a reserved matter. However, the Scottish ministers have been advised that the UK Government considers it unlikely that the decision of the tribunal in the case of the Pre-School Learning Alliance will have an effect on voluntary organisations.</p>

  <p>Normally, the public funding of community activities does not constitute payment for a service, and thus it is not subject to VAT. The tribunal considered that the circumstances were different in the case of the Pre-School Learning Alliance in that the arrangements had, unusually, led to an agreement to supply services.</p>
