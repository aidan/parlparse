  <p>No financial provisions have been agreed with Highlands and Islands Enterprise to provide future support to the proposed Cairngorm Funicular Railway. The Secretary of State gave approval to Highlands and Islands Enterprise&#146;s proposal to support the Cairngorm Funicular Railway project in 1997, subject to three conditions. One of these conditions was that there should be no further financial contribution to the project from the Secretary of State (ie the Scottish Executive, after devolution), whether through HIE or otherwise.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is considering designating the sea around Fair Isle as a Marine Special Protection Area, or creating a statutory exclusion zone round the island into which vessels carrying hazardous cargoes may not sail.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not yet received advice from its statutory nature conservation advisers on the identification of areas appropriate for classification as marine Special Protection Areas under the EC Wild Birds Directive 79/409/EEC. Maritime safety and related issues are reserved functions. The Scottish Executive is aware that guidance by the International Maritime Organisation sets out recommended routes in the Fair Isle Channel for ships carrying hazardous cargo. I understand that the UK Government keeps these matters under constant review, and that they are analysing the UK coastline with a view to consulting in due course about marine environmental high risk areas to help inform policy on protective measures such as routeing systems for ships.</p>

  <p>No estimate has been made of the cost of upgrading the A77 to dual carriageway status between Whitletts roundabout and Stranraer. A Route Action Plan (RAP) study recently undertaken on this section of the route recommended several individual schemes together with road safety improvement measures to bring the whole route up to a consistent standard.</p>
