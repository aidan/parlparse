  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of any impact of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on (a) civil liberties, (b) policing generally and (c) the operation of its departments; whether ECHR has had any impact on the spending levels of (i) its departments and (ii) non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) in the current financial year and whether it will detail any estimated impact on spending levels in the next three years, broken down by department and NDPB and showing any costings.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-01-17.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0117.htm#1">

  <p>The UK has been bound by the European Convention of Human Rights since 1951. The principal effect of the Human Rights Act is to allow UK citizens to assert their Convention rights in domestic courts, rather than having to take their cases to Strasbourg. As such, it will have a positive impact on civil liberties, by bringing human rights home and giving them a place at the heart of civic society.</p>

  <p>As far as the impact on policing is concerned, it is in the first instance for Chief Constables to assess the implications of the legislation for operational policing. The Association of Chief Policy Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) has put arrangements in place to assess the policies and procedures of Scottish forces in the light of their obligations under the Convention, and a range of awareness-raising and training activities have been organised for police officers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has carried out an audit of all areas of activity in order to identify any potential incompatibilities with the Convention; and it has taken prompt and appropriate action, including legislation, where problems have been identified.</p>

  <p>As far as costs are concerned, I refer to my answers to questions S1W-2571 and 2572. The Executive has made provision for the Crown Office, the Legal Aid Fund and the Scottish Courts Service to take account of ECHR issues arising in criminal and civil proceedings under the Scotland Act and Human Rights Act. The total provision for these services principally in respect of the ECHR was &#163;6.5 million in 1999-2000, &#163;10.6 million in 2000-01 and &#163;8.9 million in 2001-02. Nothing has happened since then to cause us to revise those estimates. However, costs resulting from the consideration of ECHR issues cannot readily be disaggregated from other costs incurred in civil or criminal proceedings. The same difficulty arises in relation to any ECHR-related spending by departments of the Executive and non-departmental public bodies. The detailed breakdown requested by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton is therefore not available.</p>

  <p>The timetable for the tendering of the 2002-07 Northern Isles passenger ferry services subsidy reflected the ending of the existing subsidy contract in summer 2002 with the present operator, P&amp;O Scottish Ferries, and the full implementation of new safety regulations (Stockholm Agreement, and Safety of Life at Sea rules) on 1 October 2002. The current vessels would not comply with the new safety requirements from that date and bidders had to be given sufficient time to provide new vessels. The Executive was aware of the shipyard intervention support issues involved, but they were primarily a matter for the shipyards and bidding operator concerned, and the Executive timetable for decisions was not accelerated because of them.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8131 by Sarah Boyack on 4 July 2000, why the decision on preferred bidder status for the Northern Isles Contract planned for July 2000 was not made until October 2000 and, in particular, whether financial, technical or administrative factors caused the delay.</p>

  <p>Costed bids for the Northern Isles passenger ferry services contract were received on 23 June 2000. Evaluation of the bids proved more complex than expected, involving detailed analysis of the costs, liabilities and service involved. The financial plans were assessed in detail in relation to the associated terms and conditions, financial, accountancy and legal issues.</p>

  <p>In evaluating the costed bids, as with the tendering process as a whole, the Executive had to ensure equal and fair competition and that the process complied with European Regulation and Guidelines for State aids in the maritime sector and with Scottish Executive procurement procedures.</p>

  <p>In general, the position in law is that what is illegal &quot;offline&quot; is also illegal &quot;online&quot;. Those who commit, or attempt to commit, crimes online are therefore liable to prosecution. The law also provides for specific offences of accessing or tampering with computer systems. Changes to the law relating to the Internet is reserved to Westminster. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland is represented on a UK-wide Internet Crime Forum that allows policy and practice in this area to be kept under review.</p>

  <p>The answer to your own question S1W-6102 explained why the Executive did not collect information centrally on a wide variety of conditions, including osteoporosis, and the position set out in that answer has not changed. While Scottish Needs Assessment Programmes are effectively endorsed by the Executive, which sponsors the programme, they are intended as tools for health boards to use in preparing their individual strategies for their areas, rather than mandatory policy documents.</p>

  <p>The Public Transport Fund (PTF) was announced in the Scottish Transport White Paper in 1998 and was specifically created to assist local authorities in providing key value for money developments to their public transport network. Prior to the PTF, public transport projects were eligible for funding under the previous Government&#8217;s Transport Challenge Fund which operated for projects commencing in financial years 1997-98 and 1998-99. The allocations made from these funds between 1997 and 2000 are set out in the table A and the budget for the PTF in future years is set out in table B.</p>

  <p>On 28 November last year we published a consultation paper on strategic priorities for Scotland&#8217;s railways as part of the process of developing directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority. During this process we will give consideration to a wide range of issues, including rail links to airports.</p>

  <p>In fulfilment of the undertakings given in the UK integrated transport white paper, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (which is the sponsoring UK department for aviation policy) initiated a series of regional airport studies. That for Scotland was carried out jointly with the Scottish Executive. In conjunction with the Scottish study, an additional project has been undertaken on the rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports with support from the shadow Strategic Rail Authority.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is responsible for the management and maintenance of trunk roads in Scotland, including measures to ensure the safety of users of those roads. The Executive has no specific plans to review the provision of safety measures outside schools on trunk roads. Safety on the trunk road network is continually monitored, including sections in close proximity to schools, to identify and implement any appropriate safety measures.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a duty under the Road Traffic Act 1988 to carry out a programme of measures designed to promote road safety on local roads. Decisions on specific measures such as road markings, speed limits, sleeping policemen and other speed restrictions in the proximity of schools to safeguard pupils are matters for individual authorities.</p>

  <p>In May, the Executive made available additional resources, totalling &#163;5.2 million, to enable local authorities to take forward a wide range of Safer Routes to School projects in the current financial year.</p>

  <p>Health Board Drug and Therapeutic Committees are providing doctors with guidance on the prescription of Zyban. As a prescription-only medicine, clinical responsibility for the use of this drug rests with the prescriber who should discuss this treatment with the patient concerned.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the appropriate use of Zyban is also contained in the British National Formulary, published by the British Medical Association and by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and issued free of charge to doctors. In addition, Zyban is dispensed with a Patient Information Leaflet to ensure that it is used safely and correctly.</p>

  <p>The Executive is looking at the availability of smoking cessation services, Zyban is one element of this.</p>
