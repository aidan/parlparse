  <p>In our spending plans for 2008-09 to 2010-11 we have set out plans to spend &pound;3.2 million each year on major events and themed years. A large proportion of this funding in 2008-09 and 2009-10 will be allocated to Homecoming Scotland to cover the project&rsquo;s costs, including support for events which will drive tourism growth and link to the themes of Homecoming Scotland. EventScotland aim to use that funding to attract further funding for Homecoming Scotland from a range of sources, including local authorities, private sector sponsors and European sources. In addition, VisitScotland will incorporate the Homecoming Scotland message in all of its marketing starting from early in 2008, and that in-kind marketing support over the two years will be worth a great deal.</p>

  <p>Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited are obliged to follow EU procurement guidelines in tendering the contract for new vessels. Ferguson Shipbuilders originally expressed an interest and were invited to tender. However, early in the tender period Ferguson Shipbuilders withdrew from the tender competition. Consequently no Scottish shipbuilders tendered for the contract.</p>

  <p>Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited are responsible for procuring vessels for use on the Clyde and Hebrides routes. They are bound by EU procurement rules and consequently cannot be seen to encourage one bidder over another. The tendering process was advertised widely to ensure the maximum degree of interest. It was important that all bidders were treated equally during the tender process.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Climate Change Programme sets a carbon contribution for the forestry sector of 0.6MtC savings annually by 2010, rising to around 1MtC per year by 2020. This equates to the annual removal of 2MtCo2 and 3.7MtCo2 respectively.</p>

  <p>We will be issuing a consultation shortly on the proposed Climate Change Bill which will include the target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050.</p>

  <p>The main forestry activities that will contribute towards meeting these targets are increased levels of woodland creation, the continuing development of biomass as a renewable energy source, using wood as a substitute for energy intensive building materials, and reducing timber haulage miles.</p>

  <p>In the interests of stability, as agreed with COSLA, the distribution of all local authority funding will be distributed by using the most appropriate indicator. Wherever appropriate, individual local authorities will receive similar shares of funding in the next three years as they are currently receiving.

  <p>The following table shows the 2007-08 value of each specific grant and the supported borrowing allocation that has been rolled into the General Capital Support. The 13 per cent figure refers to the total increase in support for capital which was &pound;860.4 million in 2007-08 and that this figure includes continuing ring-fenced grants (&pound;273.3 million) and general capital funding (&pound;587.1 million).

  <p>Our historic concordat with local government means that central and local government have, for the first time, a shared set of national outcomes and indicators. Each council will develop a Single Outcome Agreement with the Scottish Government, and we are working to have these in place by April 2008. Local and central government will work in partnership to deliver these shared outcomes.</p>

  <p>The concordat details those grants which will no longer be ring-fenced. The removal of bureaucracy and regulation around these will allow local authorities to operate more efficiently and with greater flexibility and freedom than ever before. Reinstating the ring fencing would be a very last resort only if the partnership was failing to deliver. I have no reason to anticipate that will happen.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise has been working closely with, and has provided a range of support and advice to, Ferguson Shipbuilders in Port Glasgow. Ferguson Shipbuilders is probably the only Scottish civil shipyard currently with the capability to undertake the recent contract for the construction of a vessel for the Islay service. Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s work has been undertaken with a view to ensuring the company maximises its opportunity to bid for any appropriate work, aimed at helping to retain and to create Scottish jobs. However, while Scottish Enterprise can bring appropriate invitations to tender of which it is aware to the attention of private companies, it is not able to influence what are private company decisions on whether to bid. Any decision on whether or not to tender is a matter for the company&rsquo;s own commercial judgment.</p>

  <p>No meetings are planned with the Community Transport Association regarding the formulation and implementation of single outcome agreements (SOAs). Officials have recently discussed the effects of the Strategic Spending Review 2007 on the funding of community transport by telephone with the CTA&rsquo;s Director for Scotland. However, he did not request a meeting with officials to discuss SOAs.</p>
