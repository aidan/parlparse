  <p>No statistics are available indicating the number of reports received by the Procurator Fiscal alleging the commission of the offences referred to. The available statistics indicate that between 1984 and 1998 inclusive, 11 persons were prosecuted in Scotland, where the main offence libelled was culpable and reckless conduct in relation to the supply of solvents. Of those 11 persons, nine were convicted of culpable and reckless conduct. Of the nine persons convicted, two were sentenced to custodial disposals, four were fined and three were ordered to perform community service.</p>

I have therefore put in place a guarantee in relation to the funding gap for these organisations to enable them to plan effectively for the new programme and I have asked officials to bring forward as a matter of urgency recommendations as to how such a scheme should work.</p>

  <p>The Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority (SPTA) submitted their outline business case for the project to the then Scottish Office in October 1998. Several issues arising from this submission required further scrutiny. A number of exchanges followed communication of the Scottish Office&#8217;s concerns to the SPTA in January 1999. At that time the Scottish Office offered the SPTA help, through its officials, in revising the project&#8217;s economic and business case and updating cost benefit calculations previously undertaken. Over the following few months, the Scottish Office and then the Scottish Executive issued several reminders to SPTA about responding to the concerns expressed and also the offer of help. In January 2000, the SPTA submitted a reappraisal of the investment case for the project. However, that information needs to be supplemented by the final figures to be included in the full business case, which SPTA have not yet completed. I understand this is now expected in May or June. Until this further information is received and analysed, Scottish Ministers will not be in a position to reach a view about the project's value for money.</p>

  <p>A condition of all PPP projects is that they should be able to demonstrate value for money. Consequently, the Scottish Executive&#8217;s funding of &pound;5 million from the 1998 Transport Challenge Fund towards the cost of the Larkhall to Milngavie Rail route and the level playing field support of up to &pound;2.26 million per annum, for which the project may be eligible as part of the PPP arrangements, depends upon value for money being demonstrated satisfactorily in the full business case for the project which the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority is still preparing.</p>

  <p>The Ministerial Group on Sustainable Scotland, which I announced to the Parliament in the debate on 3 February, met for the first time on 18 January. It considered first thoughts on its programme of work and agreed that an immediate start should be made on indicators of sustainable development. A consultancy is to be let at a cost in the region of &pound;20,000. As yet no other work for which a cost can be identified has been set in train. The costs of running the group itself are not identifiable separately from the overall effort on sustainable development.</p>

  <p>The Energy and the Environment Group, which I chair, considers a range of issues, such as climate change and renewable energy. Close links between the two groups are ensured by an element of common membership. No specific costs are expected to be incurred.</p>

  <p>A core component of the Skillseekers programme is that the young person works towards an SVQ up to Level 3. SVQs are competence-based qualifications which reflect the work-based nature of Skillseekers. SVQs are designed to assess the candidate&#8217;s competencies against occupational standards and to test understanding of the theoretical part of the qualification. Modern Apprenticeships, which are delivered in Scotland through the Skillseekers programme, include aspects of other qualifications in addition to the SVQ, as part of the Modern Apprenticeship framework.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is considering the range of qualifications which are funded through Skillseekers as part of the &quot;Opportunities and Choices&quot; consultation exercise. An announcement will be made shortly. <br /></p>
