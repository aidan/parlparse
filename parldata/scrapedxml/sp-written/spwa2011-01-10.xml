  <p>Car parking management is a matter for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that has a contract with CP Plus Ltd to provide car parking management services at the hospitals covered by the NHS board&rsquo;s car parking policy. The contract sets out clearly the duties of the contractor in managing those car parks, including the car parking attendants, in line with the board&rsquo;s car parking management policy.</p>
