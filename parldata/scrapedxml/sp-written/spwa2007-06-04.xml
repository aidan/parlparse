  <p>The cost of respite is dependent on the type and level of respite provided and the client groups for whom it is provided. The Respite Task Group, established last year, estimated the average cost of residential respite as &pound;629 per week. On that basis, the cost of 10,000 residential respite weeks would be &pound;6.3 million.</p>

  <p>In a statement to the Scottish Parliament on 31 May 2007 I set out our objectives for energy. These are:</p>

  <p>the need to reduce carbon emissions, and so tackle climate change;</p>

  <p>the need to ensure security of energy supplies by fostering a vibrant, diverse and competitive energy sector that is rooted here in Scotland;</p>

  <p>the need to deliver energy at an affordable price for both individuals and businesses, and</p>

  <p>ensuring that energy policy allows the energy sector to continue to make its vital contribution to economic growth.</p>

  <p>I am confident that with clean coal technology and renewables we can achieve these objectives without the need for new nuclear power stations.</p>

  <p>We are also committed to delivering a Scottish Energy Strategy in coming months and will be consulting with a wide range of stakeholders.</p>

The Executive supports a coherent approach to energy policy, recognising that promoting reduced energy consumption and promoting low carbon technologies are key to achieving sustainable economic growth.

  <p>Scottish Development International (SDI), the international arm of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s economic development agency, has doubled its resources in the Russian market in the last 18 months.

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-211 on 4 June 2007, that gives a list of existing services on offer to Scottish companies from SDI in the Russian market. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition to these, the Enterprise Networks provide a wide range of products and services to companies seeking to internationalise. This complements the SDI-led market awareness raising work and guidance on offer through UK Trade and Investment network/website for companies considering doing business with Russia.</p>

  <p>Where clinically possible, clinicians are encouraged to prescribe generically. In 2006, the cost of prescribed branded drugs for which a generic equivalent was usually available was &pound;10,843,438. This figure does not include the cost of modified release preparations or antiepileptic drugs where generic substitution might not be clinically appropriate. In some instances, branded drugs will need to be dispensed where the generic equivalent is temporarily in short supply.</p>

  <p>The cost shown relates to prescribed items dispensed in the community by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors and excludes medicines dispensed by hospitals and hospital-based clinics. The cost given is that before the addition of any pharmacy fees and deduction of any drug manufacturers discount and patient charges.</p>

  <p>We recognise the acute shortage of affordable homes that exists in many communities, whether urban, rural or island, and are committed to improving the supply and affordability of housing through targeted investment and by removing barriers to provision.

  <p>The five NHS boards that levy charges provide car parking as an in-house service, through a private sector provider or a combination of these methods of provision and accordingly each have different charging structures.</p>

  <p>The current guidance on car park charging is clear that NHS boards must not introduce charging as a means of generating income but charging may be justified if the income generated is used by the board to cover any significant costs in providing parking facilities (e.g. capital charges, maintenance costs, administration costs, security costs, security lighting, CCTV); to cover the cost of providing new or improved parking facilities or making existing facilities more secure, or to better manage car parking facilities by discouraging unauthorised users (e.g. fly-parkers) but in so doing, measures taken to discourage unauthorised users must not be detrimental to the car parking arrangements for staff, patients, carers and visitors.</p>

  <p>We intend to review the guidance issued recently to NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are required to consult the public on proposals for significant changes to services. It is for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to decide on the timing of consultation on any proposals for change to the delivery of maternity services within the Clyde area. I have made clear that I will introduce a process of independent scrutiny of boards&rsquo; proposals before these are consulted on publicly. The scrutiny stage would review the range of options to be consulted on. I am currently considering how independent scrutiny will be undertaken and will make an announcement soon.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, through Scottish Development International (SDI), the international arm of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s economic development agency, provides support to individual companies and organises trade delegations to oil and gas provinces throughout the world, including Russia.</p>

  <p>This gives companies new to the market the opportunity to meet with contractors and operators in the oil and gas sector and attend meetings and presentations on how to operate in an overseas market. Twelve Scottish companies participated in a trade delegation to Moscow in June 2004.</p>

  <p>SDI has an office in Moscow which works very closely with the UK Embassy and UK Trade and Investment on research, assistance and recruiting Scottish companies interested in the Russian market for trade delegations and exhibitions.</p>

  <p>In 2007, SDI has taken space at 8th International Conference and Exhibition for Oil and Gas Resources. Development of the Russian Arctic and CIS Continental Shelf (RAO/CIS) Exhibition 11 to 13 September, and the Moscow International Oil and Gas Exhibition (MIOGE) in June.</p>

  <p>Any proposal to build a new nuclear power station in Scotland would require consent from Scottish ministers.

  <p>The distribution of National Lottery funds is a matter for the lottery distribution bodies: Scottish Arts Council, Scottish Screen, sportscotland, the Big Lottery Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund. The information requested is not held centrally by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) maintains an electronic database of national lottery awards. Details of the total awarded to each country, each constituency area and each local authority area for each lottery good cause can be obtained through the DCMS website at <a href="http://www.lottery.culture.gov.uk/search.asp" target="_blank">http://www.lottery.culture.gov.uk/search.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that lottery distributors in Scotland will lose approximately one year&rsquo;s worth of income over the period to 2012.</p>

  <p>The previous Scottish Executive wrote to the UK Government asking that they look seriously at alternative funding streams to the National Lottery to fund the additional cost of the 2012 Olympics. Having reviewed the position, I would fully endorse this and will be working to vigorously pursue this.</p>
