  <p>The additional drug treatment and rehabilitation money was allocated to drug action teams (DAT) on the basis of the quantified impact of DAT proposals on the three identified national priorities namely: increasing the number of clients entering treatment; reducing waiting times and increasing the range of interventions, and on evidence of deliverability within agreed timescales.</p>

  <p>In terms of &quot;evidence of deliverability within agreed timescales&quot; we considered DAT performance to date and looked for clearly planned, well thought out proposals which included some indication of how the aim of the proposal would be achieved with timescales and a brief breakdown of cost. In particular we looked for proposals which complemented existing provision (i.e. filled a clearly identified and evidenced gap in existing services or provided additionality to existing provision), proposals which demonstrated a strategic approach to development and proposals which had secured part-funding from elsewhere. The underlying principles of Best Value and Integrated Care were also considered.</p>

  <p>Guidance on recordkeeping is constantly under review. Much of the Executive&rsquo;s internal guidance has been updated and adapted this year to reflect the transition from paper to electronic recordkeeping that is currently underway. An updated Records Management Manual reflecting these changes should be issued around the end of 2005. The Records Management Manual is published on the Executive's website.</p>

  <p>Training is available to Scottish Executive staff covering a range of good practice issues, including on the style and content of records of meetings. The Executive&rsquo;s recommended best practice is that minutes of meetings should record key discussion points and key decisions, and that they should be published where possible in line with the Executive&rsquo;s general commitment to transparency and openness.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not issued specific guidance to NHS boards on the provision of physiotherapy to people who have had a stroke. Each board has the autonomy to determine the level of service provision on the basis of local needs and priorities. Provision in each NHS board will be informed by the advice of a Managed Clinical Network for Stroke, which is involved in all aspects of care and rehabilitation planning. Funding from the Chronic Heart Disease/Stroke Strategy has allowed many boards to recruit additional physiotherapy support.</p>

  <p>Although not specific to physiotherapy, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will be developing a best practice statement on stroke rehabilitation. This will complement the existing evidence-based guideline for the rehabilitation of stroke patients produced by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. This specifies that &quot;all patients who have difficulties with movement following stroke should have access to a physiotherapist specialising in stroke. Physiotherapy treatment should be based on an assessment of each patient&rsquo;s unique problems&quot;.</p>

  <p>Patients who suffer a stroke are admitted to hospital as an emergency so there are no formal waiting time targets set for the various treatments following diagnosis. They should receive immediate medical assessment, with all relevant investigations, including CT scan, carried out within 48 hours of admission and no later than seven days.</p>

  <p>There are no formal waiting time targets for the issue of specific equipment for stroke patients, for access to speech therapists and CT scanners or for stages in the journey of care for stroke patients. However, each NHS board has a duty to ensure that patients have access to these when they need it.</p>

  <p>If a patient presents to their GP with a transient ischaemic attack, also known as a TIA or a mini-stroke, an appointment will be arranged for them at a neurovascular clinic. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Chronic Heart Disease/Stroke Strategy recommends that these patients should be seen within seven days and ideally within 72 hours of their event.</p>

  <p>There are three national surveillance tools used to monitor physical activity levels in Scotland. These are: the Scottish Health Survey which monitors overall levels of physical activity in Scotland among adults; the Health Education Population Survey which monitors changes in knowledge, attitudes, motivation and action among adults around physical activity, and the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children, a World Health Organization cross-national collaborative study which compares Scottish children at ages 11, 13 and 15 to children of the same age in other countries.</p>

  <p>Targets within the National Strategy for Sport, <em>Sport 21</em>, which relate to physical activity, will be measured through the Scottish Health Survey, the Scottish Opinion Survey and data compiled from schools by education authorities.</p>

  <p>Six to eight weeks before breast screening appointments are due to commence for women from a given GP practice, a Prior Notification List (PNL) is issued to the practice by the breast screening centre. The PNL contains the details of every woman at that practice who is eligible for screening. GPs are requested to add women from their practice in the eligible age range who are not on the PNL, for example those who have recently joined the practice.</p>

  <p>GPs can also refer any women over 50 for breast screening if her screening appointment is due when she joins the practice, even if women from her new practice are not scheduled to be screened at that time.</p>

  <p>It is a mandatory requirement of the NHSScotland Property Transactions Handbook that NHSScotland bodies carry out trawl procedures, in accordance with departmental guidance, to identify any relevant interest in a property and to deal direct with any prospective purchaser who expresses such an interest.</p>

  <p>Departmental guidance, which mirrors that contained in the Scottish Public Finance Manual (SPFM), requires NHSScotland bodies to carry out a trawl of Scottish Executive departments and sponsored bodies. The trawl process is now administered by Executive&rsquo;s Property Advice Division which circulates details electronically of those properties identified as surplus to requirement for operational purposes.</p>

  <p>Where an interest is noted there are detailed guidelines contained within the SPFM on a mechanism for dealing with the price at which the property should transfer that is economical, transparent and fair and which is designed to avoid public bodies incurring unnecessary costs in relation to property that is already held within the public sector.</p>

  <p>It is not normal practice for clawback clauses to be included when concluding missives for the sale of surplus NHSScotland property.</p>

  <p>However, in every disposal NHSScotland bodies are required to consider, in the light of professional advice, whether clawback/right of pre-emption or other provisions covering future change of use should be included in the disposition as part of the terms of sale. Where the planning position is uncertain or enquiries regarding the planning consents likely to be granted have not been satisfactorily resolved the use of such provisions must be considered. Advice from the property adviser and where appointed the independent valuer will be critical in deciding what safeguards are put in place.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Finance Manual (SPFM), issued by Scottish ministers, provides guidance to the Scottish Executive and other relevant bodies on the proper handling of public funds, including property. The SPFM includes detailed guidance on the disposal of surplus property and this guidance is replicated in the NHSScotland Property Transaction Handbook which is provided as a ready source of reference for all NHSScotland bodies.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland bodies are free to conclude property transactions without reference to the Health Department unless particular circumstances require notification to and the approval of the Accountable Officer. However, they are required to adhere to the guidance contained in the handbook which includes not only the mandatory requirements with which bodies must comply but also guidance on best practice in managing property transactions.</p>

  <p>One of the principal means by which the department ensures that full value is achieved is by the requirement for a property adviser, an appropriately qualified external adviser, to be appointed for every transaction. The property adviser assumes overall responsibility for advising on the non-legal aspects of a transaction. In major or potentially difficult transactions an Independent Valuer must be appointed as a second source of independent professional advice.</p>

  <p>It also places responsibility on NHSScotland bodies for ensuring that on completion each transaction is duly certified. The purpose of certification is to ensure that the responsibility for property transactions given to NHSScotland bodies is properly recognised and acted upon by bodies&rsquo; chief executives who are ultimately responsible for the overall management of all property transactions.</p>

  <p>Finally, all transactions are subject to monitoring as part of each body&rsquo;s internal audit programme and completed reports are submitted to the Health Department for consideration. And any further action deemed appropriate.</p>

  <p>The response to S2W-17655, answered on 2 August 2005, related to admissions to hospital resulting from road traffic accidents. The STATS 19 report publishes data that cover all injury road accidents (i.e. accidents in which one or more people are injured) which become known to the police in Scotland. Thus the two reports are not directly comparable. Police forces submit the STATS 19 returns, which give details of road accidents, in which one or more people were injured, which occurred on public roads and which were reported to them. Many of the casualties in such accidents are not injured sufficiently badly to be admitted to hospital - so would not be counted in the hospital admissions figures There will also be accidents which result in someone being admitted to hospital but which are not reported to the police. For example, a child who was badly injured when falling off a bike in the street, with no other vehicle being involved, might well be admitted to hospital (and recorded there as a road accident casualty) without the police being informed - so would not be counted in the Stats 19 figures.</p>

  <p>Road accident statistics are available in <em>Key 2004 Road Accident Statistics</em>, (Bib. number 36730) <em>and Road Accidents Scotland 2003,</em> (Bib. number 34523).</p>

  <p>In normal circumstances, i.e. when there is not an enhanced state of security alert, hand delivered correspondence and packages from unexpected sources are normally accepted at the security gatehouse where they are screened in an area which provides bomb blast protection. The deliverer is asked to remain until items are screened and deemed safe for internal delivery. Certain additional security measures apply during an enhanced state of alert. One of these is that we accept only fully documented deliveries. This removes the increased probability of identifying suspect packages from unknown sources. It also means that the safety of security staff is not unnecessarily compromised during higher risk periods.</p>

  <p>Security staff on duty will advise anyone wishing to deliver undocumented items of the reason for non acceptance and will provide full Parliament addressee details to enable the deliverer to use the external mail system if they wish. All external mail for the Parliament is screened at an off-site location prior to delivery.</p>
