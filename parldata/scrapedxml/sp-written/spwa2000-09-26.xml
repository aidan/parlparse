  <p>The Scottish Executive have put in place a new electricity and energy management services contract with Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) from 1 July 2000. The new contract is for two years with a possible extension of a further one year and covers 12 Scottish Executive bodies and 14 other Scottish public sector organisations across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Projected savings in comparison to the previous contract for the period 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2002 are &pound;515,000. After taking account of the market effect of the proposed climate change levy (CCL) of approximately &pound;290,000, a net saving of &pound;225,000 is anticipated.</p>

  <p>CCL is revenue neutral. The monies raised will be returned in full through a reduction in National Insurance Contributions and through support for energy efficiency measures. This cannot, as yet, be calculated by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The terms of the contract negotiated with SSE provide for energy management services in the following areas: customer needs analysis, energy audits, consumption data, advisory services and the delivery of energy awareness programmes to staff. Promoting energy conservation will reduce energy bills and the subsequent level of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to break down these savings and the effect of CCL by department, as buildings are shared and departmental areas are not separately metered.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what detoxification programmes are available to current methadone users.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-09-26.S1W-8873.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80192" speakername="Angus MacKay" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0926.htm#8873">

  <p>I refer Ms Scanlon to the responses to her earlier related questions (S1W-8866, S1W-8871 and S1W-8872). Methadone treatment is a long-term process and joint assessment and care management arrangements are an important component of any good programme. Good joint assessment ensures that the best kind of detoxification takes place &#8211; whether in the person&#8217;s own home or in a residential centre. The Executive is actively considering the inclusion of questions about such service models in the reporting templates for Drug Action Teams in 2001-02, which will help in giving us a better idea of what is available at local level.</p>

  <p>Of course, a number of good services already exist such as the &quot;Social Firm&quot; project in Angus, which provides links to people coming off drugs with education and employment. Another good initiative is the &quot;Backpacking&quot; home care projects in Ayrshire which involve nurses going to people&#8217;s homes and offering support to those trying to harm reduce or come off drugs. Funding has been given under the New Futures Fund to 21 projects which all seek to encourage people to move away from their drug habit and develop a personal action plan to improve their employability skills. For example, the Glasgow Community Drugs project offers support and a drop-in facility for methadone users and provides an activities programme to support them in the transition to further training and an outreach service.</p>

  <p>I recently announced that I was making an extra &pound;1 million available to voluntary sector organisations for the development of drug rehabilitation services through section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. While applications for a share of this funding are currently under consideration, a feature of the bidding process has been that some areas are attempting to decrease the number of people being sent to residential rehabilitation by developing local services that include home detoxification facilities. These resources should, therefore, help in improving the provision of services for people, including methadone users, who want to come off drugs and be rehabilitated into the community.</p>

  <p>Estimates of revenue commitment resulting from service payments by the public sector are calculated in real and cash terms, rounded to the nearest &pound;1 million, for both signed projects and projects under procurement on a year-by-year and sector-by-sector basis. They are provided to HM Treasury as part of the Public Expenditure Survey and are published in the Treasury &quot;Red Book&quot; as aggregated figures.</p>

  <p>The impact of estimated total revenue commitments for signed Private Finance Initiative or Public/Private Partnership contracts on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s budget is less than 1% in cash terms in any year during the period covered by Scotland&#8217;s Budget Documents.</p>

  <p>Note: The figure for NHS Trusts is negative (-&pound;23 million) because the repayment of existing loans, which scores as a receipt in public expenditure terms, is greater than the draw down of any new loans. It is obviously not a reduction in ability to spend or borrow.</p>

  <p>The average cost of a court hearing to deal with non-payment of a fine in the sheriff court was &pound;35 in 1998-99. Similar information is not readily available in respect of non-payment cases dealt with in the district court. The average fine imposed in Scottish courts was &pound;176 in 1998, the latest year for which data are available. We have commissioned research on implications for the criminal justice system, and hope that the results of this research will be available in the early part of next year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-5993 by Mr Jim Wallace on 12 May 2000, what are the &quot;considerable difficulties&quot; which it sees for any proposed legislation in respect of landed estates and what are the &quot;difficulties of regulation&quot; in ensuring any compliance.</p>

  <p>We can see practical difficulties in several areas relating to a proposal to legislate to require non-resident and corporate owners to appoint a legally responsible local agent. For example, how to enforce requirements upon non-residents; and how to address a failure to comply. There is also the matter of attaching liability to secure the compliance of local agents, and setting appropriate penalties to deal with any failure.</p>

  <p>As I explained, we fully support the principle of accountability, and our Code of Good Practice on Rural Land Ownership will address the matter of local representation.</p>

  <p>Health boards and local authority social work departments incur expenditure in relation to mental health.</p>

  <p>In terms of NHS expenditure, mental illness is equated with the specialties of general psychiatry, adolescent psychiatry, child psychiatry and geriatric psychiatry.</p>

  <p>The figures for the years up to and including 1998-99 are provided in the publication <i>Scottish Health Service Costs</i> for each of the years. Figures relating to expenditure by health boards are not yet available for 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>The table below sets out the expenditure by local authority social work departments on services for people with mental health problems. There is a discontinuity in the data between 1996-97 and 1997-98.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what resources it has put in place to help Greater Glasgow Health Board address the recent increased level of hospital waiting lists.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-09-26.S1W-9248.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0926.htm#9248">

  <p>Greater Glasgow Health Board already receives &pound;8.503 million each year specifically to reduce waiting lists. A further &pound;11.179 million was recently allocated to the health board as its share of the additional &pound;60 million allocated to the NHS in Scotland to tackle waiting times, prepare for winter and reduce the problem of delayed discharge.</p>

  <p>On 8 August I announced the allocation of &pound;11 million for cancer imaging equipment: Glasgow&#8217;s share is &pound;2.573 million. I also announced &pound;5 million for the provision of dedicated MRI scanners at each of Scotland&#8217;s five specialist cancer centres, including the Beatson Oncology Centre attached to the Western Infirmary, Glasgow. In addition, on 29 August I announced the allocation of a further &pound;7 million for the redesign of services. Each NHS Trust in Scotland will receive &pound;225,000 to reduce waiting, bureaucracy and provide a better, more responsive service for patients.</p>

  <p>Sustained improvement can only be achieved by investment underpinned by strategic planning and changes to working practices and service design. I have made it clear to health board and NHS Trust senior management that I expect them to develop strategies to ensure that waiting lists and waiting times are driven down at an early date, and that downward pressure is sustained for the benefit of patients throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Our new staff attendance system will enable our staff resources to be used more effectively and efficiently. It has been discussed with our trade union representatives since spring 1998. We have rescheduled the start to the autumn rather than 1 September to enable a final period for discussion to take place, but we have told them that the status quo is not acceptable as SPS needs to make significant efficiency improvements to become competitive and thus improve job security.</p>

  <p>Our Absence Management Procedure, which will start on 15 October, has been developed fully in partnership with our Trade Union Side. We believe that the new procedure will improve SPS&#8217;s poor sickness absence record.</p>

  <p>Its main features are:</p>

  <p>takes account of the ACAS advisory booklet &#8211; discipline at work;</p>

  <p>supportive home contacts whilst absent;</p>

  <p>supportive return to work meetings held on each occasion of sick absence;</p>

  <p>occupational health advice and support;</p>

  <p>three separate periods of sick absence; or nine days sick absence or any discernible pattern of sick absence in a rolling 12 months period will be formally managed;</p>

  <p>more than 21 consecutive days sick absence qualify as long-term sickness;</p>

  <p>employees have the right to make representation, be represented and appeal against any decision made in the formal procedure.</p>

  <p>The SPS seeks to provide an excellent service at a competitive cost. To achieve this, efficiency savings need to be implemented throughout the service and, in particular, a more flexible staff attendance system and more flexible working practices are required.</p>

  <p>Reducing the number of delayed discharges is a high priority for the Scottish Executive. &pound;60 million has been made available to the NHS &#8211; on top of the existing record levels of funding, to accelerate delivery of a number of priorities, including a reduction in the number of delayed discharges.</p>

  <p>In addition, &pound;10 million is being distributed this year to local authorities to help tackle the problems arising from delays in the discharge of patients from hospital. Scotland&#8217;s 32 local authorities have been asked to submit plans outlining how they will use the additional amounts available to them. The use of these resources will be planned in partnership with health boards so that they can complement the activity funded by the record additional resources available to the NHS.</p>

  <p>Last December the Scottish Executive issued guidance on <i>How to Run Safer Routes to School</i> to each local authority and all schools in Scotland. The guidance provides practical advice to all those involved in the journey to school and will help enable safer routes schemes to become more widespread in Scotland. This will contribute significant improvements to the health, safety and social development of our children.</p>

  <p>In May I announced that local authorities in Scotland would receive additional capital consents totalling &pound;5.2 million to take forward work on the implementation of safer routes to school schemes in the current financial year.</p>

  <p>In June I announced the establishment of the Scottish School Travel Advisory Group (Scottish STAG). This will consider, amongst other things, the report of the UK School Travel Advisory Group and make recommendations on how the report&#8217;s conclusions can best be taken forward in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Most recently, the Executive supported a major conference on the issue of Safer Routes to School, which was run jointly by the Cycling Charity SUSTRANS and Glasgow City Council. The conference took place in Glasgow on 4 September and I gave the keynote address.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority was established under the Education (Scotland) Act 1996. The Act sets out the authority&#8217;s functions and the powers which Scottish Ministers have in relation to SQA. As a Non-Departmental Public Body, the relationship between the SQA and Scottish Ministers is also set out in the authority&#8217;s Management Statement and Financial Memorandum.</p>

  <p>Ministers&#8217; powers in relation to SQA will be considered in the light of the inquiries being undertaken by the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee and the Education Committee of the Scottish Parliament; and by the Policy and Financial Management Review of the SQA being undertaken by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority has long-established quality assurance procedures for the marking process. The inquiry which I have commissioned will determine whether they were used correctly this year and make recommendations about how quality assurance on marking should operate in future.</p>
