  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s policy is to provide funding to national organisations, while funding for groups operating locally should be decided locally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provided funding of &#163;191,844 in 1999-2000, &#163;196,356 in 2000-01, and &#163;202,914 in 2001-02 to the Scottish Refugee Council. This is to assist the council to provide advice, support and practical help to refugees and their families in Scotland, and to fund the council&#8217;s housing policy work with local authorities, housing associations and others on the development of accommodation and support provision and the council&#8217;s own provision of housing support and advice to refugees.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not issued guidance on these matters.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for health boards and trusts to assess and provide for local needs and to determine the staffing levels required for effective service delivery. National recommendations on staffing levels would cut across these responsibilities and would undermine boards&#8217; and trusts&#8217; ability to provide a modern, flexible service matched to local needs.</p>

  <p>The latest information available on the number of consultants recorded as Endocrinology and Diabetes consultants, broken down by health board area, is shown in the table. There are also general physicians who specialise in treating diabetes but who may not be recorded on that basis. Information on the number of diabetologists and specialist diabetes nurses is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>Our promotion of renewable energy developments through the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) is intended to build up a Scottish renewable energy capability, as well as reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. One early result was the recent announcement of a significant inward investment from Vestas, the Danish wind turbine company, whose new manufacturing facility near Campbeltown will provide over 150 jobs in the area.</p>

  <p>We are also working with Scottish Enterprise to encourage Scottish companies to diversify into the manufacturing opportunities which will arise from further development of renewable energy. A series of Scottish Enterprise roadshows on the subject attracted interest from a variety of companies and, as a direct result, several of them are now pursuing opportunities for new business. We will continue to work to strengthen the renewables industry, enabling it to attract investment to Scotland and bring the newer and more expensive technologies nearer to the market.</p>

  <p>The key changes relate to the housing programmes. I have provided details on what we expect to spend on social justice commitments, in both cash and real terms, in answer to question S1W-16746. Level 3 information will be published once we receive final agreement to end year flexibility. These changes will still allow us to meet all our existing commitments and targets and also address additional housing budget pressures.</p>

  <p>The revised plans for the range of Rural Development grant schemes and for Pensions shown in the table reflect estimating changes in the light of outturn in previous years.</p>

  <p>While the revised plans for SABRIs capital will require the bodies to be more efficient in their use of capital resources, planned provision in 2002-03 and 2003-04 remains over &#163;2 million a year higher than in 2000-01. Also, plans to increase current support for the SABRIs by &#163;2 million and &#163;3 million in 2002-03 and 2003-04 respectively are unchanged.</p>

  <p>Some &#163;3.4 million a year was added to the capital Budget of the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency for 2002-03 and 2003-04 in the 2000 Spending Review, to provide for the replacement of a Fishery Protection Vessel. While this provision has been removed from the baseline, I would expect to be able to fund construction of the new vessel from carry forward of end year flexibility entitlements.</p>

  <p>The merger of the three existing water authorities will help secure a wide range of efficiency savings in our water industry. At the same time the Water Industry Commissioner will be setting demanding operating and capital efficiency targets for the new authority ensuring the public receives a first class service. We are confident that the small saving identified will not prevent the necessary investment of &#163;2.2 billion (as identified in the <i>Water Quality and Standards: 2002 to 2006: Consultation</i> <i>Paper</i>) from being delivered over the period.</p>

  <p>Detailed spending plans for 2002-03 and 2003-04 will be subject, in due course, to the usual consultation and parliamentary approval procedures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to a policy of purchasing recycled paper for general use and will carry out a review of options for Scottish Executive publications this year. The Executive is inviting all associated departments, executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies to adopt a greening Government policy. These policies will encourage the use of recycled materials, including paper.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive monitors the usage of recycled materials through its existing stationery procurement and service contracts. The Executive does not record the use of recycled materials by other bodies other than where the materials are purchased through central contracts. The Executive is expecting all associated departments, executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies to adopt a greening Government policy. Monitoring and reporting arrangements will be considered in this context.</p>

  <p>The greening Government policy, which includes guidance on the use of recycled paper, was launched 18 November 1998. This policy was promoted to staff and placed on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s website. The Executive is currently finalising revised guidance which will be issued this summer. The Executive is also inviting all associated departments, executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies to adopt greening Government policies. These policies should encourage the use of recycled materials, including paper.</p>

  <p>The increasing deployment of renewable energy systems, notably wind turbines, does have implications for low-flying aircraft, and, as has always been the case, every proposal for a wind farm is considered by the Ministry of Defence, as a statutory planning consultee, on a case-by-case basis. We are in touch with the Ministry and other departments on the issue of low flying to clarify the issues involved. In the meantime, I would expect wind farm developers to engage in early dialogue with the MoD in order to resolve any potential problems.</p>

  <p>Through our Social Justice Strategy, we are already delivering a range of polices and programmes which will build strong and inclusive communities throughout Scotland, in both rural and urban settings. We have acknowledged that we need to improve our understanding of rural social exclusion in Scotland, and established the rural poverty and inclusion working group with a remit to investigate and recommend ways of achieving this, including ensuring that existing indicators are appropriately developed for, and measurable in rural areas, and to recommend ways of promoting social inclusion in rural areas. The group has now concluded its work and I look forward to receiving its report shortly.</p>
