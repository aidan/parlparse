  <p>: It is not possible to be definitive at this point about how the relocation of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland&rsquo;s Showground from Ingliston to Norton Mains will be paid for and whether there will be any cost to Scottish taxpayers. Studies are currently underway, project managed by Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian, to undertake detailed feasibility of proposals for the relocation. These studies are expected to provide a range of costs for the relocation and construction of the new Showground.</p>

  <p>Funding for the relocation will come from a number of sources which will include: BAA acquisition of that part of the existing Showground which they require for their expansion; BAA obligation to fund like for like relocation costs; potential development value of that part of the existing Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland&rsquo;s land holdings not required by BAA.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not routinely monitor the reasons for which people seek asylum. Officials in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office, who are responsible for handling asylum claims, have been issued with guidance on identifying and handling victims of human trafficking.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive currently supports a pilot project in Glasgow under the Violence Against Women Fund which aims to determine the need for support to trafficked women, as there is currently no specialist support service in Scotland. Funding for this project has been agreed for 2006-08.</p>

  <p>We have made good progress in implementing the measures in the March 2006 Agreement referred to by the member. The joint inspection of local services for the children of asylum seekers &ndash; to assess the quality of those services &ndash; took place in the autumn. We are close to agreement on lead professional arrangements with Glasgow City Council and the Home Office.</p>

  <p>Support and protection of asylum seeker children is already in line with the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. The act places duties on local authorities relative to the provision of services to safeguard and promote the welfare for all children in their area who are in need, except where disapplied by UK legislation. The measures being put in place through the March Agreement should ensure that the rights, needs and interests of children in asylum seeker families are given earlier and on-going consideration.</p>

  <p>NHS Forth Valley is part of the West of Scotland Cancer Network. This network brings together all of the professions and disciplines involved in the care of patients with particular cancer types, including breast cancer, to help ensure that the best possible quality of care is provided equitably across the region.</p>

  <p>Breast cancer services in Forth Valley are provided from a dedicated oncology unit specifically designed to provide combined outpatient assessment, chemotherapy and follow-up services locally. This is considered to be a significant improvement from the previous two site arrangements in terms of quality of patient care received. It provides a centralised focus for specialist care ensuring adequate volume and critical mass of patients whilst enhancing the skills of practitioners and maximising resources.</p>

  <p>The oncology unit will be located at the new hospital site in Larbert from 2009.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the Stern report and the Executive&rsquo;s stated commitment to tackling climate change, whether it will introduce a requirement for a climate change impact assessment to be undertaken in respect of major projects, such as the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and Aberdeen Airport extension, in order that planning decisions are informed by environmental considerations and current thinking on climate change.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-01-24.S2W-30918.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80085" speakername="Des McNulty" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0124.htm#5">

  <p>Where a major project falls to be determined under planning legislation, it is already a requirement that environmental considerations are taken into account. Planning applications must be determined in accordance with the relevant development plan &ndash; with environmental considerations factored into the preparation of that plan &ndash; unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Material considerations may include statements of Scottish Executive policy, such as that issued through the Scottish Planning Policies series which includes guidance on climate change.</p>

  <p>In addition, all new and replacement development plans are subject to Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) legislation, including requirements concerning the consideration of effects on climatic factors. Further, under the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006, the National Planning Framework and development plans will be subject to a duty to contribute to sustainable development.</p>

  <p>Under the Environmental Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1999 as amended, individual planning applications may also be subject to an environmental impact assessment on the likely significant environmental effects of that project, including climatic factors where appropriate.</p>

  <p>Trunk roads projects, such as the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, are already subject to comprehensive environmental impact assessments, including consideration of greenhouse gas emission predictions. New arrangements for major transport projects are currently under consideration in the Transport and Works (Scotland) Bill currently before parliament, which includes provision for the environmental impact assessment of proposed projects.</p>

  <p>In view of these measures we have no plans to introduce an additional climate change impact assessment for major projects. However, we are developing a &quot;carbon balance sheet&quot;, as part of future reviews of the National Transport Strategy, which will present the impact of all Scottish transport policies and projects that are expected to have a significant impact on carbon, whether positive or negative.</p>

  <p>Broad guidance is produced by the Scottish Executive Education Department and Learning and Teaching Scotland. Advice and guidance seeks to ensure that the curriculum secures breadth, balance, continuity and progression for all pupils. Responsibility for the management and delivery of the curriculum belongs to education authorities and head teachers, or in the case of independent schools, the boards of governors and head teachers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s 4th National Priority in Education is &quot;values and citizenship&quot;. Education for Citizenship is cross curricular and permeates through a number of curricular areas. In the <em>5-14 Environmental Studies National Guidelines</em>, with &quot;Social Subjects: Understanding People in Society&quot; the key features; &quot;social rules, rights and responsibilities&quot; and &quot;conflict and participation in decision-making in society&quot; are particularly relevant and primary schools have used these to introduce aspects of citizenship into their work.</p>

  <p>Many secondary schools (around 70%) offer Modern Studies courses in S1 and S2 which offer substantial opportunities for teaching about citizenship. In upper secondary, from S3-S6, all pupils undertake Personal and Social Education (PSE) courses and many of these contain the strands of citizenship identified in the report.</p>

  <p>Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) work with schools to deliver safety information to young people through fire service and police visits. Police officers are regular visitors to schools for other interventions, either delivering inputs on personal safety, road safety and in some cases drugs awareness. The CSPs along with the ASB teams also produce materials for use in schools focussing on personal safety and awareness, accident prevention and driving skills, amongst others.</p>

  <p>My predecessor, Malcolm Chisholm, met with representatives of the three main Scottish energy suppliers late last year to discuss rising prices and actions that they are taking to protect vulnerable customers. My officials are in regular dialogue with Scottish Gas and have been assured that vulnerable customers will be exempt from the &pound;5 fine introduced for late payment of bills.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking forward a wide range of activities which aim to encourage Scotland&rsquo;s people to lead a healthier lifestyle and I refer the Member to the First Minister&rsquo;s Health Improvement Annual Report <em>Delivering a Healthy Scotland: Meeting the Challenge</em> , published on 5 December 2006, for an overview of this work.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2O-11655 by Des McNulty on 11 January 2007 (Official Report c. 30992), why it does not believe that there was any breach of EC competition law in the Glasgow stock transfer in respect of the commercial properties referred to in European Parliament petition 0863/2005.</p>

  <p>In European Parliament petition 0863/2005, the complainant claims that Glasgow City Council should have put the sale of its commercial properties out to European Union-wide tendering. As far as the Scottish Executive is aware, the complaint does not allege any breach of competition law, but instead of European Community procurement law.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, EU procurement law does not require European-wide competitive tendering for the acquisition of existing buildings or the disposal of property. The acquisition of existing buildings and other structures is exempt from advertising under Regulation 6 of the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations, which give effect to EU procurement Directive 2004/18/EC.</p>

  <p>Trafficking for sexual exploitation was made a specific offence by section 22 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003. Trafficking for any purpose was made a specific offence by Section 4 of the Asylum &amp; Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004. To date, there have been no convictions recorded under either of these offences in Scotland.</p>

  <p>People involved in trafficking are likely to have committed a number of offences, both at statute and in common law, including kidnap, false imprisonment, deception and immigration offences.

  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) publish the population projections for Scotland. In addition to the principal projection, which uses assumptions considered to reflect current trends, GROS also publish a series of projections reflecting different scenarios which are available on the GROS website: <a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/library/popproj/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/library/popproj/index.html#2004-based</a> .</p>

  <p>The principal projection, including net inflow of 4,000 per year, envisages a broadly stable population over the next 25 years. A variant assuming a long-term net inflow of 12,500 persons a year would result in a population of today&rsquo;s size in 70 years but would result in a small population increase in the meantime.</p>

  <p>Parliament agreed to the remit of the Standards Commission for Scotland, as set out in the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000. That remit did not include the operation of, or the investigation of members of, prison visiting committees. However, the Scottish Executive has asked Professor Lorne Crerar to carry out an independent review of the regulation, inspection audit and complaints handling of public services in Scotland. It is likely that the Standards Commission and prison visiting committees will be considered within that independent review. Any consideration of changing existing remits would have to take account of the review&rsquo;s findings.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Gross expenditure includes the full cost of running local authority owned care homes and the full fees paid to private and voluntary care homes for local authority funded clients. It also includes free personal and nursing care payments for self funders.</p>

  <p>2. Local authorities receive income in the form of (i) client contributions toward care home fees and (ii) transfers from health boards. These are subtracted from the gross figure to produce the net figure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has a central contract for the supply of recruitment advertising services. To ensure good value for money the contract was let by competitive tender and the procurement process followed the general principles of European Union Procurement Directives following a restricted procedure.</p>

  <p>The value and performance of the contract are monitored at regular review meetings using monthly management information reports which show detailed information on the cost of recruitment advertising and the savings made under the contract. The contractor is currently working to increase the scope of the management information that they provide to enable even better analysis of spend &ndash; for example to provide information on the quality of candidates applying through each advertising source.</p>

  <p>The contractor is continually delivering ways of getting better value from spend on recruitment. Further value is added through regular recruitment market updates, seminars to the business on new ideas, ad hoc projects, and through sharing good ideas and best practice.</p>

  <p>The performance indicators that you refer to are the drivers and measures contained within the Partnership Agreement and ministerial commitments. These have been distilled down through the Executive Departments and are underpinned by Building a Better Scotland and Spending Review targets which departments all contribute to. Most of this activity is reflected within departmental business plans which are published.</p>

  <p>Details of a <em>Building a Better Scotland</em> (which includes the <em>Spending Review 2004</em> targets) and the technical notes that accompany the targets can be found on the Executive&rsquo;s websites:</p>

  <p>A final progress report on targets that were set in September 2002 as part of the <em>2002 Spending Review</em> were published September 2006: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/09/06102312/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/09/06102312/0</a>.</p>

  <p>The end of term report on the Partnership Agreement and ministerial commitments was published on the internet on 29 December 2006 under <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland &ndash; Delivering Our Commitments</em>.

  <p>The Executive reviews and disposes of its records in accordance with the Public Records Acts of 1958 and 1967. Although these acts have no legal force in Scotland, they have been applied by the Executive in reviewing and disposing of its records by agreement with the UK Cabinet Office, in the absence of modern Scottish public records legislation. Records are recommended for destruction in accordance with retention and disposal schedules and only when reviewing staff are satisfied that they contain no papers that are likely to be of continuing public interest. No Scottish Executive record is actually destroyed without the agreement of the National Archives of Scotland, whose staff work alongside Executive reviewing staff to ensure that proper procedures are followed.</p>

  <p>The key requirement on the Executive and its agencies is public records legislation. Scottish Executive Agencies are therefore expected to manage their records in accordance with the Public Records Acts of 1958 and 1967. Although these acts have no legal force in Scotland, they have been applied by the Executive and its Agencies in reviewing and disposing of records by agreement with the UK Cabinet Office, in the absence of modern Scottish public records legislation. Guidance on records retention and disposal issued under the authority of this body of legislation takes into account the requirements of the very large number of pieces of legislation governing the retention and destruction of all kinds of information.</p>

  <p>The only legal sanction which might be applicable in this context is section 65 of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, under which it is an offence to alter records (including destruction) to prevent disclosure.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans at present to introduce any new initiatives to enhance capacity building, self-sufficiency and social inclusion in Stirling. We already have in place a range of national programmes to tackle such issues, such as the Community Voices Programme, the National Standards for Community Engagement and the Community Regeneration Fund, which Stirling is already benefiting from. These are in addition to any local initiatives being undertaken by local agencies, which will be best placed to respond to local needs. In addition, Raploch Urban Regeneration Company is already delivering a comprehensive programme of community support and engagement to secure employment and training opportunities for local people as part of the regeneration of the area.</p>
