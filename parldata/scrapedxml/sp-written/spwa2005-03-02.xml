  <p>The Scottish Executive provides ring fenced funding through Section 27 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to local authorities for the delivery of services to offenders. The following amounts have been allocated by authorities on specific programmes for drug misusing offenders. This funding covers programmes for those offenders subject to a condition of drug treatment as part of a probation order, the introduction of Drug Treatment and Testing Orders and the piloting of drug courts in Glasgow and Fife. It also includes the contributory funding provided by the Executive for the piloting of arrest referral schemes in six areas.</p>

  <p>As part of the over-arching review of the curriculum 3-18, a cycle of continuous updating and reform of all areas of learning, including geography, has begun.

  <p>It is the responsibility of the individual education authorities and head teachers to make decisions on how best to promote the teaching of music. The Scottish Executive does, however, provide advice on the provision of music tuition in the classroom, primarily in the form of curriculum guidelines.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council has been charged by the First Minister with administering &pound;17.5 million over three years from 2003&ndash;06 to assist education authorities in ensuring that every primary school pupil has the opportunity to have at least one year&rsquo;s free music tuition before they reach primary 6.</p>

  <p>On 2 March 2005 the Inspectorate produced is report <em>A Climate for Learning</em>, in which it comments on the standards of behaviour in schools observed and reported from school and authority inspections up to March 2004.

  <p>The table reports the level of manufacturing employment in Scotland in 1979 and for the spring quarter in 1997, 1999 and 2004.</p>

  <p>The manufacturing employment estimate for 1979 is not directly comparable with the estimates for 1997, 1999 and 2004 due to changes in the definition of manufacturing. The 1979 classification of manufacturing activity was broader and included activities which would now be classified in other industry groups. For example, in 1979 individuals working in vehicle repairs were categorised in the manufacturing sector whereas in 1997 they would fall into the service sector.</p>

  <p>The spring quarter runs from March to May in each year. These figures are estimated from the Labour Force Survey which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p>

  <p>Environmental offences cover a wide range of statutory offences including, but not limited to, the Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Environment Act 1995, and can be reported to the Procurator Fiscal by a number of different reporting agencies.

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that those entering higher education achieve their potential and graduate from their chosen course. The number of people who enter higher education will fluctuate from year-to-year and whilst there has been a reduction in the number of graduates under 25 from Scottish higher education institutions over the past four years Scotland still achieves a higher rate of participation in higher education than any other part of the UK.</p>

  <p>For the reasons explained in the answer to question S2W-14267, answered on 2 March 2005, the decline in the overall number of graduates is partly explained by the different method of collecting data on the numbers acquiring a sub-degree.

  <p>The improvement in data collection mentioned in the answer to question S2W-13677, answered on 1 February 2005, refers to the outcomes for continuing students who study at further education colleges. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>Students on a two year course that results in an intermediate qualification after one year (such as HNC) were previously counted at the intermediate stage and again at the end of the course (such as HND). From 2001-02 these students are only included when they obtain their final qualification at their institution. An explanation of the change was published in the Statistics Publication Notice, Higher Education Graduates and Diplomates in Scotland: 2001-02, issued 20 November 2003.</p>

  <p>The effect of the change was to reduce from 2001-02 the number of people counted as achieving higher education qualifications from further education colleges, both in West Dunbartonshire and Scotland as a whole. Data on the number of graduates at higher education institutions are not affected.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory register of disabled people.</p>

  <p>The Labour Force Survey (2004 Autumn Quarter) estimates that there were 648,000 working age people in Scotland, or 21 per cent of the working age population, estimated to have a disability. Labour Force Survey estimates are entirely based on self-reporting of disability and all respondents answer on their own behalf.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive asks staff to self declare whether they have a disability and this information is recorded. As at January 2005, 3.2 per cent of all permanent staff In the Scottish Executive, including its Agencies and Associated Departments, had self-declared their disability. To improve the accuracy of our data we are currently resurveying our staff with regards to their ethnicity and disabled status.</p>

  <p>The answer to question S1W-18842 on 1 November 2001, refers to the research into the feasibility of combining existing datasets such as the Scottish Household Survey and the Family Resources Survey to provide a base of Scottish information on income. Following the conclusion of this research, it was determined that this was not a robust solution to produce small area income estimates.</p>

  <p>All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>Following the Income Statistics Seminar, held by the Scottish Executive for users in September 2003, it was concluded that resources would be better targeted elsewhere, for example at obtaining small area data on benefits and tax credits from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue. The work on obtaining small area benefits data is being taken forward through the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics project.</p>

<p>The Scottish Prison Service aims to provide a healthy nutritious diet for all prisoners within the resources available.

  <p>The information sought is not available. The SPS have produced Return to Custody Research Bulletins based on a two-year follow up of offenders released from prison in particular years.

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>No data is kept on the cost of imprisoning persons in default of a fine payment as opposed to imprisoning other persons. </p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The average annual cost per prisoner place is published in the SPS Annual Report and Accounts. Copies of this publication for each of the last five years are available on the Scottish Prison Service website <a href="http://www.sps.gov.uk/keydocs" target="_blank">http://www.sps.gov.uk/keydocs</a>.</p>

  <p>Information is available on the number of incidents reported to the police of violence or antisocial behaviour against local authority staff. It is for head teachers to judge when an incident in their school should be reported to the police. However, any member of school staff has the same right as any other member of the public to report a crime to the police.</p>

  <p>There is no information on how many of the incidents reported in the following table resulted in criminal charges. Incidents reported could have included theft or damage and any other form of crime. No further breakdown of categories is available. The perpetrators may have been pupils, parents or another member of the public. The crimes concern staff in many different education authority roles and not all incidents were committed inside school premises.</p>

  <p>In January 2004 I tasked a review group, headed by Professor Pamela Munn and Mr Jim Martin, formerly of the EIS, to consider the most effective way to gather information on indiscipline in schools. I made the advice of the group public in October 2004, in the Executive&rsquo;s policy update on <em>Better Behaviour in Scottish Schools</em> .</p>

  <p>I am committed to ensuring that there is accurate information on the extent of incidents of indiscipline in schools, by a regular national survey of teachers and pupils. I also stated that local authorities must have in place robust arrangements for monitoring incidents of indiscipline. Local authorities use a range of management information systems to record data in schools.</p>

  <p>In addition local authorities, as employers, are responsible for meeting the statutory requirements for reporting incidents affecting health and safety at work.</p>

  <p>A review is underway looking at unescorted leave of absence for restricted patients from the state hospital. The review will consider the current decision-making process in respect of unescorted leave from the State Hospital including:</p>

<p>the arrangements for making such decisions under the mental health legislation, including the roles and responsibilities of ministers, officials, the psychiatric adviser and professional advisers;<br />

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s annual teacher workforce planning exercise takes account of the numbers leaving teaching on the following grounds, domestic reasons, maternity, teaching post outwith Scotland, health grounds, early retirement, age retirement and other or not known. However, we have not carried out any research into the factors affecting teachers&rsquo; decisions to leave the profession.</p>

  <p>In 2002, the Executive commissioned the Scottish Council for Research in Education to review the literature of research on teacher stress over the previous ten years.</p>

  <p>The review, entitled <em>Feeling the Strain</em> identified fourteen Scottish references. A copy has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Inevitably, there will have been other studies into teacher stress carried out elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently providing financial support to Teacher Support Scotland to develop, with three local authorities, a pilot project aimed at developing a strategy to improve the well being of teachers in Scotland. Local authorities, as teachers&rsquo; employers, have responsibilities in these areas. Being aware of the local circumstance in which their teachers work, local authorities are best placed to identify and provide the support required.</p>

  <p>The majority of offences, particularly, those reported by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary to the Procurator Fiscal, relate to failures to provide personal information to police officers at ports in contravention of section 53 of the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

  <p>Information is not available from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service database before 2002. It is also not possible to tell from the database whether common law charges such as assault are terrorism related and this answer is therefore restricted to statutory offences under The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, now repealed by The Terrorism Act 2000 which replaced it when it came into force on 19 February 2001, and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to tell from the available data whether an individual who was convicted of one of the statutory offences was connected to a terrorist organisation &ndash; many of the offences (e.g. refusing to provide personal details when required to do so) can be committed by an accused who has no known or provable connection to a terrorist organisation.</p>
