  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) issued a Variation Notice to the current operators of the plant, requiring them to demonstrate that statutory environmental controls were in place, when ownership of the plant was transferred earlier this year. These controls have been the subject of rigorous risk assessment and are in place to safeguard public health. Following an investigation into complaints from local residents on 9 October, SEPA placed prohibition and enforcement notices on the plant. The prohibition notice withdrew SEPA&#8217;s authorisation for the incinerator until further notice. The enforcement notice requires the operator to take remedial action at the plant. SEPA is currently awaiting receipt of the company&#8217;s improvement plan and will not authorise operations to restart until they are satisfied that all the necessary improvements have been met.</p>

  <p>In addition to the actions set out in the Biodiversity Species Action Plan for capercaillie, the Scottish Executive, Scottish Natural Heritage, Forestry Commission, Caledonian Partnership, RSPB and others have developed a bid for funding from the EU LIFE Nature programme directed at enhancing capercaillie populations within and adjacent to capercaillie Special Protection Areas (SPAs). It is also likely that there will be a large scale demonstration project targeted at undesignated sites.</p>

  <p>I also announced in September the provision of &#163;700,000 for the removal and marking of deer fences in Scotland through a scheme being administered by the Forestry Commission. An additional two capercaillie SPAs have also been submitted to the European Commission for classification.</p>

  <p>Additionally, a Scottish Statutory Instrument is currently before the Scottish Parliament which will include the capercaillie on Schedule 1, Part 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. This will provide capercaillie with greater protection by making it illegal to hunt the species, and will make offences punishable by increased penalties.</p>

  <p>The decline of the capercaillie population, to around 1,000 individual birds, is undoubtedly serious. If the decline continues the future of the species in Scotland would be seriously threatened. It is widely recognised that the decline is related to climatic changes, and in particular to a series of cold wet springs. There are other contributory causes and the measures described in the answer to question S1W-18767 are designed to address some of these.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has received representations from the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) recommending that additional steps must be taken to protect the capercaillie population and, if so, what response it will make to the proposal by the SGA that SNH should fund hillpacks on a twice annual basis in areas where capercaillie are resident.</p>

  <p>I understand that SNH has received a letter from the SGA seeking grant aid for foot-packs on a twice-yearly basis in areas where capercaillie are resident. SNH is taking action to enhance the capercaillie population through the Biodiversity Species Action Plan Steering Group, and by the development of the EU LIFE Nature project and large scale management trial. These include appropriate predator control in capercaillie areas, initially focused on Special Protection Areas, along with important management measures such as fence removal and habitat management. SNH has no plans to fund foot-packs specifically for the purpose of predator control in capercaillie areas, though use of dogs in fox control has not been ruled out in areas where this method is considered appropriate.</p>

  <p>We are allocating record levels of resources to local authorities for social care, with &#163;1.25 billion provided this year. It is for authorities to use these resources to best meet local needs, including the provision of respite care or short breaks. In recognition of the importance of short break services we have made significant new funding available to local authorities from April this year to expand their current level of respite provision by an additional 22,000 weeks each year across Scotland by 2003-04. These resources will increase from &#163;5 million in 2001-02 to &#163;11 million by 2003-04. This is in addition to the &#163;10 million a year already ear-marked under the <i>Strategy for Carers in Scotland</i> for supporting for carers and providing short breaks, doubling the resources previously available to authorities for these purposes.</p>

  <p>The primary difference between Udal and Feudal land law is that Udal land is held outright by the owner and is not subject to any superior interest, including the Crown. This difference will be removed by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 which provides for the abolition of superior interests in Feudal land on the appointed day. Land will then be owned outright.</p>

  <p>Another distinguishing feature, is that under Udal law the foreshore in Orkney and Shetland is treated in the same way as land above the high water mark across the rest of Scotland. Consequently, it is possible for Udal titles to land to include the foreshore as property.</p>

  <p>Another distinctive feature of Udal land is that, unlike Feudal land, ownership may be transferred without the requirement of a written title. This difference will disappear once the Land Register becomes operational in Orkney and Shetland from 1 April 2003 as the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 provides that an acquirer of Udal land will only obtain a real right to the land on registration.</p>

  <p>The payment of skat, which is considered to be a form of land tax, is an incident of Udal land law. It has not been competent to create new skats since 1974 and both skat and feuduty will be extinguished on the appointed day.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory requirement for planning authorities to conduct housing land audits. <i>Planning Advice Note 38 Structure Plans: Housing Land Requirements</i> , however, <i> </i> sets out the Scottish Executive&#8217;s advice in relation to auditing the effective housing land supply and refers to such audits as an annual process.

  <p>The general law of Scotland applies to land across Scotland. In areas where Udal tenure subsists, Udal land may differ from land held on feudal tenure, and it is therefore consistent with the law of Scotland for adjacent pieces of land in these areas to be held under different systems of land tenure.</p>

  <p>Projects aimed at supporting the carers, families and partners of people with mental health problems are primarily provided through local authorities and NHSScotland, often working with the voluntary sector. A wide range of such projects is currently running across Scotland, supported under a number of different initiatives. The <i>Strategy for Carers in Scotland </i> doubled, from April 2000, the resources available to local authorities to support carers, including carers of people with mental health difficulties. From April this year local authorities are also receiving significant new funding to expand short break services, which will benefit many people and their carers. Local authorities use these resources to meet local needs, including those of carers of people with mental health difficulties. Mental Illness Specific Grant also funds many projects which help people with mental health difficulties, their families and carers. In addition, through the Scottish Health Plan <i>Our National Health </i> and projects such as <i> Allies in Change</i> , <i> </i> we are promoting the involvement of mental health service users and their carers in service planning and delivery.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">how the Water Industry (Scotland) Bill will have a positive impact on water charges for island communities in the North of Scotland Water area, as stated in the Bill&#8217;s Policy Memorandum, and what it estimates this impact will be.</a></p>

  <p>The main element of the Water Industry (Scotland) Bill is the creation of Scottish Water as a single all-Scotland water and sewerage authority, with the key objective of providing services to customers across Scotland more efficiently than can be done by the existing three water authorities separately. Customers in the island communities currently served by North of Scotland Water (NSW) will benefit from this in the same way as other customers. In addition, and in common with other NSW customers, future increases in water charges will be lower than would have been the case as a result of the charge harmonisation across Scotland that will follow the creation of Scottish Water.</p>
