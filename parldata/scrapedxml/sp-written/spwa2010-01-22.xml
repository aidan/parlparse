  <p>Regulations made to manage allotments in terms of section 6(1) of the Allotments (Scotland) Act 1892 should be formally confirmed by Scottish Ministers. Regulations, made under this provision have no legal effect without ministerial confirmation. It would be for the local authority to resolve any management issues that arose.</p>

  <p>Through Skills Development Scotland, all young people aged 16 to 19 across all sectors, including tourism, who wish to undertake a modern apprenticeship are eligible for full public funding.</p>

  <p>In addition, funding for those aged 20+ has been made available in 2009-10 for the hospitality, professional cookery and management framework. As an example, the hospitality and tourism sector identified projected demand for skills for chefs and managers, as a result 200 all-age apprenticeships in professional cookery and double the number of apprenticeships in hospitality supervision have been made available in 2009-10. Please see in the following table information on funding rates for modern apprenticeships (MA) in tourism or related MAs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) applications, (b) householders assessed for eligibility and (c) acceptances there have been for Stage Four measures of the Energy Assistance Package in each month, broken down by local authority area.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-01-22.S3W-30247.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0122.htm#3">

  <p>Callers to the Energy Assistance Package helpline do not make an application for Stage Four measures as such. Their local energy advisor takes them through an assessment of their potential eligibility for Stages Three and Four, while also offering energy saving advice at Stage One and opportunities to maximise their income and reduce their energy costs at Stage Two.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify the number of applications for Stage Four measures, because the application made is to the Energy Assistance Package, rather than to a particular Stage. However, a breakdown of enquiries to the EAP is given in the first table, at (a).Those households that the energy advisor considers potentially eligible for Stage Four are referred to the managing agent for a survey. The survey comprises both an eligibility check of the household and an energy performance assessment of the dwelling. A relatively small number of households are excluded without a survey being undertaken because the managing agent cannot contact them, or they withdraw. The first table shows the households referred to Stage Four and those who cancelled with a survey being undertaken, at (b) and (c).The second table shows the households where the survey is not yet complete and where the eligibility survey has been completed, at (d) and (e). The number of households where the survey is incomplete are slightly higher than usual, due to the holidays which followed closely on the coming into effect on 21 December 2009 of the amended regulations which extended eligibility to dwellings with Band E energy performance. The third table shows the status of the households that have been surveyed, with those accepted for Stage Four measures, those that are not eligible, and those who cancelled after the survey, at (f), (g), and (h).The analyses are provided for the year to date, broken down by local authority area. This information is not normally analysed by local authority area and considerable additional analysis would be required to provide monthly figures going back to April. Therefore, the figures provided are for the year total, from April to end of December. The figures exclude the 5,500 households who had applied under the Central Heating Programme who did not undergo the same eligibility survey.</p>

  <p>Within the Scottish Government, posts are created and removed regularly to reflect changing business needs. It is therefore not possible to provide detailed information about the titles and grades of posts which have been created since May 2007.</p>

  <p>It is possible to identify the net change in overall number of posts. The annual publication, <em>Civil Service Statistics</em>, published by the Office for National Statistics, provides information on the number of employees on a head count and full-time equivalent basis, by responsibility level, for government departments or for Scotland. Published figures from 2007 onwards are available at the following link. <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=2899" target="_blank">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=2899</a>.Work is ongoing to simplify the public sector landscape. The number of public bodies has already been reduced from 199 to 162 and we are on target to achieve the government&rsquo;s target to reduce the number of public bodies by 25% by April 2011.</p>

  <p>The Translating, Interpreting and Communication Support Group, set up by the Scottish Government to improve the standard of translation and interpreting services, identified monitoring quality and standards of the interpretation service as a key priority. One way of facilitating this could be through the use of the existing UK wide national register or a register specific to Scotland.</p>

  <p>The national register of public service interpreters operational in England and Wales also operates in Scotland. However, it is our understanding that it is not widely used. The Scottish Government would be supportive of steps to improve monitoring of quality and data, through the use of a register if service providers felt that was the most effective way of doing so.</p>

  <p>The level of support provided to community councils, including any financial support, is at the discretion of each individual local authority.</p>

  <p>However, in partnership with COSLA and the Association of Scottish Community Councils (ASCC), we are continuing to raise the profile and effectiveness of community councils throughout Scotland to enable them to build their capacity and to allow them to engage as key participants in local decision making and delivery.This includes promoting the adoption of the Model Scheme of Establishment of Community Councils and Code of Conduct for Community Councillors, documents developed by a Scottish Government Community Council Working Group (CCWG). Adoption of these documents is key to the building of capacity as they will help establish a greater consistency of operational arrangements and a culture of accountability.The Scottish Government is also funding a series of Community Council Pilot Projects.

  <p>The Scottish Government values the important role that community councils can play in ensuring that the views of the community it represents are reflected in local decision making.</p>

  <p>The general statutory purpose of community councils is to &quot;ascertain, co-ordinate and express to local authorities for its area, and to public authorities, the views of the community which it represents, in relation to matters for which those authorities are responsible, and to take such action in the interests of that community as appears to it to be expedient and practicable&quot;. In that respect they can bring an important local dimension to the development and delivery of services by local public bodies.A Scottish Government Community Council Working Group (CCWG) was invited to identify expanded roles and responsibilities for community councils. They found that many, in discussion and agreement with their local authority, already undertook a variety of roles and responsibilities, for example &ndash; arranging minor repairs of certain local authority amenities, control of common good funds and Community Hall management/maintenance. However, in order for this to be more widespread, it was recognised that the capacity of community councils would require strengthening.In partnership with COSLA and the Association of Scottish Community Councils (ASCC), therefore, we are continuing to raise the profile and effectiveness of community councils throughout Scotland to enable them to build their capacity and to allow them to engage as key participants in local decision making and delivery.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are making steady progress, albeit from a low starting point, in relation to the provision of insulin pumps and the structured education associated with them. We have asked NHS boards to provide details of their planned investment for the next three to five years in this area of provision, and are awaiting responses from several of them.</p>

  <p>We expect the revised Diabetes Action Plan to include a number of measures designed to guide NHS boards in planning this investment. The issue will also be dealt with in the resource impact assessment which the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network intends to publish to accompany its revised clinical guideline on the management of diabetes.From March 2010, the annual Diabetes Survey will contain an update on insulin pump provision across NHSScotland to allow boards&rsquo; progress to be monitored.</p>

  <p>(a) schools</p>

  <p>The co-operative model is consistent with the experiences and outcomes for learners and resources have been provided to support teachers.</p>

  <p>These include <em>Enterprise with Ethics: Social Enterprise in the Curriculum</em> which was prepared by the Co-operative Education Trust Scotland and is available on the Learning and Teaching Scotland website.</p>

  <p>Links are also provided to other organisations and resources such as the Young Co-operatives, an o<span lang="">rganisation helping secondary school students and other young people to establish and run their own cooperative businesses selling fairly traded products. <a href="http://www.youngco-operatives.coop" target="_blank">http://www.youngco-operatives.coop/</a>.</span></p>

  <p>(b) further education, (c) higher education</p>

  <p>Scottish Government supports the general concept of co-operative models in colleges where they align with key policies such as Curriculum for Excellence. However, because colleges and universities are autonomous bodies with responsibility for the courses they offer, it would not be appropriate for Scottish Ministers to stipulate the specific nature of business education courses.</p>

  <p>Arrangements for the appointment of a new Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service are currently underway. In September last year, the post was trawled internally within the Scottish Prison Service and across other government departments which covered staff working within the UK Prison Services. Whilst the Cabinet Secretary for Justice has acknowledged the strong field of candidates who applied it was decided to open up the competition to external candidates to ensure that candidates outwith the civil service also have the opportunity to apply for this important and strategic role within the justice sector. The post was advertised on 15 January 2010 in the Press and on-line. The closing date for applications is 5 February 2010. The new process is being chaired by a Civil Service Commissioner.</p>

  <p>Willie Pretswell, Director of Finance and Business Services at the Scottish Prison Service, will act as Interim Chief Executive for the period until the recruitment process is complete and a new Chief Executive is appointed.</p>
