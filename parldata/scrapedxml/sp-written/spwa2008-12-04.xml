  <p>Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish ministers have an agency agreement with the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD), who act on our behalf on certain pesticide matters. PSD have a formal structure of working groups in which they consult and involve relevant organisations on matters of current interest, and we receive formal views through that avenue. In addition, the Scottish Government has had direct informal contacts with NFU Scotland about the on-going review of Directive 91/414/EEC and the potential implications for Scotland.</p>

  <p>No amendments to Directive 91/414/EEC have yet been formally adopted. Negotiations are continuing at a European level, and we are taking active steps to influence the negotiations, for example by working with Scottish MEPs and by promoting Scotland&rsquo;s interests in discussions to agree the UK&rsquo;s negotiating position. One aspect which we are highlighting is the potential reduction in the availability of plant protection products.</p>

  <p>We have held no such discussions with Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL). As satellite based technologies develop, HIAL will evaluate the costs and benefits of these in relation to the provision of navigational aids at its airports.</p>

  <p>We understand that a study undertaken by Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd has shown that less than 2% of scheduled flights through Wick are cancelled or diverted and that an Instrument Landing System (ILS) would benefit only 50% of those flights.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Where main offence.</p>

  <p>2. Incorporates an approximate mapping of sheriff courts into local authority areas. Some sheriff courts will deal with cases from more than one local authority area. There are four local authority areas which do not contain a sheriff court, namely East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Midlothian and North Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>3. Includes a small number where court is unknown.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings.

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority Accreditation Unit is responsible for promoting SVQs generally to encourage their uptake. A number of colleges in Scotland offer SVQs in aquaculture, including by distance learning, thus increasing access to accredited vocational training.</p>

  <p>Lantra, the Sector Skills Council which covers the aquaculture sector, receives additional funding of approximately &pound;400,000 per annum from the Scottish Government to take forward work in Scotland, including on aquaculture. Lantra has already developed an aquaculture industry action plan which addresses the issue of recruitment and workforce-ready recruits. Lantra also works with schools to promote aquaculture as an industry and to encourage young people to enter the industry.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation document <em>A Fresh Start, a Renewed Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture</em> highlighted the importance to the aquaculture industry of attracting, retaining and developing people for a long term career in aquaculture and ensuring appropriately trained and skilled industry employees. The new framework will be delivered in conjunction with industry, which has the primary responsibility for training their staff.</p>

  <p>Vocational training for the aquaculture industry is provided directly by employers and also by a number of colleges in Scotland delivering SVQ levels II and III in aquaculture, including online and by distance learning, a Scottish Progression Award and the modern apprenticeship scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has supported the development of best practice in aquaculture training through funding for Lantra, the Sector Skills Council for this sector, which has recognised employer-based training excellence through its annual National Training Award, as does the annual Crown Estate Commission Scottish Marine Aquaculture Award for Training and Education.</p>

  <p>In December 2000, <em>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</em> announced that by 2005, the maximum wait from urgent referral to treatment for all cancers will be two months. Quarterly performance information showing progress against the 62-day urgent referral to treatment target, broken down by NHS board and cancer type is published from October 2004 on the Scottish Government website <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/waiting-times" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/waiting-times</a> .</p>

  <p>The number of patients reported within data submissions has increased (coverage) over time and guidance has been revised to reflect issues with definitions and guidance highlighted by NHS boards. This makes direct comparisons in quarterly performance difficult.</p>

  <p>Prior to 2003 cancer waiting times statistics included only breast cancer; in April 2003 colorectal cancers were added; July 2003 ovarian cancer; July 2004 lung cancers; January 2005 melanoma; April 2005 lymphoma cancer, and in July 2005 head and neck, upper GI, and urology cancers.

  <p>The Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 empowers the Crofters Commission to appoint suitable persons resident in the crofting counties as assessors to assist in the local exercise of its functions. The appointment process and functions of the assessors were agreed between the commission and the Scottish Crofting Foundation and the commission considers the process to be operating effectively.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has welcomed recent steps to reinvigorate the assessors network but believes that further reform is required to make the governance arrangements for crofting more transparent, democratic and accountable. We expect to consult on draft legislation during 2009.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 places duties on education authorities to ensure that the additional support needs of all children and young people are addressed and that they have access to the same range of learning opportunities as other pupils. Education authorities are required to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils and to tailor provision to meet their individual needs.</p>

  <p>It is for education authorities to ensure that they have in place a range of suitably qualified staff with the appropriate knowledge, skills and understanding to undertake the teaching required of them and fully support the needs of all pupils with additional support needs.</p>

  <p>Through the continuing professional development (CPD) framework, the Scottish Government fully expects all teachers to be able to recognise and know how to support pupils with additional support needs. Teachers should know where to go for specialist advice and support with regard to the educational provision for pupils to ensure that the appropriate assessments, interventions and strategies can be put in place. A national CPD team is also in place to support a network of local authority CPD co-ordinators to help share best practice. The team has particular expertise in additional support needs.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are supporting the Scottish Teacher Education Committee (STEC) Action Plan &ndash; <em>Framework for Inclusion, </em>a two year action plan to take forward inclusive education in initial teacher education and continuous professional development.</p>

  <p>We will also soon publish <em>The Autism Toolbox</em>, an autism resource for Scottish local authorities and schools. This will draw on a range of practice experience, literature and research to support education authorities and school staff develop innovative and individualised approaches to teaching pupils with autism.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has taken a number of steps to ensure that accessible curriculum material is available for those with additional support needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is responsible for determining the entitlement of all individuals to national qualifications. SQA provides a range of advice to enable centres, pupils and their families to gain an understanding of the alternative or accessible formats that can be made available to those taking National Qualifications examinations. These alternative formats include the provision of question papers in Braille, large print and digital media. Centres, pupils and their families can obtain information about alternative formats available through SQA's website or by telephoning their customer contact centre.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government funds the CALL Centre (Communication Aids for Language and Learning), University of Edinburgh, which provides specialist advice, expertise and training in technology for those working with children who have speech, communication and/or writing difficulties in schools across Scotland. CALL were funded to organise a national symposium in Edinburgh in March 2008 where key stakeholders considered how digital versions of curriculum resources can be created and accessed by pupils with additional support needs.</p>

  <p>CALL are currently working with Learning and Teaching Scotland to produce an on line database of adapted curriculum materials. This is an output of work with the Copyright Licensing Agency to extend the schools copyright licence so that it covers not only pupils with visual impairments but those who are registered disabled. CALL has also been funded to produce a resource that enables pupils to listen to digital curriculum materials spoken out in a Scottish voice. The voice can be downloaded free of charge from the CALL website. It has also been recently agreed to fund CALL to develop an accessibility guide for textual resources and they have also been working to create and develop examination papers in accessible digital formats with SQA.</p>

  <p>In partnership with Learning and Teaching Scotland, we have made available to all schools a web-based catalogue of adapted curriculum materials.</p>

  <p>In its report, the Fuel Poverty Forum noted that there was a concern that some people with acute or pre-existing health conditions that may be affected by cold or damp housing would not be included in the eligible groups benefiting from Stage 4 of the Energy Assistance Package, but that further work was needed to define who these are. In the light of this, the Scottish Government does not intend to include a separate category for this group in the Energy Assistance Package initially, but we will ask the forum to monitor and review the package and its impact. However, we have extended support through the new package to include help for low income families with a child aged under 5 or a disabled child under 16. This will mean that from April 2009, for the first time, these households can receive help beyond basic insulation measures through stage 4 of the Energy Assistance Package.</p>

  <p>The reforms to Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise are allowing them to focus on making an improved contribution to sustainable economic development both regionally and nationally. Scottish Enterprise is working closely with significant and high growth potential companies in Glasgow while the Business Gateway continues to provide support to those businesses serving predominantly local markets. Delivery of this latter role is now the responsibility of Glasgow City Council, as is the lead on local regeneration. Any associated impact of these changes on the Glasgow economy, should be positive.</p>

  <p>There is already a longstanding arrangement in place (the E112 scheme) that allows citizens of European Economic Area (EEA) countries to travel throughout the EEA for planned treatment, subject to prior approval by the home member state, although indications suggest that Scots much prefer to access quality NHS services at home.</p>

  <p>The draft directive on the application of patients&rsquo; rights in cross-border health care, published on 2 July 2008, aims to codify the application of European Court of Justice case law, which has established that patients have a right (under Article 49 of the EU Treaty) to seek health care in another member state, subject to certain conditions, and to receive reimbursement for that treatment from the NHS. Codification of the case law will clarify how the rules will work in practice and will allow member states to establish a patient mobility framework.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government carried out a public consultation exercise on the proposals, which concluded on 3 December. The consultation document, which includes the draft directive, is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/10/15082114/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/10/15082114/0</a>.</p>

  <p>The responses to the consultation will be shared with the UK Government to inform Health Council negotiations. The negotiations are in their infancy and will take some time to complete.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to the principle that while Scottish patients should have the choice to travel abroad for health care, NHS Scotland should retain the ability to decide the health care it will fund. Equally, anyone travelling from another member state to receive NHS health care in Scotland will have to pay the full cost of the treatment in advance. Once a set of proposals is agreed and adopted by Europe, the Scottish Government will have 12 months to transpose the terms of the directive into domestic legislation.</p>

We are therefore supportive of any initiative that will have a positive impact on reducing levels of violence and disorder. We are looking at the impact of schemes such as Unight and will continue to identify ways to share all examples of practice with other partners. I personally heard about Unight when I visited one of the clubs involved in setting-up Unight during the Cocaine Awareness launch last week.

  <p>The Scottish Government receives advice from the Special Committee on Seals on estimates of the common seal population and also holds information on the number of seals killed under licences issued for control of seals under the Conservation of Seals Act. The Scottish Government has been seeking to improve the quality of information on the number of seals killed in Scotland and recently initiated a data collection exercise in collaboration with key partners of the Scottish Seals Forum.</p>

  <p>Any decision to give medication for mental disorder covertly to a patient who is unable to consent must be made taking account of the principles of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and where appropriate the 2003 act.

  <p>The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 does not address the issue of covert medication.

  <p>Between 2006-07 and 2007-08 there were increases in the number of emergency in-patient admissions of 3.4 per cent in Fife, 5.7 per cent in Dunfermline and West Fife and 6 per cent in Kirkcaldy and Levenmouth. There was a 1.4 per cent reduction in Glenrothes and North East Fife.</p>

  <p>An eight per cent increase was seen in people aged 20 to 64 across Fife and for people aged 65 plus there was a 2.5 per cent increase. In the 0 to 19 age group there was a 6.7 per cent reduction.</p>

  <p>In Fife in the last year, the main increase in the number of emergency in-patient admissions has been in the general medicine speciality.</p>

  <p>Increases in emergency admissions are not new and NHS boards take account of this in planning their services. An admission to hospital may be the best response for the patient.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has introduced a target to reduce the number of long-term condition admissions by 2010-11. To support this the Chief Medical Officer is developing a delivery plan that will draw together the many strands of work that impact on long term conditions. The Scottish Government will be discussing NHS boards&rsquo; delivery plans through the 2009-10 Local Delivery Planning process.</p>

  <p>The decision by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer to increase employers&rsquo; national insurance contributions by half a percentage point from 2011-12 will impact on the public sector in Scotland by increasing employment costs.</p>

  <p>We are unable at this stage to provide detailed estimates of the total impact across the public sector in Scotland. The increase in costs will depend on a number of factors including the level of the secondary income threshold in 2011-12 (currently &pound;105 per week) above which NI contributions become payable; the weekly earnings of employees; and the relative number of employees &quot;contracted in or out&quot; from the second state pension.</p>

  <p>What is clear is that the cost of delivering public services will rise and that additional income will accrue to the Treasury.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland&rsquo;s promotion of Scotland and its areas, and the process by which marketing funds are allocated, is based on market research which identifies what potential visitors want from a trip to Scotland. This allows VisitScotland to focus marketing spend in order to generate the maximum economic value for Scotland, both locally and nationally. Accordingly, spend is not allocated on an area or local authority basis but spread across a wide variety of promotional activities, many of which will cover South Lanarkshire and its attractions.</p>

  <p>Examples of these activities include the Be Inspired Campaign 2008; Go for it!; Real Scotland &ndash; Local&rsquo;s Guide; Winter White, and the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Valley Accommodation Guide and Visitor Guide. In addition New Lanark World Heritage Site, Chatelherault Country Park and Scotkart featured in VisitScotland&rsquo;s Citybreaks campaign.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland works closely with South Lanarkshire Council, which provides funding directly to VisitScotland in order to deliver specified marketing for the benefit of the area, as well as the provision of information and inspiration via the area&rsquo;s Visitor Information Centres. These activities are agreed through direct discussion between the local authority and VisitScotland, and form part of their annual partnership agreement which contributes to the promotion of the area to visitors. The council provided &pound;97,000 under this partnership agreement in 2007-08, and the final amount to be provided in 2008-09 is still under discussion.</p>

  <p>In answer to questions S3W-17978, S3W-17979, S3W-17980, and S3W-17981 and as set out in SPCB(2008) Paper 61, one member of staff has been assigned to the Commission on Scottish Devolution. Other resources provided to the Commission have included research and the provision of background documents undertaken by SPICe staff, support to meetings of the commission by the Events and Exhibitions Team, the Security Office and Broadcasting Office and substantially verbatim reports of the public commission meetings by the Official Report.</p>

  <p>All costs, which now amount to an estimated &pound;65,000 have been absorbed within existing office budgets and expenditure continues to be kept under review.</p>

  <p>We cannot anticipate any future calls on resources until the commission has decided on its next steps.</p>
