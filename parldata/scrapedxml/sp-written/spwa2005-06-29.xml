  <p>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 30 May 2005 together with Margaret Beckett.</p>

  <p>On agriculture, the Council agreed a technical regulation on the financing of CAP measures for the 2007-2013 period. The UK welcomed its provisions for treatment of member states outside the Euro and for implementing budget discipline, as agreed in the 2003 reforms. The Council adopted, at the same time, conclusions noting that this regulation could, if necessary, be re-examined in the light of other Council decisions including those on the next Financial Perspective.</p>

  <p>The Council discussed a Commission communication on the possibility of new instruments which might be funded under the Rural Development Regulation to assist the management of risks or crisis situations in the farming industry. The UK joined several member states who called for further reflection about any such approach, noting that any such measures would need to be consistent with WTO rules.</p>

  <p>The Council agreed a two year extension of the potato starch regime which will be reviewed in the light of experience with the implementation of the 2003 CAP reforms.</p>

  <p>Under any other business, Sweden urged the Commission to ban imports of cat and dog fur into the community. The UK joined a number of member states in stressing their abhorrence at the inhumane exploitation of animals and called on the Commission to explore the options available for taking action.</p>

  <p>France and Germany tabled a memorandum urging the community to take further action to promote bio-fuels. The UK supported their initiative. On GMOs, Italy registered concern about the reliance placed by the European Food Standards Agency on data from companies seeking authorisations of a GMO. France reported its continuing surveillance of sheep and goats to ensure that BSE is not present in either population. Ireland drew attention to a weakening of dairy market prices but the Commission made clear that it would not propose any new measures aimed at raising producer prices.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Presidency and Commission held a series of individual discussions with member states on the proposal for revision of the Rural Development Regulation in preparation for discussion at the June Council.</p>

  <p>No fisheries items were on the agenda.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of the situation at Inveresk&rsquo;s Carrongrove paper mill in Denny and, through Scottish Enterprise Forth Valley, have already been in touch with the company. Our main concern is for those facing redundancy and as part of the Executive's Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) framework there are plans to hold regular meetings with both the management and unions.</p>

  <p>Local partners will offer any workers facing redundancy advice, support and guidance on a full range of retraining and employment opportunities available.</p>

  <p>SEERAD and the other three fisheries administrations are partners in the joint UK Quota Management Change Programme.</p>

  <p>The use of the term individual transferable quotas (ITQ) can be confusing as there is no single model for how so-called ITQ systems operate. We want to improve quota management. No decisions have yet been taken on the specific changes needed. That will only happen after in-depth consideration of the options in consultation with stakeholders.</p>

  <p>All stakeholders will have the opportunity to input into the Change Programme, and fisheries administrations are currently planning a number of mechanisms to achieve this. A Consultative Group is planned, which will comprise 14 stakeholder representatives &ndash; 12 of whom are drawn from the catching sector, including six Scottish representatives. This group will not be the only method of consulting stakeholders. It is anticipated that working groups will be established to discuss specific issues as the Change Programme progresses.</p>

  <p>The bill allows the Secretary of State to make provision in future for information from the national identity register to be disclosed to public authorities, including possibly public authorities in Scotland. It is for the Secretary of State to determine the circumstances in which he will disclose information from the reserved register. The Scottish Parliament could not legislate so as to require or prevent him from disclosing information from the register.</p>

  <p>However, the use to which any disclosed information could be put would depend on the existing powers and duties of the bodies concerned. In devolved areas, an Act of the Scottish Parliament could make provision for the way in which information received from the register is to be used for purposes connected with devolved policy areas.</p>

  <p>Scottish public bodies will only be able to receive information from the register when the Secretary of State exercises his powers &ndash; set out in the bill &ndash; to disclose information. Disclosure of information from the register is reserved.</p>

  <p>If Scottish public bodies receive information from the register, the use to which they put that information will be subject to their existing powers and duties, including their responsibilities under the Data Protection Act. Such usage could be modified by an Act of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The information is not available as yet, however, progress is being made as follows.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency Scotland (FSAS) will be publishing a report this autumn reviewing the progress made by 2003 towards the Scottish Diet Action Plan targets. Due to the nature of survey methodology this will be the most up-to-date data available.</p>

  <p>Regular monitoring will be put in place beyond this to provide data on on-going progress towards the targets.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify the exact proportion of Scottish Community Diet Project (SCDP) funding exclusively used to support breakfast clubs.</p>

  <p>Many SCDP supported projects include breakfast club provision as one element of a wide range of activities aimed at strengthening local initiatives through the provision of local services, communication, practice development and capacity building.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive funding for the Scottish Community Diet Project (SCDP) is subject to formal conditions agreed to by the SCDP and in accordance with the work outlined in their Business Plan. The latest business plan covers the period 2005&ndash;08.</p>

  <p>The SCDP operates under the auspices of the Scottish Consumer Council (SCC) and is therefore monitored in line with SCC (and National Consumer Council) procedures. The project provides quarterly written reports and an annual verbal report to the SCC. These reports are also scrutinised at the quarterly meetings of the project's steering group.</p>

  <p>Annual audited accounts are also presented by SCC to the Scottish Executive Health Department every year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Consolidated Resource Accounts for the Year to 31 March 2004 are publicly available and can be found by accessing:</p>

  <p>In the Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department&rsquo;s (ETLLD) section of these accounts, the Department&rsquo;s total budgeted amount for the year to 31 March 2004 was &pound;3,334.5 million, with &pound;3,244 million representing total spend. Therefore 97.29% of ETLLD&rsquo;s total budget was actually spent.</p>

  <p>Table 1, shows the percentage of the department&rsquo;s budget that was spent on (i) grants to Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd, (ii) other transport programmes, (iii) European Structural Funds &ndash; central and (iv) European Structural Funds &ndash; support to local authorities. Given that not all of the budget was spent, the table also reports the percentage of the actual total spend represented by each of the aforementioned.</p>
