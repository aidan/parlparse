  <p>The consequentials on the full NHS (health) settlement in England are allocated to the Scottish Government on a total budget basis with no specific policies ring-fenced. The Scottish Government will give due consideration to the Department of Health cancer drugs fund consultation findings once they are published.</p>

  <p>Scotland has robust, equitable and transparent arrangements for the introduction of newly licensed clinically and cost-effective medicines to treat all conditions. These arrangements include opportunities at national level to consider additional factors to facilitate, in certain circumstances, a flexible appraisal of clinical and cost-effective evidence. They also include opportunities at local level for clinically led consideration of medicines for individual patients in certain circumstances.</p>

  <p>Since August 2010, I have met with School Leaders Scotland (SLS) on 6 October, the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) on 1 November and the Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS) on 24 November.

  <p>At present, the Scottish Government has no plans to offer local authorities the facility to provide further additional in-service days. We expect that local authorities will work with their schools and teachers to make best use of the five standard in-service days, and other time available for professional development, to address priorities for improvement in the context of Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>However, we have acted swiftly in the past on the advice of the Curriculum for Excellence management board on such matters. The management board is using a range of evidence from partners to monitor and advise on implementation matters, including support. We will carefully consider any such advice that is forthcoming in future.</p>

  <p>As such it asks for the same information as the question you refer to and asked previously (S3W-36574); and I refer you to my answer at that time &ndash; reproduced below for your convenience.</p>

  <p>Assessment of the approximate carbon emissions and energy consumption of non-domestic buildings is undertaken using the National Calculation Methodology (NCM) which ensures that such assessments comply with European Directive 2002/91/EC Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD).</p>

  <p>Under regulation 10, Scottish ministers are required to keep at least one register of energy performance certificates. This has been achieved through the registration of energy performance certificates on the Home Energy Efficiency Database.

  <p>Estimates of the tax revenue which could have been raised in Scotland, and the associated level of public sector expenditure, under alternative fiscal frameworks would depend upon a number of factors, including the policy decisions at that time.</p>

  <p>Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) demonstrates that, under the current fiscal framework, Scotland ran a cumulative current budget surplus, including a geographical share of North Sea revenue, worth &pound;3.5 billion over the four years to 2008-09. Over the same period, the UK ran a cumulative current budget deficit worth &pound;72.3 billion. This demonstrates that Scotland stands on a firm financial footing. With full fiscal responsibility, Scotland could build upon this, promote growth and create opportunities for all.</p>

  <p>Under independence, the Scottish Government would have an opportunity to establish a regulatory regime that ensured sufficient safeguards were in place to address the weaknesses of the regulatory regime established by the previous UK Government. As highlighted in the National Conversation discussion paper <em>Fiscal Autonomy in Scotland: The Case for Change and Options for Reform</em> , under full fiscal responsibility within the UK, certain elements of economic policy could remain reserved &ndash; including financial regulation &ndash; with the exact division of responsibility dependent on the specific framework put in place.</p>

  <p>Independence would also allow the Scottish Government to put forward an enhanced and better targeted stimulus package which met the priorities of the Scottish economy. For example, the temporary VAT cut implemented by the previous UK Government in 2009 was estimated to have supported 5,500 direct jobs in Scotland. If Scotland&rsquo;s share of that cut had been used to increase capital expenditure, it is estimated that approximately 10,000 jobs would have been supported.</p>

  <p>The fiscal frameworks in the Basque Country, Canada and the USA demonstrate the additional economic levers and opportunities that more ambitious levels of fiscal responsibility can provide. For example, the Basque Country has used its responsibility for the tax system to introduce a lower corporation tax rate than the rest of Spain. As of September 2010 the Basque Country also had a stronger credit rating than the Federal Spanish Government.</p>

  <p>In the USA and Canada, devolving responsibility for natural resource taxation, has allowed States and Provinces to tailor the tax system to maximise long term production rates, and invest a proportion of the resulting tax revenue in an &lsquo;oil fund&rsquo;, to provide a permanent benefit for future generations, such as those in Alberta and Alaska. State and Provincial governments in the USA and Canada also have the opportunity to borrow to manage the pace and priority of investment in infrastructure and to manage volatilities in tax revenues.</p>

  <p>All of these examples offer useful experience of how fiscal responsibility would benefit Scotland.</p>

  <p>The most effective way to reduce public sector borrowing is to promote sustainable economic growth. Faster economic growth will boost tax revenues, protect jobs and make addressing the legacy of debt left by the previous UK Government that much easier. However, the current UK Government&rsquo;s proposals to cut public spending too far and too fast risks undermining the recovery and threatens the very efforts to restore the long-term sustainability of the UK fiscal position.</p>

  <p>Greater fiscal responsibility would allow the Scottish Government to manage the pace and priorities of fiscal consolidation to ensure that vital public services are protected and that the economic recovery is not damaged. Fiscal responsibility would also give the Scottish Government maximum opportunities to use the full spectrum of key economic policy levers to promote sustainable economic growth over the long term.</p>

The final Departmental Expenditure Limit underspends for 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 were &pound;42 million, &pound;21 million, and &pound;47 million respectively.</p>

  <p>The figure of around &pound;426 million represents the additional revenue funding allocated to local government as a result of the Scottish Government and COSLA&rsquo;s Leadership agreeing to maintain local government&rsquo;s share of the overall Scottish Budget at 2010-11 levels in return for the specific commitments set out in the joint agreement.</p>

  <p>Had local government received the same average reduction in funding as the other areas of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s portfolio budgets which did not receive the same degree of protection then their reduction in revenue funding would have been reduced by 6.4 per cent whereas under the joint agreement it is only 2.6 per cent, which is worth around &pound;426 million.</p>

  <p>improve prevention and management of chronic pain for people in Scotland;</p>

  <p>improve services at all levels;</p>

  <p>minimise the burden of pain on individuals and the community, and</p>

  <p>promote the aims of other institutions involved in supporting pain management practice, education, research and specialty recognition, including supporting improved self management programmes.</p>

  <p>The model is integrated with the pathway for referral into services currently being taken forward through the musculo-skeletal programme of the Adult Framework for Rehabilitation.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally, as NHSScotland does not generally quantify the funding attributable to any specific long-term condition. We have however been providing funding of just over &pound;60,000 a year to fund the post of Scottish Government Lead Clinician on Chronic Pain. We also provided NHS Quality Improvement Scotland with funding of &pound;24,000 in financial year 2009-10, to help with the administrative support it provides for the lead clinician and the Chronic Pain Steering Group.</p>

  <p>We provided pump-priming funding of &pound;50,000 a year for two years to help with the establishment of a chronic pain managed clinical network (MCN) in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. It is now supported very effectively by the board. Our intention remains that the network should act as a demonstrator to other NHS boards of the benefits of an MCN approach to chronic pain services.</p>

  <p>We awarded the Pain Association Scotland a three year core grant from April 2010 of &pound;35,000 a year under the section 16B scheme of grants. In 2008-09, the association also received a one-off grant of &pound;60,000 over two years to support the role out of its chronic pain self management programme. We also provided Fibromyalgia Friends Scotland with section 16B funding to assist with the costs associated with running support groups across Scotland, in the form of a core grant totalling &pound;9,000 over three years from 2007-10, and a one-off project grant, totalling &pound;2,513.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to encourage industry best practice on predator control through the implementation of <em>A Fresh Start &ndash; the Renewed Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture</em> and its associated Working Groups. One of these, the Improved Containment Working Group, has seen the finfish industry sign up to the development of a statutory engineering standard for Scottish fish-farms. The contractor for that work has just been appointed, with the standard to be developed over the next year.</p>

  <p>The Containment Group is also rolling out a programme of skills development and improved training of operators and site staff to reduce fish farm escapes, including through predation. This includes awareness raising seminars, best practice workshops, on-site training and development of nationally recognised containment and predator control qualifications. The group has also identified specific actions to share Scottish and international best practice on predator control and training of site staff in appropriate use of Acoustic Deterrent Devices.</p>

  <p>Most modern fish farms now have an independently audited Environmental Management System, accredited to ISO 14001. Many include a predator control plan specific to its location, taking account of likely predators, tidal conditions and stringent animal welfare requirements.</p>

  <p>As regards lower stocking densities on fish farms, that is an explicit objective of the RSPCA&rsquo;s Freedom Food Standard which aims at a stocking density of 15kg per cubic metre. All of the Scottish Salmon Producers&rsquo; Organisation (SSPO) member companies are now involved in this initiative, either working towards or having already achieved accreditation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also works closely with the industry on a range of initiatives to encourage best practice on predator control.</p>

  <p>The industry will shortly publish an updated <em>Code of Good Practice for Scottish Aquaculture</em>. This will incorporate an updated predator control code of practice outlining specific measures to deter seals from approaching pens, such as nets that are sufficiently weighted to tension side panels, and use of acoustic seal scaring devices.</p>

  <p>The SSPO is sponsoring the development of new acoustic seal scarers with the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) and is actively involved with other independent seals experts and wildlife interests in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Scottish Seals Forum.</p>

  <p>Finally, a Salmon, Aquaculture and Seals Working Group has recently been established with the aim of establishing non-lethal methods of seal deterrence. The group is chaired by Dr Simon Northridge of SMRU and its membership includes representatives from Marine Harvest, Sainsbury&rsquo;s, the Seal Protection Action Group, International Animal Rescue, RSPCA and SMRU.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-30201 on 25 January 2010. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a> .</p>

  <p>In addition, a Scottish Government sponsored research project has reviewed existing deterrents and developed a cetacean-friendly seal scarer using novel artificial sounds. This research showed, through captive experiments, that seals can be deterred by many sounds but that this effect can gradually disappear over time. The new acoustic deterrent involves a &lsquo;startle stimulus&rsquo; which appears to continue to work over time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently funding a project to test this new species-specific acoustic deterrent in the field at fish farms which is due to report during late 2011.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Aquaculture Research Forum (SARF) has funded a project to determine the extent to which Acoustic Deterrent Devices (ADDs) used at Scottish salmon farms affect harbour porpoise distribution, and how effective ADDs are at deterring seals from causing damage to nets and to farmed stock. The interactions between seals and salmon farms were also examined through direct observations of seal activity around two sites and by examining trends in numbers of seals in relation to their distance from farm sites throughout Scotland. A report on this project will be published in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to work with its partners to refine these technologies and develop new approaches.</p>

  <p>The term fishery is not defined in the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. The Oxford English Dictionary definition covers both a place where fish are caught - &quot;a place or district where fish are caught; fishing-ground&quot;, and the business of catching fish - &quot;business, occupation, or industry of catching fish, or of taking other products of the sea or rivers from the water&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Coastal Forum (SCF) was set up by ministerial invitation in 1996 with a remit to:</p>

  <p>Encourage a voluntary, sustainable and holistic approach to the management of Scotland&rsquo;s coasts through the formation of local coastal fora;</p>

  <p>Act as the national focus for coastal issues and co-ordinate the dissemination of advice on best practice;</p>

  <p>Reflect views and aspirations of local fora for the coast of Scotland and guide a national policy framework within which local initiatives can operate, and</p>

  <p>Advise Government in the development of coastal policies for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Following the passing of the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, it was agreed that the Scottish Coastal Forum would have a particular role in supporting the setting up of Marine Planning Partnerships during the transition to the new post-marine act regime.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Coastal Forum is more operational and more coastal in focus. Membership details for both the Scottish Coastal Forum and the Marine Strategy Forum are on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website. There are a number of organisations which are members of one only and there is also some overlap in terms of organisations represented on both. Where there is overlap in representation for an organisation, membership is intended to be at the operational level for the Scottish Coastal Forum and at a more strategic level for the Marine Strategy Forum.</p>

  <p>The Quick Reference Clinical Guide associated with the Scottish Good Practice Statement on myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME-CFS) contains an algorithm showing the generic care pathway for people with ME-CFS. This helps make general practitioners aware of the more specialist services to which they might refer their patients.</p>

  <p>The needs assessment of ME-CFS published in September by the Scottish Public Health Network (SPHN) recommends a three-tier model of care for Scotland, covering services in the community, services within primary care and specialist services or expertise. We are currently considering this and the other recommendations in the SPHN report.</p>

  <p>Implementation of the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) clinical standards for neurological health services will also assist NHS boards in the process of improving their services for all neurological conditions, including ME-CFS. We are providing funding to encourage the development of a neurological managed clinical network (MCN) in each NHS board as the main vehicle for taking forward this work.</p>

  <p>Planning legislation requires planning authorities to make decisions in line with the development plan for the area unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Where the outcome of public engagement is submitted as a representation to the planning authority on an application it may constitute such a material consideration. While material considerations are likely to include views of statutory and other consultees and those of the public, the weight to be attached to each material consideration is for the decision maker to decide.</p>

  <p>Circular 4/2009: Development Management Procedures contains further guidance on what may constitute a material consideration and is available on the Scottish Government website at:<br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/planning/publications/circulars" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/planning/publications/circulars</a>.</p>

  <p>Yes. The UK Policing and Crime Act 2009 made provision to ensure that football banning orders (FBOs) issued in England and Wales apply in Scotland. This part of the Act came into force on 1 April 2010. In a recent case in Edinburgh, a person was convicted for breaching an FBO issued in England in 2007 for attending a match in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Provisions in the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006 ensured that FBOs issued in Scotland apply in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>The scale of the total reduction in the Scottish Government budget for 2011-12 has required tough decisions to be taken about expenditure across government and careful consideration of pressures and priorities in all portfolios. Taking into account these pressures, we have considered all areas of expenditure, the scope for efficiencies and the contribution that spending programmes make to sustainable economic growth and the delivery of portfolio priorities. In order to reduce the level of spending across the Finance and Sustainable Growth portfolio, we have taken the following difficult decisions on Transport:</p>

  <p>With a few notable exceptions such as the Forth Replacement Crossing, on capital spend we will prioritise existing projects over new. Expenditure on road improvements has been reduced. In 2010-11, the level three budget line for road improvements included preparation for major projects and this has been moved to capital works.</p>

  <p>The spending to be reduced in this budget line includes deferring some of the work to further expand the Traffic Scotland infrastructure and the small trunk road improvement schemes which have completed their statutory process will be held in readiness to be taken forward at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

  <p>As was made clear in the parliamentary debate on the Scottish Variable Rate (SVR) on Wednesday 24 November, the Scottish Government has been in dialogue with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) since 2007 about the work required to re-establish the capability of HMRC&rsquo;s systems to operate the SVR following the mothballing of the SVR from 2000, and about the costs and timescales associated with that work.</p>

  <p>After providing, in 2007, initial cost estimates ranging from &pound;1.2 million to &pound;3.4 million, HMRC on 28 July 2010 sought a payment of &pound;7 million from the Scottish Government in order for the work to be undertaken. HMRC indicated that if agreement to pay was reached by 21 August, work would go ahead to enable the Scottish Parliament returned in May 2011 to exercise the SVR powers in the Scotland Act 1998 with effect from the tax year beginning 5 April 2012. This timescale could be achieved provided that the decision to vary the tax rate was made and communicated to HMRC by the end of May 2011.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to HMRC drew attention to a number of legitimate concerns, including questions about value for money given the UK Government&rsquo;s planned introduction of new income tax provisions set out in the report of the Calman Commission which would lead to the replacement of the SVR, and sought a meeting at which these concerns could be examined. Despite a reminder, no meeting was arranged. Since the Parliament debated this important issue on 24 November, HMRC and Scottish Government officials have met and further work is now in hand on costs and timescales associated with returning the SVR systems to an operable condition.</p>

  <p>A Service Level Agreement (SLA) was in place between the then Scottish Executive and its predecessor organisations from 2000 to 2003, and from 2003 to 2007, when the agreement expired. Under the SLA that expired in 2007, an annual payment of &pound;50,000 was made to HMRC in return for maintaining the database of Scottish taxpayers. The existence of an up to date list of Scottish taxpayers was a necessary but not a sufficient condition for operating the SVR. Operable IT systems were also required. The work required to return the IT systems to a fully operable condition was much more significant and many times more expensive than the annual cost of the SLA.</p>

  <p>On 24 November I apologised for not informing or consulting Parliament about the unavailability of the SVR systems either in 2007, when the condition of the SVR systems first became known, or this summer, when it emerged that only by spending a substantial amount of public money could the capacity of the SVR systems be restored in time for use in 2012-13.</p>

  <p>The scale of the total reduction in the Scottish Government budget for 2011-12 has required tough decisions to be taken about expenditure across government and careful consideration of pressures and priorities in all portfolios. Taking into account these pressures, we have considered all areas of expenditure, the scope for efficiencies and the contribution that spending programmes make to sustainable economic growth and the delivery of portfolio priorities. In order to reduce the level of spending across the Finance and Sustainable Growth portfolio, we have taken the following difficult decisions on transport:</p>

  <p>With a few notable exceptions such as the Forth Replacement Crossing, on capital spend we will prioritise existing projects over new. Expenditure on maintenance of the motorway and trunks roads network, including Network Strengthening and Improvement has been reduced.</p>

  <p>The Capital Maintenance budget available for trunk roads is the combined total for Network Strengthening and Improvement, which has been reduced, and structural repairs which has been increased. The total available funding has therefore been reduced from &pound;71 million to &pound;45 million. We will manage the decrease in funding by re-prioritising the structural maintenance programme and focus on maintaining the safety and condition of our trunk roads allowing essential road repair works to be carried out.</p>

  <p>The UK Government has reduced Scotland&rsquo;s budget by &pound;1.3 billion in 2011-12 - cuts of around &pound;500 million to our resource budget and &pound;800 million to our capital budget. As a result, we have had to take tough decisions, including a reduction in the Support for the Freight Industry budget. This has led to the closure of the Freight Facilities Grant scheme to applications for projects which will incur expenditure after 31 March 2011.</p>

  <p>Like other areas of public spending, these services are subject to cuts because of the reduced funding from the Westminster Government. No final decision has been made yet on the funding to the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) for the delivery of veterinary surveillance in Scotland. Several scenarios involving cuts to this and other public good advisory activities delivered by SAC and other organisations are being explored, and their potential impacts will be assessed jointly. A final proposal will be made taking into consideration our priorities and other factors, including the potentially unfortunate timing of changes to veterinary surveillance ahead of this report.</p>
