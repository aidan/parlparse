  <p>The Reshaping Care for Older People programme has highlighted that the way care services for older people are currently provided, at times, acts against our agreed policy objective of optimising the independence and wellbeing of older people, for as long as possible, in their own homes or another homely setting.</p>

  <p><em>Scotland&rsquo;s Spending Plans and the Draft Scottish Budget 2011-12</em>, published on 17 November 2010, set out our plans for a Change Fund for older people&rsquo;s services. This fund will provide bridging funding to enable local health and social care partnerships to introduce innovation and improvements throughout older people&rsquo;s services, across health and social care.</p>

  <p>The change fund will encourage a greater degree of integrated commissioning and will act as a catalyst for significant changes in service planning and provision including a much more innovative use of care home capacity, such as the care hub model as set out in Scottish Care&rsquo;s manifesto for the future of care.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 requires the Care Commission to inspect care homes a minimum <em> </em> of twice a year, with at least one of those inspections being unannounced. Information about announced and unannounced inspections is an operational matter for the Care Commission and the member can contact the Chief Executive, Mrs Jacquie Roberts OBE at:</p>

  <p>The Care Commission<br /> Compass House<br /> 11 Riverside Drive<br /> Dundee<br /> DD1 4NY<br /> Tel: 01382 207 100</p>

  <p>From 1 April 2011 the regulatory functions of the Care Commission, apart from those relating to independent healthcare, will be transferred to Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland (SCSWIS), which was established by the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. All inspections carried out by SCSWIS in 2011-12 will be proportionate and based on consideration of the risks to service quality and vulnerable people. SCSWIS&rsquo;s inspection plans will be shaped by the budget to be agreed by the Parliament early in 2011.</p>

  <p>Under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the Act) Scottish Ministers are responsible for setting the maximum regulatory fees which may be charged per year by the Care Commission. It is for the commission to fix fee levels within these maxima, having regard to its reasonable expenses in carrying out its functions under the Act.</p>

  <p>The current maximum fee for care home services, as set out in the Regulation of Care (Fees) (Scotland) Order 2005, is &pound;165 per place. In 2010-11 the Commission has set fees at that amount. For care homes of the sizes indicated the fees are:</p>

  <p>(a) for 20 places, &pound;3,300;</p>

  <p>(b) for 30 places, &pound;4,950;</p>

  <p>Considerable progress has been made in recent years to raise standards of care, in particular through <em>Making good care better: National practice statements for general palliative care in adult care homes in Scotland</em> which was published by the Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care and the then Scottish Executive in May 2006. The Care Commission paid particular attention to this aspect of care in its inspection activities during year 2007-2008 together with the National Care Standards for care homes for older people. These set out the standards of care that service users should expect from care homes.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission&rsquo;s subsequent report, <em>Better Care Every Step of the Way</em>,<em> </em>highlights both the good practice achieved and what has still to be done to achieve a uniformly high standard of palliative and end of life care in care homes throughout Scotland.

  <p>Independent and voluntary sector care homes, able to provide nursing care, can be used for the non-specialist assessment, intervention and care of older people. Some NHS board areas currently commission care homes places for this purpose in the absence of community hospitals, with the direct involvement of GPs in the homes. However, the direct referral from an emergency situation, or accident and emergency attendance, to a care home may be more difficult to achieve.</p>

  <p>Work has also recently started on the development of an intermediate care framework which aims to provide guidance on the local development of intermediate care, and ensure consistency of service delivery across Scotland. The care home sector will play an important part in the development of this policy.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether independent and voluntary sector care homes for older people could be used for continuing care and rehabilitation of older patients rather than hospital places.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-11-22.S3W-37411.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1122.htm#2">

  <p>Independent and voluntary sector care homes are currently being used for the continuing care and rehabilitation of older people. The Scottish Government is keen to continue to shift the focus of care from a hospital setting to one where care is planned, delivered and evaluated close to people&rsquo;s homes, when this is the most appropriate option.</p>

  <p>The <em>Better Health Better Care Action Plan</em> (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/12/11103453/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/12/11103453/0</a>) and the Shifting the Balance of Care agenda both encourage this change in the focus and setting of care.</p>

  <p>The <em>Delivery Framework for Adult Rehabilitation in Scotland</em> (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/NHS-Scotland/adultrehabilitation/rehabframework" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/NHS-Scotland/adultrehabilitation/rehabframework</a>) also recognises that services should be provided locally, with a strong community focus. Rehabilitation teams are already working within a diverse range of settings, including care homes, people&rsquo;s homes, sheltered housing, community centres and leisure services accommodation.</p>

  <p>Data on the number of people receiving NHS continuing healthcare, and the settings it is provided in, has been collected since September 2008. The most recent data from March 2010 was published in June 2010. This census identified that 448 patients were receiving NHS continuing healthcare in a care home setting.</p>

  <p>Full details from the fourth balance of care/continuing care census can be found on the NHS Information Services Division website at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and COSLA issued joint guidance on National Eligibility Criteria for Social Care Services for Older People and Waiting Times for Personal and Nursing Care on 28 September 2009. The guidance is intended to help achieve better outcomes for older people. It delivers a standard eligibility framework for older people which is applied by all local authorities.</p>

  <p>It also delivers a commitment to provide personal and nursing care services to older people within a maximum period of six weeks following the identification of need, where an individual is identified as being at critical or substantial risk as regards their independent living or wellbeing. Where an individual&rsquo;s needs have been assessed as being less than at critical or substantial risk the local authority should have arrangements in place to meet, manage or review that individual's needs.</p>

  <p>The target of a maximum period of six weeks is also in line with the local authority and NHS partnerships&rsquo; standard of having no patients delayed in hospital for longer than six weeks.</p>

  <p>The delayed discharge target is monitored and published on a quarterly basis, and the most recent report can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/6209.html" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/6209.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Data collection is under development with local authorities on a quarterly return on the target waiting time for service delivery for free personal and nursing care, and will be published in due course.</p>

  <p>Evidence from the Reshaping Care programme, and from elsewhere in the UK and wider afield, demonstrates that better outcomes for people, including older people, coupled with better use of resources and a better experience of care, can all flow when services are planned and delivered in an effectively integrated way between GPs, hospitals and community based health and social care teams.</p>

  <p>The role of GPs in accessing an appropriate range of referral options is significant in achieving better outcomes for individuals. That is why the Scottish Government is working with partners in NHS Scotland and local government to improve their understanding and use of resources across all of older people&rsquo;s services.</p>

  <p>The question compares two metrics which are not in fact comparable.</p>

  <p>The EU target relates to a reduction of &quot;20% of annual consumption of primary energy by 2020 (compared to the energy consumption forecasts for 2020)&quot;. Those 2020 forecasts are actually based upon an estimated increase on the 2005 baseline, i.e. the absolute reduction in the EU target is significantly lower than 20%. The target is voluntary and not legally binding.</p>

  <p>Primary energy consumption is defined as the consumption of energy used in the same form as in its naturally occurring state, for example crude oil, coal, natural gas, e.g. before it is converted into electricity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government target relates to an absolute 12% reduction in annual total final energy consumption when compared with the 2005-07 baseline with annual decreasing maximum limits set down in statute.</p>

  <p>Both metrics are equally valid with the difference between the two being that the process of converting primary energy into final energy in itself leads to the consumption of energy.</p>

  <p>The Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Scotland sets the framework for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s comprehensive approach to energy efficiency and microgeneration. The plan covers the areas of behaviour change; household, business and public sector energy efficiency; infrastructure; transport; skills; and international engagement.</p>

  <p>In this situation, final energy consumption is a more appropriate metric.</p>

  <p>The Energy Efficiency Action Plan emphasises the importance of energy efficiency measures and behavioural change in delivering the energy consumption and ultimately emission reduction targets.</p>

  <p>The energy efficiency target was set and will be reported against using the sub-national final energy consumption data published annually by the Department of Energy and Climate Change.</p>

  <p>There is a limited historic time series available for this regional data with the energy consumption statistics for Scotland only available from 2005-07. The lack of a historic time series means that any robust business as usual projection would largely be based upon the average over this period. In essence, the methodology adopted is equivalent to assuming reductions against a business as usual scenario.</p>

  <p>The Climate Change Delivery Plan published in 2009 suggests that emissions from transport should reduce by 27% by 2020 if the overall target of a 42% emissions reduction over this period is to be met. It highlights the need for complete decarbonisation of road transport through the widespread uptake of low carbon vehicles, and for significant decarbonisation of rail transport, by 2050.</p>

  <p>A programme of transport emission reduction measures is being considered by ministers for inclusion in the statutory report on Proposals and Policies for meeting Scotland&rsquo;s ambitious climate change targets. This report is being prepared in the context of the development of the draft Scottish budget. It is intended that these documents be published in November 2010.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, <em>Conserve and Save</em>, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Energy Efficiency Action Plan, published in October 2010 sets out a number of key actions required to reduce transport energy consumption by (a) reducing the need to travel (b) widening travel choices to include more sustainable transport options and (c) efficiencies in driving and in the transport network.</p>

  <p>An action plan to deliver the widespread uptake of low carbon vehicles envisaged in the Climate Change Delivery Plan will be published later this year. For 2010-11, Transport Scotland has committed &pound;4.3 million to support Community Planning Partnership procurement of low carbon vehicles, and for the provision of supportive infrastructure. Bus operators are also benefiting from the Scottish Green Bus Fund, which is providing &pound;4.4 million in the current financial year to assist the purchase of low carbon buses. In addition, Transport Scotland and a range of public and private sector partners have submitted a joint bid under the UK Government funded Plugged-in Places electric vehicle infrastructure scheme. If successful, this proposal will see a critical mass of infrastructure placed throughout central and southern Scotland by 2013.</p>

  <p>The Cycling Action Plan for Scotland published earlier this year sets the framework for a tenfold increase by 2020 in the number of journeys that are made by bicycle. Total funding in support of cycling in Scotland in 2010-11 is &pound;17.3 million. The &pound;15 million Smarter Choices Smarter Places joint programme with COSLA supports sustainable travel demonstration projects in seven communities across Scotland i.e. Kirkwall, Dundee, Larbert and Stenhousemuir, Kirkintilloch and Lenzie, Glasgow East End, Barrhead and Dumfries.</p>

  <p>We are also working to reduce emissions from the movement of goods. The latest report of the Freight Best Practice Scotland programme suggests savings of 33,173 tonnes of CO2 emissions and nearly &pound;14 million for operators in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 created a statutory framework for greenhouse gas emissions reductions in Scotland by setting an interim 42% reduction target for 2020 and an 80% reduction target for 2050.</p>

  <p>The draft report on Proposals and Policies published on 17 November 2010 (laying number SG/2010/251) sets out our proposals and policies for meeting the targets to 2022, and thus making the transition to a low carbon economy. A copy has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52063). A final report will be published following a 60-day period for parliamentary consideration, as required by the Climate Change Act.</p>

  <p>The transport measures identified in the draft report fall into three broad categories:</p>

  <p>reducing the need to travel;</p>

  <p>widening travel choices to encourage lower carbon options; and</p>

  <p>encouraging more energy efficient driving.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers taking part in EU Council meetings:</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers attended eight AgriFish, four Environment, two Justice and Home Affairs and two Education, Youth and Culture (EYC) Councils. I led the UK delegation at the informal Culture Council on 30 to 31 March 2010 and the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning used Gaelic for the first time ever in the EU institutions at the EYC Council in May 2010.

  <p>The Scottish Government has not approached the European Commission for additional structural funds for Moray. Successful bids have been made for funds available through the European Economic Recovery Plan for use elsewhere in Scotland. Funds are still available from the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund to support projects across Scotland, so projects to support business or individuals in Moray that are eligible may apply for support.</p>

  <p>However, the immediate priority of the Moray Task Force and the Scottish Government is to present a strong argument to the UK Government as to why the RAF presence should be retained in Moray. The Scottish Government has made it clear it will do all that it can to support the community in Moray but we will also continue to press the UK Government to recognise its responsibilities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does recognise the significant contribution that the voluntary sector can make to educating the public regarding blood-borne viruses.</p>

  <p>Through the Hepatitis C Phase 2 Action Plan the Scottish Government has directed &pound;300,000 each year over the last two years towards national voluntary sector organisations. Much of this funding has been utilised to raised awareness amongst the public of hepatitis C, including the delivery of the Mainliners Hepatitis C Resource Centre.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government worked closely with voluntary sector partners in the development of the HIV Action Plan and input from HIV Scotland, the national umbrella voluntary sector agency for HIV continues. The voluntary sector has, and will continue to have, an important role to play in educating the public through increased awareness of HIV and a reduction in HIV related stigma and discrimination. The Scottish Government funding to HIV voluntary sector organisations will assist them to advance education and understanding of HIV in the public.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has provided &pound;300,000 each year over the last two years to support national voluntary sector activity in respect of hepatitis C. This funding, which has been provided to Scottish Drugs Forum, The Hepatitis C Trust and Mainliners, is intended to enable these organisations to deliver specific and national projects which support the Hepatitis C Action Plan. At a local level NHS boards have also been provided with a specific allocation for care and support of those with Hepatitis C and boards are free to invest this in voluntary sector providers if that meets their local needs. Some boards have used the money in this way.</p>

  <p>Similarly, for HIV, the Scottish Government provides funding to support national voluntary sector activity. In this financial year, this comprises &pound;270,000 to HIV Scotland, as the key national umbrella HIV organisation; &pound;50,478 to Waverley Care to promote the welfare and care of people affected by HIV, including working with people from Africa living in Scotland; and &pound;9,000 to support the National AIDS Trust work in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has provided significant funding for hepatitis C treatment, care and support services over the last five years. Under the Hepatitis C Phase 2 Action Plan, which was launched in 2008, the clinical and non-clinical services (including care and support services through voluntary sector organisations) that are available to those on long term treatment have increased significantly.</p>

  <p>The HIV Action Plan, published in 2009, aims to support people living with HIV through improved and co-ordinated treatment and care services. This includes the development of NHS QIS HIV Services Standards to ensure quality of HIV services throughout Scotland. Voluntary sector agencies have been fully involved in this process.</p>

  <p>Each NHS board has, or is affiliated to, a managed care network (MCN) for hepatitis C. MCNs locally are required to develop care pathways for individuals affected by hepatitis C. The national generic care pathway for hepatitis C, which was developed under Action 3 of the Hepatitis C Phase 2 Action Plan, acknowledges post-treatment in the care pathway. This would normally include, for example, follow up with an individual following completion of treatment to assess whether or not there has been a sustained viral response.</p>

  <p>Both hepatitis B and HIV cannot currently be cured and so treatment and engagement with services for both conditions will be life long.</p>

  <p>This is exactly the same number as in 2009 due to my decision earlier this year to freeze the number of distinction awards awarded in 2010. This decision resulted in a saving of &pound;2 million.</p>

  <p>I also announced on 16 November 2010 that I am proposing to extend this freeze in 2011-12. This move will save an additional &pound;2 million which can be reinvested in frontline patient care.</p>

  <p>The information requested for 2007 is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Stroke Care Audit 2010 National Report, published on 29 June 2010, indicates that in 2008, 260 (3%) people received thrombolysis and in 2009 the number was 411 (5%). The report is available at the following website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.strokeaudit.scot.nhs.uk/Downloads/2010%20report/SSCAReport0610.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.strokeaudit.scot.nhs.uk/Downloads/2010%20report/SSCAReport0610.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>The percentages given above are calculated from the total number of acute strokes discharged from hospital. These figures include people who had a haemorrhagic stroke and who were therefore not eligible for thrombolytic therapy.</p>

  <p>The NHS Quality Improvement Scotland clinical standard for stroke thrombolysis is a treatment rate of 5 per 100,000 population each year in Scotland. The number of people treated in 2008 equates to 5 per 100,000 population and in 2009 8 per 100,000 population.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has been working with the Scottish Cot Death Trust to update the <em>Reduce the risk of cot death</em> leaflet, which will be published early in 2011. A copy of the leaflet is given to all new parents. This leaflet emphasises that a parent should never fall asleep with a baby on a couch or armchair and contains information on avoiding bed sharing if either parent smokes, has recently drunk any alcohol or has taken medication or drugs which would make it difficult for them to respond to their baby.</p>

  <p>We recognise that policies on bed sharing while women are in hospital vary between maternity units. We know that many units including baby friendly hospitals provide additional information to breastfeeding mums such as UNICEF&rsquo;s leaflet <em>Sharing a bed with your baby &ndash; A guide for breastfeeding mothers</em> at:</p>

  <p>Arrangements are in place at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (Yorkhill) to ensure that all children on admission to hospital who have special dietary requirements are assessed by a dietician. Food suitable for children&rsquo;s dietary needs is available during working hours, seven days a week and the children are able to select meals once they have seen what is on offer. Rotating menu plans are available so that parents are aware of the choices in advance. A special feeds unit also prepares special feeds and supplements for infants and children with complex nutritional problems where a child&rsquo;s nutritional needs or requirements are altered by their disease or medical condition.</p>

  <p>Food tasting audits were undertaken in 2009 which focused on children&rsquo;s views of catering services, including popular choices. Feedback indicates the need for a very flexible catering provision for children given the patient age ranges, eating preferences and, in some cases, highly specialist dietary requirements being catered for. Catering services are continually adapting menu formats on the basis of patient and parent comments and are maintaining ongoing dialogue with patients, parents and carers.</p>

  <p>The provision of palliative and end of life care in a patient&rsquo;s home is based on the needs of the individual concerned. The composition of the teams providing care will reflect the particular needs of individuals which may change over time. NHS boards, through the implementation of <em>Living and Dying Well</em> , are encouraged to work with their independent and voluntary sector colleagues in order to achieve a multi-disciplinary approach to addressing the palliative and end of life needs of patients and their carers. The provision of services by independent and voluntary sector care homes is a matter for the organisation concerned.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to monitor the supply of prescription medicines and is in regular contact about supply issues with the Department of Health, pharmaceutical companies and others, including Community Pharmacy Scotland and NHS National Services Scotland.</p>

  <p>On 13 November 2009 guidance was issued by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and other key organisations entitled <em>Trading Medicines for Human Use: Shortages and Supply Chain Obligations</em>. This guidance, which remains extant, has been drawn to the attention of the NHS in Scotland under cover of a letter from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer and can be found at:</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2010 (SSI 2010/128) introduced on 1 May 2010 place an obligation upon pharmacists who dispense NHS prescriptions to use all reasonable endeavours to provide prescribed drugs and appliances with reasonable promptness and not to engage in activity which might delay or prevent the dispensing of prescribed drugs and appliances to NHS patients. The amendment regulations also place on pharmacists an obligation to contact the prescriber to discuss alternative arrangements where there is likely to be, in that pharmacist&rsquo;s opinion, a clinically significant delay to the dispensing of prescribed drugs or appliances. A copy of the amendment regulations can be found on the Office of Public Sector Information website at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provided an extra &pound;4.19 million over two years to local authorities on top of the overall settlement to enable local authorities to deliver in full by 2010-11 the commitment in the concordat to progress towards delivering 10,000 extra respite weeks. Of this extra &pound;4.19 million, the allocation in 2009-10 is &pound;1.370 million, intended to help deliver an increase of 6,000 weeks in that year. Glasgow&rsquo;s share of this was &pound;0.165 million which would equate to an additional 240 weeks. Both the interim target of 6,000 weeks by 2009-10 and the 2010-11 target of 10,000 weeks are Scotland-wide. These weeks have not been apportioned amongst local authorities. This reflects both the fact that the concordat commitment is Scotland-wide and the different costs associated with different types of respite. It is noted that 24 local authorities contributed positively to the delivery of the additional 8,950 respite weeks recorded in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is in regular contact with the UK Government on behalf of Scottish shipbuilding and other manufacturing sectors. Most recently, the First Minister and the Minister for Parliamentary Business wrote to Liam Fox MP, Secretary of State for Defence, outlining Scotland&rsquo;s capabilities in defence manufacturing prior to the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). The Scottish Government and main Scottish party leaders&rsquo; submission sent to the MoD on 23 September 2010 also outlined the importance of the Royal Navy&rsquo;s military afloat reach and sustainability vessels programme to the UK&rsquo;s manufacturing and defence capabilities. The First Minister has also separately written to Liam Fox MP since the SDSR seeking clarification on the implications for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and agencies continue to promote Scottish shipbuilding but we are limited in directly influencing individual procurement contracts as this would contravene EU commercial policy on open procurement.</p>
