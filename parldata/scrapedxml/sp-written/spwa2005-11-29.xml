  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service deploys the most appropriate resource to an emergency call, and in relation to Category A (life threatening) calls, these should now all be responded to by a paramedic, whether that paramedic is in a rapid response unit, or is part of a double crewed ambulance, unless there are exceptional circumstances. It should be recognised that ambulance technicians are also trained and well equipped to deal with the wide range of conditions that are presented by patients who require an emergency ambulance response.</p>

  <p>Accident and emergency ambulances and rapid response units staffed by 1,155 paramedics and 910 technicians respond to around 500,000 incidents across Scotland each year that require the emergency ambulance service. This compares with a staffing mix of 721 paramedics to 1,101 technicians in 2002. These numbers are not broken down by NHS board area.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of incidents broken down to differentiate between those that received a paramedic-led response and those that did not is not currently available. This is one example of the type of information which the ambulance service is looking to capture once the proposed electronic patient record form is introduced.</p>

  <p>The ambulance service has a process in place whereby crews are encouraged to feed back to the control room cases where the response and resources deployed to a call did not appear to match the priority based dispatch categorisation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to equality for disabled people. The consultation paper <em>Safe and Secure Homes for Our Most Vulnerable Children</em> set out the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s proposals to modernise and strengthen the adoption system in Scotland, to the benefit of all those affected by it, including people with a communication impairment. In particular, legislative and other steps will be taken to facilitate the matching of children with suitable adoptive parents, outwith a child&rsquo;s local authority area if necessary. This can particularly benefit children affected by disabilities where it may otherwise be hard to find prospective adopters. New legislation will seek to improve access to medical information for adoptive families. In implementing this legislation, Scottish ministers and local authorities will be subject, as in all their duties, to the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

  <p>The proposed Children&rsquo;s Hearings and Integrated Services Bill will put in place the legislation to implement the proposals contained in <em>Getting it Right for Every Child</em> . These have been developed to ensure that every child&rsquo;s needs are identified through an Integrated Assessment where this is necessary. It commits all services to working together to deliver what is required for each individual child&rsquo;s needs.</p>

  <p>We also propose that agencies must be alert to a child&rsquo;s needs and seek and record the child&rsquo;s views. In implementing this legislation, Scottish ministers and local authorities will be subject, as in all their duties, to the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

  <p>Education authorities, who would be responsible under the bill proposals for preparing strategies to promote greater parental involvement in their own children&rsquo;s education and in the life of their school, will also need to have regard to the new requirements in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. And in future inspections of schools and authorities Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectors of Education will continue to look closely at how well authorities and schools do achieve the involvement of parents.</p>

  <p>The proposed bill has the overall objective of modernising the administration of elections and registration services. Key elements of this modernisation are to make the process of voting more accessible and the registration of vital events more convenient. These measures will help people with a communication impairment as well as the general population. In particular, it is intended that the proposed bill would include a provision allowing Returning Officers to give guidance in a variety of languages and formats. This could include guidance for people who have difficulty in communicating through a physical impairment. In implementing this legislation, Scottish ministers and local authorities will be subject, as in all their duties, to the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

  <p>While the proposed Summary Justice Reform Bill will not specifically impact on the provision of services to people with a communication impairment, justice services will continue to be provided in a way which is designed to meet their needs. Under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, all public bodies must have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people.</p>

  <p>For example, interpreters are provided by the Scottish Court Service where English is not the first language of the accused and sign language services are made available where required. The Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 and its associated regulations, ensure that special needs, including any communication impairment, are taken into account when a decision is taken on whether an individual should receive criminal legal assistance for legal representation in court.</p>

  <p>The Executive had planned to publish its action plan this autumn, as a follow-up to a series of Scotland-wide consultation seminars. We have, however, decided to postpone publication until spring 2006 so that the document can be informed by other key initiatives, such as the scoping study on parental substance misuse, the <em>Getting It Right for Every Child</em> proposals for action, and the 21st Century Social Work Review.</p>

  <p>Most cases of E coli are sporadic and there is rarely any microbiological confirmation of the source of infection.</p>

  <p>From 1999 to date, 18 outbreaks of E coli linked to school or business locations were identified by Health Protection Scotland.</p>

  <p>Outbreaks are defined as incidents involving members of more than one household, or institutions. There were no reported outbreaks linked to leisure centres or hospitals. A total of 80 persons were both ill, and had positive laboratory confirmation of infection.</p>

  <p>Information is not held by local authority area, but a break down by NHS board area is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The only statutory aspects of the curriculum are Religious Education and Religious Observance. The aims for Religious Education as set out in the 5&ndash;14 guidelines include helping pupils to develop their own beliefs, attitudes, moral values and practices through a process of personal search, discovery and critical evaluation.</p>

  <p>The aims of Religious Observance include promoting pupils&rsquo; spiritual development by increasing their understanding of religious practices such as prayer and meditation and the religious experience which underlies them. The Scottish Executive Education Department issued a revised circular on religious observance in Scottish schools in February 2005 (Circular 1/2005). This circular describes and explains the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policy on the provision of religious observance in Scottish schools and sets out action for local authorities in planning the provision of religious observance and can be found at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/education/circ1_05-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/education/circ1_05-00.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>Learning and Teaching Scotland appointed a Development Officer in May 2005 to work with key faith groups in producing support materials to support the 1/2005 circular.</p>

  <p>The Structure and Balance of the Curriculum: 5&ndash;14 National Guidelines advise education authorities and schools of the minimum time allocations for each of the following curricular areas:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>English Language &ndash; 20%<br />
              Environmental Studies &ndash; 15%<br />
              Expressive Arts &ndash; 15%<br />
              Mathematics &ndash; 20%<br />
              Religious and Moral Education &ndash; 10%<br />
              Curriculum Flexibility &ndash; 20%.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The guidelines do not specify how much of this should be spent on individual subjects but schools are encouraged to use curriculum flexibility time for activities which reflect their own needs and circumstances. In S3-S6 the flexibility factor is 30%.</p>

  <p>The S3/S4 stage of secondary education builds on the learning experiences of S1/S2. It provides a framework within which, subject to principles of breadth and balance, pupils can make negotiated choices in accordance with their own aspirations, interest, abilities and potential career paths.</p>

  <p>The Structure and Balance of the Curriculum 5-14 National Guidelines set out minimum time allocations for Environmental Studies 5-14 and four other key curriculum areas but do not specify how much of this should be spent on individual subjects. However, guidelines for Environmental Studies, which include History, make it clear that there is an expectation that attention should be given to events in Scottish history in both primary and the first two years of secondary.</p>

  <p>There are no set percentages for Scottish or any other areas of study within Standard Grade, Higher and Advanced Higher History courses. Each of these courses offers a range of options for study including different time periods within the history of Scotland. For example, study of the Highland Clearances is part of the 1830 to 1930 option at Standard Grade.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made no representations or held discussions or meetings with the EOC or other organisations on the specific issue of pay for women in local authority employment as this is a matter for local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive has had a number of discussions with a range of organisations on the general issue of equal pay in the context of its work on gender equality. This has primarily been through the Executive&rsquo;s role as a partner within the Close the Gap project.</p>

  <p>For the last four years the Scottish Executive has been a partner, along with the Equal Opportunities Commission Scotland, in the Close the Gap project which aims to raise awareness about the pay gap between women and men in Scotland and encourage activity to close it, such as carrying out equal pay audits or reviews. The project steering group, which is made up of representatives from all the partner organisations &ndash; Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Scottish Trades Union Congress and TGWU, the EOC Scotland, Fair Play and the University of the Highlands and Islands Millennium Institute, meets regularly to discuss the issues surrounding the pay gap.</p>

  <p>(a) The levels of indicative funding for General Medical Services (GMS) in 2003-04 were (i) &pound;2.7 million for NHS Orkney and (ii) &pound;477.8 million for NHS Scotland. The funding was indicative because it included the estimated amounts required to cover non discretionary expenditure under the former GMS contract, which was fully funded by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>(b) The levels of actual funding for Primary Medical Services in 2004-05 were (i) &pound;3.8 million for NHS Orkney and (ii) &pound;559.2 million for NHS Scotland. This included additional funding of &pound;32 million transferred from HM Treasury to meet increased employer&rsquo;s superannuation contributions.</p>

  <p>In 2004-05, following the introduction of the new contract for Primary Medical Services, NHS boards are required to deliver primary medical services through a range of contractual options within the actual funding that they are allocated.</p>

  <p>The Ministerial Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Task Force is nearing completion of a three-year programme of work to improve prevention and control of HAI. The task force has developed a raft of tools, including a national Code of Practice for the Local Management of Hygiene and HAI, a range of professional guidance, public information, and multidisciplinary education and training programmes.</p>

  <p>We recently announced that the task force will lead a new programme of work (underpinned by the &pound;15 million Clean Hospitals funding). This will focus on implementation of, and monitoring compliance with, HAI Task Force recommendations and Scottish Executive requirements to ensure that best practice on infection prevention and control is firmly embedded into working practices throughout NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>For example, I recently launched a monitoring tool that will measure compliance within NHS boards with the NHSScotland National Cleaning Services Specification. The Health Department will receive quarterly reports on compliance.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Communities Scotland (and its predecessor, Scottish Homes) has worked strenuously to increase the quality and variety of houses in disadvantaged areas of West Dunbartonshire. In particular:</p>
<p>Since 1997 (and before) investment has been targeted almost solely on areas of deprivation in West Dunbartonshire, especially in the seven former social inclusion partnership priority areas, which now correspond to the community planning areas for priority investment.</p>
<p>Communities Scotland has worked in close partnership with West Dunbartonshire Council, local registered social landlords (RSL) and communities to identify local housing need, together with the type and tenure of housing appropriate to local areas. This has involved the development of comprehensive area based housing strategies including the restructuring of estates and removal of unpopular/low demand housing.</p>
<p>Together with the above Communities Scotland is ensuring through its appraisal procedures an increase in housing quality through the use of sustainable materials, increased energy efficiency and the provision of housing for varying needs.</p>
<p>Since 1997 (the nine year period from 1996-97 to 2004-05) 1,466 houses have been provided comprising 846 units for social rent general needs, 291 units for social rent special needs, 329 for low cost home ownership (71 units shared ownership and 258 units GRO grant funded). Total investment over this period was &pound;61,365,000.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The location of the houses provided as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote><table width="25%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">

  <p>The staffing of individual subject departments are matters for local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise to ensure at a national level adequate numbers of newly qualified teachers are trained for when they are required in publicly funded schools. This takes into account factors such as the age profile of the profession; changing pupil numbers; numbers of new entrants to the profession and those leaving due to resignation, retirement etc.</p>

  <p>As part of the exercise subject specialisms are prioritised to make certain intakes to initial teacher education reflect the teachers needed. Factors which are considered in the prioritisation exercise include vacancy levels reported by local authorities and the demand from local authorities for probationer teachers in each sector/subject.</p>

  <p>The normal retirement age of teachers is 60. Teachers employed by local authorities must retire at 65, so there is potential to retire at anytime between 60 and 65 with unreduced benefits. Teachers can apply to retire at any time between 55 to 59 with an actuarially reduced pension, though in practice at present very few teachers are doing so. The employer must agree to the teacher&rsquo;s retirement but consent cannot be held for more than six months.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the numbers in each year at 60 and above who are eligible to retire rather than the number that will retire in the years specified. Teachers therefore can appear in more than one column.</p>

The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), on behalf of the voluntary sector, is working with the Scottish Trades Union Council (STUC) in addressing this issue as part of a Voluntary Sector Workforce Development Strategy, which has recently been developed following consultation with the sector and key stakeholders.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for Scottish Water. Therefore I have asked the Chief Executive of Scottish Water to write to you with the information that you have requested.</p>
