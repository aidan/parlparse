  <p>Health boards are required to commission services to meet the needs of their resident population including those from minority ethnic communities.</p>

  <p>While the information requested is not currently held centrally, a stocktake of how the needs of minority ethnic communities across Scotland are being met is currently underway. The report of this stocktake will be published later this year and will lead to further guidance and support being provided to enable local health boards and Trusts to meet the specific health needs of ethnic minority communities.</p>

  <p>The Executive intends to write to interested parties to urge them to familiarise themselves with the Scottish Law Commission&#8217;s <i>Report</i> <i>on</i> <i>Real</i> <i>Burdens</i> . We hope that if individuals and organisations take time to read and evaluate the Commission&#8217;s recommendations then this will allow them to respond from a more informed position when the Executive issues its consultation paper on this subject. We anticipate that the formal consultation process will take place in the spring.</p>

  <p>No new guidance has been issued. In 1995, guidance about new drugs for multiple sclerosis and clinical advice from the Scottish Medical Advisory Committee was issued to all health boards and this guidance continues to apply.</p>

  <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland is at present carrying out an assessment of Beta Interferon and Copaxone in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently considering an application from Scottish Borders Council for support from the Public Transport Fund (PTF) to meet the costs of securing the necessary parliamentary permissions for reopening the line from Edinburgh to the Central Borders. I hope to make an announcement on this and 25 other PTF applications in the near future.</p>

  <p>There are a number of options on the Scottish Executive website through which members of the public can send in email correspondence. The table below shows the main mailboxes on the website and the number of e-mails received through these since 1 August 2000.

  <p>Consultations and questionnaires published on the website may also contain an email address but we do not hold statistics centrally on the number of emails sent to these individual addresses.</p>

  <p>Our practice is only to send a holding reply to correspondence when we cannot provide a substantive answer quickly.</p>
