  <p>On 7 November 2008, I wrote to Andy Burnham, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, formally requesting the return of &pound;150 million of lottery funds to Scotland to help us deliver Scotland&rsquo;s legacy ambitions for the 2014 games. The return of the diverted lottery funds will allow us to capitalise on the inspiration, ambition and levels of engagement generated across Scotland by our winning bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>My letter included a bid document which sets out examples of the sorts of initiatives across Scotland that could be funded with these lottery funds. This document has been published on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>The Commonwealth Games provides an opportunity for visitors to see what Glasgow and Scotland has to offer as a destination. It&rsquo;s a fantastic chance to showcase Scotland&rsquo;s heritage. We have some magnificent buildings and inspiring scenery of which we are rightly proud. But they could be improved. We want our built and natural heritage to be inclusive, but also protected and enhanced &ndash; and better understood by young and old alike.</p>

  <p>Lottery funding would help us to restore some of Scotland&rsquo;s neglected buildings and to make them, together with our natural heritage, more accessible.</p>

  <p>Decisions taken about the crewing arrangements for the air ambulance service are operational ones for the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS). As such, the information sought is a matter for them and is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The SAS have provided the Scottish Government with an assurance that every air ambulance mission is evaluated to ensure no adverse effects and all mission performance is monitored on an on-going basis. This issue was most recently discussed at public annual review of the SAS on 24 September 2008.</p>

  <p>Note: Central Scotland police force were unable to supply data for 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Please note that, as the 2003-04 data is only available for seven of the eight police forces, care must be taken when examining trends over time in the overall Scotland total.</p>

  <p>It is expected that the numbers of crimes would have been affected by the implementation (from 1 April 2004) of the Scottish Crime Recording Standard (SCRS), which means that no corroborative evidence is required initially to record a crime related incident as a crime if so perceived by the victim. This was expected to increase the numbers of minor crimes recorded by the police, such as minor crimes of vandalism, minor assaults and breach of the peace.</p>

  <p>This suggests that increases from 2003-04 to 2004-05 in the number of those crimes recorded as a part of a racist incident might have been affected by the new recording standard.</p>

  <p>Thrombophilia investigations are available at several haematology departments and molecular genetics laboratories in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There are a number of genetic mutations which give rise to thrombophilia, but Factor V Leiden is the most common relevant genetic abnormality. The test for Factor V Leiden costs between &pound;80 and &pound;100.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 62 on Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) recommends that all pregnant women with a personal or, family history of VTE in first or second degree relatives should be offered screening for thrombophilia.</p>

  <p>SIGN is now reviewing Guideline 62 and consultation on the revised draft guideline will take place during 2009. The SIGN guideline development group has devised a set of key questions covering issues such as risk factors and testing, and the key questions about the investigations which predict risk of VTE refer to testing for thrombophilia as well as to family history.</p>

  <p>Lyme disease is a notifiable disease, but clinical presentation of Lyme disease is highly variable and asymptomatic infections do occur, which can mean that a diagnosis based on clinical suspicion of the disease is often difficult and that some cases may go unreported. Recorded diagnoses of Lyme disease are therefore based on a combination of clinical findings and laboratory results. Laboratory results are only valid if they are performed in accredited laboratories such as the national Lyme Borrelioses Testing Service at Raigmore hospital. The sensitivity of these laboratory tests is very high if performed after a sufficient period of time to allow the patient to develop antibodies (usually six to eight weeks post tick bite).</p>

  <p>The Lyme Borreliosis Unit at Southampton General Hospital undertake continuous research and assessment on testing kits.</p>

  <p>While today marks the end of the taskforce, it also represents a new beginning in terms of our approach and relationships. There is much work to be taken forward now &ndash; by government, by universities and by the funding council &ndash; to ensure our ambitions for the sector and for Scotland as a whole are met.</p>

  <p>Between 10 March 2008 and 30 September 2008, procurators fiscal offered direct measures involving a fine (i.e. fiscal fines and fiscal fines combined with compensation offers) to the value of &pound;2.5 million. As at 30 September 2008, &pound;0.7 million had been collected. These direct measures are offered with the option of paying by weekly or fortnightly instalments of between &pound;10 and &pound;200. The value of the uncollected fines therefore includes fines which are in the process of being paid. Where payment is not made, the new enforcement powers introduced in the Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 are being used to ensure that payment is made.</p>

  <p>Capital and revenue funds are allocated on a formula basis to geographic NHS boards for them to identify their spending requirements and to prioritise these in line with available resources. NHS boards develop long-term financial plans and it is for them, when developing these plans, to take account of infrastructure investment. NHS boards across Scotland received &pound;324 million pounds of capital funding for 2008-09, and have been notified of indicative capital allocations of &pound;329 million and &pound;334 million for 2009-10 and 2010-11 to build new fit-for-purpose facilities, and upgrade existing facilities.</p>

  <p>Provision of medical services in police custody is determined at a local level, and each police force in Scotland has arrangements in place for the health care of those in its custody. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland Health and Medical Service Reference Group, on which the Scottish Government is represented, is currently considering the range of existing arrangements for care in custody with a view to identifying best practice models which can be deployed to suit local circumstances.</p>

  <p>In January 2009, Tayside Police and NHS Tayside will begin a three year pilot partnership to provide Police Surgeon Services, covering custody health care, forensic services, and training and development. This has been part funded by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, working with ACPOS, the Scottish Ambulance Service and the NHS, has also commissioned research on drunk and incapable people. This aims to identify the potential scale of the problem in Scotland, and to identify different models of support practised by all relevant agencies including local authorities, both in Scotland and elsewhere, to establish the key elements of successful approaches. A set of conclusions and recommendations on how best to manage people who are drunk and incapable to help alleviate the unnecessary pressure on emergency services is expected in the New Year.</p>
