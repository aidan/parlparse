  <p>Section 52(J) of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 enables children who may have been misusing alcohol or drugs to be referred to the children&rsquo;s reporter. Statistics on referrals are collated and published by the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration in line with the statutory position and in that light information on alcohol misuse alone is not available.

  <p>Tables providing this information are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Table 1 (Bib. number 39488) shows the combined figures for acute and psychiatric hospital discharges with an explicit diagnosis of alcohol related condition for the period 1990-91 to 2001-02. This has been reported as discharge information because the detail is drawn from two datasets and one of these datasets records discharge data only. Complete data on psychiatric discharges are unavailable for 2002-03 to 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Table 2 (Bib. number 39489) provides information on discharges from acute hospitals for the period 1990-91 to 2004-05. For acute hospitals, only discharge data exists.</p>

  <p>Advice on distribution and marketing is included in generic business support provided by the Scottish Enterprise network to individual companies within the digital media and creative industries. The main channels for delivery of this type of support are the Account Management and Client Management services within each Local Enterprise Company, together with the Business Gateways and Cultural Enterprise Offices who offer advice and appropriate services to general business enquirers. In respect of creative media businesses, the work of the Cultural Enterprise Offices, now rolled out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen, is particularly relevant. Equally important to distribution and marketing are overseas links and in this respect the Business Gateway International network provides appropriate services and links to UK-wide services to assist export marketing.</p>

  <p>In addition, Scottish Screen provides a wide range of advice and support to the screen industries in Scotland, including support for distribution, exhibition and market development.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of research recently published by Wake Forest University, United States of America, confirming the finding of the measles virus, RNA, in the terminal ileum of autistic children, what urgent steps will now be taken to have this clinical research replicated in the United Kingdom by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) and what explanations will be sought by the Executive from the MRC and CSO regarding their not investigating the relationship between bowel disease and autism since 2001 when the MRC stated that this was a priority area of research.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-05-08.S2W-25442.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0508.htm#3">

  <p>The Medical Research Council (MRC) still considers research into autism as a priority. The research strategy implemented by the MRC in 2003, which the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) is contributing towards, encourages a programme of research across all aspects of autism. This was thought to be the most appropriate vehicle for testing hypotheses about possible causes and treatment.</p>

  <p>The CSO and the MRC would welcome research proposals that wish to further explore the link between bowel disease and autism. However, CSO and the MRC do not operate by commissioning research to address specific questions. Both fund research by responding to research proposals initiated by the research community and it is therefore up to the scientific community to submit ideas for consideration. Since the MRC review and a specific workshop directed towards this area in 2003, only a few applications have been received by the MRC in relation to this, and none have been deemed of sufficient quality (by peer review) to receive funding.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2O-9171 by Ross Finnie on 2 March 2006, what action it has taken to prepare for the use of vaccination as a disease control tool in an outbreak of H5N1 avian flu.</p>

  <p>Current vaccines for avian influenza have a number of limitations which would restrict their potential use as a credible disease control tool. However, the Executive has continued to work closely with other UK administrations and veterinary and scientific experts to keep the use of vaccination under review in the epidemiological circumstances.</p>

  <p>As part of this work the European Commission has approved a strategy for the use of vaccine amongst zoo birds, where this can be justified against the level of risk and potential disease control and biodiversity benefits and we have obtained sufficient stocks of vaccine for that purpose.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many shots of H5N1 vaccine it has in stock and whether this number would be sufficient to carry out a ring vaccination programme against an outbreak of H5N1 avian flu.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-05-08.S2W-25126.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0508.htm#4">

  <p>Two million doses of vaccine have been ordered by the UK Government to allow a vaccination programme for zoo birds if the veterinary risk assessment suggested that this would be appropriate for the protection of avian biodiversity.</p>

  <p>Given the limitations of avian influenza vaccination as a disease control tool, no bank for emergency vaccination is currently in place. The quantity of vaccine required in any vaccination campaign is difficult to quantify as it will depend on the specific circumstances of the outbreak e.g. poultry density, types of poultry, husbandry practices and the size of area affected.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that staffing levels in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh virology laboratories are sufficient to cope with a possible avian flu pandemic.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-05-08.S2W-25508.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0508.htm#4">

  <p>Avian influenza is distinct from human pandemic influenza. Although the avian influenza virus poses a risk to birds, the risk it poses to humans is extremely limited. This is because it is very difficult to catch from birds and even more difficult to pass from human to human. The major concern is the possibility that the virus could mutate into a form that can easily transmit between humans, and thus give rise to another global epidemic (a pandemic) in humans.</p>

  <p>While the work force planning to deliver health services is primarily the responsibility of the individual NHS board, the Scottish Executive is working with NHSScotland, including NHS Lothian, on the planning arrangements for any potential outbreak of pandemic influenza. As plans develop, the Scottish Executive would expect them to reflect arrangements for staffing key areas such as laboratories.</p>

  <p>During the design stage of the laboratory suite at the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh the possibility of cross-contamination was taken into account. The two sections of the laboratory are quite separate, with dedicated staff performing virology investigations and blood transfusion staff involved in blood handling. The areas are also physically separate. Control procedures are also in place to ensure accurate diagnostic testing, including minimising the risk of cross-contamination. The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service believe the risk of cross-contamination to be low and are not aware of any episode arising through the incident reporting systems.</p>

  <p>Yes. However National Express are currently working to allowing entitlement card holders to book free tickets for Scottish journeys in advance.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, cardholders can travel free of charge between any two points within Scotland, on any National Express journey, simply by showing their entitlement card to the driver when they board. If cardholders need to guarantee their seat by pre-booking they will need to pay for the journey and National Express will refund the cost.</p>

  <p>The data in these publications was taken from the National Survey of 5-14 Attainment Levels which was conducted each year by the Education and Children Statistics Unit of the Scottish Executive Education Department since 1998-99. However, as a result of the <em>Assessment, Testing and Reporting 3-14</em> (2003) consultation this survey has been discontinued, and the 2003-04 publication is the last in the series.</p>

  <p>In May 2005 the new Scottish Survey of Achievement was introduced to provide an overview of attainment levels based on a sample of pupils rather than on the whole pupil population. The results of the 2005 survey are not yet available.</p>

  <p>The Executive provides support in a number of ways to create high value and highly skilled jobs within the aquaculture industry. This is augmented through Executive support for scientific research.</p>

  <p>Measures through which assistance is given include the Financial Instrument For Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) which is expected to be replaced by the European Fisheries Fund next year, the Knowledge Transfer Partnership initiative and the Scottish Aquaculture Research Forum.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise, through funding from the Scottish Executive, also provides support to the aquaculture industry through direct financial assistance to businesses for capital investment and workforce development as well as providing funding for strategic research and development.</p>

  <p>A key factor to securing high quality employment in the industry is to provide the right conditions to secure international investment. The Executive, in successfully persuading the European Union to introduce minimum import prices, has helped create market stability, which will assist investor confidence, which should lead to the creation of further high quality jobs.</p>

  <p>The CION investigation proved that Norwegian companies were dumping salmon into the EU market, which resulted in anti-dumping regulations being applied against Norway.

  <p>As part of the routine administrative arrangements for managing Scottish Executive records, all records were automatically closed for 30 years, and certain records of a sensitive nature were closed for extended periods up to 100 years, e.g. because they contained personal information. When the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act came into force on 1 January 2005, this administrative arrangement ceased.

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland has made no recommendation on Temozolomide. The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) made the following recommendation regarding Temozolomide in February 2006:</p>

  <p>Temozolomide (Temodal&reg;) is not recommended for use within NHS Scotland for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) concomitantly with radiotherapy and subsequently as monotherapy.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and the Scottish Health Council have complementary roles in ensuring the delivery of high quality, patient focussed health services, and ensuring that independent advocacy is available to all who need it. The Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance is also a key organisation in ensuring the continued promotion of good practice in advocacy, and we have increased the funding available to it.</p>

  <p>We are currently working to develop principles and standards for advocacy in health services and revised guidance on the commissioning and evaluation of advocacy. We plan to begin a consultation on these issues in June.</p>

Athletes from all home nations who meet the criteria are eligible to receive support from this funding, but there is no set amount reserved for Scottish athletes. Therefore, it is not possible to disaggregate how much would be spent specifically on Scottish athletes or in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the &pound;200 million will be phased in over the four year period up to and including the 2012 Games subject to the sports meeting designated performance targets.</p>

  <p>Local authorities receive &pound;16 million Change Fund per annum, to help implement the recommendations in <em>The same as you?</em> review of services for people with learning disabilities. Additionally they are to receive an extra &pound;4.2 million in 2006-07 and &pound;5 million 2007-08 to take account of the increasing population and of post-hospital closure demands. The additional change funds are included with general local government grant aided expenditure. A breakdown of Change Fund allocations by local authority can be found in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39507).</p>

  <p>With this exception, no specific funding allocation is made to local authorities for learning disability services. Funding comes from community care allocations and it is for local authorities to allocate these resources as appropriate for their local area.</p>

  <p>No specific funding allocation is made to NHS boards for learning disability services. Each NHS board is given an annual allocation of funds to meet the health care needs of its resident population, including the cost of learning disability services, taking account of national and local priorities.

  <p>The Executive monitors the range of services provided by local authorities for people with learning disabilities in a number of ways. Monitoring of services for people with learning disabilities is delivered through the inspection of services by the Social Work Inspection Agency (SWIA). A pilot multi-agency inspection of learning disability services led by the SWIA and involving service users, carers, the Care Commission, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary, is currently underway in Ayrshire. An evaluation of this multi-agency inspection will be carried out prior to further inspections.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive collects annual statistics on implementation of <em>The same as you? </em>and the 2005 statistical release is due for publication at the end of May. The National Overview of the Partnership in Practice agreements will also include information on the way the Change Fund is being spent by each local authority.</p>

  <p>The work of <em>The same as you? </em>National Implementation Group, Users and Carers Group, and Partnership in Practice Network helps to highlight the range and quality of services that are available in each local authority area, and to consider areas where further development is needed.</p>

  <p>In particular, the Executive&rsquo;s Childcare Strategy stresses the importance of ample opportunities for sporting activities and play.

  <p>The Directive in question, which deals with the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, imposes a number of requirements on member states. Some of these are administrative in nature, and some have been implemented through the introduction of legislation. The <em>Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2006</em> , initially introduced in April 2002, specifically addresses Article 3(1) of the Directive (creating, in tandem with other Orders, a UK market for renewable electricity), while the Electricity (Guarantees of Origin of Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources) Regulations, which comply with the requirements of Article 5 and which cover Scotland, England and Wales, came into force in October 2003.</p>

  <p>The ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the Directive is complied with rests with the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The State Veterinary Service (SVS) is a GB wide executive agency sponsored by Defra and directly accountable to GB rural development ministers for its activities in their countries. Any breakdown of cost or staffing information would have to be provided by the Chief Executive of the State Veterinary Service for the period from 1 April 2005 and from Defra for the preceding period. However, whilst the SVS has a role in animal disease surveillance it does not employ veterinary investigation officers.

  <p>Initial screening tests using polymerase chain reaction tests can be available within around six hours of testing. These can give preliminary results and are useful in helping to screen out suspect disease. However, on their own they are insufficient to confirm disease.</p>

  <p>It takes seven days from receipt of the sample at the testing laboratory for internationally validated tests to provide final confirmation of negative results for avian influenza and Newcastle disease. Positive results can become available earlier but often need to be re-run to establish their validity. Timings are dependent on each stage of the laboratory process working smoothly which is influenced by sample quality.</p>
