  <p>The heads of the public library service in each local authority were consulted in November 1998, before the scheme was introduced. They then nominated their preferred library to participate in the scheme. All Partner Libraries were then visited by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre&rsquo;s Library Liaison Officer over the period November 1998&ndash;March 1999. The Library Liaison Officer addressed the Heads of (Public Libraries) Service meeting at the Scottish Library Association&rsquo;s annual conference in May 1999, announcing that the Partner Library network was complete and explaining its aims and objectives. All Partner Libraries have received an information pack containing information about the Parliament and details of who to contact for further information. In addition, all Partner Libraries currently receive a printed copy of &lsquo; <i>WHISP&rsquo;</i> ( <i>What&rsquo;s Happening in the Scottish Parliament</i> ). A range of publicity materials for each Partner Library is in preparation.</p>

  <p>The Parliament&rsquo;s existing waste disposal arrangements do not currently cover the recycling of waste paper. Parliament staff are, however, preparing a specification for this type of service and the aim is to award a contract later in the summer.</p>

  <p>The majority of additional space required in the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood is &lsquo;circulation&rsquo; space. The unit cost per square metre for that type of space is lower than the unit costs per square metre for other areas of the building. The average for the whole building is therefore reduced.</p>

  <p>The number of staff to be accommodated in the new Parliament building at Holyrood has increased from original estimates, this is one of the reasons for the increased construction cost estimate from &pound;50 million to &pound;62 million (excluding fees and VAT).</p>

  <p>There are three tables in the rear of the Assembly Hall, access to which is authorised by the Interim Clerk in terms of Business Bulletin Number 5/1999 published on 24 May 1999.</p>

  <p>The eastmost table is used by civil servants supporting the Scottish Executive. Up to 12 names are approved for attendance on each day when the Parliament is sitting: only 6 may be in the Hall at any time. These names are notified on the previous day. A copy of the list will be made available in the Reference Point behind the Chamber. A card indicating that the table is for use by officials of the Scottish Executive will be placed on the table.</p>

  <p>The centre table is used, as required, by staff of the Parliament. This will be clearly marked. All Parliamentary staff wear name badges.</p>

  <p>The westmost table is available for up to 6 advisers supporting non-executive parties. The names of those granted access on any day will also be listed in the Reference Point. Again, the table will be clearly identified as being available for non-Executive parties&rsquo; support.</p>

  <p>An introductory seminar was run for MSPs on Friday 21 May on the subject of Finance. Speakers from The Scottish Office and the Parliament presented an outline of the financial process as it is currently envisaged. Handouts of the presentation were provided on the day and, subsequently, to other members on request. Copies are also available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre along with copies of the briefing prepared by The Scottish Office for incoming Ministers.</p>

  <p>A variety of briefing material is also being produced by the Scottish Parliament Clerking Directorate for the Finance Committee. Much of this may well be applicable more widely across members and will be made available.</p>

  <p>Further training on the Parliament&rsquo;s financial affairs will be developed once the Finance Bill, which will set out all the procedures and timetables governing financial aspects, has been agreed by the Parliament.</p>
