  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will investigate the Food Safety Authority of Ireland&#8217;s decision to allow the continued sale of scallops which have been &quot;shucked&quot; from areas affected by amnesic shellfish poisoning with a view to introducing this policy in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have recently sought and received information on the Republic of Ireland&#8217;s monitoring and control system for amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). We are advised that the Republic of Ireland either close scallop production areas if results from the whole body exceed the EU action level, or prohibit the sale or use of scallops if results from gonad or muscle exceed the action level.</p>

  <p>The testing regime in Scotland is directed to the gonad since research has shown that, of the most commonly eaten parts of the scallop, this tends to have the highest concentration of toxins. Production areas are closed when levels of toxin in the gonad exceed the EU action level.</p>

  <p>The Executive has already announced that around 120 jobs in the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department will move from Edinburgh, making the entire department Glasgow located; and that the new Food Standards Agency, with over 40 posts, will be established in Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s policy on the location and relocation of public service jobs was set out in my reply of 15 September to question S1W-1558. I set out our objectives and our criteria for considering the location of staff, principally that where new units or agencies are set up there will be a presumption against an Edinburgh location and that when a significant property break occurs options outwith Edinburgh will be considered. Opportunities which meet these criteria will be considered on a case-by-case basis consistent with our objectives of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

  <p>Support for carers is for local authorities as part of their responsibility for community care. The Scottish Executive has allocated almost &pound;800 million grant-aided expenditure to local authorities for community care this financial year. Within that, &pound;5 million is notionally allocated for carers&#8217; services, including respite care. In addition, we have contributed about &pound;220,000 this year to national voluntary organisations representing and supporting carers.</p>

  <p>As part of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Programme for Government, a Strategy for Carers in Scotland was launched on 24 November 1999. The strategy sets out new measures to support both adult and young carers and these are now being taken forward alongside other relevant initiatives already underway. New initiatives include doubling the allocated resources available to local authorities for carers&#8217; services to &pound;10 million, the promotion of new and more flexible services, drawing up legislative proposals, and the provision of better and more targeted information for carers.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that individuals&#8217; community care needs are assessed and met in the most appropriate manner. They have a responsibility to ensure that housing and health colleagues are involved in the assessment procedure. Guidance on these matters has been issued.</p>

  <p>We know that home-based care, combined with suitable housing, is what most people prefer. <i>Modernising Community Care: An Action Plan </i>called for a modern, flexible homecare service, and a shift of community care resources to home-based care.<i> </i>Local authorities&#8217; response to this agenda has been encouraging and we are building on this through an increased incentive fund (&pound;7.5 million in 2000-01).</p>

  <p>The Joint Future Group which I chair will consider what the balance should be between home and residential care and address charging for home care. Its first meeting was held on 22 February.</p>

  <p>There are 87 secure places at present in Scotland. Of these, 49 places are in Rossie (near Montrose) and St Mary&#8217;s (Bishopbriggs, Glasgow) independent schools. The remainder are in local authority units in Kerelaw, Glasgow, Howdenhall, St Katherine&#8217;s, Edinburgh and Rimbelton Young Person&#8217;s Centre, Fife.</p>

  <p>We need to look at the use of secure accommodation in the round. An advisory group has been established to help us do this with representatives from the secure units, Directors of Social Work, Children&#8217;s Panels, Chief Police Officers, the Prison service and criminal justice interests. One of the key issues to be examined is how best to manage supply and demand for secure places.</p>

  <p>Education authorities have a duty under section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 to secure the adequate and efficient provision of school education for their area, including special educational needs. In order to fulfil these duties, authorities must establish which children belonging to their area, who are two years of age or over but under school leaving age, have pronounced, specific or complex special educational needs which require continuing review. They must open and keep a Record of Needs for any such child who, following assessment, is found to have such needs. Once opened, authorities are required to review their decision to open and keep a Record and the information contained in it whenever they think it expedient to do so. As a matter of good practice, reviews should be carried out at least annually.</p>

  <p>Ministers, Officials and Special Advisers worked together on all aspects of the preparation of the text of <i>Making it Work Together: A Programme for Government</i> and on plans for its presentation.</p>

  <p>Tactica Solutions was awarded the contract for the provision of design, print and publication services to the Scottish Executive based on best value for money and following a tendering process which complied with the European Procurement Directive. The production of <i>Making it Work Together: A Programme for Government</i>, for which Tactica was paid &pound;34,667.78,<i> </i>was subcontracted out, in respect of design work, by Tactica to Navy Blue Design, who in turn further subcontracted out photography work to Nesbitt and Wyllie the preferred supplier.</p>

  <p>Designers and photographers are selected on a project-by-project basis based on their suitability for the job. As the production timetable was short the project did not go out to tender. This is permitted under the procurement rules which allow the use of a sole supplier when it is recognised that that supplier is the best for the job.</p>

  <p>Assistance with the launch was provided by the following companies (costs in brackets):</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding for flu immunisation and issues guidance in accordance with medical advice on those who would most benefit from vaccination.</p>

  <p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is the expert advisory group on vaccination and immunisation to the four UK Health Departments. Their expert advice determines the policy for the flu vaccination programme and that advice recommends that the vaccine is offered to over 75s and other specific vulnerable groups. They do not recommend vaccinating all over 65s. This advice is kept under regular review and is relayed to GPs annually before the time for them to commence flu immunisations.</p>

  <p>It is for health boards to determine the number of intensive therapy units required in their respective areas, in light of local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Report from the Audit Group of the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG), which was published on Friday 28 January 2000, provides a very positive picture of intensive care in Scotland. It indicates that there are currently around 130 adult general ITU beds in Scotland, excluding coronary care units, neurosurgical ITU beds, cardiac surgical intensive care and paediatric intensive care beds. As I announced in Parliament on 3 February, we will be working with the Society and other relevant interests to examine the implications of the report for future provision.</p>

  <p>Tayside University Hospital NHS Trust has advised that a combination of staff vacancies and winter pressures has affected its physiotherapy services.</p>

  <p>Physiotherapists at both Stracathro and Ninewells Hospitals are continuing to see urgent or acute outpatients and inpatients who would suffer potential long-term ill-effects from not receiving physiotherapy. Those with non-acute or chronic conditions are added to the physiotherapy outpatient waiting list. Occupational therapy services are busy and are also experiencing vacant posts but I understand the effect on the level of service has been less marked. The Trust indicates that every effort is being made to fill vacant posts.</p>

  <p>Information on the percentage of patients now accommodated in mixed sex wards is not held by the Executive and is not being collected. The 90% figure announced in April 1999 was an estimate based on advice provided by Trusts at that time. It reflected the fact that most Trusts were largely compliant but with a small number of wards which did not meet the criteria. The position is, however, constantly changing, for example, as ward configurations alter and work on eliminating mixed sex accommodation continues. An exercise to obtain an accurate picture of the percentage of patients in mixed sex wards at a set point in time would be time consuming and of limited value.</p>

  <p>Progress is being made towards the elimination of mixed sex accommodation from the NHS in Scotland by March 2002. I have asked for regular updates on the position, with information on the Trusts that are fully compliant and the extent of non-compliance in other Trusts. The first report, in January, confirmed that most Trusts will meet the deadline of March 2002 without difficulty and support is being provided to those with specific problems. &pound;4.2 million over three years has been made available for this purpose.</p>

  <p>Information on registrations is only available centrally based on the postcode of dental practices in an area and not by patient postcode. It is not therefore possible to provide accurate information on patients registered in Aberdeenshire Council area as a number of these patients are registered with NHS dentists in Aberdeen City. The percentage of the adult population registered with an NHS dentist in the Grampian Health Board area (which covers Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Moray) was 49.1 as at 31 December 1999.</p>

  <p>The time limits for the termination of pregnancies are laid down clearly by the Abortion Act 1967 as amended by section 37 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Both these Acts are UK legislation and both are reserved to Westminster. An additional time limit for the medical termination of pregnancy was effectively imposed by the UK Medicines Control Agency in 1991 when it granted a product licence for an antiprogesterone drug to be used in the termination of pregnancy up to nine weeks gestation.</p>

  <p>Health boards have a duty to provide suitable treatment for the termination of the pregnancy of any resident woman who meets the requirements of the Abortion Act. All health boards are aware of the time limits.</p>

  <p>In the programme of proposals debated and agreed in Parliament on 27 January, we explained the exemption from making a contribution to tuition fees from academic year 2000-01 would only apply to Scottish domiciled and EU students attending Scottish institutions.</p>

  <p>In saying that I want to stress that no Scottish student studying in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will be worse off than under the present arrangements.</p>

  <p>We will, however, continue to examine this issue, and others that arise from our proposals, as the work on the detail of the new support scheme progresses.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-2268 by Sarah Boyack on 22 November 1999, whether it will explain the difference in the cost of providing cycling facilities on the Harthope Viaduct to Coatsgate section of the M74 and the cost of providing cycling facilities on the Millbank J12 to Parkhead section of the M74.</p>

  <p>The difference in cost is attributable to the longer length and more extensive works applicable to the Harthope Viaduct to Coatsgate section. In this case new carriageway construction was required to support the cycleway. Within the Millbank to Parkhead section the cycleway was formed on the disused carriageway of the old A74.</p>

  <p>Orders were made on 17 December 1999 which include the power to purchase land to permit a full connection of the existing A77, and thereby B764 Eaglesham Moor Road with the proposed M77 at Kingswell. However, if proposals can be confirmed to construct the Glasgow Southern Orbital at the same time as the M77, then the need for the south-facing slip roads may be reconsidered. In that case these slip roads will not be required at this junction as the strategic east-west traffic would no longer use the Moor Road. Local traffic would be able to use the south-facing slip roads at Fenwick.</p>

  <p>The SE is actively pursuing a range of measures designed to further its commitment to support the voluntary and community sector.</p>

  <p>These include: implementing the Compact across central government departments and agencies; attracting new forms of financial support; strengthening the council for voluntary service network; completing the local volunteer development agency network; increasing the number of people taking part in voluntary activities, supporting volunteering among young people; and reorganising administrative arrangements within the Executive to give voluntary sector issues a more strategic and high profile focus. On 31 January we launched a major consultation on the Active Communities Initiative and are holding a high level conference about it on 2 March.</p>
