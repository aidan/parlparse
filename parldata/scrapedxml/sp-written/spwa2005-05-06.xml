  <p><em>The Right Medicine: A Strategy for Pharmaceutical Care in Scotland</em> outlines the ways in which the Scottish Executive, the NHS and the pharmacy profession will work across the clinical and organisational boundaries to ensure that medicines are used both safely and effectively. This is being taken forward through the redesign of the hospital pharmacy service and the introduction of a new community pharmacy contract.</p>

  <p>Copies of the strategy are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 18835).</p>

  <p>The majority of ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) provision in Scotland, as elsewhere, is learner-centred. However, we recognise the benefits to employers of a highly skilled and flexible workforce, which includes fluent communication skills and improving English language skills where appropriate. There are a number of examples of provision which is closely linked to specific employers or sectors, such as work shadowing and &quot;into work&quot; programmes.</p>

  <p>Recent research on ESOL provision in Scotland, commissioned by the Scottish Executive, highlighted the merits of such close working between ESOL practitioners, employers and others. The research notes examples of successful schemes involving colleges, the Enterprise Networks, local authorities, Jobcentre Plus, and racial equality councils, and including funding from a number of sources, such as local enterprise companies, European Structural Funds and the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>A forthcoming consultation paper will set out a draft ESOL strategy for Scotland. Implicit in the paper&rsquo;s vision and principles will be the need for provision which supports learners into, and within, the workplace.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and NHS boards working with their partners are responsible for designing, providing and supporting mental health crisis services. Comprehensive information on the number of crisis centres by area and provider is not available centrally but will be held by individual local authorities and NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is supporting pilot projects across Scotland for different models of crisis prevention, support, evaluation and project management. Over &pound;576,000 has been made available since 2004 to support these initiatives.</p>

  <p>As part of the joint local implementation process for the 2003 act all local areas have been asked to involve their local partners in planning services this should include local service users.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has undertaken some specific consultation with services users in relation to the development of child and adolescent health services through HeadsUpScotland, and through commissioning Penumbra to consult with service users and their carers on the Child Health Support Group&rsquo;s recommendation for psychiatric in-patient services for children and young people. In addition, the Scottish Recovery Network, supported by the Scottish Executive, assists local authorities and their agency partners to promote well-being and social development as a key component of people&rsquo;s recovery from mental ill-health.</p>

  <p>The replacement of medical equipment, including CT scanners, is a matter for NHS boards. Capital is distributed to NHS boards by Arbuthnott Formula adjusted for cross boundary flows and weighted for the provision of regional specialities. This means that NHS boards can determine, based on their local knowledge or the local needs of the local area how this money should be spent.</p>

  <p>Record levels of capital funding are being made available to NHSScotland with &pound;426 million, &pound;458 million and &pound;532 million being provided in 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively. Within the capital provision available over this period, &pound;125 million has been specifically identified for the purchase/replacement of medical and diagnostic equipment. &pound;40 million has been made available in the current year with a further &pound;40 million and &pound;45 million distributed in 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Before deciding whether it would be appropriate to make such a designation, it would be necessary to consult every person to whom the order relates (or persons appearing to represent such persons). Issues would become apparent at that stage.</p>
