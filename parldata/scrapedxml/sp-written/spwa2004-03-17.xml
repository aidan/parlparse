  <p>The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 places a duty on local authorities to notify carers who appear to them to be eligible to have an assessment of their support needs as a carer, that they may be entitled to have such an assessment. The act also provides powers to require health boards to draw up NHS Carer Information Strategies that will set out how NHS staff will similarly inform carers of their right to an assessment. Executive guidance to the NHS on the format and content of NHS Carer Information Strategies will be available later this year. Authorities and boards must be able to demonstrate compliance with any legislative duties placed on them. The Executive is committed to monitoring the impact of its Carers Strategy, including the new legislative measures to support carers. From 2004-05 the Executive will be collecting data from local authorities on the numbers of carers&#8217; assessments being carried out. Other performance indicators and outcome measures will be developed in due course. These are expected to look at the time intervals between an assessment being requested, the assessment being carried out and the provision of services.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that respite care is an integral and central part of the range of health and social care services which should be available to service users and carers. Our Partnership Agreement reflects our firm commitment to develop respite provision across Scotland and over the last three years &#163;22 million has been provided to local authorities specifically to develop short break services. These resources are just part of the total resources available to local authorities. Authorities must decide, with other statutory bodies including health boards, how much to spend on respite provision. It is a matter for local authorities, working with other agencies and with users and carers, to make decisions on respite provision for individuals. All local authorities have complaints procedures in place to address any concerns users and carers may have about care management or service planning and delivery decisions.</p>

  <p>Advice and information on the risks from injecting come from several sources, eg needle exchange workers, medical practitioners and written materials. It is not, therefore, possible to quantify aggregate expenditure on these activities.</p>

  <p>Through our Know the Score Drugs Communications Strategy, written materials on preventing initiation into injecting, hepatitis B and hepatitis C have been disseminated widely to drugs and prison services across Scotland. These materials highlight the risks of transmitting blood-borne viruses through injecting.</p>

  <p>We are also considering the recommendations from a recent research study by the University of Paisley which observed injecting practices among a group of drug users.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any supervised injecting rooms in Scotland, and we have no plans to support such facilities.</p>

  <p>Although injecting rooms are available in some other countries, current evaluation evidence is not particularly robust.

  <p>A Partnership for a Better Scotland makes clear the Executive&#8217;s commitment to ensuring public services are designed around the needs of individuals.</p>

  <p>Community engagement is a key part of the community planning process. Communities Scotland are developing national standards to improve the way communities, including older people, can influence the planning and delivery of services. The standards are being developed from a series of focus groups, which include one aimed specifically at older people. One of the principles underpinning the standards is that fairness, equality and inclusion must underpin all aspects of community engagement. This should help ensure that older people are effectively engaged. The detail of how engagement is taken forward is a matter for community planning partnerships depending on local circumstances.</p>

  <p>The findings of the research Involving Older People: Lessons for Community Planning have been widely circulated to service planners and providers and were the focus of a conference organised by COSLA on 1 December 2003. This was designed to raise awareness and disseminate good practice supplementing the guidance referred to above.</p>

  <p>The Health White Paper, <em>Partnership for Care</em>, is explicit that looking at services from a patient&#8217;s point of view should be a key driver of change in the Health Service. Patient Focus and Public Involvement (PFPI) aims to ensure all patient and public groups are considered in NHS service planning as appropriate, taking full account of equality and diversity issues such as age, religion/faith, race/ethnicity, sexuality, disability and gender. Draft guidance to ensure that the public are informed, engaged and consulted on all policies and services developed by the Health Department and NHSScotland has recently been distributed to NHS board chief executives and other key stakeholders for final comment. This guidance takes account of equality issues, including age.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive consulted a wide range of trade associations and other organisations before the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 were made.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000, whether it is appropriate for pelagic fish processing factories that operate for around six months of the year to meet the full cost of a Scottish Environment Protection Agency licence/permit and the cost of annual renewals of that licence/permit.</p>

  <p>The level of charges for permits issued by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is based on the cost of processing applications. In the case of an application for a permit under the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000, the resources required to determine the application are exactly the same irrespective of whether the site operates for only part of the year. Both the application fee and annual subsistence charges are based on average costs within the relevant industrial sector.</p>

  <p>Following the publication of the report of the HIV Health Promotion Strategy Review Group in January 2001, the Executive increased the resources available to NHS boards by &#163;2 million annually, to assist their work to prevent the spread of HIV and other bloodborne viruses. The allocation in 2003-04 is &#163;8.12 million. Boards use these resources to fund measures to address a range of issues relating to HIV in their areas.</p>

  <p>Expenditure on treatment and care services for those suffering from HIV is a matter for individual boards to determine within their general funding allocations, which increased by a minimum of 7.4% across boards in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Local authorities also have a key role in supporting those suffering from HIV. Substantial additional resources for community care have been allocated in the local government finance settlement to 2005-06.</p>

  <p>The Executive also provides some &#163;500,000 to a range of voluntary organisations responding to the challenges posed by bloodborne viruses, particularly HIV and hepatitis C.</p>

  <p>The &#163;6.8 million annual allocation continues within individual authorities&#8217; grant aided expenditure resources, and we expect authorities to continue to use these resources for drug rehabilitation services.

  <p>We recognise the problems at local level which are identified and highlighted in the report. To address these issues we will consider the recommendations on management information carefully and discuss with NHS boards how improvements can be made. The strategic planning of medical equipment requirements is one of a number of components integral to the planning of sustainable clinical services. A requirement for NHS boards to identify capital investment on medical equipment as part of the financial information to support local health plans is being introduced from 1 April 2004 and as a follow up to the Audit Scotland report all NHS boards will be asked to respond to the recommendations made and detail what action they propose to take to comply with the recommendations.</p>

  <p>There may be potential benefits in expanding the role of the National Clinical Assessment Authority (NCAA) to provide its services in Scotland. However, the Scottish Executive is currently undertaking a consultation on the document <em>Safer for</em> <em>Patients, Supportive for Professionals</em> : <em>A Framework for Managing Poor Performance of Health Professionals and Team in NHS Scotland.</em></p>

  <p>In the consultation paper, respondees have been asked to consider a number of potential options including the extension of the National Clinical Assessment Authority&#8217;s remit in relation to Scotland. The NCAA currently only deals with doctors and dentists which is inconsistent with the multi-professional and team approach to all workforce development and performance in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s National Planning Policy Guideline 6 and Planning Advice Note 45 ensure that our commitment to exploiting the environmental and economic benefits of renewable energy is pursued in tandem with natural and built heritage obligations and community interests. The policy principle is that developments should be accommodated where the technology can operate efficiently and environmental impacts can be addressed satisfactorily.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the Section 36 consents process is available on the Scottish Executive website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/enterprise/energy" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/enterprise/energy</a></p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) does not itself have powers of prosecution. SEPA&#8217;s role is to enforce various environmental protection legislation for which it is the regulator, for example by issuing notices requiring certain works to be undertaken, to investigate cases where it suspects breaches of licence or notice conditions and to recommend prosecution to the Procurator Fiscal where appropriate.</p>

  <p>Decisions on whether to prosecute those who breach environmental legislation are entirely matters for the Crown Office and the Procurators Fiscal Service.</p>

  <p>Skills training programmes are operated by Group Training Associations which are funded by Seafish. While I am aware that Seafish has asked a consultant to look into aspects of the Group Training Association functions, I am not aware that the Executive has received representations in respect of their viability.</p>
