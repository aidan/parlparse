  <p>As announced by the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice, in the answer given to question S1W-21207 on 19 <sup> </sup> December 2001, an additional &#163;3 million per annum will be made available for the provision of money advice. This additional funding is intended to enhance local availability of money advice. It will be targeted on improving front-line services.</p>

  <p>It is envisaged that this money will be made available through local authorities. As local authorities currently provide the majority of funding for local money advice provision, this has the advantage of building on existing structures and is the best way of ensuring that resources are available quickly.</p>

  <p>We will consult COSLA on the distribution of additional resources between all local authorities, taking account of relevant factors such as additional outcomes to be secured. The decision on allocations to local authorities will be made by Scottish Executive ministers.</p>

  <p>We envisage that local authorities will involve local providers in the planning and decision-making process. However, consultation is ultimately a matter for local authorities who are best placed to assess local needs.</p>

  <p>Support for front-line money advisers, such as training, is currently available from existing national organisations, in particular Money Advice Scotland and Citizens Advice Scotland. The Executive is at present considering whether, given the planned expansion of services, greater support is needed for money advice workers.</p>

  <p>A wide range of health statistics are published by the Information and Statistics Division of the Common Services Agency for NHSScotland (ISD Scotland). All ISD Scotland publications are now placed on the ISD Scotland website; the website now contains more information than was previously presented in <i>Scottish Health Statistics</i> . Although in future <i>Scottish Health Statistics</i> will not continue as a specific publication, the contents page will be retained and used as one of the indexes for the rest of the ISD Scotland website.</p>

  <p>As part of ongoing reviews of published health statistics in Scotland, which include consultation with major users of health statistics, it is possible that the content and format of the statistics that previously formed Chapter M (Hospital and Clinical Activity) of <i>Scottish Health Statistics</i> will be revised. Any resulting changes will be clearly explained on the relevant webpages.</p>

  <p>The release dates for ISD Scotland publications for the month of March 2002 will be placed on the following websites on 28 February 2002:</p>

  <p>Trunk roads are defined as nationally important routes that serve destinations of importance to industry, commerce, agriculture and tourism. As such the 1996 <i>Shaping the Trunk Road Network</i> report designated the A95 a trunk road in view of its importance to the economically productive Strath Spey valley industries (including the whisky industry) and in order to provide a gateway to the fishing centres along the Moray coast.</p>

  <p>Note: In considering deaths from suicide it is usual to add deaths where it is undetermined whether an injury was accidentally or purposely inflicted.</p>

  <p>Overall totals are given in Table 1.</p>

  <p>Table 2 covers suicide and self-inflicted injury.</p>

  <p>Table 3 covers injury undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of attempted suicides in the community is not available centrally. However, an estimate of the number of attempted suicides can be obtained from hospital discharge records. In 2000 there were 11,644 people admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of &quot;suicide/self-inflicted injury&quot;. For comparison, the figures for 1981 and 1991 were 8,570 and 9,022 respectively.</p>

  <p>Road congestion imposes significant costs on business and the wider economy. The 1999 Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment report, <i>Transport and the Economy</i> , acknowledged the fact that traffic congestion can act as a constraint on economic growth, but noted that the linkages between transport and the economy are complex.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-22821 on 20 February 2002. The consortia tendering for the Katrine Water Project were not asked to provide proposals for new treatment works.</p>

  <p>As part of the tendering exercise each consortia were asked to apply rates to a bill of quantities for a hypothetical generic works. The purpose of this was only to directly compare commercial tender rates and to give guidance rates for the later calculation of a target price.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water, and I have asked the Chief Executive to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The preferred option became a firm proposal when the planning application was submitted. Prior to this Katrine Water Project was very proactive in communicating with statutory and non-statutory consultees. In total 71 statutory and non-statutory consultees were contacted. Consultations began as early as March 2000 as part of the Babtie Mott Strategic Review. As the project developed, meetings were held with the major consultees and presentations were given. Initially this was to explain the large numbers of options, then to seek their views about the short-listed options, and more recently to include for any concerns they had in the design and development of the preferred scheme. In addition, during the process of surveying possible sites and pipe routes, members of the project team and our land agents visited some 75 landowners, occupiers and tenants. A further consultation process was undertaken as part of their Environmental Impact Assessment by our consultants, ERM. They wrote to 62 bodies giving details of our proposals and seeking their comments.</p>

  <p>The project team has also met with and given presentations to, on several occasions, local community and interest groups including: Baldernock Community Council, Milngavie Community Council, the Mugdock Association, Strathblane Community Council and the Baldernock Amenity Society.</p>

  <p>In August 2001, once the preferred scheme had been identified, a website (<a href="http://www.katrinewaterproject.com/" target="_blank">www.katrinewaterproject.com</a>) was established and a caravan display taken to the Milngavie and Baldernock areas. It was exhibited over a continuous period of 26 days and received nearly 3,000 visitors. Comment sheets were available. Those completed showed no disapproving comments on the detail of the initial proposal itself. Some asked for information on other options considered and most raised concerns on aspects of project implementation.</p>

  <p>Following the caravan initiative, public meetings were held in Balmore and Milngavie on 29 and 30 August to explain the project proposals, respond to queries and seek feedback. To satisfy requests for further information on the site selection process, a third meeting was held on 26 September. At that meeting further documentation was handed out which gave cost comparisons and explained how the data previously given out had been used to come to the preferred option.</p>

  <p>Since the planning application was submitted, material relating to the submission has been displayed at six local venues where members of the project team have been available to explain the proposals to anyone interested.</p>

  <p>At all stages the various public meetings and displays have been publicised in the local press and by widespread distribution of posters.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water, and I have asked the Chief Executive to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The construction of the works associated with the Katrine Water Project cannot commence until East Dunbartonshire Council (EDC) grants planning approval. The work must be constructed, commissioned and supply drinking water to the Glasgow distribution system by December 2005 in order to comply with drinking water quality regulations.</p>

  <p>If EDC grants planning approval, and Scottish ministers grant listed building approval by June this year, the construction work should be completed by mid-summer 2005.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water, and I have asked the Chief Executive to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Any delay in the approvals process will have an adverse financial impact on the Katrine water Project.</p>

  <p>Planning was submitted to East Dunbartonshire Council in November and the statutory approval/decision period is four months, i.e. until mid-March 2002. Thereafter there is a 28-day period for Scottish ministers to give listed building approval bringing us to mid-April.</p>

  <p>A delay of greater than four to six weeks will inconvenience the excavation operations which rely on better weather for their efficiency. This means that more muck would be shifted in the winter months resulting in increased operation times and costs.</p>

  <p>Should a planning inquiry be deemed necessary, the consequent delays and costs are a larger order of magnitude. Our best advice is that an inquiry cannot be carried out in less than one year and is more likely to take 18 to 24 months. Direct costs of such an enquiry could easily be in the order of &#163;2.5 to &#163;3 million. Consequential increased construction costs resulting from the delay could bring this figure up to &#163;10 million.</p>
