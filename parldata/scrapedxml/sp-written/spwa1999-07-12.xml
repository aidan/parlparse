  <p>The Scottish Executive has carefully considered the evidence which exists from other countries on the effect of bans on tobacco advertising and sponsorship on tobacco consumption. Such evidence was assessed in the 1992 Department of Health (Economic and Operational Research Division) publication &#145; <i>Effect of Tobacco Advertising on Tobacco Evidence</i> : <i>A Discussion Document Reviewing The Evidence</i> &#146;. The evidence from countries which had introduced bans indicated a significant effect. In each case, the banning of advertising was followed by a fall in smoking on a scale which could not reasonably be attributed to other anti-smoking measures in operation in these countries such as increased health education and tighter restrictions on sales of tobacco to young people.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will lay regulations before the Scottish Parliament introducing a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship. The terms of the draft regulations are currently subject to UK-wide consultations. Under these proposals, the ban on tobacco advertising would come into force on 10 December this year and tobacco sponsorship in line with EU deadlines outlined in the EU Directive 98/43/EC dated 6 July 1998 The consultation period comes to an end on 13 August and Scottish regulations will be tabled shortly thereafter. A parallel set of regulations covering the rest of the UK will be laid at Westminster on a similar timescale.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in view of the appalling death of 3 year old Natalie Smith of Easterhouse in a window fall and the injuring of up to 250 other children in Scotland in similar accidents each year, it intends to request all Local Authorities in Scotland to commence immediate window-catch safety checks and consult with child experts on the safest type of windows.</p>

  <p>The Scottish building regulations do not require safety catches on all windows because research has indicated that more deaths would occur in fires where occupants are unable to escape than would be saved by having the types of catches presently available. The latest information on the subject, the result of Scottish Office commissioned research, was sent to all local authorities in June 1998. The British Standards institution is currently revising BS 8213 which deals with window safety and a draft for public comment was issued on 28 May 1999. The public comment period ends on 31 August 1999 and depending on the number and complexity of the comments received it is hoped that the final version of the British Standard will be published next summer. We will then consider incorporating its recommendations into the building regulations. However, most local authorities will fit child proof safety catches when parents request them.</p>

  <p>We announced on 30 June our intention to legislate to abolish the feudal system substantially along the lines recommended by the Scottish Law Commission in its recent report (Scot Law Com 168). This report recommends that the rights of superiors should be abolished. However it also recommends that where a superior disposed of land substantially below market value for a specific purpose, then there should be the possibility of compensation in the event that the land is freed for development. Compensation would reflect land values at the time of sale rather than current market values and should therefore cause local authorities little expense.</p>

  <p>In Scotland a different but no less innovative approach to community regeneration has been adopted to that being pursued in England. Our approach reflects particular Scottish needs and circumstances. It is guided by the principle, which has been established in Scotland for a number of years, that regeneration is best achieved through broadly based partnerships in which the local community plays a full role.</p>

  <p>Resources dedicated to regenerating communities in Scotland over this and the next two years include:</p>

  <p>&pound;137 million for 47 Social Inclusion Partnerships to tackle disadvantage and exclusion in deprived communities and amongst excluded groups.</p>

  <p>&pound;10 million for the Working for Communities programme, providing additional support for new ways of giving local people more influence over the delivery of local services;</p>

  <p>&pound;3 million for the Listening to Communities programme, sharing best practice on involving the community in regeneration and providing training to support community participation.</p>

  <p>&pound;26 million for New Community Schools, which is a radical initiative in Scotland to modernise schools, raise attainment and promote social inclusion, the focus of which is on the pupil and his or her family - addressing needs in the round.</p>

  <p>This investment should be seen in the context of our wider commitment that tackling social exclusion will be a priority of all Ministers in the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Most schools are situated adjacent to local roads. Local authorities have power to set speed limits outside schools (and elsewhere) on local roads. In particular, local authorities have the freedom to set 20 mph limits where they consider them to be appropriate. For other limits below 30 mph, local authorities require to obtain the consent of the Scottish Ministers. Scottish Ministers have power to set speed limits outside schools (and elsewhere) on trunk roads in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will continue to promote road safety measures aimed at road users of all ages. Specific measures in relation to school children include:</p>

  <p>Guidance on safer routes to school projects will be issued later this year;</p>

  <p>The issue of road user charging will be addressed in the forthcoming Transport Bill. No decision has been made on the introduction of road user charges on any trunk road or motorway. Accordingly, there is no such proposal.</p>

  <p>&pound;15 million additional capital allocations are being made available from the previous Transport Challenge Fund competition for projects commencing in 1997-98 to assist The City of Edinburgh Council with their CERT scheme. The current phasing of the award is 1997-98 - &pound;4.0 million, 1998-99 - &pound;6.0 million, 1999-2000 - &pound;3.750 million and 2000-01 - &pound;1.250 million. The Council is also seeking private finance for the project which is estimated to cost approximately &pound;49 million. The project is the responsibility of the Council and the implementation programme is a matter for them. I understand the project is expected to be completed in late autumn 2001.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to undertake such a study. However, the Forestry Commission is looking at possible alternative routes for lorries taking timber from Whitelee Forest, starting next year. The Commission is carefully considering all aspects, including the impact of timber traffic on existing roads and its effect on any communities alongside the roads, and it is also discussing the options with the local authority.</p>

Parliament staff are presently preparing a specification for a waste management service which will include recycling facilities for waste paper, cardboard, aluminium cans, plastic cups and where possible glass and other plastics. It is hoped that recycling arrangements will be in place by the end of the summer at which time recycling receptacles will be positioned throughout the Parliamentary complex.

  <p>All waste from Parliament buildings is disposed at landfill by City of Edinburgh Council. Facilities Management are currently preparing a specification for a waste management contract which will include recycling facilities for waste paper, cardboard, aluminium cans, plastic cups and where possible glass and other plastics.</p>

  <p>At present there are no figures available on the quantities of waste from Parliament buildings. The specification for the waste management contract will require the contractor to provide data on quantities of each waste material recycled and disposed at landfill. In additional, we require to put in place procedures for quantifying materials purchased for use within Parliament buildings. Only when these 2 elements have been established can we look at setting targets for reducing the percentage of waste to landfill and increasing the percentage of waste materials recycled.</p>

  <p>It is hoped that at the end of the summer a waste management contract will be in place and relevant data can begin to be gathered. It will be next year before we can establish a baseline figure for waste and therefore set realistic waste management targets.</p>
