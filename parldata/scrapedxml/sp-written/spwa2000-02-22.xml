  <p>In an emergency a GP is required to render whatever services are in the best interest of any patient on the GP's list. The GP is required to provide treatment other than at the practice premises if the patient's condition is such that in the GP's reasonable opinion it would not be appropriate for the patient to attend there.</p>

  <p>For a person not on his or her list, in an emergency a GP is required - on request and if available - to provide treatment immediately required.</p>

  <p>These requirements are part of the Terms of Service for General Practitioners as set out in Schedule 1 to the National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995, as amended.</p>

  <p>In addition, the General Medical Council has issued guidance to doctors which indicates that, in an emergency, a doctor must offer anyone at risk the treatment which the doctor could reasonably be expected to provide.</p>

  <p>I am determined that there be a further reduction in the use of bank and agency nurses. Those Trusts responsible for the heaviest use of bank and agency nurses are already in the process of introducing new practices to rectify the situation.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. In this context &quot;science&quot; is defined as those subjects included in physical sciences, biological sciences, and engineering and technology.</p>

  <p>2. The location of graduates who do not obtain permanent employment is not captured by this survey.</p>

  <p>3. The survey assumes that the employment and destination profile of graduates who responded to the survey questionnaire is representative of the survey cohort as a whole in order to produce the estimated number and percentage who obtained permanent employment overseas.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-222 by Donald Dewar on 9 August, whether it will define, describe and elucidate the nature of the specialism of each of its Special Advisers and whether such specialisms exist within the civil service.</p>

  <p>Special Advisers are not appointed as subject specialists but to give broad advice, including political advice, to Ministers on the development of Government policy and its effective implementation. The specialist nature of their role is that it encompasses the giving of political advice which is not a function of the impartial civil service.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made in pursuing the award of a grant from the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority to assist in upgrading the Kilmarnock-Glasgow railway and whether it will allow the A77/M77 upgrade to proceed on schedule, even in the event of any slippage in the upgrading of the railway line.</p>

  <p>The upgrading of the Kilmarnock-Glasgow railway line is not the subject of an application for an award of grant from the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority. However, I understand that Railtrack have concluded a feasibility study on behalf of Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority (SPTA) to identify the infrastructure work required to upgrade the line. The study is currently being considered by the SPTA.</p>

  <p>This possible project will not affect the timetable for proceeding with the upgrade of the A77/M77.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament Information Centre is currently compiling a report from the electronic voting data which are recorded in its <i>Scottish Parliament</i> <i>Profiles</i> <i>(SPP)</i> database. It will include details of MSPs&#8217; participation in electronically recorded votes since 1 July 1999, and will be updated monthly. The first report will be completed shortly, and will be made available on the parliamentary Intranet (SPEIR) and on the website. Information about cross-party voting cannot be compiled comprehensively without disproportionate cost, but when the browser interface for SPP is available on SPEIR, Intranet users will be able to construct such searches for themselves. The browser interface should be available within the next few months. <br /></p>
