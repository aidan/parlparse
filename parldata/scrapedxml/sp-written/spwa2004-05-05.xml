  <p>Veterinary surveillance is an integral part of the Animal Health and Welfare Strategy and the Scottish Executive has worked with the other UK administrations to create the UK Surveillance Strategy. This was published in October 2003 after extensive consultation with farming, veterinary and other stakeholders. The ten-year strategy will help to deliver earlier warning of disease threats, prioritise surveillance activities and make better use of the data collected. Building on partnerships between data producers, it will help enhance dissemination of information to the industry, to inform their own decision making.</p>

The Executive commissions SAC to provide veterinary surveillance services at an approximate cost of &#163;2.5 million per annum. In addition, SAC&#8217;s laboratory services will be enhanced in June 2004 with the opening of a new diagnostic facility in Dumfries which has been funded primarily by the Executive.

  <p>As set out in the answer to question S2W-7038 UK Health Departments are advised by a number of expert committees on matters relating to vaccination and immunisation and their advice, which has full regard to issues of safety and effectiveness is, and will continue to be, reflected in the childhood vaccination programme.</p>

  <p>Infranrix is the brand name of the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis) vaccine, currently licensed for use in the UK. The alternative, recommended, vaccine is DTwP (diphtheria, tetanus and wholecell pertussis) which contains thiomersal. Protection against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis is currently recommended for babies at two, three and four months and, when administered, the vaccine used is generally combined with a Hib vaccine to protect infants against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease.</p>

  <p>Based on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), UK Health Departments currently recommend DTwP-Hib vaccine, for primary immunisation at 2, 3 and 4 months, as part of the childhood immunisation programme. This is because it has been demonstrated to give more effective protection against whooping cough (pertussis) than the DTaP-Hib alternative. Scientific evidence shows that the combined DTwP-Hib is more efficacious against Hib disease than DTaP-Hib, which provides lower immunity against Hib disease.</p>

  <p>Where a child has a valid contraindication to DTwP, current advice is that he or she should be given DTaP and separate Hib vaccines at the same time but in different limbs. General Practitioners (GPs) are aware that any final decision about immunisation of a child requires the informed consent of a parent or guardian. In that process, it is appropriate for GPs to make available information on why a particular product is recommended, while recognising that it is open to parents to request, and doctors to provide, an alternative vaccine, which is licensed in the UK and available through the NHS.</p>

  <p>Maritime security is a reserved matter, and the Scottish Executive is in close contact with the Department for Transport&#39;s Transport Security Directorate (TRANSEC) which is responsible for maritime counter-terrorist security policy.</p>

  <p>The UK already has a comprehensive maritime security regime in place that is regulated in accordance with the Aviation and Maritime Act 1990 and this will be used, where appropriate, as the foundation of a new National Maritime Security Programme (NMSP). A cornerstone of the NMSP is the introduction of the new International Maritime Organisation (IMO) International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code. The ISPS Code applies to all port facilities serving passenger ships and cargo ships over 500gt engaged on international voyages.</p>

  <p>In the UK, the cost of meeting these security requirements falls to industry. The &quot;user pays&quot; principle has been maintained throughout the country&#8217;s history of regulating transport security, and costs are ultimately passed on to customers. It is not therefore possible to give an indication of costs because they are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, as part of the implementation process of the IMO&#8217;s new maritime security regime, TRANSEC is conducting a Regulatory Impact Assessment which will, when complete, provide a broad picture of the costs associated with meeting the UK&#8217;s new security requirements.</p>

  <p>The European Commission has also proposed a regulation to ensure consistent application and implementation of the IMO requirements, which the UK supports. The Department for Transport is also currently consulting on the proposal for an EC Directive on enhancing port security.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not collate divergence of costs of a PPP project from Outline Business Case stage to outturn. Executive funding for PPP projects is capped. It is for the public sector body concerned to monitor the divergence of costs between outline business case and outturn and to ensure that the project remains affordable at contract close. Once financial close is reached, the annual payments to the private sector consortium are fixed and only increased by an inflation index, unless changes are made to the original contract.</p>

  <p>We are aware of a few examples of share transactions in PPP companies following the initial contract. Such transactions can play a useful role in re-cycling capital for other projects, and bringing in new investors. Continuity of service is provided by the consortium.

  <p>The enactment of the Energy Bill will have no immediate impact on the Executive&#8217;s functions within the territorial sea as we already have powers to consent proposals under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 within these waters.

  <p>The Executive will shortly be granting the Scottish Aquaculture Research Forum (SARF) &#163;100,000 towards its operating and research costs for 2004-05. The SARF was formally established in April 2004 and enjoys representation from a wide range of stakeholders, as well as having an independent chair. The SARF promotes, encourages and supports research and development into aquaculture and related activities. The formation of the SARF was one of the 33 priorities for action contained within the Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture.</p>

  <p>The overall number of care home places fell slightly between 2002 and 2003 (by 1.6%). However, over the same time period the number of people receiving care in their own homes increased (by 4 per cent) and the number of hours of home care services provided by local authorities also increased (by 11 per cent).</p>

  <p>This reflects a continuing shift in the balance of service provision towards more care at home.</p>

  <p>A road safety research report looking at sleepiness as a factor in road accidents was published by the UK Government in 2001. The report suggests that sleep could be a factor in a tenth of all road accidents across the whole of the road network and up to 20% on &quot;monotonous&quot; roads, especially motorways.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the Stats 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>The Stats 19 returns do not record the causes of the accidents. Under a pilot scheme, 14 police forces across Great Britain have been voluntarily submitting information on contributory factors to accidents along with their Stats 19 returns. However, it is not possible to use the pilot contributory factor data to provide figures which are representative of accidents in Scotland because only two police forces in Scotland took part in the scheme. I understand that the UK Government is analysing the pilot data and will publish an article later in the year.</p>

  <p>Starting in January 2005, the pilot scheme will be replaced by a new set of questions on contributory factors, which will form an integral part of the Stats 19 injury road accident reporting system. Information about contributory factors should thereafter be supplied by all police forces for personal injury accidents which are reported either (a) following attendance at the scene by a police officer or (b) by a member of the public to police staff at a police station.</p>

  <p>The first three year review of the GB road safety strategy <em>Tomorrow&#8217;s Roads &#8211; safer</em> <em>for everyone</em> was published on 7 April. The review reports that considerable research has been undertaken by the Department for Transport to increase understanding of the risks associated with falling asleep at the wheel. This work is continuing and has helped influence publicity campaigns to raise awareness amongst drivers of the dangers of driving while tired and the need to take regular breaks. Campaigns started in August 2000 and have included leaflets, posters, TV and radio advertising. In addition motorway variable message signs and truck backs have been used to carry the &quot;Don&#8217;t Drive Tired&quot; message directly to drivers on the road. Copies of the review are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32399).</p>

  <p>The National Public Mental Health Resource was launched in December 2002 (at the same time as Choose Life) by the Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS). The key objectives are to collect and disseminate up to date evidence and good practice in relation to suicide prevention and other areas of work. The resource can be found at www.hebs.com/suicideprevention.</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued to all local authorities and their Community Planning Partners in June 2003 on the implementation of Choose Life.</p>

  <p>Guidance on priority groups was prepared for consideration at the first National Support Network meeting in November 2003. Since then, further work has been undertaken on the guidance material to produce a toolkit resource, for use nationally and locally. This toolkit will help provide guidance on priority groups, in particular children and young people.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, Cruse Bereavement Care are being funded by the National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well-Being to produce a video called &quot;Living with Suicide&quot; and supporting resource materials, on coping with bereavement following a suicide. These will be launched later in the year.</p>

  <p>The National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well-Being is working with the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Scotland to provide guidance for people working in the media on the reporting and representation of mental health and suicide. The NUJ plan to launch this guidance later this year.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, Samaritans published a helpful guide in June 2002 for the media to use when reporting suicide. The guidelines, which are available electronically via Samaritans&#8217; website &#8211; www.samaritans.org/know/media_guide.shtm, are aimed at those reporting suicide in any media from factual description to dramatic portrayal. The guidelines outline suicide facts, media myths, signs of suicide risk and recommend phrases to use when referring to suicide.</p>

  <p>The establishment of a national capacity for collection of data on suicide will be a key task for the National Information Manager for Choose Life. This post is one of the Choose Life National Implementation Support Team posts to be recruited shortly, and to which I referred in the answer given to question S2W-7698.

  <p>The Mental Health Research Team in the Health Department Analytical Services Division is developing a research and evaluation strategy to support the National Programme. A major part of this work is focused on the actions laid out in <em>Choose Life &#8211; a National Strategy and Action Plan</em> . The first version of the strategy was published on &quot;Well on the Web&quot; in January 2004, and will be updated regularly.</p>

  <p>A three-stage process has been adopted by the team to ensure that the evidence base relating to suicide and suicidal behaviour is reliable, comprehensive and able to inform practice at national and local levels. A scoping exercise was commissioned in January (stage 1) to explore the interests and areas of expertise of those centres and individuals focusing on suicide-related research (nationally and internationally). Respondents are invited to contribute to establishing the territory and focus of a series of reviews to collate the existing evidence base on research relating to suicide and suicidal behaviour, and to identify gaps (stage 2). The scoping exercise will be completed in June and the report will be published by September 2004. The reviews will be commissioned later in the year. Once reliable evidence to suggest gaps in information has been established, primary research will be commissioned (stage 3).</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued to each local area in June 2003. This set out the requirements on local areas to produce a local suicide prevention action plan by the end of December 2003. All local action plans have now been submitted, and have since been assessed by the Head of Implementation for Choose Life.</p>

  <p>Individual meetings have been held with all 32 local suicide prevention representatives. Local actions will be subject to further monitoring and performance management. This work will be undertaken by the Head of Implementation and the National Implementation Support Team.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, an independent evaluation is being commissioned by the Scottish Executive to assess the impact of the first phase of the Choose Life Strategy and Action Plan. This evaluation will report in 2006.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify which, nor how many, local self-help groups have been established as a result of Choose Life. Each local action plan addresses support for local self-help groups. Guidance to local areas, which was issued in June 2003, made clear that an element of local Choose Life funds is to be used to help establish and maintain local self-help groups. This is one of the aspects which the National Programme will be monitoring.</p>

  <p>Guidance to local areas, which was issued in June 2003, identified the development of local multi-agency training as a priority area. Each local area action plan addresses how local training is to be taken forward.</p>

  <p>In addition to local training work, a national training strategy is currently being developed for Choose Life. The first element of this is the introduction of a community-based training course first developed in Alberta, Canada called Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST). ASIST is a training and capacity building programme to help develop a long-term sustainable infrastructure for suicide prevention. The training enables participants to be ready, willing and able to provide emergency first-aid to persons at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p>

  <p>ASIST is by far the most widely used, acclaimed and researched suicide intervention skills training in the world. It has been refined over a period of 20 years with feedback from over 400,000 participants and 2,000 active trainers worldwide. Links have been established between Choose Life in Scotland and Living Works Education, a highly respected training organisation based in Alberta, Canada, which developed the ASIST training.</p>

  <p>From April 25 till May 7 2004, two 1 - week ASIST training programmes are being held in Scotland; one in West Lothian and one in Glasgow. Forty-eight individuals from around Scotland are being trained to become ASIST trainers. This is the first wave of training ASIST instructors in Scotland and further courses are planned.</p>

  <p>Forest Enterprise, Scotland currently has 13.5 kilometres of electric fencing along boundaries in three locations, Mull, Glen Prosen and Rannoch. In two areas Mull and Glen Prosen they are regarded as temporary measures to be used until agreement is reached on the erection of conventional fencing along mutual boundaries. In Rannoch the electric fence is being used to strengthen an existing conventional fence to protect woodland from red deer incursion during periods of heavy snowfall.</p>

  <p>Electric fencing is used on private estates. However, there is no Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme support for the erection of this type of fence.</p>

  <p>The Forestry Commission produced a Research Information Note (Number 206) in 1992 on the use of electric fences following two year trials in Argyll and the North of England. The project identified that electric fencing is not such an effective barrier to red and roe deer as conventional line and wire mesh fencing. Roe deer in particular are very resistant to electric current. There have been a number of more recent reports that have reached similar conclusions.</p>

  <p>The Deer Commission Scotland (DCS) is aware of this information and is currently working with Forestry Commission Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department to produce a joint policy statement on deer fencing. Once published, this will be made available in Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. What internal documents DCS have is a matter for the Commission and this information is not held centrally.</p>
