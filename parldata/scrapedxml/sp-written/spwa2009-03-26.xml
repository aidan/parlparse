  <p>The Water of Leith Scheme was taken into account in the allocation of resources to the City of Edinburgh Council and included within the local government finance settlement for 2008 to 2011. It is entirely a matter for the council to allocate their total resources to meet local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>While some elements of the scheme have been constructed, I understand the council is currently evaluating the tenders submitted for the main works with a view to its construction over the next three years, starting in the summer. I wrote last month to the council asking them to keep us fully informed of the council&rsquo;s likely commitments in respect of this scheme for the next spending review.</p>

  <p>A fixed interest rate applies to loans provided to crofters under the former Crofters etc Building Grants &amp; Loans Scheme (CBGLS). From 27 May 1982 the applicable interest rate was 7% over a period of up to 40 years. The scheme was closed to new applicants on 31 December 2004, when it was replaced by the Croft House Grants Scheme (CHGS).</p>

  <p>CBGLS loans may be discharged without penalty. However, the Scottish Government is unable to provide a replacement loan under the present CHGS. We shall, however, consider this issue as part of the review of housing grants to rural areas which we announced in response to the recommendations of the Shucksmith Inquiry.</p>

  <p>It is unacceptable for people to make profits from others&rsquo; financial desperation. Illegal and extortionate money lending and the criminal behaviour that often goes with it is abhorrent in modern society.</p>

  <p>While the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which regulates money lending is reserved, the Scottish Government is doing what it can to tackle this trade.</p>

  <p>As the First Minister indicated on 19 March, we will be consulting shortly on adding illegal money lending to the list of specific offences that are deemed to be criminal lifestyle offences in Scotland under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.</p>

  <p>Our Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill contains important measures to help tackle serious organised crime, including new offences of involvement in or directing serious organised crime. The bill will also make it easier for the courts to impose non-harassment orders, improving the protection available to the victims of loan sharks.</p>

  <p><em>Building the Curriculum 3: A framework for learning and teaching</em> sets out the government&rsquo;s expectation that children and young people are entitled to two hours of quality physical education per week. This is in addition to physical activity and sport. The experiences and outcomes which support Curriculum for Excellence articulate what children are entitled to as they progress through the curriculum levels. In the early phase, the physical education strand of Health and Wellbeing will provide opportunities for children to develop movement skills, competencies and concepts in a number of ways including through practice and energetic play.</p>

We will continue to work with SEPA to identify further action it can take to contribute to Scotland&rsquo;s economic recovery.</p>
