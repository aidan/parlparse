  <p>Throughout the Angus area the Rapid Response Unit deployed to patients with chest pains will be either the Cardiac Response Unit (CRU) or an accident and emergency unit (AEU), both of which have the same thrombolytic capability. While the AEU is available on a 24-hour basis throughout the area, the CRU is only operational in an area that may broadly be described as to the north of Forfar and during peak times.</p>

  <p>We are committed to improving the educational attainment of looked-after children. By the end of this year we expect local authorities to ensure that looked-after children receive full-time education, that they have a care plan covering their educational needs, and that each school has a designated teacher to look after their interests. In 2001-02 we gave local authorities &#163;10 million to support the education of looked-after young people. The spending review allocated money to improving outcomes, including educational attainment, for looked-after children. This year we have collected information on the educational attainment of looked-after children for the first time and we have commissioned Who Cares? Scotland to survey looked-after children to find out about their experiences of education, what they want from education and how it can be inspired.</p>

  <p>There are two known sites for <i>Metrioptera brachyptera</i> (the bog bush-cricket) in Scotland. This species has been recorded in 2002 at Aucheninnes Moss/Little Cloak near Dalbeattie. There is also a record from the 1960s, for Raeburn Flow a SSSI/cSAC, near Kirkpatrick Fleming in Dumfries and Galloway.</p>

  <p>There is no UK Species Action Plan for the bog bush-cricket. The bog bush-cricket is listed as a Local Priority Species within the Dumfries and Galloway Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP), published June 1999. LBAPs encourage positive conservation management for species which are regionally or locally scarce but are not endangered on a UK level.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any sites on which bog bush-crickets have been recorded have been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) or receive protection under any other national or international legislation and, if no such sites have been designated, what directions or guidance it has provided to Scottish Natural Heritage in relation to site protection measures for this species and other rare invertebrate fauna.</p>

  <p>During the 1960s the bog bush-cricket was recorded at Raeburn Flow, a SSSI/cSAC. This is the only record on any SSSI in Scotland. The guidelines for the selection of a biological SSSI specify a number of criteria under which invertebrates may be "qualifying features" for SSSI designation. As it is not an endangered species in Great Britain, the bog bush-cricket is unlikely to be considered a "qualifying feature". There are no international protection measures in place for the bog bush-cricket.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage, as the Scottish Executive's Statutory Advisor implements the protection of rare invertebrate fauna through provision of guidance and direction. This includes the protection of species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, by SSSI and other designations and through UK and Local Biodiversity Action Plans.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers place much reliance on working with landowners and managers of land containing invertebrate species as an important aspect of their protection. Many of the threats to such species can be the absence of key features of their habitats so landowners and managers are well placed to provide the necessary habitats and food sources important to their survival.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued guidance in October 2001 which offered advice to local authorities and developers on the licensing arrangements which apply in cases where European Protected Species are presently on any site which is the subject of a development proposal. This guidance re-enforces the protective regime for the animal and plant species listed respectively in Schedule 2 and Schedule 4 to the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c) Regulations 1994.</p>

  <p>In order to secure a future for fishing communities, we need to safeguard the fish stocks on which they depend. The Scottish Executive takes very seriously the latest scientific advice that a substantial reduction in fish mortality is required if a collapse of key whitefish stocks is to be avoided. However, the Commission has accepted our argument that alternatives to closure must be sought. We shall continue to press hard for alternative measures that strike an appropriate balance between conservation of stocks and ensuring a sustainable fishing industry.</p>

  <p>The North Sea sandeel fishery is spread across the North Sea with the highest volume of landings reported from the area between 54 and 59 degrees latitude excluding the Wee Bankie area which has been closed to sandeel fishing since 2000 as a result of UK intervention. Few of the vessels involved in the sandeel fishery are Scottish, and the Scottish Executive does not hold data on the activity of foreign vessels that have not landed into Scotland.</p>

  <p>Marine environments are complex systems of multiple interactive influences including food chains, predation and human activities including fishing. The precise effects of any single influence are therefore not known although it is recognised that there is some whitefish by-catch. Monitoring of this fishery is conducted through the normal logbook requirements; a scientific sampling plan applies for the small-scale scientific fishery in the Wee Bankie box.</p>

  <p>Measures to reduce effort in all fisheries that result in increased mortality rates of cod are under serious consideration. These include the sandeel fishery. It should be noted that the most effective means of reducing whitefish by-catch in this fishery appears to be by reduction of fishing effort and not by the introduction of additional technical conservation measures. The UK has previously expressed concerns about the effects of industrial fishing and has signalled to the Commission and to member states its determination to see a reduction in the sandeel TAC for 2003 to ensure that allowable catches of whitefish stocks will be prioritised for human consumption.</p>

However, the average over this period is &#163;600,000 a year. A total of &#163;3,140,256 from all sources, both public and private, has been spent on acquisitions.</p>

  <p>Over the last five years (i.e. since 1997) the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art has acquired 441 works. Of these, well over a half, 267, are by artists who are Scottish or who live in Scotland. Three hundred and eleven of the total number of acquisitions have been given to the gallery, and of those, 194 are works by Scottish artists.</p>

  <p>During this period the gallery spent &#163;613,520 on acquiring Scottish art. The value of Scottish art that it received as gifts was probably in excess of that figure.</p>

  <p>The funds used to acquire new works come from various sources including outside bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, the National Art Collections Fund and the Henry Moore Foundation. This came to &#163;1,014,244, a third of the total amount spent.</p>

  <p>All works acquired by the gallery must be able to stand up to being viewed in an international context. The collective judgement of the expert curators working at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, as well as broad professional opinion, inform these decisions. Significant acquisitions include &#163;1,050,000 on Mir&oacute;&#146;s masterpiece <i>Head of a Catalan Peasant</i> 1925, which the gallery bought together with the Tate Gallery, London, and the first instalment (&#163;316,667) towards the J&ouml;rg Schellmann Collection of Multiples by Joseph Beuys (an artist who had a close connection with Scotland and a major impact on Scottish artists) and a group of important paintings by the Scottish artist Alan Davie.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-31153 by Malcolm Chisholm on 12 November 2002, what the current monetary value is of the nursing and midwifery student bursary; whether this bursary level adequately provides for the living costs of nursing and midwifery students that receive the bursary; how many such students have received the bursary in each of the last three years; how many such students are currently receiving the bursary, and how much would it cost annually, based on current information, to replace the bursary with a salary system providing (a) &#163;10,000 and (b) &#163;15,000 per year.</p>

  <p>The Nursing and Midwifery Student Bursary scheme is demand-led but in 2001-02 cost &#163;35.7 million. A non-repayable bursary of &#163;5,430 (for students under 26 at the start of the course) or &#163;6,115 (for students over 26) is awarded to cover day-to-day living costs. The bursary has increased by 21% since 1998 and is supplemented by other allowances including single parents' allowance (currently &#163;1,100), an income assessed allowance for dependant children, excess costs for travel to placement and Disabled Students Allowance.</p>

  <p>Other health care students receive a partly income assessed package totalling &#163;3,980, including student loan, for their living cost support, plus other allowances where appropriate. Other students receive up to &#163;3,905, plus allowances.</p>

  <p>According to the data collected by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland, the number of students who have received bursaries in the current and previous three years is set out in the following table:</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="50%">
<tr><td width="38%" valign="TOP"> <p>Year</p></td><td width="62%" valign="TOP"> <p align="CENTER">Students</p></td></tr>

</table></p>

  <p>A salary of &#163;10,000 (which would be taxable) for each student would cost around &#163;86 million a year and a salary of &#163;15,000 would cost around &#163;130 million.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce publication today of this independent report which was prepared for the Scottish Executive by Philip Banks, an independent consultant.</p>

  <p>The remit of the review was to provide information on and evaluate local authority support for school boards; to identify the needs of school boards and headteachers in terms of finance and administration, initial and continuing training, availability of information, resources and role development; to evaluate the current contribution of key agencies to meeting school boards needs, and to identify key issues for future policy consideration.</p>

  <p>The report, in its own words &quot;does not propose a set of firm recommendations to address a list of neatly definable problems&quot;. Instead it &quot;suggests a process that may be set in motion to find practical proposals to ensure the future health of parental representation in Scottish Schools&quot; and emphasises how important it is that this review process should be both inclusive and consultative. I very much endorse these conclusions. Getting the balance and approach right for current and future generations of parents is not something that can be achieved on the basis of a limited investigation.</p>

  <p>Some of the report&#146;s findings relate to good practice. I have, therefore, already asked the Scottish School Board Association and the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland to consider developing guidance which could be issued to local authorities and school boards to improve good practice and ensure that boards are working in the most effective way.</p>

  <p>Other findings, relating to the report&#146;s more fundamental &quot;key issues for future policy consideration&quot; will need to be reviewed in the inclusive and consultative way the report suggests. Many of these issues relate to aspects of one of the main themes running through the responses to the National Debate on Education, namely how to improve communication between schools and parents and to involve parents more in their children&#146;s education. We shall indicate how these matters are to be taken forward when we publish our response to the national debate in the new year.</p>

  <p>A copy of the report will be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. It will also be available on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>Child poverty is defined not only by income, but also by children&#146;s ability to reach their potential. Social inclusion partnerships are assisting in the alleviation of child poverty by promoting a range of activities to encourage and empower communities; health projects; child care provision, and routes into employment and training.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to its letter to me of 11 November 2002, whether it is its intention to consult local authorities on the abolition of capital receipts set-aside rules as announced by the Minister for Social Justice in her ministerial statement on housing on 7 November 2002 or to abolish these rules as indicated by the Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services during the debate on quality of life later that day.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#146;s policy is as stated in the Minister for Social Justice&#146;s statement on 7 November. As a consequence of the move to the Prudential Regime, the capital receipts set-aside rules are unlikely to remain relevant and we will consult local authorities on the abolition of these rules.</p>

  <p>* Co-opted as new or replacement member</p>

  <p>Nominations for membership of the forum were received in early 2000 from over 60 individuals or organisations with expertise in special educational needs. From these ministers appointed 19 members to serve as members of the forum for three years. Ministers, subsequently, co-opted a further three members. The membership covers a broad range of SEN interests, including local authority and health agencies, teaching, learning support and educational psychology, parents, the independent and voluntary sectors, training providers and academic interests.</p>

  <p>Ministers will review the future work and membership of the forum in early 2003.</p>
