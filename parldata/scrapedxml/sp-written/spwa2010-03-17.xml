  <p>New guidance on the provision of equipment and adaptations was issued on 1 December 2009. This guidance aims to promote a consistent approach to assessment of need, and the provision of appropriate services, including equipment and adaptations to all care groups.</p>

  <p>The government is providing &pound;2.2 million over this, and the next, financial year to pilot seven &quot;one-stop-shop&quot; models of sensory impairment service delivery. One key aspect of the &quot;one-stop-shop&quot; is the provision of aids and equipment at a local level, with additional information and support on what aids are available and appropriate for someone.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued new guidance on the provision of equipment and adaptations by NHS and local authority partnerships on 1 December 2009. This guidance is applicable to all care groups, including those with a sensory impairment.</p>

  <p>To accompany this guidance the Scottish Executive has also developed a Good Practice Guide for the Provision of Community Equipment, and a Self Evaluation Tool which accompanies this guide.</p>

  <p>The guidance and associated toolkits are available at:</p>

  <p>Furthermore, during the equipment and adaptations consultation period the importance of utilising Telecare was highlighted. A training resource for use with Telecare for people with Sensory Impairment has now been developed. A formal launch of this workbook will take place on 26 March 2010 at the Sensory Impairment Clinic in Falkirk.</p>

  <p>It is entirely a matter for home educators to decide how a child receives home education. Local authorities may, and often do, provide assistance to home educators with regard to teaching materials, although they are under no statutory obligation to do so. Authorities do have a duty to ensure that children who have been withdrawn from school continue to receive an efficient and suitable education and appropriate contact will be made to that effect.</p>

  <p>There are no qualifications required to home educate a child. However, section 30 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 sets out that it is the duty of parents to provide efficient education suitable to the age ability and aptitude of the child. Local authorities have a duty to ensure that where children have been removed from school, such an education is being provided.</p>

  <p>There are guidelines issued to authorities on setting the minimum number of teaching hours required to home educate a child. However, section 30 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 sets out that it is the duty of parents to provide efficient education suitable to the age ability and aptitude of the child. Local authorities have a duty to ensure that where they are aware of children being home educated, such an education is being provided.</p>

  <p>During the development of the Scottish science baccalaureate, my predecessor considered whether geography should be part of the baccalaureate and decided that it should not. However, geography can contribute to the Interdisciplinary Project and the SQA was asked to explore whether the baccalaureates should be extended to other subject areas. The focus of SQA&rsquo;s work to date has rightly been on developing and supporting the implementation of the Scottish science and languages baccalaureates. With regard to the scoping of baccalaureates in other subject areas, SQA will begin work this month, with a view to having a proposal early summer and a potential start date of August 2011. This timescale will also allow for a review of the two existing baccalaureates before launch of a possible third. The geography sector will be involved as part of this process.</p>

The Group&rsquo;s role in providing the Scottish Government with advice on the development of National Qualifications has been subsumed within (a) the expanded role, remit and membership of the Curriculum for Excellence Management Board and its sub-group: the Qualifications Governing Group and (b) the governance processes established by the Scottish Qualifications Authority for the development of the new qualifications.

  <p>The police recorded crime statistics collected centrally are based on an aggregate return and do not record the occupation of the victim. However, following the introduction of the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act in 2005, a new distinct crime classification of &quot;Minor assault of an emergency workers&quot; was created.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of minor assaults on emergency workers for 2006-07 and 2007-08, in each local authority area.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-03-17.S3W-32217.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0317.htm#12">

  <p>(a) Police officers hold the office of constable and are not covered by standard employment legislation. As &quot;office holders&quot; they require their terms and conditions to be set out in regulations.</p>

  <p>When a police officer has an official charge brought against them they may be suspended under the Police (Conduct) (Scotland) Regulation 1996. The regulations state that an officer may be suspended from duty where they may have committed an act or omission that may amount to misconduct or where they may have committed a criminal offence.</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued by the Scottish Government, within Police Circular 7 of 1996, on the arrangements introduced in the regulations.</p>

  <p>Where an officer has an official charge brought against them, the decision to suspend an officer or place them on restricted duties is an operational matter for the relevant Deputy Chief Constable, given the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

  <p>(b) The decision as to whether a member of the fire brigade is suspended or given restricted duties following an official charge brought against them is an employment matter and entirely a matter for employers.</p>

  <p>(c) Guidance on whether a Prison Officer should be suspended or given restricted/alternative duties whilst matters are is investigated is expressed in the relevant Section (Section 6, 6.10) of the Scottish Prison Service Employee Code of Conduct (&quot;The Code&quot;) which deals with Gross Misconduct.</p>

  <p>The Code states: The governor in charge, head of branch or directorate, will consider whether it is appropriate to suspend the employee, whilst an investigation is carried out. Suspension will only be used in exceptional circumstances e.g. where the alleged offence, if proven, may result in dismissal and/or where the interests of the employee or the organisation would be best served by the suspension.</p>

  <p>Additional further guidance was issued to all HR Managers on 9 and 10 February 2010. This guidance advised that instances such as allegations/charges (whether internal or external) relating to sexual impropriety, violence, theft, drug trafficking etc, may; for reasons of reputational damage, potential risk to staff or prisoners, and to safeguard the interest of the accused; merit suspension.</p>

  <p>The decision to suspend a police officer, or to place them on restricted duties, following an official charge being brought against them, is a matter for the relevant chief constable.

  <p>The principle of judicial independence is a fundamental cornerstone of the Scottish justice system. In bringing forward the proposals to create a presumption against sentences of six months or less, contained in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill, the Scottish Government is upholding this principle. The presumption does not take the form of identifying particular crimes which should not receive a custodial sentence of six months or less.

  <p>We do not hold information on the number of contracts awarded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Scottish Procurement Information Hub does however hold information on the proportion of public procurement spending with SMEs. In 2007-08 (the most recent financial year for which complete data is available on the hub), 49% of public procurement spending, by value, was with SMEs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration will be given to the overall balance of greenhouse gas emissions and savings from the development of offshore renewable energy, including emissions from manufacture, transport, construction, seabed disturbance, operation, maintenance and decommissioning, when assessing (a) individual applications for consent and (b) the contribution of offshore renewable energy to meeting the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 targets for emissions reductions.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-03-17.S3W-32194.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80347" speakername="Jim Mather" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0317.htm#19">

  <p>(a) As part of an individual application for consent developers are required to submit an Environmental Statement. The associated assessment is subject to wide ranging consultation with statutory bodies and other affected stakeholders.</p>

  <p>To assist Scottish ministers in making a determination on an application developers are invited to produce a statement of expected carbon savings over the lifetime of the associated application. Emissions from the various stages of manufacture and deployment will be accounted for under the NSEA as outlined in part (b) to this answer.</p>

  <p>(b) The Net Scottish Emissions Account (NSEA), which will be used to measure the targets in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act, measures Scottish emissions using a production-based methodology. Emissions are attributed to the sector in which the production of the greenhouse gas takes place, so that emissions from electricity use are attributed to power stations, and direct (non-electrical) emissions from the manufacture (in Scotland) of wind turbines would be attributed to the industry that manufactures them. Direct emissions from, for example, the transport and construction of turbines are captured in the transport and construction sectors respectively.</p>

  <p>Emissions from electricity generation fall within the traded sector and are included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). For consistency with international accounting methodologies, the NSEA will record emissions from this sector as Scotland&rsquo;s share of the declining cap set by the EU ETS, regardless of total electricity production or the amount of renewable electricity. However, as made clear in the recent advice from the Committee on Climate Change, meeting the target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 will require early decarbonisation of the power sector. Renewable electricity, through displacing fossil fuelled generation, plays a crucial role in achieving this.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Report on Policies and Proposals, to be published in September 2010, is required to set out how Scotland will meet its annual targets from 2010 to 2022 and the interim target for 2020. The report must consider the contribution towards the annual targets that should be made by electricity generation (among other activities).</p>

  <p>The Climate Change (Scotland) Act also requires ministers to report separately on emissions attributable to the consumption and use of goods and services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There is a statutory requirement on care home providers to ensure that at all times suitably qualified and competent persons are working in the service to meet the health and welfare of service users. <em>The National Care Standards &ndash; Care Homes for Older People</em> require that the provider is aware of the nutritional state of residents and will arrange for this to be regularly assessed and reviewed. The Care Commission works with care providers to improve the quality of care and inspects against care standards and legislation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improving nutrition for older people in care homes and to help deliver on this commitment funded the <em>Promoting Nutrition in Care Homes Project</em>. The project trained care home staff in ways to improve nutrition, food and eating practices. The Care Commission evaluated the project and published a report in 2009. The Scottish Government now plans to build on the project for the further benefit of older people in care homes.</p>

  <p>The First Minister and the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change represented Scotland in Copenhagen during the UN Climate Change conference in December 2009 to promote Scotland&rsquo;s world-leading targets set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. The First Minister took part in a number of activities and meetings including signing a joint statement with President Nasheed of the Maldives and addressed The Climate Group&rsquo;s Climate Leaders Summit of over 60 state and regional government ministers. He also held a number of other meetings including with the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance and DONG Energy, a major Danish energy company. The Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change hosted Scotland&rsquo;s Low Carbon Mission event with keynote speaker Mary Robinson, and met Joan Ruddock MP Minister of State and held bilateral business meetings with Ministers from New Zealand, Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg and Ontario amongst others. He also attended a meeting of the UN Conference of the Parties.</p>

  <p>The First Minister, the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change and 10 Scottish Government officials travelled by business or economy flights, which are subject to a Scottish Government carbon levy. It is the policy of the Scottish Government to proactively publish the costs of ministerial overseas travel, accommodation and expenses and ministers&rsquo; costs for Copenhagen are available at:</p>
