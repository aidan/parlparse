  <p>NHS Health Scotland produces a teaching pack, <em>Drink Talking</em> , which is distributed to secondary schools and contains a video and teaching notes to facilitate discussion on the effects of alcohol on the body. Although this does not specifically discuss the effects of alcohol on unborn babies, it does offer advice on alcohol consumption. <em>Alcohol: What every parent should know</em> , a guide that is aimed at the parents of teenage children, is also distributed to schools and contains information on the effects of alcohol consumption and the health of unborn children.</p>

  <p>There have been no further discussions. I currently await the latest draft version from the Environment Agency for consideration. The introduction of rod licences is a separate although related matter, and is not subject to consideration or approval by Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>Diamorphine is one of the opioid analgesics used in pain relief in cancer patients. On 23 December 2004, the Scottish Executive Health Department wrote to health professionals to alert them to a potential problem with supplies of diamorphine. Health professionals were asked to take every possible step to conserve stocks of diamorphine injection for patients in whom the need is greatest. Alternative analgesics to diamorphine are available and care is needed when switching from one opioid analgesic to another to ensure equipotent dosage. The advice which issued from the department included a dosage guidance table.</p>

  <p>In June 2000, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) issued a guideline on the control of pain in patients with cancer. This guideline, number 44, can be accessed at <a href="http://www.sign.ac.uk" target="_blank">www.sign.ac.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The British National Formulary (BNF), issued free to doctors, gives advice on prescribing in palliative care. The BNF can be accessed at <a href="http://www.bnf.org" target="_blank">www.bnf.org</a>.</p>

  <p>There is no requirement for local authorities to provide specific policy statements and parent guidelines on provision for dyslexia. Education authorities are, however, required to include a specific statement of the special educational needs policy for each school in their school handbooks.</p>

  <p>Research commissioned by the Executive into local authority policy and provision for dyslexia has recently been completed and Dyslexia Scotland have organised a national conference to consider the findings and identify good practice. The conference is to be held on 17 March and the next step will be for Dyslexia Scotland, with the support of the &pound;100,000 awarded over the period 2005-07 by the Executive, to work with education authorities and to develop best practice guidance to support teaching staff, parents and pupils with dyslexia.</p>

  <p>Education authorities and schools should have clearly stated arrangements in place to meet the concerns of all parents who feel that the education provided for their child is not appropriate. The emphasis should be on resolving matters informally at a local level, thereafter through statutory appeal mechanisms.</p>

  <p>Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, which is due to commence by the end of this year, education authorities will have a new duty to provide and publish details of their independent mediation and dispute resolution services which will be free of charge to parents of children with additional support needs. Both these services will consider matters relating to educational provision including dyslexia.</p>

  <p>In March 2004, the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) published new advice on limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields, including those from power lines. This new advice recommends adoption of the guidelines on levels of public exposure that are published by the International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection. The NRPB note, however, that there have been some population studies that point to the possibility of effects below these guidelines, in particular for power-frequency magnetic fields. It has therefore recommended that Government consider the possible need for further precautionary measures.</p>

  <p>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Public Health (Melanie Johnson) has written to the Chairman of the NRPB welcoming the new advice, highlighting the need for inter-departmental working and introducing initial plans for a wider stakeholder process to address the NRPB&rsquo;s call for consideration of further precautionary measures in this area. This process is now underway through a stakeholder advisory group on extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields. Membership of the group includes UK government departments, the devolved administrations, the electricity supply industry, the electricity supply regulators and a number of non-governmental organisations and public concern groups.</p>

  <p>On 23 December 2004, the Scottish Executive Health Department issued guidance to health professionals alerting them to a potential shortage of diamorphine injection.

  <p>The safety of medicines available on the UK market is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the expert independent advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).</p>

  <p>There have been longstanding concerns about the safety and efficacy of co-proxamol. The CSM first warned prescribers about the risks associated with co-proxamol in 1985. Despite being identified by the British National Formulary as &quot;less suitable for prescribing&quot;, co-proxamol remains widely prescribed.</p>

  <p>During 2004, the CSM reviewed all the available evidence regarding the risks and benefits of co-proxamol. A public call for evidence on the risks and benefits of co-proxamol was also conducted for 12 weeks in 2004; the MHRA wrote to a large number of organisations representing health care professionals, patient groups and other stakeholders as well as publishing the request for information on their website (<a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>). The CSM reviewed all the responses together with international evidence on the safety of co-proxamol. The information gathered during this exercise provided no new objective evidence concerning the risk:benefit of co-proxamol.</p>

  <p>The CSM noted that previously strengthened warnings to doctors and patients on the hazards of co-proxamol proved ineffective. After considering the wide range of available evidence and the options for action to reduce the risk of overdose (e.g. prescriber and patient education, smaller pack sizes and restricted indications) the CSM determined that the risks of co-proxamol clearly outweigh the benefits of allowing this medicine to remain on the market.</p>

  <p>The safety of medicines available on the UK market is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the expert independent advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).</p>

  <p>There are a number of alternatives for managing pain and the CSM has issued advice on pain management options to assist prescribers, together with individual patients, in choosing pain management strategies. This guidance also refers to a number of sources of additional advice including the British National Formulary, issued to doctors and pharmacists.</p>

  <p>On 31 January 2005, The Scottish Executive Health Department issued advice from Professor Gordon Duff, Chairman, CSM, about the withdrawal of co-proxamol. The CSM&rsquo;s overview of alternative analgesic options is available on the MHRA website (<a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>). In order to minimise disruption of health care provision, co-proxamol will be phased out over an extended period of time so that patients currently receiving co-proxamol may be switched to a suitable alternative.</p>

  <p>No new patients should be initiated on co-proxamol therapy.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the preparation of local housing strategies produced for local authorities suggests that Strategies should identify the broad picture of investment needs for existing and new housing.</p>

  <p>While local housing strategies are not intended to be bidding documents, the priorities identified in Strategies are expected to determine councils' future expenditure priorities.</p>

  <p>A fit for purpose local housing strategy should set out a clear investment framework for registered social landlords and for other partners and providers that would allow them to prioritise and target their actions and resources in support of the strategy.</p>

  <p>Where the management of development funding has transferred from Communities Scotland, local authorities are also responsible for the administration of funding to Registered Social Landlords and other providers &ndash; in all other cases this function remains with Communities Scotland.</p>

We are pursuing these challenges through our Fresh Talent policy within the framework of the UK immigration system. I look forward to working closely with the Home Office on the detail of how the five year plan will be implemented.</p>

  <p>The existing low-skill schemes account for only a very small proportion of low-skilled migration to the UK. Accession country nationals are increasingly filling low-skill jobs in the hospitality and agriculture sectors. Almost 8,000 workers from these countries have registered in Scotland since the worker registration scheme came into effect on 1 May 2005 and we are looking at ways in which we can promote Scotland in these countries and raise this figure still higher.</p>

  <p>Immigration is a reserved matter, and statistics on the control of immigration are a matter for the Home Office.</p>

  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland compiles estimates of international migration into Scotland, for the purposes of demographic estimation and projections. A migrant is internationally defined as someone who changes his or her country of residence for a period of at least a year. These estimates are derived primarily from the International Passenger Survey (IPS). Because the sample-size involved is relatively small, the estimates do not allow figures for the accession states to be separately identified.</p>

  <p>There is some information available on workers and visitors from accession states:</p>

  <p>Information about the number of people from the EU accession states who have registered to work in Scotland, including seasonal workers as well as immigrants, is available from the Home Office: <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/en/home/0/reports/accession_monitoring.Maincontent.0007.file.tmp/Final%20Feb%20accession%20report.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/en/home/0/reports/accession_monitoring.Maincontent.0007.file.tmp/Final%20Feb%20accession%20report.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Information from the IPS about all visitors to the UK from accession countries (including those who visit for less than 12 months and are therefore not defined as migrants) is published monthly and is available through the following link: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=12222&amp;More=n" target="_blank">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=12222&amp;More=n</a>.</p>

  <p>This does not give information for Scotland due to the small sample-size.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-12959 by Tavish Scott on 28 January 2005, what its policy is in relation to the undertaking of criminal prosecutions by private individuals and whether the power for a landowner or occupier, as well as the procurator fiscal, to prosecute an alleged offender under the Game (Scotland) Act 1832 is consistent with this policy.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-03-10.S2W-14167.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80109" speakername="Tavish Scott" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0310.htm#16">

  <p>The sole public prosecutor in Scotland is the Lord Advocate. He is represented locally by the Procurator Fiscal. The question of prosecution by a private individual is a matter of law rather than policy.</p>

  <p>The authority vested in landowners and others by virtue of the Game (Scotland) Act 1832 can be distinguished from private prosecution.</p>

  <p>A person may apply to the High Court of Justiciary for authority to bring a private prosecution in relation to a crime at common law or a statutory offence for which imprisonment without option of a fine is competent. Such a person must establish that he or she has a substantial interest to do so and that the Lord Advocate has refused to prosecute. The petitioner must state that the Lord Advocate has not only refused to prosecute but has also refused to concur in a private prosecution. In considering whether to concur in a private prosecution in any case the Lord Advocate will have regard to whether it is in the public interest in view of the facts and circumstances of the case. Such prosecutions have only been authorised by the High Court twice since 1900.</p>

  <p>In contrast, section 2 of the Game (Scotland) Act 1832 is a specific statutory provision which provides that a trespasser who has been required to quit land and give his or her name and abode but refuses to do so may be arrested and brought before a justice of the peace and, on summary conviction, at the instance of the owner or occupier of the land or the Procurator Fiscal may be required to pay a financial penalty of not more than level one on the standard scale. It would be inappropriate for a person to be prosecuted twice for the same offence and therefore, in practice, any person seeking to prosecute a trespasser for this offence should ensure that no other proceedings are in contemplation or have been taken.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any cases in recent times in which a private individual has initiated a prosecution in terms of section 2 of the act but records held indicate that a very small number of offences have been reported to procurators fiscal.</p>

  <p>Any review of the Game (Scotland) Act 1832 will provide an opportunity to examine the situation and consider amendments.</p>

  <p>Local authorities&rsquo; accumulated debt as at 31 March 2004 of &pound;9 billion is made up from past years&rsquo; capital investment programmes and around 75% is directly supported by the Scottish Executive through revenue support grant in the form of Loan Charge Support. In 2003-04 this support amounted to &pound;861 million. The remaining debt is financed from other revenue streams, mainly from income from housing rents and housing support grant.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s support has enabled authorities to make significant investments over many years in infrastructure including capital investment to assist with the delivery of services for elderly people and disabled people, such as new residential care homes.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also continuing to support around &pound;300 million of new capital investment each year as part of the three-year settlement for local government finance.

  <p>We are not aware of any significant delays. I would refer you to the answer to question S2W-14575 on 10 March 2005. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="../../../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>The average waiting time for installation of a concentrator from receipt of prescription is normally about four days.</p>

  <p>The consultation document <em>A New Public Involvement Structure for NHSScotland</em> , held in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26830), outlined the proposals for the Scottish Health Council which were based on an increasing emphasis on NHS boards directly engaging with and involving the public, and the need for a new body to provide quality assurance of boards&rsquo; performance.</p>

  <p>Providing advice and support services to people wishing to comment on NHS services has been the responsibility of the board. This service has been provided by some local health councils in the past and some NHS boards have provided funding for complaints support staff. There are currently no national standards for the delivery of complaints advice and support and it is outwith the health council core remit. Arrangements are now being developed to establish a partnership with Citizens Advice Scotland and their local bureaux to formalise their existing arrangements for providing advice and support on NHS services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Council will not provide advice and support services, but they will seek to ensure that NHS boards have appropriate and effective arrangements in place. The Scottish Health Council will also ensure that individual patients, carers and members of the public are able to make their views on health services known.</p>

  <p>The totals particularly for 2004, reflect the increasing investment in infrastructure, including use of PPP projects, as shown in <em>Building a Better Scotland : Infrastructure Investment Plan </em>(Bib. number 35376).</p>

  <p>The Executive has used eight PPP consultancy firms during this period. The number of full-time equivalents employed by these firms is not readily available.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are four secondments to the Executive&rsquo;s Financial Partnerships Unit. The expenditure on these to the end of 2004 totals &pound;46,404.</p>

  <p><em>The Right Medicine; a Strategy for Pharmaceutical Care in Scotland</em> identifies community pharmacists as having a role in providing access to advice in various areas of sexual health promotion such as advice on safe sex and avoiding sexually transmitted infections as well as providing contraceptive services, for example access to emergency hormonal contraception.</p>

  <p>As part of its work in Phase One (2001-04), the National Demonstration Project <em>Healthy Respect</em> enabled community pharmacists in Lothian to provide Chlamydia testing as part of an integrated sexual health service. Their work on postal Chlamydia testing kits which were widely distributed in retail outlets including pharmacies has helped to inform the development of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s sexual health strategy Respect and Responsibility: Strategy and Action Plan for Improving Sexual Health.</p>

  <p>I launched the strategy with a statement to the Scottish Parliament on 27 January. The strategy sets out, for the first time in Scotland, a coherent framework for improving sexual health. We expect its implementation to be driven by the relevant agencies, taking account of input from key stakeholders. Contained within the strategy is a commitment on the Health Department to consider the possible extension of the Chlamydia postal testing kit in the light of the evaluation of Healthy Respect. We will also consider the potential of developing and testing sexually transmitted infections diagnostic kits in rural and urban settings.</p>

  <p>I am delighted to announce the new rates of support for students in further and higher education for academic year 2005-06. I am today placing in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 35558) details of the rates of those loans, bursaries and grants, which will be available to eligible undergraduate and postgraduate students in full-time higher education.</p>

  <p>A general uprating factor of 2.5%, in line with inflation, will be applied to the existing schemes of support in 2005-06, thus maintaining their value in real terms. We are also increasing by the same factor the standard rates of tuition fee payments made to institutions on behalf of eligible students by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland.</p>

  <p>This increase is consistent with that announced by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on 9 December 2004 for English and Welsh domiciled students.</p>

  <p>The Partnership Agreement contained a commitment to review student bursaries with a view to increasing the family income ceiling and review the amount of bursary available. I announced in January that this bursary has been increased by approximately 11% to &pound;2,395 and that the income thresholds have been increased from &pound;10,740 to &pound;17,500 for the maximum family income ceiling and from &pound;28,000 to &pound;31,500 for the minimum threshold, therefore more students will receive the bursary and more will receive the maximum amount.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) has also agreed to maintain the alignment between the further and higher education sectors by, where appropriate, uprating the support available to further education students by 2.5%. A copy of these rates is also being placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 35558).</p>
