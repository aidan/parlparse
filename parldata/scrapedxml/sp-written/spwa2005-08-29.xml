  <p>We install cavity wall insulation through the Warm Deal and the central heating programme. We have not set targets for cavity wall installation, principally because these programmes are demand-led.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-17448 by Nicol Stephen on 19 July 2005, whether it will include the relevant trade unions in any discussions on how the Arjo Wiggins paper mill at Corpach might be kept open as a going concern.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has asked Scottish Development International and Lochaber Enterprise to take the lead in working closely with the company to explore all feasible options for the future of the facility. As part of their efforts Lochaber Enterprise has been in regular contact with the company and the local union representatives. This has involved all the relevant local players in planning a co-ordinated response.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Arjo Wiggins has now made it clear that it intends to close the Corpach mill at the end of September. The workforce has been informed of this, but no redundancy notices have been served yet. A redundancy support team will be working with union representatives, staff and management to provide support to the people faced with losing their jobs.</p>

  <p>To respond to the planned closure Lochaber Enterprise has formed a task team to look at all relevant issues, co-ordinate action and ensure that all future options for the site are fully explored. Local MP Charles Kennedy has agreed to chair the group and its membership will include a senior staff member of Argo Wiggins as well as relevant union representatives.</p>

  <p>Scottish Development International (SDI) and its partners, including Scottish Enterprise Tayside, target global decision makers in key industries to highlight business opportunities and secure investment into Scotland. This includes traditional foreign direct investment (FDI) projects but also research investment and new technology partnerships. The high international regard for this work can be seen in the fact that in October 2004 the <em>Financial Times&rsquo;</em> FDI Magazine awarded Dundee the title of &quot;European Cities of the Future &ndash; Best FDI Promotion Strategy&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and its agencies continue to work to attract the kind of inward investment to Dundee which has helped make it an internationally recognised location for the life sciences and creative industries, attracting companies such as US-owned drug discovery firm Upstate and medical imaging specialists Kestrel 3D. Dundee is also home to long-standing inward investors such as NCR which continues to make high-value investments in the area assisted by public sector support.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive operates a range of measures to assist manufacturing throughout Scotland. The Executive&rsquo;s strategy, Smart Successful Scotland, is delivered through local enterprise companies including Scottish Enterprise Tayside in Dundee which works closely in conjunction with the Business Gateway and also its partners in the Dundee Community Planning Partnership. Together they offer manufacturers business support services which are available to all types and sizes of business and Scottish Enterprise Tayside also provides intensive support to key companies with the best potential for sustainable growth.</p>

  <p>The Executive provides direct financial support for investment projects through Regional Selective Assistance which, in the past two years, has provided 11 companies in Dundee over &pound;2.7 million of grant aid creating 182 jobs and securing the employment of 206. Other direct Executive grant schemes such as Smart and Spur, which encourage product and process innovation, have delivered &pound;1.68 million to 14 Dundee companies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Manufacturing Advisory Service - designed specifically to improve productivity in manufacturing industry will be introduced later this year.</p>

  <p>This is primarily a matter for ScottishPower. However, our leaflet entitled <em>Fuel Poverty: An Adviser&rsquo;s Guide to referral networks</em> , which has been distributed widely in the voluntary sector, includes contact details of agencies which will be aware of this source of funding.

  <p>The latest data available are contained in the Scottish House Condition Survey 2002. At that time it was estimated that around 286,000 households lived in fuel poverty, approximately 13% of the total housing stock. The Scottish House Condition Survey is the only source we have for reliably assessing the extent of fuel poverty in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The new Continuous Scottish House Condition Survey uses a much smaller annual sample-size than the 2002 Survey. For this reason, we will not be able to update the detailed fuel poverty analysis of the type contained within the 2004 Fuel Poverty report until 2007 at the earliest when we will have responses for the first three years of the survey.</p>

  <p>It was not possible to publish details of the enhancements to the General Register Office for Scotland website along with the annual review as the review of the statistical information on the website had not then been completed.

It is intended to make summary weekly data on vital events available on the website by the end of October.

  <p>These data should be treated with great caution: detailed information on healthcare associated infections as a cause of death from specific infections can be difficult or impossible to interpret safely. As at the end of 2004 there was no international code for recording MRSA as a cause of death: the MRSA data above were abstracted from hand-written notes on the original paper certificates, and are not taken from formal national electronic datasets. In addition, detailed recording of specific healthcare associated infections as a cause of death is often influenced by the then current level of professional and public awareness &ndash; e.g. in recording clostridium difficile rather than the more commonly used generic category, intestinal infection: apparent increases in cases may therefore not reflect the true underlying picture.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department funded a study, which completed in February 2001. It assessed theories on how VRE is spread and methods of control in high dependency units. The study found that the type of vancomycin-resistance that is found may be influenced by the way in which antibiotics are prescribed. A greater understanding of the pattern of resistance will help to identify the therapeutic options likely to be effective. Guidance on prudent antibiotic prescribing in hospitals will be published in the very near future.</p>

  <p>The CSO is not currently funding any research into VRE, but would be pleased to consider research proposals for innovative VRE studies of a sufficiently high standard. These would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>Details of further UK research studies that have been undertaken on VRE can be found on the National Research Register.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. The information provided by local authorities to the Scottish ministers, in seeking confirmation of a compulsory purchase order, do not necessarily specify whether land is to be released for affordable housing. A local authority is also not obliged to inform the Executive whether a confirmed order has been actioned or not, and therefore whether it has succeeded in its purpose.</p>

  <p>The majority of patients who require in-patient and day case treatment, are treated quickly. Nearly 55% of patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals receive immediate treatment and never join a waiting list. Of those who do wait 41% are admitted within one month and almost 70% within three months.</p>

  <p>For those who wait longer, the current national maximum waiting time is nine months. This guaranteed waiting time will be reduced to six months from the end of 2005 and to 18 weeks from the end of 2007. On 30 June 2005, no NHSScotland patient with a guarantee had waited more than nine months for in-patient and day case treatment.</p>

  <p>Retrospective analyses of the time between the decision to treat and receipt of treatment are derived from information on patients treated during the previous year. This includes cases where patients will have had an Availability Status Code (ASC) applied, for example because they were medically unfit or asked for their admission to be deferred for personal reasons. So the analyses include patients who did not have a guarantee of treatment within nine months. The information requested on heart operations and hip replacements is given, on this basis, in the table entitled <em>Number of Patients by Length of Wait</em>, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37249).</p>

  <p><em>Fair To All, Personal To Each</em>, set out our commitment to abolish Availability Status Codes and introduce a new system of defining and measuring waiting times, which will be clearer, more consistent and help to put patients at the centre of their care, by the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>Waiting times for cancer treatments equivalent to the waiting times for the other specified procedures are not available from routinely collected hospital data as complete information is not captured on all treatment types, such as hormonal therapy and chemotherapy and not all cancer treatments require a hospital admission.</p>

  <p>Information on cancer waiting times is currently gathered through cancer audit systems in order to measure the target that &quot;by December 2005 the maximum wait from urgent referral to treatment for all cancers will be two months&quot; from <em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change</em>, published in 2001. Information showing performance against the target by NHS board of diagnosis is currently available for lung, breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers and is available from the following Scottish Executive website <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/cancerwaits" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/cancerwaits</a>.</p>

  <p>Performance for other tumour types and updates to the information will be published by the Scottish Executive as they become available.</p>
