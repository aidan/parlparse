  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, if it is successful in its bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, whether it will ensure that sporting competitions are located around Scotland, such as equestrian events in the Scottish Borders.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-02-01.S2W-22587.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80030" speakername="Patricia Ferguson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0201.htm#1">

  <p>The Scottish Executive and Glasgow City Council have received advice from the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland indicating that the prospects for Scotland&rsquo;s bid to be successful are maximised if the events venues are as close together as possible and if the use of these facilities is maximised where possible.</p>

  <p>Therefore it is likely that, should Scotland be successful in its bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, the majority of sporting events would be based within or close to Glasgow. All of the bid partners are, however, committed to ensuring the bid is one that involves and benefits the whole of Scotland.</p>

  <p>: Every death that occurs in Scotland is registered under the civil registration system which is operated by local councils on behalf of the Registrar General. The information collected and processed through the registration system creates the death registers of Scotland and these can be viewed by any member of the public. A computerised statistical record of the death registration is also created. This is used to answer customer and other enquiries and to produce the statistics that appear in the publications of the Registrar General. The statistical database can provide information at an individual level or data can be grouped together to provide counts for many different demographic or personal variables.</p>

  <p>The registration process and the nature of the information that is required to register a death is the same for every death irrespective of the cause (or causes) of death. All causes of death that are recorded by the certifying doctor are coded according to the rules and regulations of the World Health Organization as defined in their publication <i>The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems &ndash; Tenth Revision (ICD10).</i></p>

  <p>There is no definitive methodology for deciding if a particular death was alcohol-related. The staff of the Registrar General normally use a pre-determined list of ICD10 codes to identify those causes of death regarded as being most directly the result of alcohol consumption. The list is not exhaustive and indeed the Office for National Statistics have just completed a consultation exercise seeking views or comments on an expansion of the list that they presently use to identify alcohol-related deaths. Depending on the outcome it is likely that Scotland will follow their recommendations for purposes of comparability.</p>

  <p>The ICD10 codes that are normally used to answer questions about alcohol-related deaths cover key causes of death that are known to be associated with alcohol and comprise:</p>

  <p>F10: Mental and behavioural disorders due to the use of alcohol.</p>

  <p>I42.6: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy.</p>

  <p>K70: Alcoholic liver disease.</p>

  <p>: Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) is working closely with partners such as Scottish Natural Heritage, RSPB and the Game Conservancy Trust in a co-ordinated approach to conserving black grouse, a wide ranging species that needs a balance of moorland and young woodland habitats.</p>

  <p>Within the national forest estate, FCS carries out a range of operations to conserve black grouse, including lek counts, enhancing habitat by thinning and felling woodland to create more open and edge habitat, cutting vegetation to improve habitat for young chicks, and incorporating suitable long-term habitat structures in forest design plans.</p>

  <p>FCS also offers grants and guidance under its Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme for similar conservation measures in private woodland, as well as marking or removing fences in areas where black grouse or capercaillie may fly into them. The grants cover 90% of costs in priority areas for black grouse, near to known lek sites.</p>

  <p>In conjunction with its partners, FCS is analysing the results of the recent survey to determine options for further conservation work.</p>

  <p>: Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 empowers local authorities to carry out inspections within their areas for the purpose of identifying contaminated land and to secure its remediation. At the time the contaminated land regime came into force in 2000, little was known about the true extent and nature of contaminated land and it was not possible to set targets for overall progress.</p>

  <p>The Executive has, therefore, provided resources for the purpose of supporting local authorities in carrying out their statutory responsibilities for identifying and investigating contaminated land within their areas. In addition, funding has been provided for remediating approximately 144 hectares of contaminated land on specific sites. It is also likely that additional contaminated land will be remediated by developers in compliance with conditions in planning consents.</p>

  <p>: The Scottish Executive does not impose on local authorities any conditions that are specifically concerned with the provision of repairs or improvement grants for roof repairs. It is for the local authority to decide whether to make such a grant, except where it has chosen to serve a statutory repairs notice, when it must approve an application for grant for works in the notice. The link between such a notice and grant will be removed as part of the package of changes to local authority enforcement and assistance powers in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 which will be implemented over the next two years.</p>

  <p>: Arrangements have been in place prior to devolution to ensure the provision of appropriate medical assistance where necessary for people attending Bute House, which is used for overnight stays as well as for regular Scottish Executive business. These arrangements are kept under close and constant review. The arrangements apply to all persons using Bute House, including staff, visitors, contractors and ministers, including the First Minister.</p>

  <p>Standing instructions are that where someone falls ill or sustains an injury and appears to need medical attention, a call is made to the Scottish Ambulance Service. The ambulance service operator will decide, using standard procedures and on the basis of information provided by the person calling from Bute House, whether it is necessary to send an ambulance. Where this action is not considered necessary, the Bute House caller will be advised to call NHS 24. NHS 24 has put in place a standard procedure for dealing appropriately with calls from Bute House, to ensure confidentiality and consistency. Where, following assessment of information provided by the Bute House caller, NHS 24 decides that medical attention is required NHS 24 will (in line with the standard procedure) either provide advice to the caller about how best to obtain this attention, or arrange for a healthcare worker from NHS Lothian to make a home visit to Bute House. The precise arrangements will depend on whether the call has been made during or outwith working hours, as well as on the symptoms and other circumstances.</p>

  <p>These arrangements help to ensure that any person who falls ill or sustains an injury in Bute House receives appropriate medical care. Bute House is the only Scottish Executive building which is categorised as a residence, and procedures to ensure that residents, including visiting dignitaries etc, have access to medical advice or assistance have been in place for some time. These procedures support the day-to-day management and security of the building. They do not in any way affect the services provided by NHS 24 to the general public.</p>

  <p>: Since the publication of the independent review team&rsquo;s report in October 2005, NHS 24 has been working very hard to implement the recommendations. In the last few months this work has begun to pay off - performance in relation to access to the service has been improving and there has been a reduction in the reliance of call back. This improvement in performance continues to be monitored closely by the Health Department.</p>

  <p>Over the traditionally busy festive period, NHS 24 and its NHS partners endeavoured to ensure that patients in Scotland continued to receive a responsive and high quality service. It is evident from the early performance information for primary care out-of-hours services that the whole system performed well despite sustained pressure over the two four day holiday periods, and that responsive services were maintained overall.</p>

  <p>Additional NHS 24 call handlers and nurse advisers played a significant part in delivering this improved performance. In addition, NHS boards, as agreed, accepted and managed untriaged calls from NHS 24 over the period, dealing with nearly 10% of the total call volume &ndash; 81,563 calls were received by NHS 24 over the two four day periods, with 7,691 passing directly to NHS boards for triage. These successes are down to real partnership working, and delivered improved services for patients at a time when high levels of peak demand placed considerable pressures on resources.</p>

  <p>The service standards are significantly better than those achieved across the 2004 festive period and owe much to both the strength of planning and to the sheer dedication and professionalism of front line staff. Clearly much of the winter remains ahead of us, and the test of the robustness of overall winter planning continues.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Polmont is currently undergoing a refurbishment costing over &pound;90 million which is due to be completed around 2007-08. As part of this redevelopment, most existing areas referred to in the Her Majesty&rsquo;s Chief Inspector of Prisons (HMCIP) Report will be replaced. Young people on remand are no longer held in &quot;slopping out&quot; accommodation, Spey Hall has already been closed and a purpose built activity centre for programmes and work has been opened. A second activity area and further accommodation are planned for next year. As part of the development of the regime at Polmont, specialised training is provided for staff as required.</p>

  <p>The SPS responds formally to recommendations in HMCIP Reports. Responses are published on the SPS website at <a href="http://www.sps.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.sps.gov.uk</a>. In addition to these recommendations, HMCIP may also list some &quot;Points of Note.&quot; In responding, the SPS note these without commitment. They may be taken into account by local managers, and will be balanced against managers&rsquo; judgement about resources available, any savings which might be required, and the operational balance of the establishment.&quot;</p>

  <p>: The Executive&rsquo;s policy is to avoid, wherever possible, holding young people under the age of 16 in prison. In the exceptional circumstances where it is deemed necessary, it must be for the shortest appropriate period of time.</p>

  <p>Very occasionally, and only when the courts decide, would an under 16 be held in prison or young offenders institution for the shortest possible time until a suitable secure place is available.</p>

  <p>To ensure we meet the needs of this very vulnerable group of young people, we are investing &pound;18 million to support the redevelopment of the secure estate. An additional 29 places will be provided. The overall estate will be 125 places when the redevelopment is complete in 2007.</p>

  <p>We have also developed a range of alternatives to secure care. The Intensive Support Fund, announced on 19 December 2003, was set up to improve the range of intensive support and supervision available in Scotland; to improve the quality of care in secure and to improve aftercare arrangements for young people leaving secure.</p>

  <p>The first phase of Intensive Support and Monitoring Services is being implemented. This intervention can offer a direct alternative to secure accommodation for some young people, in appropriate circumstances.</p>

  <p>Detaining young people is not a decision that is taken lightly, but we must balance the welfare of that young person with that of the community they live in.</p>

  <p>: The Executive&rsquo;s policy is to avoid, wherever possible, holding young people under the age of 16 in prison. In the exceptional circumstances where it is deemed necessary, it must be for the shortest appropriate period of time.</p>

  <p>The normal expectation is that a child will remain in the same establishment until their release. Transfer to another secure unit or to a young offenders institute will only be considered if a child&rsquo;s behaviour becomes completely unmanageable within the current placement or where, for example, the child is convicted of further serious charges which suggest that the child would present an unacceptable risk to the safety of other residents or staff. Conversely, where a child makes suitable progress he or she will be considered for a move from a secure establishment to an open setting within the child care system.</p>

  <p>The majority of those children who are recorded as being held in adult prisons are children whose behaviour is so challenging that the courts have certified them as &quot;unruly&quot;.</p>

  <p>These special arrangements are in place in order to protect those children whose behaviour is so challenging that it would be inappropriate to place them in local authority secure accommodation at that point in time.</p>

  <p>Staff in secure units already have well developed skills for dealing with difficult behaviour in a secure setting. Further training and development which will enhance these skills is on-going within each unit.</p>

  <p>The SPCB recognised the twin desires of:</p>

  <p>supporting &quot;family friendly policies&quot; by providing direct childcare support for members and their staff and SPCB staff in the form of an on-site nursery, and</p>

  <p>facilitating access to and engagement with the Parliament by providing cr&egrave;che facilities for visitors.</p>

  <p>On balance it decided that the User Brief be amended to require the provision of a cr&egrave;che instead of a nursery within the Parliamentary complex as this would support public engagement with the Parliament while also being available to members and their staff and SPCB staff for emergency use.</p>

  <p>The SPCB supports child care responsibilities generally by the provision of Childcare Vouchers (= to a max of &pound;54.80 per week per family). The benefit of this support [over direct nursery provision] is that it supports a range of childcare options regardless of where these are delivered geographically. This is especially important in the context of the Scottish Parliament in which many of the members and staff live significant distances from the Parliament.</p>

  <p>The members&rsquo; restaurant is available to all passholders on a Monday and Friday and is also used to host official functions and events. The bar area is accessible to all passholders.</p>

  <p>The estimated total subsidy across all the Parliament&rsquo;s catering outlets between August 2004 and December 2005 is around &pound;650,000. It is not possible to give a precise figure for the members&rsquo; restaurant, since some costs are generic, but we estimate around &pound;100,000. This has been calculated by apportioning to the members&rsquo; restaurant a percentage of the total cost of labour and other overheads of all catering services.</p>

  <p>The future subsidy will be determined by usage, service level and tariff policy. Whilst usage is beyond our control, a business decision is taken by the SPCB to set the tariff, which determines the income, and service levels, which control one of the costs. Usage aside, the subsidy is driven by and controlled by that business decision. While we will keep these matters under review, we have no current plans to make major changes and subsidy is likely to continue at broadly the same level.</p>

  <p>Between November 2004 and December 2005, 112 requests for maintenance repairs were recorded by the helpdesk. Since migration, 2,165 building project snags and complaints have been reported by building users and forwarded to the Holyrood Project Team to investigate and resolve. The majority of these were minor and have been resolved. The aim is to close out remaining snags, including those resulting from the on-going final snagging inspection exercise, by end of June 2006.</p>

  <p>In accordance with its wish to be more open and accessible with regard to expenses, the SPCB has established a Joint Working Group of members and officials to look at issues. It is recognised that, in publishing information on MSPs allowances, adequate explanatory notes are required to aid an understanding of the information being provided. Taking account of representations received arising from the 2004-05 financial year information published in December 2005, the SPCB will expand explanatory notes for the 2005-06 information on allowances which are pooled.</p>

  <p>Our contractor is currently reviewing its menus to introduce traditional and contemporary Scottish dishes in the members&rsquo; dining room.</p>

  <p>The SPCB cannot adopt a policy which specifies that all produce must be Scottish as this is not permissible under European procurement law. We pursue sustainable development objectives in the catering service contract in line with our Responsible Purchasing Policy. This covers, for example, food production, packaging, wastage, nutrition, healthy food, freshness, fair trade products and local sourcing. We encourage local supply. The contract already specifies the use of fresh and seasonal produce and our contractor is working with us in the sourcing of local produce taking account of quality, price and health and safety standards of suppliers. Examples of locally sourced products are, salmon, pork, most root vegetables, cheese and milk.</p>
