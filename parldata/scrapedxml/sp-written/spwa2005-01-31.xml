  <p>Section 25 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 imposes a duty on the Environment Agency to, by a system of licences, regulate fishing for salmon and trout and, except where excused by a Minister of the Crown, apply the same system to regulate fishing for all freshwater fish or eels. Section 25 applies to England and Wales and to so much of the Esk as is situated in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Article 4 of the Scotland Act 1998 (Border Rivers) Order 1999 provides the relevant framework for the Esk to be regulated by the Environment Agency, with any proposals having to be agreed by both Westminster and Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>In relation to children, we have recently published for consultation <em>Children and Young People's Mental Health: A Framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care</em>. This is intended to assist local health, education and social work services in planning and delivering integrated approaches to children and young people's mental health, including for those children and young people with autistic spectrum disorder.</p>

  <p>In addition, a national conference on medical interventions for people with autistic spectrum disorders is being planned for later this year. The conference will consider a range of health issues, including mental health problems.</p>

  <p>The Executive made a commitment in our transport white paper, <em>Scotland&rsquo;s</em> <em>Transport Future</em> , to carry out a two-phase review of the tolled bridges in Scotland, including the Forth and Tay road bridges. Phase one of the review is now complete and the resulting report is available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/enterprise/tobr-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/enterprise/tobr-00.asp</a> . The phase one report includes the terms of reference for phase two. Phase two will specifically consider the impact of future tolls on both the Tay and Forth road bridges looking specifically at congestion, pollution and the environment. A major issue will be how to reduce the significant number of single occupancy vehicles using both bridges.</p>

  <p>The Parents&rsquo; Demand for and Access to Childcare in Scotland research published in 2004 found that 65% of parents did not pay for their child care. Of those who did pay, 72% found it easy to pay for their child care, 26% found it difficult to meet the costs, and 2% found it very difficult. Cost of child care for those on low to moderate income is being addressed through enhancements to the child care element of tax credits, with the maximum cost of child care eligible for tax credits increasing to &pound;175 for one child and &pound;300 for two or more from April 2005 (currently &pound;135 and &pound;200 respectively), and the maximum proportion of costs funded by the child care element increasing from 70% to 80% from April 2006. We are not currently considering the commissioning of further research.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it assesses the success of the civic participation initiatives that it has supported since 1999, including the work of its Civic Participation Unit and of external organisations; what benchmarks it considers should be used in assessing the development of a more participatory democracy in Scotland, and how it envisages this work progressing over the next five years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is strongly committed to the principle of civic participation and we support a range of different approaches to developing this commitment. This includes providing support for a number of organisations who promote civic participation as well as specific initiatives such as promoting citizenship education in schools; supporting volunteering and the voluntary sector, and promoting community engagement through community planning partnerships.</p>

  <p>We have encouraged increased opportunities for civic participation and stakeholder engagement by building a consistent approach to public consultation into our policy making processes. The Executive&rsquo;s Consultation Registration and Evaluation System (CRES) was set up in December 2003 by the civic participation research team in our office of the chief researcher to record details of all Scottish Executive (SE) consultation activity and the online SE consultation service enables registered users to receive weekly updates on new consultation activity across the Executive. Over 780 consultations have taken place since 1999, including the recent consultation on smoking in public places, which attracted over 53,000 responses.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the successful achievement of policy outcomes is also at the heart of our approach to delivering professional policy, and this encourages the sharing of good practice and the development of policies better tailored to meet the needs of the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>We will continue to consider every specific proposal for developing civic participation in public policy development on its own merits, in accordance with our principles, policy priorities, and the need to ensure value for money.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Business Crime Centre (SBCC) is a partnership involving the Executive as principal sponsors, Association of Chief Police Officers of Scotland and leading retail, business and commerce organisations. The SBCC has for a number of years provided advice and guidance on crime reduction and prevention to all types and scale of business in all parts of the community.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided &pound;1 million over three years for the establishment of Safe City Centre initiatives in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling, Inverness and Perth. We have agreed to extend the Initiative to other towns in Scotland and a decision on the towns which will be invited to participate will be made soon.</p>

  <p>Retail businesses have also benefited from public space CCTV systems funded by the Scottish Executive. In Partnership for a Better Scotland, the Scottish Executive committed to expand CCTV in shopping and other areas, supporting businesses and others to reduce crime. &pound;1 million has been allocated in 2005-06 for this and decisions will be made soon on how this commitment will be delivered.</p>

  <p>The UK government has signed up for Part II (general principles) of the charter with regard to Scots and Gaelic and Part III which seeks to translate the general principles into specific undertakings, for Gaelic. The Scottish Executive is committed to policies which will assist the UK government to meet the charter obligations for which it has responsibility in relation to Gaelic and Scots. The Scottish Executive considers Gaelic and Scots to be important aspects of Scotland&rsquo;s distinctive linguistic and cultural heritage and seeks to give expression to the general principles in its policies. In relation to Gaelic the Scottish Executive is also taking action in areas such as education, media, public services and cultural activities. These actions include the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill and a National Languages Strategy. The UK government will provide a detailed report to the Council of Europe on Charter compliance in 2005.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are content that the UK Gambling Bill will provide them with a wider range of controls under the new system than at present.</p>

  <p>The bill provides for three types of casinos &ndash; small, large and regional. The UK Government has now announced that, initially, the number of new casinos will be limited to eight of each type throughout Great Britain. However, the decision on the location of any new casinos in Scotland will only be taken in consultation with Scottish ministers and this will be reflected on the face of the bill.</p>

  <p>All new casinos will need to be licensed by a new regulatory body, the Gambling Commission, who will be responsible for regulating gambling and for operating and personal licences. Social responsibility will be an explicit condition of an operating licence, with breaches triggering penalties or even loss of licence.</p>

  <p>The bill also provides local authority Licensing Boards with power to decide whether to license any category of casino in their areas.</p>

  <p>Casinos will be allowed to install more gaming machines than at present, but their numbers will be capped. Only regional casinos will be allowed to install slot machines offering the potential to win unlimited prizes. This is reserved.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The Scottish Executive has funded the establishment of a database, which will hold information on all hepatitis C virus infected persons in clinical care throughout Scotland. It is anticipated that this database will be functioning by late 2005. The database will hold information on numbers of persons in clinical care, eligible for antiviral therapy and being administered antiviral therapy, and on waiting times for antiviral therapy.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Prisoners known to have hepatitis C are referred to specialist NHS services for assessment and treatment. Prison health professionals ensure that hepatitis C status, when confirmed in prison and for those established on treatment, is known to their next health care provider, whether in prison or the community following release.</p>

  <p>Under good clinical practice individual clinicians will consider and discuss with their patients the implications of aspects of lifestyle for their well-being and long-term treatment prospects. This should include discussion of both diet and alcohol intake.</p>

  <p>Although there are no plans at present to implement programmes aimed at alcohol reduction or dietary education specifically for people diagnosed with hepatitis C, the Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems commits the Executive to a programme of culture change. This involves a range of activities including communications, the role of which is to prompt the general public to think about their drinking and to encourage a sense of personal responsibility for the negative cost of alcohol problems.</p>

  <p>The wider Healthy Living campaign aims to encourage and motivate everyone to take on the challenge of making daily health improving decisions about their diet and physical activity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has commissioned hepatitis C clinicians, working in association with Health Protection Scotland, to establish a hepatitis C Clinical Database. Data managers have started to enter retrospective and prospective data, held in different clinical settings throughout Scotland, onto a dedicated database. It is anticipated that data will be ready for analysis in late 2005. These data, when examined together with laboratory diagnoses data held at Health Protection Scotland, will allow us to understand better the effectiveness of care pathways relating to hepatitis C positive individuals from different risk groups and will help us to determine the optimal configuration of services for such persons.</p>

  <p>A Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network for Hepatitis C has been established to determine evidence-based optimal approaches to hepatitis C care and proposals for a Managed Clinical Network for Hepatitis are also being developed.</p>

  <p>On the treatment of drug misuse, the Executive published a summary of our Review of Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Services on 27 October 2004 in the form of an action plan which contains several recommendations aimed at Improving Service Quality and Consistency. It is for local Drug Action Teams and constituent partners to plan and deliver the full range of drug treatment and care services in line with identified need and local priorities.</p>

  <p>In 2005, courts throughout Scotland will continue to have access to a range of community based penalties which contain an element of community reparation. These include both Community Service Orders and Probation Orders - where the court has imposed an additional condition of unpaid work in the community. Supervised Attendance Orders, which are a penalty for fine default, can also include a requirement to carry out unpaid work within the community.</p>

  <p>In addition, from spring of this year both District and Sheriff Courts in the Dundee, Inverness and Greenock areas will have access to a new Community Reparation Order, provided for within the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004, as part of a two year Scottish Executive funded pilot scheme.</p>

  <p>The role of the Executive is to ensure that courts have access to a sufficient range of appropriately resourced sentencing options. Sentencing decisions are for the courts. There is a continuing increase in the use by courts of community based penalties, including Community Service Orders, which provide for reparation to be made to communities through a specified period of unpaid work. The 1% increase in the number of Community Service Orders in 2003-04 followed a 13% increase the previous year. Similarly there was a 10% increase in 2003-04 in the number of Supervised Attendance Orders, which contain an element of community reparation, imposed by courts in dealing with fine defaulters.</p>

  <p>A new development for 2005-06 is commencement of two year Executive funded pilots of Community Reparation Orders to deal with antisocial behaviour. Both District and Sheriff Courts within the pilot areas of Dundee, Inverness and Greenock will have access to this new sentence. As a statutory duty local authorities require to carry out consultation of appropriate groups within their areas on the nature of placements to be carried out by those subject to a Community Reparation Order.</p>

  <p>An offer of treatment arranged by the NHS under contract with an independent health care sector is an offer of treatment from the NHS.</p>

  <p>As we announced in Fair to All, Personal to Each, published on 15 December 2004, from the end of 2007 patients who refuse a reasonable offer of treatment will be moved to the end of the waiting list. By the end of 2007, that will mean a maximum wait of 18 weeks.</p>

  <p>There is no reason why an offer of treatment arranged by the NHS under contract with an independent healthcare provider should be regarded any differently from treatment provided by the NHS.</p>

  <p><sup><a name="nhsp" id="nhsp"></a>P</sup>Provisional.</p>

  <p>The distributions of both out-patients and in-patients/day cases and out-patients are very skewed making the median the more appropriate measure. The mean is highly sensitive to the small number of unusually high values in the long tail of the distribution. A significant number of those waiting for a long time will have been delayed due to failing to attend, cancelling an offer of an appointment or having medical/social constraints that prevent admission for treatment.</p>

  <p>Neither the mean nor the median are targets for NHSScotland and they are only summary measures for patients awaiting in-patient/daycase hospital care where reducing maximum waiting times is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s priority. They take no account of the annual 465,000 emergency admissions, where patients are admitted immediately and they take no account of the annual 26.5 million face-to-face contacts with the primary care team.</p>

  <p>The choice of projection period reflects user demand and the increasing uncertainty of projections as the period is extended, particularly for smaller populations. A 40 year period has been used since 1970 for the projections for the constituent countries of the UK, including Scotland.

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Information on the Scottish Prison Service&rsquo;s (SPS) performance on targets set for 2002-03 and 2003-04 is covered by the SPS Publication Scheme and was published in the SPS Annual Report for 2003-04. This was laid before Parliament on 14 October 2004 and is available on the SPS website (<a href="http://www.sps.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.sps.gov.uk</a>). Performance so far in 2004-05 is similar to that in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Pay is a matter for local authorities. The Scottish Executive has been working to increase the pool of social workers. This has included a Social Work Fast Track Graduate Scheme which will produce up to 520 additional new social workers by 2008, with the first 97 trainees graduating over the coming months. The numbers of Fast Track and qualified undergraduates in social work are rising each year and, over the next three years, we expect there will be an additional 650 new social workers joining the labour force each year. We have established an incentive scheme to encourage newly-qualified graduates into areas of significant shortage. There has also been an on-going recruitment media campaign since 2002 and promotion of the new social work degree. Figures show a 25% increase in qualifying social workers between 2002 and 2003 and a 25% increase in new social work students between 2003 and 2004. While recognising the need for a continuing commitment to the sector, significant progress has been made to address the need for social worker services across Scotland, including those areas with highest levels of deprivation.</p>

  <p>&quot;Choose Life&quot; the national strategy and action plan to prevent suicide was launched by the Scottish Executive in December 2002. Good progress is being made in implementing the main objectives and milestones set out in the strategy. In relation to new practices and procedures, a number of areas are worth highlighting.</p>

  <p>A national suicide prevention training strategy is being developed, the main component of this is a training programme called ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) training. There are now 90 accredited trainers across Scotland, this will rise to 150 trainers by March 2005. These trainers then cascade the training in their local areas and relevant organisations and networks.</p>

  <p>Progress is being made in developing partnerships with key agencies to help target suicide prevention work at particular target and high-risk groups. Such groups include the Scottish Prison Service, Samaritans and Childline. Further to this work, all 32 local authority areas now have in place a local Choose Life co-ordinator and local action plan. Work on implementing these action plans has now begun.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why eligibility for the Teacher Induction Scheme is restricted to those graduating from a Scottish higher education institution with a teaching qualification whose training has been publicly funded.</p>

  <p>Eligibility is restricted because the number of eligible teachers is controlled by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to match teacher workforce requirements.</p>

  <p>It would be possible to extend eligibility to include all teacher education institutions elsewhere in the UK, but we would not be able to limit eligibility to individual institutions. We would therefore be opening ourselves to an indeterminate number of applications, for the most part without teaching vacancies being available.</p>

  <p>We regularly review eligibility for the induction scheme, but it is extremely unlikely it will ever be extended to guarantee places to individuals graduating from elsewhere in the UK.</p>

  <p>No funding has been given by the Scottish Executive to local authorities for specific traffic management projects. The only Executive funding awarded to Dumfries and Galloway Council for specific public transport projects has been from the Public Transport Fund, in line with the guidance issued to local authorities for the relevant bidding round. The following table sets out the total value of allocations awarded to the council from the fund, for those projects involving public transport infrastructure construction and enhancement.</p>

  <p>The table also gives the allocations received by the Council for Cycling, Walking and Safer Streets (CWSS) projects. Whilst it is for local authorities to determine what specific projects should be supported with these allocations, we understand that most of Dumfries and Galloway Council&rsquo;s allocations have gone towards infrastructure construction and enhancement.</p>

  <p>Under existing financial commitments, Dumfries and Galloway Council has an allocation in 2005-06 of &pound;412,000 from the Public Transport Fund for its southern sector access strategy. The council will also receive cycling, walking and safer streets allocations of &pound;252,000, &pound;256,000 and &pound;262,000 in 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively, which may be used towards infrastructure projects.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the claim by Homes for Scotland that less than 50% of the land currently approved for new housing can be developed due to lack of investment by Scottish Water, what action the Executive will take to address this issue.</p>

  <p>The issue of constraints on new development was addressed in the Executive&rsquo;s recent consultation <em>Investing in Water Services 2006-2014</em> (Bib. number 33325), and it will be addressed in the next investment programme commencing in April 2006. A Ministerial Statement outlining priorities for this programme will be made in the Parliament shortly.</p>

  <p>As part of <em>Paying for Water Services 2006-2010</em> , the Executive recently consulted on the principle of developers funding increased local capacity required by their developments. A Ministerial Statement including our decisions on this will be made in the Parliament shortly.</p>

  <p>Further detailed provision on meeting the costs of new connections to the water services infrastructure will be set out in regulations to be made under the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003. We will consult on the draft regulations later this year.</p>
