  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to bring forward the commencement order in respect of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 in order to ensure that home owners do not continue to face demands from feudal superiors for payments for waiver of title conditions and whether it will canvass MSPs in order to establish how widespread this practice continues to be.</p>

  <p>We will bring forward the commencement order in due course. The Property Law Reform programme is a package and we will assess the appropriate date for commencement when the next Bill in the package &#8211; the Title Conditions Bill &#8211; has been enacted. We expect to consult on a draft Title Conditions Bill in the spring. Meantime, we have no plans to conduct a survey of MSPs, but would of course be happy to receive any information from them.</p>

  <p>Monitoring of depleted uranium in the environment is already undertaken by the Radiation Protection Services of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. The Scottish Executive has no plans to instigate additional monitoring.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Ministry of Defence that 6,907 depleted uranium projectiles have been fired into the Solway Firth from the Dundrennan Range, Kirkcudbright, and 315 into Luce Bay from the West Freugh Range, near Stranraer. These projectiles are not explosive.</p>

  <p>It is for the Chief Constable in consultation with his joint police board to determine priorities within the budget set for the force. Funding is allocated to forces in total and is not earmarked by the Executive for specific purposes.</p>

  <p>The policy priorities and programme for government of the Scottish Executive are encapsulated in <i>Working together for Scotland &#8211; a Programme for Government</i> , published today. It sets out what the Executive has done, and what we will do in the future to build a modern, prosperous and socially just Scotland. It also reports on progress and achievements against the commitments we set out in the first programme for government, <i>Making it work together</i> , published in September 1999.</p>

  <p>A copy of <i>Working together for Scotland &#8211; a Programme for Government</i> is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 10911). Additional copies are available in the Document Supply Centre.</p>
