The Executive is currently discussing the implications for Scotland with the Department for Transport.

Intervention by the Scottish ministers generally occurs only where a proposed development raises an issue of national importance, or where proposals represent a significant departure from the approved structure plan for the area and/or national planning guidance.

  <p>Dr Richard Simpson met representatives from Nil by Mouth on 12 August 2002 at a meeting of the cross-party working group on possible legislation to tackle religious hatred. The organisation attended at the working group&rsquo;s invitation to discuss a range of issues relating to tackling the problem of sectarianism. Nil by Mouth is currently receiving funding from the Education Department to raise awareness amongst young people of sectarianism and bigotry, and contribute to education for citizenship in schools and youth groups.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range if issues including collection of student loan repayments.</p>

  <p>There is no income threshold for payment of the graduate endowment.</p>

  <p>Many hotels in Scotland already accept the euro, while some hotels and restaurants routinely bill their customers in euros as well as in sterling. All of Historic Scotland&rsquo;s many visitor attractions also accept the euro. Decisions on whether to accept the currency is a commercial decision for owners of individual tourism businesses, but I would encourage all who wish to attract more overseas visitors to consider doing so.</p>

  <p>The Executive is well aware of the importance to Scottish tourism of the Irish market. The number of visits from the Republic of Ireland more than doubled between 2000 and 2001. VisitScotland already works closely with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board on a number of issues of mutual interest, including quality grading and marketing. In addition, VisitScotland recently visited Dublin to hold discussions with Bord Failte and Tourism Ireland (the latter being responsible for the whole of Ireland) to explore opportunities for research collaboration, and joint marketing opportunities to exploit the Celtic brand. These discussions will be followed up during 2003.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive/Voluntary Sector Forum met in June and October 2001 and in April and December 2002.</p>

  <p>The joint review of the Scottish Compact in 2000-01 recommended that a monitoring framework should be developed based on agreed indicators for the Scottish Executive, its agencies, non-departmental public bodies and the voluntary sector. A joint Compact Review Group was established in May 2002 to advise on the development of such a monitoring and evaluation framework and this group aims to report to the forum early next summer. Further monitoring of the compact will be undertaken in due course once a robust framework is in place.</p>
