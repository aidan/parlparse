  <p>Reducing harmful drinking by children and young people is one of the key priorities of the <i>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</i> , published on 18 January 2002. The plan sets out a range of action in relation to school and community-based education. There is also action to ensure children affected by alcohol problems have access to appropriate services and new resources for parents to help them to discuss alcohol issues with their children. We are also continuing to provide support to Health Education Board for Scotland and Alcohol Focus Scotland to provide information and advice on the dangers of under-age and excessive drinking and undertake preventative activities with schools and youth and community groups.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made &#163;3.3 million available through central budgets in this financial year to support local and national action to tackle alcohol problems. A breakdown of funding to tackle harmful drinking by children and young people is not available.</p>

  <p>Voluntary proof of age was an integral part of the Scottish Executive funded Dialogue Youth and Young Scot smart card pilot project. Under the pilot, cards containing a digital photograph and verified date of birth were offered to all secondary school pupils in Angus, Glasgow, Argyll and Bute and Edinburgh. Take-up of the card was between 80 and 90% and the young people themselves requested that the proof of age element be maintained and accredited.</p>

  <p>A full roll-out of the card to all 32 local authority areas is now planned, resulting in some 375,000 cards being issued by the end of 2004. Accreditation for the card is being sought under the British Retail Consortium's Proof of Age Standard Scheme, the outcome of which is expected in the spring.</p>

  <p>The resources allocated by the Executive to local authorities to support carers will have risen from &#163;5 million in 1999-2000 to &#163;21 million in 2003-04. This level of investment will be sustained over the next three years and increased in line with pay and inflation. In addition to this, local government finance settlements for the next three years include substantial extra sums for social care. We are working closely with local authorities, the NHS and carer representatives to develop policy guidance for health and social care practitioners around the new rights for carers contained in the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002, as well as comprehensive new best practice guidance in supporting carers. Both sets of guidance will address the importance of delivering effective outcomes for carers through assessment.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a duty under the Social Work (Scotland) 1968 Act to assess the needs of and provide appropriate services to people who appear to need them. Any decision taken about care needs by social work departments should be based on a detailed assessment of the individual&#146;s needs and wishes. This year we are providing &#163;1.38 billion to help local authorities deliver social work services.</p>

  <p>It is up to local authorities to decide how these resources should be deployed to best meet local needs and priorities. Should an individual feel that a local authority is neglecting its statutory obligation to provide appropriate community care services they may pursue the matter further through the relevant local authority's complaints procedure.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s Policy Unit undertook a &quot;snapshot&quot; study in 1999 to estimate public sector expenditure on drug-related activities. The study estimated that around &#163;56 million per annum is spent in Scotland on targeted programmes and interventions specifically aimed at the drugs problem, and a further &#163;85 million per annum is spent on tackling drugs through generic expenditure programmes. A broad breakdown of these figures is as follows:</p>

  <p>There is a strong economic case for seeking to encourage more people to come and live in Scotland, whether they are wishing to return to Scotland or indeed live in Scotland for the first time.</p>

  <p>In a speech on 25 February, the First Minister announced that he wished to see progress made in areas such as the better promotion of Scotland as a place to live and work, working with the UK government to better promote the work permit system in Scotland and encouraging overseas students to stay in Scotland after they complete their studies.</p>

  <p>An implementation team has already been set up within the Executive to drive progress forward on this issue, which will also take external advice as required.</p>

  <p>This will build upon work already undertaken, such as the TalentScotland initiative developed by Scottish Enterprise, which is creating awareness of the job opportunities in Scotland amongst electronic engineers from all over the world.</p>

  <p>The Crown Agent's report will be published today.</p>

  <p>The Lord Advocate and I welcome the report, which provides a careful and reasoned diagnosis of the fragmentation in our criminal justice system. The report describes how a more coherent approach could be achieved. We are committed to a "joined-up" approach at local and national level and will now study the details to see how this can best be put into practice.</p>

  <p>As the report shows, local co-ordination and liaison are of fundamental importance and we very much hope it will be possible to implement arrangements to bring together criminal justice agencies into closer working relationships at local level. We will be discussing further with Sheriffs Principal what role they might play in convening such arrangements, bearing in mind the limits of their statutory responsibility to secure the speedy and efficient disposal of business in the sheriff courts of their sheriffdom.</p>

  <p>We also propose to set up a national Criminal Justice System (CJS) Board, consisting of the chief officers of the main criminal justice agencies.</p>

  <p>The remit of the board will be to make recommendations on the overall aims, objectives and targets for the Criminal Justice System and to monitor the performance of the system as a whole. To enable the board to carry out its remit, members will be invited to share information and to consider how information on the performance of the system as a whole should be presented and measured.</p>

  <p>We have discussed with the judiciary their possible involvement in the national board to be sure that nothing the Executive does risks being seen to compromise their independence.</p>

  <p>A High Court judge will attend the national CJS Board when issues that would benefit from judicial input at that level arise. The Convenor of the Sheriffs Principal has also agreed to attend the board.</p>

  <p>We are anxious to ensure that closer local working relationships are based on practical projects with achievable results.</p>

  <p>To this end, we plan to set up one or more funded pilot projects to illustrate how a joined-up approach could be implemented at local level. The pilots will be in the area of the summary criminal business of the sheriff courts, with particular reference to eliminating avoidable delay. We are already committed, under Action Point 10 of our youth crime action plan, to considering measures to increase the speed of referral to the courts, and the introduction of specific targets discussed with the judiciary.</p>

  <p>The pilots would be overseen by the national CJS Board.</p>

  <p>This report complements the report by Lord Bonomy on improving the efficiency of the High Court, and the work being undertaken by Sheriff Principal McInnes&#146;s Committee on summary justice. Together, these three reviews will pave the way for the most radical improvements in our criminal justice system for over 20 years.</p>

  <p>Andrew Normand has already consulted extensively but we would welcome wider debate. We have therefore placed a copy of the report on the Scottish Executive website, and in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. We are sending the report to key organisations within the criminal justice system and making copies available to other organisations and to the general public on request and we would welcome any comments they wish to offer.</p>

The consultation paper set out a range of issues for consideration including two major themes of making the lottery more responsive to the needs and priorities of communities, and ensuring that funding is fairly distributed to all areas and communities across the UK.</p>

  <p>I have written to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport conveying Scottish ministers&#146; views in the light of the Scottish consultation responses. Copies of the letter have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26471).</p>

  <p>The Nursing and Midwifery Council have set advisory standards for the preparation of mentors who support, educate and assess student nurses and midwives in practice placements. All higher education institutions run in-house mentorship preparation programmes to meet these advisory standards and the demands of their own pre-registration programme. All mentors are required to complete one of these programmes prior to becoming a mentor of students. This ensures a degree of consistency for both nurses and students.</p>

  <p>The placement of students within NHS board areas is organised by higher education institutions in close partnership with their local trusts. Decisions about number of students in each placement are therefore made locally and subject to negotiation. All these partnerships are trying to ensure maximum use of placements, including in remote and rural areas.</p>

  <p>A report to be published by NHS Education on 20 March will describe a national approach to the identification and allocation of practice placements in conjunction with ISD. This will reduce the consistency of usage of practice placements, although still taking into account local needs and demands.</p>

  <p>I have asked Bob Millar, Chief Executive, Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Paisley Partnership Regeneration Company receives Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) funding and as such is subject to the same monitoring and appraisal processes as all Social Inclusion Partnerships.</p>

  <p>Under Communities Scotland&#146;s Standard Terms and Conditions of Grant for the SIP fund, Renfrewshire Council&#146;s role as grant recipient is to ensure effective appraisal, monitoring and financial systems are in place so that the costs of each activity which receives SIP funding and the outputs generated can be clearly identified, value for money demonstrated, and the propriety and regularity of all payments and handling of SIP fund funding ensured. The council&#146;s audit department were acting in this capacity when carrying out the recent financial health check on Paisley Partnership Regeneration Company. In addition, the Monitoring Framework for SIPs also provides for annual monitoring and appraisal of SIPs by Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>SIPs are also subject to independent evaluation at appropriate points in their life cycle. Paisley Partnership&#146;s 2001 evaluation concluded that in broad terms the Paisley SIP was making good progress towards its aims and that many of the projects funded by the SIP represented good value for money.</p>

  <p>Young Scottish students studying full-time HE courses in Scotland from 2001-02 are entitled to have up to &#163;2,050 of their annual loan support replaced by a Young Students&#146; Bursary (YSB). Young Scottish students studying elsewhere in the UK for the first time from 2002-03 onwards are entitled to an annual Young Students&#146; Outside Scotland Bursary (YSO) of up to &#163;510, which is provided in addition to their student loan entitlement. Both bursaries are provided as an entitlement based on the level of parental income and eligibility is assessed as part of the overall assessment of eligibility for student support.</p>

  <p>In academic year 2001-02, there were 13,579 recipients of YSB of whom 4,978 received the maximum award (&#163;2,000 in 2001-02). In the current academic year to date, 21,384 YSB awards and 317 YSO awards have been made with 8,917 and 250 students, respectively, receiving the maximum award.</p>

  <p>Non-repayable supplementary grants are also available for those students who have additional financial needs, such as students who have dependants or who have a disability. Additional discretionary grants are also available from individual colleges and universities for new mature students with child care costs and for any student who faces particular financial difficulties, which might prevent them from accessing or continuing their course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring that enforcement procedures are fair and transparent through the provision of a public charter for the Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland. This charter will therefore seek to comply with the Executive&#146;s charter policy and the principles of the Cabinet Office Enforcement Concordat. The Executive&#146;s commitment started with the publication of the consultation document and will conclude with the publication of the charter itself.</p>
