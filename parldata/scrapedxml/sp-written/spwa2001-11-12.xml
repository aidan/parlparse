  <p>As indicated in the answer to question S1W-12490 on 29 January 2001, we will bring forward the commencement order in due course. The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 is the first part of our programme of property law reform, and we will assess the appropriate date for commencement when the next Bill in the programme &ndash; the Title Conditions Bill &ndash; has been enacted. The consultation exercise on the draft Title Conditions Bill concluded on 23 July, and the responses to consultation are being analysed with a view to introduction as soon as an opportunity arises in the legislative programme. Due to the transitional arrangements that will have to be made, it is unlikely that either piece of legislation will be fully in effect until two to three years have elapsed.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any possible benefits arising from the delayed introduction of all of the provisions of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 are outweighed by the continued possession of powers of feudal superiors to extract payment from vassals in exchange for the grant of Minutes of Waiver.</p>

  <p>The delay is required in order to allow transitional arrangements to be put in place. Both the Scottish Law Commission and the Law Society of Scotland have suggested that commencement of the 2000 Act should be delayed for a period of at least two years to allow for these arrangements.</p>

  <p>It was always apparent that the provisions of the 2000 Act on feudal burdens might be affected by the proposed Title Conditions Bill. It would be unfair and undesirable to allow superiors to go to the expense and effort of identifying properties for which they could register notices to preserve burdens, when the position for feudal burdens might be amended by the Title Conditions Bill. We also undertook to reconsider certain aspects of the 2000 Act which were criticised during its passage. To implement Part 4 of the Act (on real burdens) now would ignore these legitimate concerns.</p>

  <p>It is possible at present for vassals to apply, under section 1 of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970, to seek an order from the Lands Tribunal for Scotland to vary or discharge a land obligation. The Tribunal will grant such an order if it is satisfied that the burden is unreasonable, inappropriate, unduly burdensome or impedes some reasonable use of the land.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers remain wholly committed to the reform of the land tenure system in Scotland and any delay is restricted to that which is essential in order to ensure an orderly and sensible transition.</p>

  <p>The financial impact of Aggregates Tax on local authorities will depend on their individual purchasing policies. The aim of the new tax is to promote a change of behaviour amongst purchasers by encouraging the use of recycled aggregates and other alternative materials in place of virgin quarried aggregates. It will have no impact on council tax.</p>

  <p>The non-domestic rate poundage is set by the Scottish Parliament, and there is no reason for this to change as a consequence of the Aggregates Tax.</p>

  <p>Information on the number, names and locations of quarries in Scotland can be found in the British Geological Survey&rsquo;s <i>Directory of Mines and Quarries 1998</i> . A copy of this is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17129). We are not able to predict the economic impacts of a tax measure on individual quarries, and assessing the broader impact on the quarrying industry is the responsibility of HM Treasury.

  <p>E-retailing offers significant opportunities to rural residents, who will have increased choice of goods for purchase. Mail-order shopping, which faces the same delivery situation as e-retailing, is and has always been very popular in rural Scotland. There is therefore no apparent significant difficulty regarding delivery of goods purchased electronically to remoter parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Since January this year, the Scottish Household Survey has asked detailed questions about what the internet is used for currently and what it is likely to be used for in future. The results of these questions will be analysed and broken down by geographical area. This will help show whether residents of remoter areas shop online less than their urban counterparts. Results will be published after data analysis is completed.</p>

  <p>A broad range <strong> </strong> of <strong> </strong> community disposals are available across Scotland for both female and male offenders. These include probation, community service orders and supervised attendance orders for female and male fine defaulters who might otherwise be facing a custodial sentence. Drug Treatment and Testing Orders and Restriction of Liberty Orders are also currently available in a number of courts. We have provided funding for diversion from prosecution schemes to allow all procurators fiscal access to local schemes and made female accused one of the four target groups.</p>

  <p>We are now moving forward with plans for the national roll-out of Restriction of Liberty Orders by May next year, and I have announced the extension of Drug Treatment and Testing Orders to a further seven sheriff courts.

  <p>It is not possible to give an average waiting time in each area. Following assessment and diagnosis in their own areas, patients considered to be suffering from sleep apnoea are referred to the Sleep Centre in Edinburgh. Decisions on the need for a CPAP machine are taken at that stage. Waiting times, therefore, differ, based on the length of time taken at the various stages of the process.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to reform the law in relation to rights of servitude and whether the power of feudal superiors and landowners in relation to the law of servitude and, in particular, on denial of rights of access should be reformed.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-11-12.S1W-19442.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80167" speakername="Iain Gray" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1112.htm#8">

  <p>The Executive has no plans to introduce a fundamental reform of the law relating to servitude rights, but the proposed Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill contains a number of consequential changes to the law on servitudes as a result of the reform of the law on real burdens. As drafted, the Bill will prevent the future creation of negative servitudes (which are usually restrictions on building for the protection of light or prospect), and will convert the few existing negative servitudes into real burdens. Servitudes which are expressly created by title deeds will have to be registered against both the burdened and the benefited properties. These servitudes which are constituted by registration will also no longer be restricted in type to the list of servitudes currently set out in a rule of law. The Bill will also make it clear that it is possible for a right to lead a pipe, cable or wire over land to be constituted as a positive servitude.</p>

  <p>The use of servitudes is not directly linked to feudal superiorities since a servitude is created for the benefit of a proprietor of land to exercise certain rights on or over adjoining land: it is not possible for a bare superiority to be the dominant tenement, or benefited property, in respect of a servitude. After the appointed day for feudal abolition, servitudes will remain an obligation enjoyed by one property in respect of another.</p>

  <p>Servitudes are separate from public rights of way. The law of servitudes is used to create rights for limited purposes, for example rights of access, not to deny rights of access.</p>

  <p>The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will provide a right of responsible access to land and inland water for recreation and passage. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code provides guidance on the rights and responsibilities of public access. It is intended that the Bill will be introduced in Parliament shortly.</p>

  <p>The underspend arose for two reasons. 2001 was the first year of the new scheme and certain assumptions had to be made about the correct split of improved pasture and rough grazing. These were subsequently adjusted. The second reason was that the 2001 scheme limited gains to sparsely stocked farms by imposing minimum stocking densities. In 2001 this latter change reduced the area of eligible rough grazing by 24% and improved pasture by 2%.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what changes have been made in the provision of winter snow clearance cover resulting from the appointment of new contractors to manage the maintenance of the trunk road network, broken down by contract area.</p>

  <p>The winter maintenance specification, and level of service in the Scottish Executive contracts with the new trunk road Operating Companies, remains unaltered from that provided in the previous contracts.</p>

  <p>The Executive held a conference at Victoria Quay on 25 September entitled &quot;Ready for Winter &ndash; Winter Maintenance on Scotland&rsquo;s Roads&quot;. The conference, which was attended by representatives from the Operating Companies, local authorities, the police, motoring organisations and other winter maintenance professionals, enabled the Executive to bring all those involved together to discuss issues relating to winter maintenance in order to provide the best possible service to the travelling public this winter.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s policy is that all procurement should be on the basis of value for money, in the interests of the taxpayer. The Executive does not routinely purchase the types of product which are available under &quot;fair trade&quot; schemes. Where such products are purchased, fair trade brands may be selected where they offer value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-17989 on 14 September 2001, which sets out full details of the virement proposals, and I would particularly highlight the fourth paragraph which clarifies the position with the Inclusion Programme.</p>

  <p>In the White Paper <i>A New Future for Communications</i> , the UK Government has set out tests which must be met before the analogue signal is fully switched to digital. Everyone who currently receives analogue television now must be able to receive the main free-to-air channels digitally. The target timetable for switch over is between 2006 and 2010.</p>

  <p>Latest available figures on the economic impact of tourist expenditure on retail products are from the 1998 Scottish Input-Output Tables, published by the Scottish Executive in June 2001.</p>

  <p>The total direct expenditure on retail products by tourists was &#163;140 million in 1998. The additional Scottish output related to this expenditure was estimated at &#163;85 million.</p>

  <p>Expenditure on retail products has been defined as purchases of Scottish made products (Input-Output groups 1 to 84, see www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/docs/io98.pdf for more details) and Scottish retail margins on both domestic output and imports.</p>

  <p>Last month, the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland, Alan Sutherland, submitted advice to me as a result of his Strategic Review of Charges. This advice is set out below.</p>

  <p>After careful consideration, I have decided to accept the commissioner&rsquo;s advice. The commissioner has also made a number of further recommendations, with which I am broadly content and on which I will take forward discussions with him. The commissioner has a legal duty to publish his advice and ministers' response to it and has made the full text of all the relevant material available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The advice I have accepted is as follows:</p>

  <p>Note:</p>

  <p>1. Projected 2001-02 revenue for the proposed Scottish Water differs from the sum of the projected revenues from the three existing authorities because of inter-authority trading</p>

  <p>iii) Harmonisation of charges</p>

  <p>Charges should be harmonised across Scotland for both the domestic and non-domestic customers, by no later than 2005-06.</p>

  <p>iv) Cost reflective tariffs</p>

  <p>Scottish Water should seek to develop tariffs that more broadly reflect the economics of the service provided. This will require that the fixed element of the charge faced by customers increases significantly from the current level.</p>
