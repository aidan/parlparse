  <p>To date, no routes to or from Glasgow Airport have been subject to investment from the Interim Route Development Fund. New routes from Glasgow would be eligible, provided they meet the same Scotland-wide criteria that apply to the fund. The fund cannot be used to distort the market, or override commercial decisions of airlines. Glasgow Airport has been, and will continue to be, actively promoted through engagement with airlines.</p>

  <p>The Literature Department of Scottish Arts Council has a budget of &#163;2.1 million which currently supports 10 national literature organisations, direct support to writers and storytellers in the form of bursaries, book awards and writing fellowships; grants to Scottish-based publishers and magazine publishers for commissioning costs, production costs and marketing and promotion; a range of projects and initiatives which support and develop readership throughout Scotland in association with other agencies such as Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals in Scotland; a national network of literature festivals and live literature events; support to publishers overseas with the translation costs of contemporary Scottish literature, and international literary fellowships and exchange programmes. Additional funding through the Writers Factory provides training in screenwriting and new series from publishers and commissioning grants for literary magazines editors.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister's Initiative (PMI), launched in June 1999, aims to attract more overseas students to the UK. The Scottish Executive is involved with the funding and development of this strategy in partnership with other devolved administrations, UK government departments, British Council and Trade Partners UK. Measures to enhance overseas student recruitment as part of the PMI include a three-year branded global marketing campaign, expansion of the Chevening scholarship scheme and streamlining work and visa regulations. A Scottish version of the brand logo and marketing materials have been developed as part of the PMI strategy for use by Scottish institutions and EducationUKScotland on their own promotional materials.</p>

  <p>In addition, EducationUKScotland (formerly Scottish Education and Training) is an initiative supported and funded primarily by the education sectors and also by British Council Scotland. The Scottish Executive has agreed to provide &#163;50,000 per annum to support the activities of the organisation in 2003-04 and 2004-05. In return for that investment, we expect the organisation to take forward some of the recommendations related to overseas students contained in the Framework for Higher Education in Scotland, in partnership with the sectors and other stakeholders. EducationUKScotland&rsquo;s primary objective is to promote Scottish education effectively in overseas markets with the aim of attracting more overseas students to Scottish institutions in all sectors.</p>

  <p>In addition to the activities outlined above, the Executive is also looking more broadly at ways of attracting and retaining fresh talent for Scotland&rsquo;s longer term prosperity.</p>

  <p>The new General Medical Services (GMS) contract will help to increase NHS provision by GPs. The contract offers incentives for GP practices to provide a wider range of services than at present and also introduces a quality and outcomes framework, which for the first time will measure and help improve the quality of clinical care and services patients receive. The contract will be supported by an increase in investment in GMS across Scotland of 33%.</p>

  <p>Discussions on the new contract for community pharmacy contractors are currently on-going with the Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council and decisions on the content and range of services to be provided have yet to be made. However, we will be consolidating and building on the range of professional skills and services that community pharmacists already provide for patients. The opportunity will also be taken to ensure that the new GMS contract and the new community pharmacy complement each other, to improve overall patient care.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for the safety and protection of staff and children rests with employers. This is monitored by the Health and Safety Executive. However, the Scottish Executive is funding a national initiative managed by the Association of Directors of Social Work to support front-line staff. Although not specifically targeted at residential child care staff, this initiative will be of benefit to them.</p>

  <p>The most recent figures available were compiled by the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care and relate to the position in 2001. They indicate that at least 305 staff (10.3%) hold the Diploma in Social Work; at least four staff (0.1%) hold the Scottish Vocational Qualification in Care at Level 4 and at least 247 staff (8.3%) hold the Scottish Vocational Qualification in Care at Level 3 and the Higher National Certificate in Social Care.</p>

  <p>These figures exclude numbers of staff who were in the process of gaining qualifications when the audit was conducted, and so are likely to be an underestimate of qualifications held by the current workforce.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking significant steps to support employers to recruit and retain social work staff. This includes a national recruitment and awareness campaign, financial incentives for training and the commitment to fund the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care until the end of 2009. Financial incentives include a fast-track scheme to fund the training of 120 graduates, provision of a total of &#163;1.2 million for post-graduate bursaries to enable an immediate increase in the number of social work students and an incentive scheme allowing authorities to pay up to &#163;9,000 to undergraduates completing their training from June 2004.</p>

  <p>The draft guidance was developed in partnership with Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and Dumfries and Galloway Council and has consequently been implemented in that area only. The Scottish Executive is consulting the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the Society for Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland and local event organisers about the terms of the draft guidance.</p>

  <p>A number of options for flights were considered in arranging travel for the parliamentary delegation to Catalonia, including the direct flight from Glasgow Prestwick to Girona. In deciding parliamentary travel arrangements account is taken of price, travel arrangements to and from departure and arrival airports and compatibility with the demands of parliamentary business. In the case of the recent parliamentary delegation from Scotland to Catalonia, the most suitable flights were those from Edinburgh to Barcelona via London.</p>

  <p>The Travel Management contract currently in place was awarded in collaboration with the Scottish Executive. This decision was taken on economic grounds, given the usage of the Scottish Executive in comparison to the Parliament, which would influence pricing proposals.</p>

  <p>The contract was awarded following a competitive tendering exercise in which Carlson Wagonlit Travel submitted the most economically advantageous bid.</p>

  <p>The current contract expires in October 2005 but has the option to be extended up to October 2007. A decision on whether the extension will be taken up will be made late next year, and the Procurement Office will review its policy at this time.</p>
