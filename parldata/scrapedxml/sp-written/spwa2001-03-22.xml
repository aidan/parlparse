  <p>The learning disability review, <i>The same as you?</i> , explored the needs of people with autism and learning disability. Twenty-nine recommendations were made, including assessment of local need by local authorities and health boards, and the establishment of a national service network for people with autistic spectrum disorder and a Scottish Centre for Learning Disabilities.</p>

  <p>Health boards and local authorities were also encouraged to identify a named professional who would be responsible for improving local services and linking into the national network.</p>

  <p>The Partnership in Practice agreements, due to be submitted in June, should include proposals for meeting the needs locally of adults with autism.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to supporting individuals with additional support needs into further education, training or employment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Innovation Grants Programme is providing &#163;6 million over three years from April 1999 to support voluntary and non-statutory organisations in the area of special educational needs. Autism has been highlighted as a priority and the programme is currently providing over &#163;500,000 to four voluntary organisations to run six projects specifically aimed at supporting children and their families with autistic spectrum disorder.</p>

  <p>In response to the Beattie Committee, we have made available additional resources of &#163;22.6 million over three years to take forward action. &#163;15.1 million is available for the development of key worker support, improved identification of learning and support needs and tracking. Careers service companies have been asked to co-ordinate multi-agency bids for imaginative projects to improve transition for Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable young people including those with Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome.</p>

  <p>The Learning Disabilities Review recognised the need for more support for people with autistic spectrum disorder. In response to the review, local authorities and health boards will identify named professionals who will be responsible for improving local services for people with autism, linking into a national network.</p>

  <p>The study was carried out by the Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation on behalf of the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) Board. The Executive continues to be in close contact with other UK Health Departments to consider the findings of the report.</p>

  <p>The Executive fully supports the report&#8217;s recommendation that the current uncertainty indicates a need for further research. The UK Government is funding its own studies and providing support for the multinational Electromagnetic Fields Project set up and co-ordinated by the World Health Organisation. The UK Government will also work with the NRPB to begin new research into the factors that lead to certain households having higher levels of EMFs.</p>

  <p>Yes, charity shops are allowed to sell new goods. In order to qualify for rates relief, charity shops must be wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. To satisfy this condition the shop must be used wholly or mainly for the sale of goods donated to the charity and the net proceeds of sale must be applied for the purposes of the charity. This is a matter primarily for local authorities.</p>

  <p>Effective co-operation between law enforcement agencies is an important element in the fight against crime. Record levels of funding mean that, by next year, the number of police officers in Scotland should be the highest ever.

  <p>Addiction to benzodiazepines is part of the wider drug misuse problem. Help is, therefore, available from the wide range of services which cater for people with misuse problems. Depending on the locality, these measures include general medical services and primary health care teams, psychiatric services, community psychiatric nurses, mental health nurses, psychological services and counselling. Also accessible to most drug misusers are drug problem centres, voluntary agencies and self-help groups and counselling services. This list is not definitive.</p>

  <p>Treatment and rehabilitation funding forms an important part of the &#163;100 million package which the Executive has made available for tackling drug misuse. We are determined to break the cycle of misuse which leads to the many other problems associated with drugs. That is why we have committed an extra &#163;10 million for treatment services and &#163;21 million for rehabilitation over the next three years.</p>

  <p>The dangers of long-term addiction to benzodiazepines are well recognised and information about the prescribing of these medicines is available to GPs from a number of sources. Importantly, the British National Formulary (BNF), issued free to doctors and pharmacists, provides key information for health professionals on how to use medicines safely and effectively. In addition, in 1988, the Committee on Safety of Medicines issued guidelines to doctors on the use of benzodiazepines. These guidelines remain extant.</p>

  <p>General practitioners take responsibility for their own learning needs as part of the process of lifelong learning and maintenance of clinical skills. The Scottish Executive supports this through payment of an annual Post Graduate Education Allowance to GPs. In addition we would expect all GPs to keep up-to-date with current practice and clinical guidelines in all relevant clinical areas as part of their continuing professional development.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of people with an addiction to valium or other benzodiazepines who have committed suicide in each of the three years is not held centrally. However, the number of suicides where a benzodiazepine was recorded as being present at the time of death is as follows:</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7" width="245">
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="TOP" height="4">

                  </p></td>
<td width="50%" valign="TOP" height="4">

                  </p></td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>These figures, it should be noted, include deaths where it is undetermined whether the injury was purposely or accidentally inflicted. This is normal practice when collecting information on suicides. Also, in many instances other drugs were recorded, for example, methadone and heroin.</p>

  <p>Of the above deaths the following numbers were known to be dependent drug misusers, though the drug of abuse may not have been a benzodiazepine:</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-13043 on 5 February 2001, which sets out the distribution arrangements for the new &#163;100 million drugs money. Details of the distribution to local authorities, along with accountability mechanisms, are set out in a package of information and guidance which was issued to all Drug Action Teams shortly following the distribution announcement. This information is available from the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and on the Drug Misuse in Scotland website.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what criteria will be used to determine the distribution of the latest additional funding package of &#163;100 million allocated to tackling the problem of drugs across Scotland, and what weighting will be given to (a) deprivation factors, (b) population and (c) the number of drug-related deaths.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-13043 on 5 February 2001, which contains detailed information on the distribution of the additional &#163;100 million drugs expenditure package. Distribution arrangements detailing the weighting given to deprivation and population factors where appropriate, are set out in the resource information and guidance pack issued to Drug Action Teams which is available from the Parliament Reference Centre and the Drug Misuse in Scotland website.</p>

  <p>It was not practicable to give special weighting to the number of drug-related deaths in the national distribution arrangements. It is anticipated, however, that the wide-ranging package of measures announced will impact significantly on the drug misuse problem, and help achieve the Executive&#8217;s published target of reducing the number of drug-related deaths by at least 25% by 2005.</p>

  <p>The question of whether or not it would be legitimate for local authorities to hold meetings at which some members would be present in person and others would participate by video conference is of course ultimately for the courts. However, in the Executive&#8217;s view the relevant statutory provisions, in Schedule 7 to the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, are drafted in terms which indicate that a meeting will be held in one place. That would appear to preclude the holding of a meeting in two places, albeit linked by video conference.</p>

The recommendations of the Renewing Local Democracy Group are currently being considered by a Ministerial Working Group.

  <p>Health boards and NHS Trusts are responsible for the training and continuing development of their staff, other than those aspects managed centrally by bodies such as the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education. It is for boards and Trusts to budget so that sufficient priority is given to providing resources for this vital activity. They will have been assisted in this by my announcement on 21 September last year of a 6.5% increase in health board funding.</p>

  <p>The policy framework for learning in NHSScotland is provided by <i>Learning Together</i>, the Education, Training and Lifelong Learning Strategy, and through guidance on Clinical Governance. In addition, the Scottish Executive Health Department is providing &#163;6 million of central funding over three years to support the development of good practice in learning and the use of learning resources. <i>Our National Health: A</i> <i>plan for action, a plan for change</i> introduces a new Staff Governance Standard and makes the commitment of NHS bodies to implementing <i>Learning Together</i> a core element of their performance against that standard.</p>

  <p>None. Current guidance on the completion of waiting list returns makes it clear that if an NHS patient declines an appointment for treatment at any private facility, then they should remain on the NHS Trust&#8217;s in-patient/day case waiting list until they are admitted to hospital for treatment.</p>

  <p>The data available centrally does not allow a robust comparison of the staffing levels per bed in each health board. Given the variation in health needs and health care in each area, it is in any case doubtful that such ratios would provide meaningful comparisons.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of the study commissioned by Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Orkney Islands Council, and the Port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, to examine the feasibility of creating an offshore container hub port in Orkney, and awaits with interest the results of the further studies which need to be carried out to take forward the proposal.</p>

  <p>We have already achieved our target of a free, quality part-time pre-school education place for every four-year-old whose parents want it.</p>

  <p>By the end of the school year we expect participation to rise to approximately 80% of eligible three-year-olds and to complete full provision by April 2002.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-6842 by Sarah Boyack on 30 May 2000, in relation to how many of the road traffic accidents which took place on the A71 in each of the last five years were winter weather conditions reported as an attributable factor, broken down by local authority area and specifying in each case the number of fatalities and serious injuries.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>Accidents for which winter weather conditions were reported as an attributable factor are not identified as such in the STATS 19 returns. The returns do, however, include information about the weather and the road surface condition at the time of the accident. The table below gives the number of injury road accidents which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on the A71, for which the weather was described as &quot;snowing&quot; or the road surface condition was described as &quot;snow&quot; or &quot;frost/ice&quot;, together with the numbers of associated fatalities and serious casualties. The information is broken down by local authority area.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given below are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authorities would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>

  <p>Injury road accidents occurring on the A71, for which the weather was described as &quot;snowing&quot; or the road surface condition was described as &quot;snow&quot; or &quot;frost/ice&quot;, and the associated numbers of fatalities and seriously-injured casualties, as reported in the &quot;STATS 19&quot; statistical returns.</p>

  <p>The tenderer&#8217;s quoted rates were multiplied by the base quantities for the relevant items derived by the Scottish Executive. The sum of these products was then totalled with the tenderer&#8217;s lump sums to give each tenderer&#8217;s &quot;comparative cost of tender&quot;. A series of pre-determined sensitivity tests were undertaken within a prescribed range. Weightings were applied to the total emerging from each sensitivity test &#8211; the &quot;adjusted comparative cost of tender&quot; &#8211; and the &quot;comparative cost of tender&quot; and these weighted values added to give the &quot;overall comparative cost of tender&quot;.</p>

  <p>The assessment procedure was described in the Instructions for Tendering for each competition. A specimen copy of the Instructions for Tendering is available in the Parliaments Reference Centre. The &quot;overall comparative cost of tenders&quot; for each bid in each competition was published in my response to question S1W-12726. Further information is commercially sensitive and the Scottish Executive has no plans for publication.</p>

  <p>Prior to parliamentary approval of the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Act 2000, ministers undertook, before commencing the repeal of S.2A of the Local Government Act 1986, to publish the new materials on sex education. I am pleased to be able to announce that the following materials have been published today:</p>

  <p><i>A Guide for Parents and Carers</i>;</p>

  <p><i>Guidance for Schools and Local Authorities on Effective Consultation with Parents and Carers</i>;</p>

  <p><i>A Summary of National Advice on Sex Education,</i> and</p>

  <p><i>A Circular to Directors of Education: Standard&#8217;s in Scotland&#8217;s Schools etc Act 2000 &#8211; Conduct of Sex Education in Scottish Schools</i>.</p>

  <p>I am grateful to LTScotland for taking forward this process on our behalf. They have consulted widely about these documents. In the light of the consultation responses, the documents have been improved and amended and the Guide for Parents and Carers has been rewritten.</p>

  <p>The process has been overseen by a Reference Group chaired by Mike McCabe who chaired the original Working Group on Sex Education. Some other members of the working group were also represented on the Reference Group. The Reference Group has endorsed all of the materials published today. I am sure that they will be a welcome additional resource to teachers and schools as they develop their policies in these important areas.</p>

  <p>The publication of these materials fulfils the commitments that Scottish Executive ministers gave last year. Copies of the documents are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. The Commencement Order to commence the relevant provisions in the Ethical Standards in Public Life Etc (Scotland) Act 2000 takes effect on 29 March.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s statistics on the proportion of people living in income poverty do not exclude people living north of the Caledonian Canal.</p>

  <p>The statistics are based on data collected by the Department of Social Security&#8217;s Family Resources Survey (FRS). In common with some other household surveys, the Scottish Islands and the area to the north of the Caledonian Canal were excluded from the FRS sample due to the costs of carrying out fieldwork in these areas. Although they were not included in the sample, it was assumed that their income levels were similar to the rest of Scotland, and the overall estimates for Scotland represent the whole household population.</p>

  <p>To improve the quality of the Scottish data, the Scottish Executive has provided funding for DSS to extend the coverage of the survey to the Scottish Islands and the area north of the Caledonian Canal. This change will take effect from April 2001 and the first results on the new basis will cover the financial year 2001-02.</p>

  <p>Most government surveys are based on private households, as it is expensive and in some cases impractical to collect data on people living outwith private households. There are also additional difficulties in applying the definition of income poverty to those living in institutions; one of the main assumptions behind the poverty analysis is that household income is a proxy indicator of standard of living and this assumption does not transfer to people living in institutions.</p>

Guidance on road signing, including signs for cycleways, is given in the <i>Traffic Signs Manual</i> , which is published by the Stationery Office. There is no legislation or associated guidance for signs on cycleways which do not form part of the public road network, such as forest cycle trails.</p>

  <p>Guidance on road signing, including signs for cycleways, is given in the Traffic Signs Manual, which is published by the Stationery Office. Its purpose is to provide traffic authorities with the codes to be followed in the use, siting and illumination of road signs. Decisions on placing signs and the numbers of signs required in any given situation are for the relevant traffic authority.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to ensure that no Council for Voluntary Service (CVS) will receive less funding under the new funding arrangements announced by the Minister for Communities on 4 October 2000, in particular in areas where for geographical reasons there is more than one CVS in a local authority area.</p>

  <p>Executive funding for the national network of Councils for Voluntary Service (CVS) will increase by &#163;1.2 million in 2001-02, in addition to an extra &#163;0.21 million this year. The increased funding recognises the strategic potential of the network in supporting the voluntary sector and communities.</p>

  <p>The Executive has funded seven new CVS in 2000-01, and from 2001-02 will give a minimum of &#163;60,000 to every local authority area in Scotland, including for the first time six urban areas. No individual CVS will have its Executive grant reduced. Local authority areas where there are more than one CVS will receive at least an extra &#163;30,000, and in Highland an extra &#163;60,000. Total Executive funding for CVS in the Highlands and Islands will be &#163;678,000 in 2001-02 out of a scheme total of &#163;2.6 million.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive accepted the recommendations of the Advisory Group on Youth Crime on 9 June 2000. Immediate funding of &#163;3.5 million was announced for distribution to local authorities in order to develop and support programmes which will challenge and change the behaviour of young offenders. A further &#163;20 million is being made available over the next three years.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have established Youth Crime Teams and carried out audits of local services and needs. They are now drawing up local strategies to tackle youth crime and are expected to submit preliminary reports in March.</p>

  <p>The study into the legal implications of a review of the age of criminal responsibility is currently with the Scottish Law Commission. The feasibility study into a pilot scheme to extend the scope of the children&#8217;s hearings system to 16- and 17-year-old offenders is due to report by April. We will consult shortly on a National Strategy on youth crime. This will build on the principles set out in the Youth Crime Review and take into account the representations made during the post-publication consultation exercise.</p>
