  <p>The Executive is committed to supporting and enhancing the rural economy, and agriculture is an important and integral part of that strategy. We are resolved to develop an approach to the agriculture sector in Scotland which results in its long-term sustainability and we are taking forward a range of measures designed to help.</p>

  <p>We have already provided substantial support to farmers, including &pound;40 million paid to livestock farmers and &pound;33 million in compensation for the relative weakness of the euro. For the longer term, we are promoting strategies to help the development of the sheep, milk and food sectors, and are consulting on proposals for a Rural Development Plan which will help to create a more sustainable future for the agriculture industry.</p>

  <p>to review existing curriculum guidelines, advice and support information bearing on sex education;</p>

  <p>to consider whether these existing materials and the existing arrangements for ongoing review are sufficient to meet the legitimate concerns of the public, parents and teachers;</p>

  <p>to report to the Scottish Executive with recommendations for any revisions or additions to these existing materials and arrangements;</p>

  <p>to commission with the Scottish Executive any agreed revisions and/or the development of any agreed new materials, which are to be completed before repeal of section 2A is brought into force."</p>

  <p>The membership of the Working Group is as follows:</p>

  <p>Mr Mike McCabe (Chairman), Director of Education, South Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>Mr John O'Keane, Head teacher of Cardinal Newman High School, North</p>

  <p>Cancer is one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Workforce planning is an integral part of the planning cycle for the NHS in Scotland. Specialist medical staffing is monitored annually, as are the numbers of nurses required to ensure continuity of care for patients.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cancer Group has commissioned work to model cancer incidence over the next 10 to 20 years which will inform future service and workforce planning for the range of clinical specialities involved in the treatment and care of people with cancer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE) are currently in the process of undertaking their annual review of the Specialist Registrar (SpR) establishment. This review determines the numbers of higher specialist training places available for each specialty, which in turn determines the number of doctors who will be qualified to fill consultant vacancies in the future.</p>

  <p>In both the specialties mentioned, it is expected that there will be a significant increase in the SpR establishment this year. These doctors undertake a five to six year period of specialist training to gain a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) after which they are eligible to apply for consultant posts. During this higher specialist training period SpRs carry out clinical duties across the range of the relevant speciality.</p>

  <p>Other grades of hospital medical staff apart from consultants and SpRs also provide specialist care and treatment for cancer patients. Health boards have the responsibility to decide how many consultants and non-consultant career grade doctors they appoint in their area, depending on the health needs of the local population.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to the promotion of breastfeeding throughout Scotland. We support and fund the Scottish Breastfeeding Group and the National Breastfeeding Advisor to help achieve the target of 50% of women breastfeeding their babies at six weeks by 2005. The Health Education Board for Scotland, funded by the Scottish Executive, also plays a vital role in encouraging women to breastfeed and promoting a positive public attitude towards breastfeeding. HEBS&#8217; work includes a wide range of publications and promotion of Breastfeeding Awareness Week.</p>

  <p>This work at a national level to help increase breastfeeding across Scotland is being taken up at a local level. For example, the Greater Glasgow Health Board has launched its local Breastfeeding Strategy in May last year, Glasgow maternity hospitals are implementing good practice through the UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative, and there are a number of community-based initiatives in Glasgow encouraging breastfeeding within their local area.</p>

  <p>Greater Glasgow Health Board was allocated 23.2% of NHS spend in Scotland in 1989-90, 19.3% in 1994-95 and 18.4% of the estimated expenditure in 1999-2000. These allocations have been based on the Scottish Health Authorities Revenue Equalisation (SHARE) formula which determined each health board&#8217;s need for resources on the size and nature of its population. The reduction in the percentages allocated to Greater Glasgow Health Board reflects Glasgow&#8217;s reducing population. Future allocations will be based on a new formula stemming from the Arbuthnott Committee&#8217;s review of resource allocations which will, in particular, take into account the needs of deprived and rural areas. The proposed new method of resource allocation would result in Greater Glasgow Health Board receiving an increase in the proportion of NHS resources it receives.</p>

  <p>It is for housing associations to evaluate the full implications for themselves of seeking recognition from the Inland Revenue that their association should enjoy charitable status. Charitable status could affect their tax liability, but they would also need to ensure that their activities were in line with the agreed charitable purposes. With regard to existing charity law, the Scottish Executive announced to Parliament on 3 November 1999 that an independent commission would be established to review and reform charity law in Scotland. Ministers are currently considering the chair, membership, remit and timetable of the commission and a further announcement will be made to the Parliament in due course.</p>

  <p>The Post Office, post and regulation of postal services are reserved matters. I understand from the Post Office that the number of post offices in Scotland as at end March 1999 was 2,026 and that around 7,000 people are either directly or indirectly dependent on the operation of the post office network in Scotland. In addition, there are a number of people within the Post Office Group who have responsibilities which are partly related to the operation of the post office network and those who are employed in the retail businesses associated with post offices.</p>

  <p>The automation of the post office network, which is due for completion by the spring of 2001, will enable post offices to enhance and expand the facilities they offer. The UK Government has also given an assurance that benefit recipients who wish to access their benefits in cash at post offices will continue to be able to do so before and after the move to automated credit transfer. No estimates of job numbers for the years 2003-06 are available.</p>

  <p>The construction industry uses an increasing quantity of Scottish timber each year. Half the houses built in Scotland are timber framed, and nearly all the timber panels for these houses are made from Scottish timber. About 11% of the timber used in the UK construction industry is grown in the UK; about half of this is grown in Scotland, with substantial amounts being sold south of the Border. The volume of timber available from Scottish forests is set to double in the next fifteen years, providing further significant supplies for the construction industry <strong>.</strong></p>

  <p>It is envisaged that the Parliamentary Bureau, not the Corporate Body, will consider whether invitations should be extended to non-MSPs to address the Parliament, and, if so, to seek the Parliament&#8217;s agreement on the basis of a motion from the Parliamentary Bureau. The Bureau&#8217;s interest reflects the impact that such invitations would have on the organisation of business of the Parliament and the business programme. Should the Parliament agree that such invitations should be extended, these would issue from my office on behalf of the Parliament. At a recent meeting of the Parliamentary Bureau, it was agreed that invitations to distinguished guests to address the Parliament should be made sparingly and to figures of exceptional standing.</p>

  <p>Members continue to be informed via the Business Bulletin of the arrangements of invitations to address the Parliament. To date, invitations have been restricted to leading Time for Reflection at meetings of Parliament, schedules for which are published regularly. As an alternative to invitations formally to address the Parliament, non-MSPs may be invited to address a meeting of MSPs outwith normal business times. The Parliament is also able to honour distinguished guests in other ways including acknowledging them in the gallery.</p>
