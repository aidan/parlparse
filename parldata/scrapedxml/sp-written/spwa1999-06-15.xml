  <p>With effect from 1 <sup> </sup> July, the maximum grant will be increased from &pound;315 to &pound;500. We have no present plans for any further increase. In contrast to the previous more limited scheme, the new Warm Deal will provide a more extensive package of works, comprising cavity wall insulation or loft and tank insulation, together with hot tank and pipe insulation, draught-proofing, 4 energy efficient lightbulbs and energy advice.</p>

  <p>There are no such plans. To introduce a higher grant for those who are unemployed would reduce the amount available for pensioners and other vulnerable householders who are not in the labour market.</p>

  <p>I understand that the water authorities have been consulting industrial dischargers, including the fish processing industry, about the effects of implementing the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. Much of the fish processing industry is in the area covered by the North of Scotland Water Authority, which has provided individual firms with estimates of the charge increases they will face over the next three years, if they take no action to reduce the amount and strength of the effluent they produce. I understand that the fish processing industry, with assistance from the North of Scotland Water Authority, local authorities, Grampian Enterprise Company and the Seafish Industry Authority, has commissioned consultants to report by August on ways to reduce these charges.</p>

  <p>I intend to meet all three water authorities as soon as possible to discuss a number of matters of mutual interest. I am aware of the particular issues facing the fish processing industry as a consequence of the need to comply with the statutory requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. These will form part of my discussions with the water authorities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends after 1 July to request Scotland&rsquo;s water authorities to refrain from signing any contracts in connection with relevant measures relating to the implementation of the European Urban Waste Water Directive (91/271/EEC) until a full review has been undertaken of the impact on Scotland&rsquo;s fish processing industry and its findings considered.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-06-15.S1W-18.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0615.htm#16">

  <p>To introduce a delay in signing these contracts would almost certainly lead to the water authorities failing to meet the statutory requirements imposed by the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. Clearly the water authorities must continue to plan to comply with their statutory obligations. Failure to do so would leave the UK open to infraction proceedings by the European Commission; any subsequent fines would fall to be met by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>This issue is particularly relevant to the North of Scotland Water Authority. I am aware that the Authority is working in partnership with the fish processing industry to find ways to minimise the cost implications arising from compliance with the Directive.</p>

  <p>Tayside Health Board is currently conducting a review of acute services in Tayside which is due to be completed later this year. The services provided at Stracathro hospital are part of that review. The intention is to establish an equitable network of acute services which meets the needs of people across Tayside. The involvement of clinicians and the public is part of the review process. In addition, proposed changes to the configuration of services as a result of the review will be subject to formal public consultation before decisions are taken.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive expects Health Boards to apply the principles of the national Acute Services Review report when planning services for people in rural areas by balancing local access with the provision and maintenance of viable services of appropriate quality.<br /> <br /></p>
