  <p>NHS boards, as with other private landowners, are not able to issue parking fines on their property.</p>

  <p>However, there are civil remedies which are open to NHS boards to control the use of their land, including car parks. Accordingly, in a number of NHS boards, where conditions of car park use are breached, an unauthorised parking notice will be issued and any follow up action pursued as a civil matter.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of unauthorised parking notices issued or collected is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-33970 by John Swinney on 9 June 2010, whether it will list the contracts that it has entered into that do not make specific reference to contractors complying with the national minimum wage.</p>

  <p>There is currently no central list of contracts and the conditions they contain that would enable us to provide this information. However, framework agreements awarded by the Central Government Centre of Procurement Expertise, which is part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Procurement Directorate, usually include a clause requiring that contractors comply with legislation, including the national minimum wage and, where appropriate, TUPE. These frameworks can be used by the core Scottish Government, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies.</p>

  <p>Contractors to the Scottish Government are usually required to demonstrate that they comply with their legal obligations, including obligations relating to employment law and that they are suitable to be awarded a contract. Subject to compliance with relevant legal obligations, a contactor&rsquo;s relationship with its staff is a matter for the contractor not the purchaser. Imposing a requirement for the payment of a minimum level of wage in the context of any particular procurement process may amount to a restriction of freedom to provide services and could therefore be in breach of EU law.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intelligence and Co-ordination Unit (SICU) has now been established and will become the recognised single point for the co-ordination and sharing of intelligence and information on serious organised crime groups across Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition to the work of the SICU, individual police forces across Scotland are working closely with individual local authorities to assist them in ensuring that they are minimising their risk of exposure to organised crime groups when seeking potential contractors.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government itself is firmly committed to ensuring that public contracts are awarded to legitimate businesses and has made it a condition of contract that those providing private security services directly or indirectly to it achieve Approved Contractor Status from the Security Industry Authority. The authority is the body responsible for regulating the private security industry across the UK, and must be satisfied that a company and its directors meet its fit and proper organisation/person tests before conferring Approved Contractor Status on a company. We have also communicated this across the wider public sector in Scotland with a view to encouraging other public bodies to adopt this policy.</p>

  <p>The Serious Organised Crime and Procurement Sub Group provides regular progress updates to both the Cabinet Secretary for Justice and to the Serious Organised Crime Taskforce.</p>

  <p>Initial collaborative work has been undertaken between the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency and the Scottish Procurement Directorate to assist with the identification of those sectors of public procurement which are most vulnerable to exploitation by Serious Organised Crime Groups. This initial work still requires further development and the findings from this work will be reported once they are available.</p>

  <p>In addition to this ongoing work, the SOC Taskforce &quot;Information and Research Plan&quot; includes work to develop our longer term understanding of how to better assess the vulnerability of business sectors to infiltration by Serious Organised Crime Groups drawing on methods and evidence from other jurisdictions.</p>

  <p>The Serious Organised Crime and Procurement Sub-group is leading the work to limit access to public sector contracts from organised crime groups.</p>

  <p>In addition to this work, there are a number of other initiatives being taken forward under the &quot;Deter&quot; strand of the Serious Organised Crime Strategy to help businesses and local authorities to protect themselves from becoming victims of serious organised crime through enhanced collaboration and information exchange.</p>

  <p>These initiatives include a range of presentations being delivered by the SCDEA Interventions team to COSLA, local authorities and business organisations aimed at increasing awareness and reducing the threat to legitimate business from serious organised crime. Strathclyde Police are also in the process of signing a number of information sharing agreements with the local authorities within their force area to improve information flow around organised crime groups and their ability to target the public sector.</p>

  <p>The Serious Organised Crime Taskforce will keep these issues under review, to ensure that we are continually improving our ability to increase awareness across Scotland and prevent public sector contracts being awarded to organised crime groups.</p>

  <p>Information on waste arisings is detailed in the <em>Scottish Government Environmental Performance: Annual Report 2008-09</em> , published on 21 May 2010. Copies of the report are available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 50874).</p>

  <p>Figures in respect of food waste are not held as it is not currently possible to disaggregate volumes of food waste that are included within the general waste stream. We will be holding discussions with our new waste management contractor shortly to see what improvements can be made to the waste data that we receive. Additionally a six month pilot project will shortly begin at Victoria Quay to assess the feasibility of removing food and other suitable wastes from the general waste stream for composting. If successful the initiative will enable a reduction in our waste arisings being sent to landfill in line with the Zero Waste Plan.</p>
