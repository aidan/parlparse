  <p>Taxol and Taxotere are available on the NHS in Scotland and the use of these drugs depends on the clinical judgment of the specialists concerned, informed by any advice issued by their local Drug and Therapeutic Committees.</p>

  <p>The Commission has recently published interim measures on the adventitious presence of genetically modified seed in non-genetically-modified seed. I have arranged for copies of the Commission measures to be available in SPICe.</p>

  <p>The key elements of the interim measures are:</p>

  <p>testing will apply to seeds of beet, maize, rapeseed, soya bean, cotton and tomatoes for processing, where GM presence is suspected. Member states are free to test other species;</p>

  <p>a zero threshold will apply to GM material which is <u>not</u> covered by an EU authorisation under Part C of Directive 90/220/EEC;</p>

  <p>a 0.5% threshold will apply to GM material which <u>is</u> covered by an EU authorisation under Part C of Directive 90/220/EEC;</p>

  <p>the measures apply to seeds which have been produced in the Community and to seeds from third world countries.</p>

  <p>These measures will operate until the Commission&#8217;s legislative proposals to amend the various seeds marketing directives are promulgated. This is likely to take some time as the matter is a complex one involving the need to establish an appropriate methodology and testing arrangements. It is also necessary to take account of the implications for exporting countries and of the need to have a regime that is capable of enforcement. We have an assurance from Commissioner Byrne that he will act without undue delay and as soon as the Commission&#8217;s legislative proposals are available we shall put these out for public consultation.</p>

  <p>The penalties arising from claims made under the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) are set down in the EC Regulations. As I indicated following my statement on 4 October, outlining the EU Subsidies Appeals Procedure, I have been pressing the issue of proportionality of penalties at UK level. Officials are currently in discussion with other EU member states who share the UK&#8217;s concerns. It is expected that these discussions will result in the French presidency preparing a paper on the simplification of the Common Agricultural Policy, to include our own and the presidency&#8217;s ideas on proportionality of penalties for consideration by the European Commission.</p>

  <p>To 1 September 2000, 52 cases of group C <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> had been confirmed by sero-typing by the Scottish Meningococcal &amp; Pneumococcal Reference Laboratory (SMPRL). This compared to 49 and 71 such cases between 1 January and 1 September in 1998 and 1999 respectively.</p>

  <p>The quality of samples does not allow a confirmed serogroup to be obtained for all isolates and in such cases SMPRL make projections based on the established proportions of typed cases to estimate the total numbers of cases attributable to each serogroup. Using such projections, the estimated numbers of Group C cases between 1 January and 1 September in 1998,1999 and 2000 are 122, 120 and 95 respectively.</p>

  <p>I have already announced my intention to develop a sexual health strategy for Scotland, which will have as one goal the improved sexual health of young people in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Presently, work is under way on a number of fronts to promote good sexual health, particularly among young people. Progress is being made on the demonstration project <i>Healthy Respect </i>which will be led by a team from Lothian Health. This project will receive &pound;3 million over a three-year period to develop best practice in the promotion of sexual health, in particular, the avoidance of sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV infection and chlamydia. The project will enable us to identify and promote good practice throughout Scotland. It is expected the project will be launched in November.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also providing funding of &pound;150,000 to set up four new Brook Advisory Centres in Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Falkirk. These new centres will provide a range of advice and support on sexual health, specifically to young people. Encouraging teenagers to think seriously about the consequences and responsibilities of sexual relationships also forms an important part of the HEBS&#8217; award-winning &quot;Think About It&quot; mass media campaign.</p>

  <p>The report of the HIV Health Promotion Strategy Review Group will be published in October. The report will stimulate the re-invigoration of prevention efforts at local level.</p>

  <p>I recently announced plans for the use of the &pound;26 million Health Improvement Fund and sexual health is one of the areas I have commended to boards for the use of these funds.</p>
