  <p>The Scottish Executive was not involved in any discussions between Caledonian MacBrayne and the Isle of Arran Ferry Committee on the subject of peak fares. However, officials were subsequently informed of these discussions and the ferry committee&#8217;s view that peak fares should be removed from the Ardrossan&#8211;Brodick route with a compensating increase in other fares. Officials then asked Caledonian MacBrayne to review possible future options related to peak fares on the Ardrossan&#8211;Brodick route and the other routes where peak fares apply. The results of this exercise will be considered once these options are received. Ministers expect to be consulted by Caledonian MacBrayne on strategic issues such as the fares structure.</p>

  <p>Our Fisheries Research Services (FRS) Marine Laboratory have been working on the spatial distribution of haddock, nephrops and other species since the start of the year.</p>

  <p>This work was presented at an expert group convened by the European Commission from 28 April to 7 May 2003. Based on the approach used by FRS, the group collated data on the international catch and catch distribution of various stocks. They also used this information to identify potential regulated areas which would reduce associated cod catches by varying degrees.</p>

  <p>This information was also subsequently considered by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) at the May meeting of its Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management (ACFM). This followed a special request from the EU Commission.</p>

  <p>Further progress was made by the Commission&#8217;s Scientific Technical and Economic Committee on Fisheries (STECF), which convened on 21-24 October. The group considered spatial aspects of mixed fisheries in the North Sea, with particular regard to the possibilities for identifying areas which might allow fishing on the healthier stocks (e.g. haddock and nephrops) while still offering some protection to recovery plan stocks (such as cod and plaice).</p>

  <p>Officials continue to discuss these issues with the Commission.</p>

  <p>Research has also continued on the selectivity of fishing gear. This has included technical research into various methods designed to encourage the escape of cod from nets (for example, horizontal panels, rising ropes and, in some cases, separator grids).</p>

  <p>The multi-agency Child Health Support Group Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) Development Group met with the Child Health Commissioners in August to discuss the support needed for implementation of the recommendations of the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) report on child and adolescent mental health.

  <p>Under the terms of the new UK GMS contract, by 31 December 2004 the vast majority of GP practices will be able to apply to have the responsibility for providing out of hours services transferred to the NHS Board. Local NHS boards will have in place alternative arrangements which will need to meet mandatory accredited standards.</p>

  <p>Planning for this new out of hours arrangement is underway. A national working group to look at the issues around out of hours across Scotland in both a rural and urban setting has been set up as part of the implementation process. Membership of the group has been drawn from a range of staff from across the service. The group will, over the coming months, be looking at a range of possible alternative models and arrangements for providing out of hours which will be available to all NHS boards. The remit is to support local NHS systems to identify alternative schemes and promote models of best practice covering a range of populations from urban through to remote and rural.</p>

  <p>There will be an unprecedented increase in funding for the new contract of 33% over three years. Practices who do opt to transfer their responsibility to NHS boards will surrender 6% of their global sum (average &#163;6,000 per GP) to reflect the reduced workload and responsibility. These funds will be available to boards to meet the costs of providing the service in another way. In addition the OOH Development Fund will be increased from the existing level of &#163;6.3 million to &#163;10 million in 2005-06 to help deliver the new arrangements.</p>

  <p>Policing in Fife is provided almost entirely by Fife Constabulary although officers from a number of other forces or agencies, such as the British Transport Police, also operate within the Fife area. Each year, the Executive sets a level of Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) for each police force in Scotland. It is then a matter for the police authority (or joint police board) for the area to set a budget for that year. The Executive pays police grant to the value of 51% of that budget up to the level of GAE. Over and above these amounts, the Executive also pays 100% police grant to forces for specific purposes. For Fife Constabulary, these currently include, for example, the costs of policing Rosyth ferry port, funding for financial analysts and funding for analysis of drug driving samples.

  <p>Local authorities are responsible in statute for implementing supervision requirements. I intend to meet shortly with local authority Chief Executives to discuss the Audit Scotland report, what needs to change to improve service delivery, and how best to accelerate progress in these key areas.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering the need for interim guidance to be issued to groupings/unitary authorities to draw their attention to this recommendation. The guidance will be informed by the programme of Inspections of criminal justice social work by the Social Work Services Inspectorate, which has now commenced.</p>

  <p>The Audit Scotland recommendation will also be taken account of in the planned revision of national standards, on which preliminary work has already begun.</p>

  <p>Time Intervals has been in place since 1999. The Executive has been consulting all agencies, including the police, over the summer on a new way to re-focus the process of monitoring and improving performance.</p>

  <p>We recognise the need to strengthen specialist mental health input for children and young people in residential settings and young offender institutions, and officials are considering with NHSScotland how this can be achieved more effectively. NHSScotland mental health input to residential schools, secure units and Young Offenders&#8217; Institutions is currently restricted by workforce shortages across Scotland within child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). A National Mental Health Workforce Group has recently been established and CAMHS is a recognised priority for attention.</p>

  <p>Mental health input to residential settings is also being considered in the context of the recommendations of the Scottish needs assessment programme review of child and adolescent mental health, which reported in March 2003. The report highlights the need for the development of a multi-agency approach to child and adolescent mental health alongside specialist services. The child health support group has established a child and adolescent mental health development group to support implementation of the report.</p>
