  <p>Codes of practice are required under section 11 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000, containing guidance on the exercise of functions under the Act. Draft codes, including a code for persons authorised to carry out medical treatment or research under Part 5 of the Act, are currently being prepared.</p>

  <p>Final versions of the codes will be laid before Parliament at least three months before they are required for implementation of the legislation. Implementation of the legislation starts in April 2001. We hope to bring Part 5 into force by summer 2001.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the Minister for Transport and the Environment&#8217;s letter to me dated 13 April 2000, on what research or other evidence the statement that &quot;the quarrying industry is imposing costs on the rest of society, that are not presently reflected in the price of its product&quot; is based and what opportunities the industry has been given to address these costs.</p>

  <p>Research carried out by London Economics on <i>The Environmental Costs and Benefits of the Supply of Aggregates &#8211; Phase 2</i> , was published in July 1999. This confirmed that there are significant environmental costs associated with quarrying which are not covered by existing regulation. The industry was given numerous opportunities to develop proposals of its own which would address these costs as well as, or better than, a tax. A package of proposed voluntary measures, which was to be applied throughout the UK, was submitted by the Quarry Products Association, the industry&#8217;s main representative body.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the implementation of the Groundwater Regulations 1998 as they apply to the agricultural industry differs in Scotland from England and Wales, with particular reference to disposal of spent sheep dip and washings from chemical sprayers.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-05-16.S1W-6445.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0516.htm#6445">

  <p>Implementation of the Groundwater Regulations 1998 is a matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in Scotland and for the Environment Agency (EA) in England and Wales. Anyone wishing to dispose of any substance listed in the schedule to the regulations is required to have an authorisation to do so. This would include spent sheep dip and washings from certain chemical sprays.</p>

  <p>There have been some differences in approaches to implementation between SEPA and the EA. SEPA introduced a number of measures to help farmers and crofters and waived the annual maintenance charge in the first year. The EA has dropped the annual subsistence charge for the next four years, however SEPA need to levy such a charge in order to meet the requirement on them to recover the costs of regulation.</p>

A number of representations were made to The Scotland Office during the consultation period following the 10 April announcement of revised map proposals. Copies of such representations are available on a public file held by The Scotland Office. The Secretary of State will place a copy of the public file in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre for members&#8217; convenience.

  <p>I will refer, in answering this question, to the fact that it has also been raised in relation to the areas of Nairn (S1W-6456), Moray (S1W-6457) and Badenoch and Strathspey (S1W-6458) which, along with Inverness, are contained within the Inverness NUTS 3 area.</p>

  <p>The Assisted Area map is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>The July 1999 Assisted Areas map proposals put forward the Highlands and Islands NUTS 2 area as a whole, for inclusion on the basis of its population sparsity. However, I understand that the European Commission would not accept this, on the basis the Inverness NUTS 3 area does not on its own meet the sparsity criterion.</p>

  <p>As stated in my answer to Mr Brian Monteith of 2 May (S1W-6146), it is standard practice for structural engineers involved in major construction projects to consider any effect on surrounding areas. The structural engineers for the Holyrood Project are monitoring areas within a radius of 1 kilometre of the site and the recorded evidence shows that no ground movement is being detected. Third party collateral damage is covered by insurance held by the Design Team, the Construction Manager and individual &quot;trade package&quot; contractors. The Project Team will shortly produce a report on this subject for the City of Edinburgh Council. A copy of this and related documents will be placed in the Parliament Information Centre.</p>
