  <p>Service industry apprenticeships have not been abolished for people aged over 20. Employers are still able to use the modern apprenticeship frameworks to train their staff if they so choose. Not all apprenticeships can or should be funded by taxpayers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has refocused public sector contributions for adult modern apprenticeships to construction and engineering related sectors where investment delivers economic results. Skills Development Scotland have been tasked to develop and deliver improvements in Scotland&rsquo;s skills performance for the benefit of individuals and employers, ensuring that our skills interventions continue to meet the needs of the economy, individuals and employers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to cost a notional programme of activity given the complexity of modern apprenticeship funding. In any case, specific funding of the modern apprenticeship programme is an operational matter for Skills Development Scotland.</p>

  <p>On 26 September 2008, Scotland hosted the 11th British Irish Council Summit. We had a very successful meeting attended by ministers from all the member administrations. The focus of the summit included useful discussions on energy, demography and the global economic situation.</p>

  <p>As with previous summits, the meeting received progress reports and agreed a plan for future work on the other subjects currently being taken forward by council members. These are drugs; environment; minority and lesser-used languages; transport, and social inclusion.</p>

  <p>The council agree to the establishment of a new work stream on Early Years and recognised the valuable work that had been achieved by the work streams on tourism, the knowledge economy, and eHealth and agreed that these three subjects could now be concluded.</p>

  <p>I am placing a copy of the communiqu&eacute; that was issued by the British Irish Council after the meeting in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 46719).</p>

  <p>The Youth Football Action Plan implementation steering group, which includes the Scottish Football Association, sportscotland, the Scottish Government, affiliated national football bodies and a representative from local authorities, meet regularly to discuss the progress and direction of the action plan, which was launched in 2004 to increase participation levels in Scottish football. Player pathways, including the encouragement of young people to take up the game, is a core consideration of the group.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Football Association, which leads the implementation of the action plan under guidance from partner members of the group, has instigated a series of projects that encourage school pupils to become involved in football. The SFA McDonalds Primary School Football Programme, which focuses on taking coaching into primary schools and creating new boys and girls teams within all participating schools, is a prime example. The Bank of Scotland Soccer One is another programme aimed at increasing participation. The scheme will make regular coaching and competitive matches available to all first year pupils, both girls and boys, across participating secondary schools in Scotland. Details of these and all Youth Football Action Plan projects can be obtained directly from the Scottish Football Association.</p>

  <p>The action plan is being delivered with a total investment of &pound;31.1 million, which includes contributions from the Scottish Government, lottery funding, the Scottish Football Association and local authorities.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government is investing over &pound;2.5 million in the Scottish Football Association through our Cashback for Communities programme. This investment aims to offer school aged children opportunities to take part in football through community and school based activities rather than being involved in antisocial activities.</p>

  <p>Scottish Funding Council main grants to Scotland&rsquo;s colleges are not ring-fenced, therefore colleges are free to allocate funds according to their own priorities. Core grant allocations to Glasgow colleges in 2008-09 are shown in the following table. For most colleges in Glasgow, ESOL is a priority area of provision.</p>

  <p>In addition, I announced in February 2008, additional ESOL funding of &pound;3 million per annum, for the period 2008-11, for colleges and community learning and development partnerships across Scotland in support of the Adult ESOL Strategy for Scotland. The college element of this is routed via the Scottish Funding Council, which allocated additional funding to Glasgow colleges as shown in the following table:</p>

  <p>Local authorities address homelessness through a wide range of approaches which will often extend beyond specifically housing issues. As such, there will be a number of indicators which local authorities would see as contributing to addressing and tackling homelessness.

  <p>Scottish Government officials are in regular touch with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) on issues which may impact on civil nuclear contingency planning arrangements. HSE produce regular summaries of site inspections for the local liaison committees on which Scottish Government officials are represented.</p>

  <p>HSE reviewed the fire arrangements for Hunterston in May 2007 as part of their normal inspection arrangements. Officials were aware that the review was taking place, that HSE considered that issues arising did not have any immediate impacts on nuclear safety and that HSE considered that operations could continue without affecting nuclear safety. They were not specifically informed at the time of the details of the review of fire arrangements. They are currently discussing with HSE mechanisms for ensuring transparency on such issues where this is required.</p>

  <p>The arrangements for contracting with GPs to deliver the HPV immunisation programme are being taken forward through local negotiations at NHS board level. On 16 July 2008, the Scottish Government circulated a model locally enhanced service for boards to use in local negotiations.
