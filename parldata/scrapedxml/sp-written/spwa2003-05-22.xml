  <p>The monitoring of Sandside Beach is a matter for the independent regulator, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).</p>

  <p>SEPA receives advice from the Dounreay Particles Advisory Group (DPAG), which has recently published its Second Interim Report reviewing studies on particles in the marine environment in the vicinity of Dounreay, including Sandside Bay. It makes recommendations for further work, which SEPA and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) are now taking forward. Further reviews are planned.</p>

  <p>The monitoring of Sandside beach is a matter for the independent regulator, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA). Based on the activity of the particle finds to date, SEPA does not consider that it is necessary to restrict public access to Sandside Beach. However, the situation is reviewed with each new find.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive regularly reviews its level of funding of the Scottish Agricultural College for the various publicly funded services it provides. On its education programme, the college&#8217;s student numbers have fallen significantly in recent years and the Executive has therefore reduced its funding accordingly. The college&#8217;s current level of education funding per student is substantially higher than that of other education institutions. The future level of funding of the college will be kept under review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body is required, on a quarterly basis, to provide information to the Parliament&#8217;s Finance Committee on the progress of the project in respect of inflation and materialisation of risk in order to inform the committee&#8217;s consideration of the annual Budget Bill. Once a new Finance Committee has been established, a report on progress and cost of the project will be made to the members of that committee. I would anticipate that reports will thereafter be made on a quarterly basis, in line with previous practice.</p>

  <p>Following completion of construction, scheduled for November 2003, and before the building can be occupied, testing and commissioning of all the building&#8217;s essential systems will require to be completed.

  <p>The Holyrood Progress Group was established by a resolution of the Parliament with a remit to oversee completion of construction of the new building. It is therefore expected that the Holyrood Progress Group will continue to provide advice to the Clerk and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body in the management of the project until it is complete.</p>
