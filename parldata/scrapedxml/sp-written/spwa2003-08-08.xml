  <p>As detailed in <em>Modernising Medical Careers</em> , the response of the four UK Health Ministers to the consultation on <em>Unfinished Business - Proposals for Reform of the Senior House Officer Grade</em> , we will support and encourage the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board for the United Kingdom (PMETB) to work with the medical royal colleges to develop competency-based training and assessment. We would expect this work to include consideration of the role of examinations and other assessment methods in determining levels of competence for doctors in training.</p>

  <p>Within the Scottish Enterprise area the business gateway provides a single brand for businesses allowing easier access to a consistent range of services geared towards potential business start-ups and growing businesses. There are standard/core programmes available through all outlets providing focussed and high quality support to customers. This could include, for example, an e-commerce grant to all new start companies which offers a 50% grant to a maximum of &#163;500 as a contribution towards the costs of computer equipment etc.</p>

  <p>In the Highlands and Islands enterprise area, the local enterprise companies (LECs) act as a single access point to information and advice on the range of services available to new and growing businesses.</p>

  <p>Additional services may also be available at local level on a discretionary basis. Much will depend on the specific business needs. The support programmes are not automatic and will be dependent on the specific support criteria and whether the project is commercially viable. Decisions on the provision of support for individual projects are entirely a matter for the enterprise networks.</p>

  <p>As outlined in the partnership agreement, steps are in hand to further improve support measures through the introduction of a new business start up fund.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-856 by Ross Finnie on 14 July 2003, whether it will clarify the statement that the creation of a European fund to aid fishing communities &quot;would not increase public expenditure in Scotland because of the UK&#39;s public spending arrangements&quot; and whether this statement would apply solely to this compensation fund or to all EU funding programmes.</p>

</ques>

  <p>Most public expenditure in the UK is managed within fixed departmental expenditure limit (DEL) plans, within which fisheries and other requirements are prioritised. Under these arrangements, the Executive would not gain any direct benefit from the availability of additional EU funding in this case. Any further fisheries support measures would need to be funded through re-prioritising existing expenditure commitments.</p>

  <p>These arrangements apply to directly funded EU spending - mainly under financial instrument for fisheries guidance and other EU structural fund programmes. Different arrangements operate in respect of spending on annual common agricultural policy market support subsidies and EU rural development measures where domestic expenditure cover for EU funding is classed as annually managed expenditure and provided by the UK Treasury, outside the block and formula arrangements.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much it is spending on flood prevention issues; what its future spending proposals are, and what this money is being, or will be, spent on.</p>

  <p>Provision of publicly funded flood defences is a matter for local authorities. Arising from the 2002 spending review, the Executive increased the capital allocation available to local authorities for flood prevention and coast protection programmes to a total of &#163;40 million for the period 2003-04 to 2005-06. The amount of this committed so far for flood defences is the &#163;10.9 million announced recently for the Kilmarnock and Rothesay flood prevention schemes. This is on top of the ongoing commitment of &#163;1.9 million, for the completion of river Kelvin and Largs flood prevention schemes and the river Clyde catchment study.</p>

  <p>Distribution of the remaining resources is linked to local authorities submitting requests for funding for schemes that have been prepared and have completed the necessary statutory processes.</p>

  <p>In addition, the 2002 spending review increased the total provision for other flood risk management initiatives up to &#163;10 million. To date, this provision has been used:- to continue funding for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#39;s floodline flood warning service; to fund the provision of digital ground level data to improve flood risk estimation; and to fund other flood risk-related measures in support of the Executive&#39;s flooding framework.</p>

  <p>Also, more generally, within the Executive&#39;s annual provisions to support local authorities&#39; revenue expenditure, over &#163;3 million is included to fund their duty to maintain watercourses, where this will reduce the likelihood of flooding of non-agricultural areas.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-651 by Allan Wilson on 18 June 2003, why the level of grant available for short rotation coppice under the Scottish forestry grants scheme is reduced in respect of land set aside as part of the arable area payment scheme.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-08-08.S2W-1215.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0808.htm#4">

  <p>The level of grant available for short rotation coppice under the Scottish forestry grants scheme is reduced from &#163;600 to &#163;400 per hectare in respect of land set aside under a separate scheme, the arable area payment scheme (AAPS).</p>

  <p>This is because under the AAPS, establishment grants may be paid for the production of short rotation coppice. The current levels are &#163;205.80 per hectare for less favoured areas and &#163;223.97 for non less favoured areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department funds the provision of education at the Scottish Agricultural College by a block grant-in-aid. Funds are not allocated specifically for widening access to further and higher education but the college is expected to respond to the Scottish Executive&#39;s policies and priorities for further and higher education within the grant-in-aid figure.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any of the funds allocated to the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) are allocated in recognition of its needs as a smaller college on three campuses.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department funds the provision of education at the Scottish Agricultural College by grant-in-aid. Funds are not allocated specifically to recognise the size of the college or the distribution of its campuses. However the funding of education at SAC, expressed in terms of funding per student, is currently significantly higher than at other education institutions.</p>

  <p>The college does not receive specific funding from the Executive for the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>

  <p>It is for the college to prioritise its expenditure requirements and allocate the funding that it receives from the Executive and other funders accordingly.</p>
