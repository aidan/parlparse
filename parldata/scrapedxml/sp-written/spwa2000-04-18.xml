  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the projected spend and throughput levels will be for Skillseekers, Training for Work and the New Deal in each of the next three financial years, commencing April 2000.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-04-18.S1W-5964.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80205" speakername="Henry McLeish" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0418.htm#5964">

  <p>Skillseekers and Training for Work are both delivered by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Each year Grant-in-Aid targets are agreed with the respective Enterprise bodies. These include volume-based targets, which are outlined in the reply below, and other targets which are designed to measure the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Skillseekers and Training for Work. As these targets are agreed annually with Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, they can only be supplied for the current year, 2000-01. Expenditure figures for both programmes have been supplied for 2000-01 and 2002-02 but not for 2002-03, as these will be considered as part of the Spending Review.</p>

  <p>The youth training budget is &pound;87.6 million in 2000-01 and &pound;89.6 million in 2001-02. This includes an additional &pound;3 million in 2000-01 and &pound;5 million in 2001-02 for Modern Apprenticeships. In 2000-01, Scottish Enterprise have been set a target of 24,000 first-time entrants to Skillseekers, which includes 8,000 Modern Apprenticeships. They have also been set a target of 36,000 Skillseekers in training, including 15,000 Modern Apprenticeships. Highlands and Islands Enterprise have been set a target of 1,175 first-time entrants to Skillseekers, including 400 Modern Apprenticeships, and a target of 2,555 Skillseekers in training including 1,310 Modern Apprenticeships.</p>

  <p>The budget allocation for Training for Work from the Comprehensive Spending Review is &pound;48 million for the three years from 1999-2000 to 2001-02. For 2000-01 the number of new starts to the programme have been agreed as 14,000 for the Scottish Enterprise LEC network and 750 for Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</p>

  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government which takes the lead on funding and delivery of the New Deal. In Scotland, it does this in partnership with the Scottish Executive and contributing Scottish organisations, as indicated in the answer to question S1W-5969 also answered today.</p>

  <p>The information requested on expenditure and throughputs for all New Deals in Scotland for the next three financial years is not currently available. However, details of the allocation for 2000-01 should be available in May &#8211; as will planning assumptions for 2001-02 and 2002-03 based on latest volume information.</p>

  <p>The total expenditure to date (end-February) on all the New Deals in Scotland amounts to approximately &pound;65.5 million. This figure understates the total cost accrued due to time lags in billing and reimbursement.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are central running and marketing costs for each programme, which have not been included in the above figure.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, fuel poverty is being tackled through the Healthy Homes Initiative including the Warm Deal. The Executive&#8217;s policies complement those of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaries of State for Social Security, Education and Employment and Trade and Industry, all of whom are helping the fuel poor through their policies on taxation, Benefit levels, employment and training and the terms governing the supply of domestic energy respectively.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to acting with caution based on sound scientific advice. Consent to plant GM crops for farm scale evaluations is only granted after stringent laboratory testing and the planting of small, controlled experimental sites have demonstrated that they are safe to human and animal health, and do not pose any direct environmental risk.</p>

  <p>The farm scale evaluations are a three-year UK-wide research programme, designed to provide robust information on any environmental consequences of growing GM crops on an agricultural scale when compared with similar non-GM crops. The programme of farm scale evaluations is the precautionary principle in practice. No GM crops will be grown commercially in this country in advance of passing all the regulatory controls and not until the farm scale research programme is completed and independently evaluated.</p>

  <p>Employment Policy is reserved to the UK Government, which therefore takes the lead on the funding and delivery of the New Deal throughout Great Britain, although in close consultation with its partners, including the Scottish Executive. Many partner organisations at local level also provide New Deal services under contract or provide funds and other resources including training funds to enhance the quality of New Deal in their areas. The public and voluntary sector organisations that contribute to the New Deal in this way fall within the remit of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The number of young people in Scotland who had secured sustained jobs through the programme to the end of January 2000 was 15,600 and the number of companies that had signed New Deal employer agreements was 10,600. This represents 7% of businesses registered for VAT and/or PAYE in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Information about the number of companies that have taken on New Deal recruits is not available.</p>

  <p>By the end of January 2000, 4,120 had joined the employer option: of the 2,410 who had left the employer option, 870 had moved into unsubsidised employment either as a result of being retained by their employers or by moving to a job with another employer. This includes people who left the New Deal from the Employment Option, and people who moved from it into Follow-through and then subsequently left the New Deal.</p>

  <p>The expenditure on each New Deal programme in Scotland to February 2000 was:</p>

  <p>a) New Deal for Lone Parents: &pound;4 million</p>

  <p>b) New Deal for Disabled People pilot: &pound;0.6 million</p>

  <p>c) New Deal for Partners of Unemployed People: &pound;0.4 million</p>

  <p>d) New Deal 25 plus: &pound;12.5 million</p>

  <p>e) New Deal 50 plus pathfinder: &pound;0.1 million</p>

  <p>These figures understate the total costs accrued due to time lags in billing and reimbursement. In addition, there are central running and marketing costs for each programme which have not been included in these figures.</p>

  <p>The number of people in Scotland who have taken part in each New Deal at end of January 2000 are:</p>

  <p>a) New Deal for Lone Parents: 11,180</p>

  <p>b) New Deal for Disabled People: 947</p>

  <p>c) New Deal for Partners of Unemployed People: 262</p>

  <p>d) New Deal for 25+: 22,200</p>

  <p>e) New Deal 50 Plus: New Deal 50 Plus will be available nationally from 3<sup> </sup>April 2000. This represents a major new &pound;270 million programme for people on benefits over 50 looking for work. It is too early for national participation figures to be available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Election Commission was set up in January 1999 by the five main political parties in Scotland to monitor their joint agreement in relation to the expenditure of, and donations to, political parties at the first elections to the Scottish Parliament on 6 May 1999. The Commission was a voluntary, non-statutory body which reported to the parties. The Commission produced its final report in June 1999 and, given that it was set up for the specific purpose of monitoring expenditure at the first elections to the Parliament, no longer has any remit.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why, following the advertising campaign to attract more people into the teaching profession, the Scottish Universities&#8217; faculties of education have offered no more places on PGCE courses than last year.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-04-18.S1W-5990.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80223" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0418.htm#5990">

  <p>The objective of the advertising campaign was to create interest in teaching as a career with an aim of widening the target audience and encouraging not only those choosing their first career but also suitable candidates who might consider teaching as a second career.</p>

  <p>The setting of intake levels to courses of initial teacher education is the responsibility of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC). In setting intakes, SHEFC take account of the Department's projections of the minimum requirements for newly qualified teachers, based on pupil numbers, teacher numbers and estimates for future flows in and out of the profession, and guidance offered on other relevant factors affecting the demand for teachers.</p>

  <p>The most recent annual report of the Scottish Transport Group, of which the Scottish Bus Group is a wholly owned subsidiary, showed the value of the surplus at 31 March 1999 to be approximately &pound;120 million (net of tax). <br /></p>
