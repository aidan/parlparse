  <p>New Outer House business has stayed fairly constant over the last few years. It is the responsibility of the Lord President to allocate judicial resources in the Court of Session and this takes account of the level of business in the Outer House.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-18633 today. In the further representations which the Lord President made to ministers last year, he took account of the impact of the new legislation when requesting an increase in the complement of judges.</p>

  <p>The loss of a judge or judges to public duties elsewhere in the UK or abroad is one of the factors which the Lord President will take into account in planning the supreme court programme. In the case of lengthy absences, additional resources may be provided; recent examples of this being the trial of the Lockerbie bombing suspects and the Ladbroke Grove Rail Disaster Inquiry. The absence of the judges concerned led directly to an increase in the complement from 27 to 32.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided &#163;8 million over three years for smoking cessation and health education and prevention activities. This supports a range of initiatives including cessation services. Since April 2001 a full range of NRT products has been available on prescription. Smoking cessation was identified as a priority for investment from the &#163;26 million Health Improvement Fund, and NHS Boards and Health Education Board Scotland (HEBS) have targeted resources in order to increase smoking cessation and prevention activities. HEBS are currently working on a smoking cessation resource pack for health professionals and development of health education and smoking cessation services for school-age children.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Voluntary Charter on Smoking in Public Places, which aims to promote good practice and extend consumer choice to have non-smoking areas in public places such as pubs and restaurants, was introduced in May 2000. Key players from the Scottish licensed and hospitality industry have signed up to the charter, and some thirteen hundred businesses have adopted the charter in its first year.</p>

  <p>I refer Ms MacDonald to my answer to question S1W-18866 today and confirm that, according to the convener of the Holyrood Progress Group, there is no record of any individuals within the project management raising any concerns about the appointment of Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd.</p>

  <p>The key senior personnel employed on site by Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd, a British company, were either Scottish or English. To the best of the Holyrood Project Team&#8217;s knowledge, no personnel were recruited from overseas to work on site, but this is solely a matter for the contractor concerned.</p>

  <p>This information is not yet available as much of the timber to be used within works packages for the project has still to be procured. To date, some 40m <sup>3</sup> of high quality, Scottish oak has been procured directly by the Parliament for use on the project but, under EC public procurement rules, materials cannot be specified as &quot;Scottish&quot; within the trade package documentation. Scottish suppliers are, of course, free to bid to supply any materials specified within Trade Packages.</p>

  <p>Payments from trade contractors, appointed by the SPCB, to their sub-contractors are normally a matter for the contractors concerned but, where difficulties arise, one of our principal concerns is to protect the sub-contractor and supply of materials. However, I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that no payment has yet been made to Kemnay Quarries. The failure of Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd to make payments in this respect was among the deciding factors in the decision to issue a notice of termination of contract on 26 September 2001.</p>
