  <p>Crime and the fear of crime reduce the quality of life for many older people although they are less likely to be victims. We have established partnerships led by local authorities and the police to tackle crime and community safety at local level and we encourage older people and their representatives to be part of that process. Glasgow City Council launched its Community Safety Strategy in January 1999 and its Community Safety Action Plan in April 2000.</p>

  <p>In May, the Deputy First Minister announced that he was providing Scotland&#8217;s police forces with an extra &pound;8.9 million to enable them to recruit more than 300 extra police officers. Strathclyde Police will receive &pound;3.7 million equivalent to 148 police officers. This and our ongoing commitment to the funding of CCTV and other community safety projects will contribute significantly to making our communities safer for everyone including older people.</p>

  <p>People suffering from anorexia nervosa are currently treated and supported through mainstream mental health and social work services. While some specialist psychiatric services are available, there are at present no dedicated facilities for anorexia nervosa either in Grampian or in Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>The <i>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> encourages service development to be made on the basis of alliances involving NHS services, social work, voluntary organisations, sufferers and carers. An effective alliance exists at national level in the Scottish Eating Disorders Interest Group. Service developments under discussion include the creation of a managed carer network for eating disorders, a fundamental part of which would be provision of an inpatient facility for the care and treatment of these disorders.</p>

  <p>The volume and rate at which Ministers receive correspondence continues to increase. In the first nine months since devolution, the number of letters for ministerial reply increased by over 50% compared with the same pre-devolution period. Comparing the last quarter measured, January to end-March 2000 with the same period in 1999 shows an 82% increase.</p>

  <p>The importance of tact and sensitivity in handling all rape victims, including victims of date rape, has long been recognised by the Scottish Executive and the police. Guidance on this was first issued by the Scottish Office to Chief Constables in 1976, and more extensive guidance was issued in 1985. The Scottish Police College has also developed training programmes to help the police meet the needs of such victims and forces have their own procedures.</p>

  <p>I am arranging for a copy of the 1985 guidance to be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Information Centre.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it will take to ensure that drugs used in &quot;drug rape&quot;, including Rohypnol and Gamma-hydroxybutate, are only available to those with legitimate prescriptions and whether it will commission further research into the use of these drugs in cases of &quot;drug rapes&quot;.</p>

  <p>Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) is a licensed medicine and is included in Schedule 4 to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985, thus making possession of the drug without authority an offence. Rohypnol is not prescribable on the NHS and may only be prescribed by doctors on a private prescription.</p>

  <p>Gamma-hydroxybutyrate is not a licensed medicine in the UK. It can only be sold or supplied by a doctor or dispensed by a pharmacist in response to a doctor&#8217;s prescription for a patient whose special needs require this particular product. The Medicines Control Agency investigates any reports of the unlicensed manufacture, promotion and sale of Gamma-hydroxybutyrate in the UK.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer <a name="QuestionText">when a fully searchable database of Scottish parliamentary questions, with the same functionality as is currently available for Westminster parliamentary questions, will be available to MSPs and their staff.</a></p>

  <p>MSPs and their staff can already access a fully searchable database of Scottish parliamentary questions via staff in SPICe. This is currently the House of Commons Library&#8217;s POLIS database, on to which SPICe staff are indexing Scottish Parliament proceedings. Unfortunately staffing and technical difficulties have caused a backlog in this work, which is being addressed.</p>

  <p>The connection service from Westminster is insufficiently robust to make direct access to POLIS more widely available. However, this month we are launching an improved search facility on the Scottish Parliament website, which will enable information such as Scottish parliamentary questions to be retrieved more readily by users outside SPICe.</p>

  <p>Work is also in progress on a strategy for data resources for the Scottish Parliament as a whole, and Phase 1 of this development will include Scottish parliamentary questions. We anticipate that a pilot system will be available for testing by the end of this year.</p>
