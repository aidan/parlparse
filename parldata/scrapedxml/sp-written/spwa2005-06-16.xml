  <p>The Scottish Executive is not aware of any such approach having been made. Were any proposal to be made we would of course wish to consider our position, in conjunction with other parts of the UK.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is of course committed to ensuring that a penalty regime for the Single Farm Payment is proportionate and fair and to learning from experience elsewhere in the implementation of farm subsidies.</p>

  <p>Of the total 27 year-round routes supported since the inception of the Executive&rsquo;s Route Development Fund (RDF), seven have subsequently ceased.</p>

  <p>The RDF is structured to ensure that investment is only provided when the airline has carried passengers to and from Scotland. Payments are made in arrears on the production of invoices by the airports. This enables the risk to the public sector investment element to be mitigated. The level of investment in the routes that no longer operate was a total of &pound;95,423.</p>

  <p>Over the last 15 years, the average increase in air passengers in the Highlands and Islands was 0.7% per annum compared to 8.5% per annum for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The principal reasons for the difference are the commencement of air services by no-frills carriers at Scotland&rsquo;s main airports and the decline in oil related traffic at airports in the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>The EU countries which use Public Service Obligations (PSOs) under EC Regulation 2408/92 to support air service networks, including routes in and to peripheral communities, are:</p>

  <p>France<br /> Germany<br /> Greece<br /> Ireland<br /> Italy<br /> Portugal<br /> Spain<br /> Sweden<br /> United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have definitive up-to-date information on the number of PSOs imposed on air routes in these countries. The 2002 HITRANS&rsquo; commissioned report <em>Public Service Obligations in Europe: a comparative study</em> compared the extent to which PSOs are applied across different European Union/European Economic Area member states and features of the way PSOs are applied in each country.</p>

  <p>The 16 PSOs which have been imposed on lifeline air routes in the Highlands and Islands are as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>three by the Scottish Executive to Campbeltown, Tiree and Barra from Glasgow;</p>
<p>six by Orkney Islands Council to Westray, Papa Westray, North Ronaldsay, Eday, Stronsay and Sanday from Kirkwall;</p>
<p>five by Shetland Islands Council to Foula, Papa Stour, Out Skerries, Fair Isle and Unst (not operated) from Tingwall/Sumburgh, and</p>

  <p>The Partnership Agreement committed the Scottish Executive to fully evaluate the HITRANS&rsquo; proposals for a Highlands and Islands air network. Further work, commissioned by HITRANS, developed its proposals and this has been similarly evaluated.

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not collect statistics of cycle use in each year for each local authority area.</p>

  <p>Some statistics about cycle use by local authority area are available from the Scottish Household Survey (SHS). This is designed to provide estimates for most local authority areas for two-year periods, including (a) the percentage of households with one or more bicycles which can be used by adults; (b) the percentage of adults who made a trip of more than a quarter of a mile by bicycle for certain purposes on one or more of the previous seven days; (c) the percentage who usually cycle to work; (d) the percentage who usually cycle to school, and (e) the percentage of journeys reported by adults which were made by bicycle.</p>

  <p>Such statistics for each local authority area appear in the Scottish Executive's Transport Statistics bulletins of SHS results, which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, such as: <em>Transport across Scotland in 2001 and 2002: some SHS results for parts of Scotland</em> (Bib. number 30990) and <em>SHS Travel Diary results for 2002</em> (Bib. number 32737).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold a central register of all forthcoming projects that will be subject to competitive tendering processes, and therefore could only provide a comprehensive list at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>However, some of the Scottish Executive projects which are outstanding (in the sense that the competitive process has started but a contract has not yet been awarded) include:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>System Integration - a contract for the future development, systems integration and network support of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s local and wide area networked computer system.</p>
<p>Hardware Maintenance - a hardware maintenance contract for ICT assets of the Scottish Executive.</p>
<p>Anti&ndash;Virus Software &ndash; corporate anti-virus software protection for Scottish Executive desktop and laptop computers.</p>
<p>Flexi-Time Management solution &ndash; a contract to provide a flexi-time management solution to be deployed across the Scottish Executive, replacing the current manual system.</p>
<p>Feasibility study for a Scottish Private Landlord Register (FITSS2).</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>In addition, we are aware of two projects that are planned to go out to tender later in the year:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>the re-let of the telephone switch hardware maintenance contract.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Information and Communication Technology Consultancy (FITSS4) - covers advice on technology futures; general technical advice on IT systems, applications and networks including quality assurance; reviews and audits of network design and performance; IT security consultancy and audit, and telecommunications consultancy.</p>

  <p>Many of the Executives ICT requirements are met through existing ICT framework contracts, which are advertised regularly in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
